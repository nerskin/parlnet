"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,—I would like to ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) to clarify what constitutes a breach under the activity test.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I think I gave you an answer to this question on Thursday. Did I not provide you with an answer to that? I remember I had a discussion with Senator Neal about the penalty rates for breaches that we did by negotiation in early 1997. The activity test breaches include where a person who is required to satisfy an activity test fails to do so or fails to satisfy any requirements relating to youth allowance activity agreements that apply to the person under subdivision (e) of division 1; where the person has refused or failed without reasonable excuse to accept a suitable offer of employment; where the person refuses or fails without reasonable excuse to provide information in relation to the person's income from remunerative work when required to do so; where the person knowingly or recklessly provides false or misleading information in relation to their income when required to do so. It goes on from there. There is nothing extraordinary about them. They are not what you might be driving at, which I would call administrative breaches.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—Minister, you mentioned `failed to satisfy any requirements', and that was fairly early in the list. There were some more deliberate points on the list later on, but failing to satisfy any of the requirements could be a technical breach. I know it says the third breach, but notification of a breach might not actually reach the person. How would a person know, for instance, that they had breached once or twice? For instance, if they breached once and they had been notified but their address was not accurate, could it not be possible that they could breach more than once and not know that they had breached?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Senator, I do not think you could have been in the chamber when this was all discussed very thoroughly.
—I was in the chamber.
—Not just last Thursday but also when we were changing the requirements for breaches a year or more ago. You will recall that under the previous government people were breached by losing their payment immediately regardless. We have changed that. We negotiated that with the parties in the Senate last year to a rate reduction for a number of weeks for the first penalty, a bigger rate reduction for the second penalty and only on the third breach do people lose all payment altogether. Have you forgotten that?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I think it was established during those debates, however, that some of those breaches could have still been technical breaches. Even though a person lost their benefit, there may still be something which was out of the person's control. What I am specifically asking about is whether there is any discretion involved here. If there was no discretion involved in the previous applications of the term penalties or breaches, how can you say that a person will not be treated unfairly? Is there any discretion involved in the definition of breaches? Can a person judge—even if there are three breaches— 
 whether or not a person has been treated fairly?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I think Senator Margetts, in talking about technical breaches, is referring to administrative breaches which are regarded as a lesser order, like not returning a form on time, for example. There is no discretion, as I understand it, as to whether something is determined to be an administrative breach, which gets a lesser penalty, and an activity test breach, which has the penalties that I just spelled out to you. It is very important to understand that there are two kinds of breaches: one is less serious and the other group is more serious.
The officers do not have an opportunity to distinguish between those two. If it is an administrative breach, one lot of rules apply. If it is an activity test breach, another lot of rules apply. Within that area people who are not satisfied with the decision of the determining officer have the right to ask for a review, which is done by an authorised review officer, an ARO. If that is still not satisfactory, people can then go to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—The minister is indicating that, without any means of support, a person may be expected to ask for a review. How long would the review take?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Mr Chairman, I think it must be made very clear to Senator Margetts that, as compared with the past, people are not now—with unemployment payments, for example—being left with no means support, unless it is the third time they have broken the law.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I really do not feel that the minister's answer has been satisfactory. If there is no ability for discretion, you will find—and I know the courts in Western Australia who have `three strikes and you are out' legislation find it extremely difficult when an arbitrary number is pulled out of the air with it being said, `Okay, if you've done something three times, you must be punished in a certain way,' and this is punitive—there 
 will always, always be circumstances where, no matter how many times you arbitrarily decide, there will be people for whom no one of those breaches is their fault; that there are reasons why they were unable to avoid those things.
There are reasons sometimes of poverty, there are reasons of family tragedy. There are a whole range of reasons, of circumstances, where pulling out an arbitrary number of three times will be unfair if there are no discretions. And, if there are no discretions, what is the basis upon which a person might appeal?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—There is discretion and in the sorts of circumstances you are talking about—like family tragedy, illness, et cetera—the officers are entitled to use that discretion. Senator, you were part of this chamber that put that measure through last year as a non-controversial piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I am actually referring to the part in this bill in relation to the activity test breach; I asked you a little while ago, `Was it discretionary?' and you said no. That is what I am referring to.
—As between the two kinds of breaches.
—The minister is saying that there is a different sort of breach, but in this instance, the minister is saying that it is not discretionary. I am asking: on what basis, for a non-discretionary clause to be in this bill, would a person be able to appeal?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Mr Chairman, I do not think Senator Margetts listened carefully to the answer. There are activity breaches which are the more serious ones and carry a more serious penalty, and there are administrative breaches which are considered to be less serious and carry a less serious penalty. So it is determined by law which is which.
—You are writing the law.
—However, Senator—if you would listen instead of jumping to 
 conclusions—within each of those two areas of breaches, the departmental officials are able to exercise their discretion. There is also, as I pointed out to you, an extensive review mechanism. I think that the Senate regarded that as fair. You are saying to me that we are talking about this legislation. Yes, we are. But it is mirroring the legislation that the Senate signed on to last year as a piece of non-controversial legislation. So I find it strange that you are revisiting an issue that the Senate has already passed judgment on.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I think Senator Newman may be stepping on very dangerous ground if she starts talking about non-controversial legislation, when I am basically abused nearly every time the Greens have problems with a piece of so-called non-controversial legislation which often we have not had much chance to look at.
So, if at any time we pass something through and are asked sometimes to have about two or three days to look at a piece of legislation, if then you are going to come back and say, `You agreed to it because we passed it through quickly in a lunchtime,' then I would suggest that you do not try to do that; you will not get any more pieces of legislation through at lunchtime. If we do not get a chance to look carefully at legislation, then it is quite reasonable for the Greens to say, `No, we're not going to do them in lunchtimes.' If you are then going to turn around to us and say, `We gave you a lunchtime to look at it,' or `We gave you this amount of time; we pleaded with you because we want it in a non-controversial Thursday,' I think you are stepping on very dangerous ground.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I think Senator Margetts cannot have taken any notice or any interest in the issue when it came before the Senate last time. It came about that that legislation was changed because, in the debate in December 1996, Senator Harradine suggested that he could see that all the parties around the chamber were trying to grasp at a solution which would be fairer than the system we inherited, which 
 took people off payments altogether regardless of their offence. We were agreeable to that. So we did as was suggested by Senator Harradine. We went around to the parties with some proposals, and we negotiated the final outcome of that piece of non-controversial legislation which was passed by the Senate with due process.
Now, suddenly, you are just discovering it. I am sorry about that. But what we have in this legislation is a mirror image of what the Senate thoughtfully decided upon previously.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—If Senator Newman is suggesting that the Greens (WA) agreeing to an improvement on something that was bad means that we still agree with the bad points or unfair points of the legislation, that is not true. If you want to continue on with this kind of nonsense argument, Senator, please do. But please do not assume that, when we vote for an improvement on something that is ghastly, that means we believe that the ghastly thing is okay.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Greens (WA) amendment in relation to the substitution of two weeks instead of eight weeks. Although I take on board the senator's comments about previous legislative changes in relation to the breach period, we do note that when the government first came to power the penalty for the breach of the activity test was two to six weeks for a first breach, and then subsequent breaches attracted a penalty of the period of the first breach plus an additional six weeks. So we prefer the amendment as put forward by the Greens WA.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I do want to make a few comments about this amendment and also about a view expressed by the minister when we were here on Thursday afternoon. There was some discussion when the breaches of the activity test were first put in place. But I thought it was going a little bit far to say that there was an `agreement', as if it were an initiative jointly of the government and the opposition.
It would be more accurate to say that the government proposed penalties for breaches of the activity test we found quite unacceptable. I suppose we were happy that the government was agreeable to negotiating a penalty that was less severe. To some extent we negotiated down the initial penalty. I suppose it can be described as agreement, but probably not to the full extent that might have been drawn from what the minister said. Certainly, the ultimate result was brought about by negotiation between the opposition, the government and other members.
Bearing that in mind, the opposition does not intend to support this amendment. We do see it as obviously a balance between ensuring that the penalties are not so severe that people find their circumstances quite untenable, and ensuring that people accept that they do have a responsibility to comply with the requirements for the payment of their benefits or their benefits will be suspended for a period.
We believed at the time of the negotiation that this was a reasonable balance. Nothing has occurred that has altered our minds on this and accordingly we will not be supporting these changes.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—Can I ask the minister a simple question, and forgive me if it is too simple? My understanding is that under this bill people could void the non-payment period by taking up work under the work for the dole program. Would those people presumably be included in the voluntary work for the dole participants?
—I am advised that for young people who go into the work for the dole scheme, whether it is voluntary or whether it is because they are directed to, if they have a breach penalty outstanding, that is waived.
—I am just assuming that those people, by virtue of volunteering to void the non-payment period, would be included in the voluntary numbers. Presumably, if they volunteer to get involved for whatever reason, including voiding that 
 non-payment period, they would be included in the voluntary work for the dole.
—I am advised that that is that DEETYA classification and we are really not in a position to be able to give you a precise answer. I have given you the best answer that I can at this stage.
—The question is that the request for an amendment be agreed to.
Request not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I move:
(10)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 52 (after line 29), after subsection 550C(1), insert:
(1A)	 A notice under subsection (1) must contain reasons why the activity test non-payment period applies to the person.
This amendment requires the secretary to provide reasons why the person is about to be cut off the youth allowance. The minister mentioned that it is possible for people to appeal and how awfully fair and reasonable it all is. So it is not the least bit unreasonable to suggest that, if a person is about to be cut off their youth allowance, they should be given the reasons why.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—The government will accept Senator Margetts' amendment.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments:
(12)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 65 (lines 25 and 26), omit ""one or more of sections 553A to 553C"", substitute ""either or both of sections 553B and 553C"".
(13)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 66 (line 1) to page 67 (line 4), omit section 553A.
This amendment refers to clause 553A, subsection (2) of the bill on page 66, which states:
If:
(a)	 a person's unemployment was due to other people being, or having been, engaged in industrial act or in a series of industrial actions; and 

(b)	 the people, or some of the people, were members of a trade union that was involved in the industrial action;
the person is subject to an employment-related exclusion unless the person satisfies the Secretary that the person was not a member of the trade union during the person's period of the unemployment.
I find that a fairly discriminatory clause. Basically, it says that, if there has been industrial action which has caused a person to lose their job or to be unemployed, they are going to be punished. Not only have they been disadvantaged from losing their job or because they felt it necessary to take industrial action—so there must be have been some problem to start with—but they are going to be punished for being involved with a union or being a member of a union. There is the word `and' in here. It states:
. . . the people, or some of the people, were members of a trade union that was involved in the industrial action;. . .
The minister will no doubt say that there are other bills to which this applies. We think this stinks, whichever bill you put it in.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—This is mirroring an existing provision which has been presided over by the last Labor government for the last 13 years. The presence of the trade union reference is not new to us. Our legislation is simply replicating the provisions in the newstart allowance legislation, with some minor changes due to the different qualification conditions.
Also it is not believed that it will affect significant numbers of people as most people will return to work after industrial action. The point about the preclusion period which I think is important to understand is that it applies only to industrial action which is in breach of an order, direction or injunction issued by a state industrial authority, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or the Federal Court. So, it is only if the industrial action is in breach of that that this period applies.
Before the six-week preclusion period was introduced difficulties used to arise in determining the exact reasons for a person's unemployment while the issues surrounding 
 the industrial action remained unresolved. Now the preclusion period allows resolution of issues. This is simply a transfer of the provisions in the newstart allowance legislation that we inherited into youth allowance. There is nothing particularly sinister because the words `trade union' are in the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—The minister has not been quite fulsome in her response in as much as things have been changed. Yes, this connection with newstart did exist under the previous government, but the minister has forgotten to remind the chamber that there have been many changes in the industrial relations law since then. There are very few areas which are considered to be legal industrial action any more, and more and more the industrial courts are restricted in enabling people to take industrial action. So things have changed. It is totally inappropriate to continue to put this kind of clause in any bill.
I would like to think the Labor Party will also consider that membership of a union in relation to youth allowance would not be the means by which people are discriminated and singled out, because so many things have changed. We all know how very few issues this government thinks can be acceptable for industrial action. During that debate we had issues like workers' health and safety which was so limited as to make workplaces dangerous. We know that people could not include meal breaks as allowable matters in their awards.
So many things have changed not only as a result of the federal legislation but also as a result of enabling state legislation that have made things even more restrictive. In Western Australia they are talking about fourth and fifth wave industrial legislation to make it harder and harder for people in the workplace to organise and for people to be engaged in anything that might in any way, shape or form be considered a legal strike or industrial action. The minister was not quite accurate when she said that this provision is the same as it has been before because the whole nature of industrial relations has changed since we dealt with this provision previously. I would 
 say that, at the very least, it is now totally inappropriate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—The Democrats will support this amendment because of a number of concerns we have with the clause. I acknowledge the minister's comments in relation to similar provisions—as did Senator Dee Margetts—but I share the same concerns that Senator Margetts has just outlined. While there may be provisions similar to clause 553A that have already been enacted—and I think an example is section 596 of the Social Security Act—I am very concerned, as are my Democrat colleagues, that this sort of provision is inconsistent both with a number of existing laws and with our understanding of internationally recognised labour laws and labour rights.
The clear imputation of proposed section 553A is that if you are unemployed because you are involved in industrial action, then you bear the onus of proof of satisfying the department that you were not a member of the trade union. I am curious as to whether this is your reading too, Senator Margetts, but I believe this is inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act which specifically protects the right to take industrial action in some circumstances. It is arguably inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which says that everyone has the right to freedom of association with others and that that right should not be restricted. I think this provision, along with a number of others, is a particularly sinister provision and it is one we should reject in this bill. Therefore, we will be supporting the amendment before us.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—I have just sought to obtain a copy of the act. Would the minister detail whether or not the current provision that is proposed in clause 553A differs in any way from the provisions currently in the legislation for newstart allowance; and, if so, in what manner does it differ?  ",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I have just been advised that there are some slight word 
 ing differences but that the effect is exactly the same. Perhaps I should also add that with the preclusion period changes to newstart a year ago—we are talking about the comparability of that legislation here—the government agreed to incorporate the Democrat amendments restricting the application of the preclusion period to the above circumstances only. Those circumstances are the ones I read out earlier that were inserted by the Democrats amendments with the acceptance of the government.
Nothing that we are doing here is different in effect from what happens now to newstart allowance. It is most undesirable, as Senator Bartlett has said a few times in this debate, that there be great variation between the way that various payments are administered. If you are going to worry, as I would, about mistakes being made by staff, about uncertainties and confusion as to people's entitlements or as to how they will be treated, then you do not try to vary these basic requirements if you can possibly help it. I cannot think of any justifiable reason why you would have different requirements for the newstart allowance from those for the youth allowance for the same activity.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—The minister is somewhat inconsistent here. She is quite happy to treat young people differently when it comes to saving money for the government and has done so with this particular measure and series of measures. The minister cannot be serious about being consistent, because she is prepared to single out a group of people and say, `No, you can't get unemployment benefits and you can't get case studies if we decide that you are of the wrong age or wrong category.' When it is convenient, the minister is quite capable of singling out a group of people and disadvantaging them.
Minister, is it not young people who are less likely to be able to make agreements or negotiate by themselves? Are we not picking out young people and saying, `We don't want you to be part of a union; this is one of those cases where we are going to disadvantage young people for being part of a union'? I am very keen to find out what the Labor Party's 
 response to this is, considering that they, more than anyone else, should be aware of what kinds of changes have occurred between the time of the legislation that they were involved with and now, considering the change in the industrial climate in Australia.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Essentially, the waiting period requirement was introduced by the then Labor government. This bill seems to take bits and pieces out of the waiting period on a fairly ad hoc basis. It is really not going to assist people who are trying to access the benefits. Obviously, a great deal of uncertainty and confusion about the issue is of no particular assistance.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I find it extraordinary that we are singling out and penalising a group of people for being members of a union. We are talking about subclause 553A(2) of the bill. We are saying that unemployment due to industrial action means that a person has to wait longer to get any benefit. So we are not talking about the normal waiting period. That is why I want to know whether the Labor Party still thinks this is acceptable, considering the changes that have occurred in the industrial climate in Australia that mean there are so few areas considered by this government, under legislation, to be valid industrial action. Basically, this is not the normal waiting period; this is a penalty for people for being members of a union which has taken industrial action.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—As to that view which has been put by Senator Margetts, I would be grateful if the minister would clarify whether the waiting period for unemployed individuals who were involved in industrial action is consistent with that for those who are not working for a genuine reason.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—The consistency is that the existing legislation for 
 newstart allowance has a preclusion period for people who are engaged in unlawful industrial disputes. I read out that, where there has been a breach of an order, direction or injunction issued by a state industrial authority, the Industrial Relations Commission or the Federal Court of Australia, the customer will be subject to an employment related preclusion period for youth allowance for a period of six weeks from the date the industrial action ceases. They are slightly different words, but I am advised that it has exactly the same effect as that for the newstart allowance, which was amended with some amendments from the Democrats to that effect last year.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,—It is a bit difficult to answer because there are all sorts of waiting periods for different purposes depending on people's financial circumstances.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—To put some perspective on this, I remind the Senate that during the industrial relations debate the Greens (WA) pointed out that if, for instance, there was a dangerous situation at a workplace and those people in the workplace, other than the person who is specifically put in the dangerous situation, took industrial action in support of the person who is in that dangerous situation, under this government that would be considered unlawful industrial action.
There is a whole range of what I believe to be unfair circumstances which are now considered to be unlawful industrial actions. They could be trying to save the lives, or the future 
 lives and health, of your fellow workers. The government's industrial relations legislation says that only the person or persons being put in that position of danger can take lawful industrial action. They could be told to move on and put someone else in until someone is found who does not have the courage to stand up for themselves. Basically, we are talking about a whole range of issues which did not exist before—including trying to save the lives of your fellow workers.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Minister, I was not completely clear on the answer you gave before. You said that the waiting period varies depending on the person's financial circumstances—which I accept—but in the case of two people who are in identical financial situations, in terms of their liquid assets and other things, and one person is unemployed because they have been dismissed and another person is unemployed because of what is called unlawful industrial action, is the waiting period different?

Only clause 4 relates to unlawful industrial action. In fact, clauses 1, 2 and 3 relate to any kind of industrial action. If a person loses their job as a result of any kind of industrial action—that is the clause we are talking about, clause 2—then, Minister, you could be misleading the Senate if you are relating only to unlawful industrial action, couldn't you?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

If you are involved in industrial action which is not unlawful you obviously do not get unemployment benefits while you are engaged in industrial action but you go back onto payments as soon as that action ends. If you are engaged in industrial action which is unlawful on the basis of those specific decisions that I referred to earlier from the Industrial Relations Commission, the Federal Court, a state 
 industrial authority, et cetera, then you must wait six weeks. However, if you have any outstanding waiting periods which you are liable for—and maybe you were trying to ask me this, Senator—you serve them concurrently. You wait six weeks if you have been engaged in unlawful industrial action, but you serve that six weeks concurrently with anything else that you might be liable for.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—There is a situation here where a person is unemployed—not a person being on strike, we are talking about a person's unemployment. Those are the words of the bill. It relates to when a person's unemployment—that is, losing their job—is due to other people being, or having been, engaged in industrial action. So we have established now that we are not necessarily talking about illegal industrial action. We are in clause 4, but clauses 1, 2 and 3 are talking about any kind of industrial action.
We are talking about a person who has lost their job as a result, some way or another, of industrial action. In fact, what you are saying, but need to clarify, is that if a person has lost their job for one reason or another as a result of industrial action—lawful or unlawful—they will still be subject to this penalty clause.
—The question is—
—If the minister is going to answer that question, I would prefer it being in Hansard  rather than from the chair.
—It is not a matter of answering the question, Senator Margetts. I only call people who are standing and the minister was not standing. That is why I put the question.

The government's reply, as the minister has not jumped, is that the effect of this amendment would be to render unenforceable a notice to a customer merely because it failed to state that it was a recipient notice or how the customer was to comply with the notice.
The government are admitting in their response that they do not feel that it is necessary to say to the customer—that is, the insect wriggling around on the end of their pin—in this new privatised world that it was a recipient notice. So the person does not necessarily know what it is they have not complied with or how the customer—that is, the unemployed person—needs to comply. So it might be a bit difficult to blame a person for not complying

I am just saying that they say that the effect of this amendment would render unenforceable a notice to a customer merely because it failed to state that it was a recipient notice or how the customer was to comply with the notice.
The translation of that is that they believe it is acceptable to not notify a person that it is a recipient notice, so the person will not know necessarily whether they have had a recipient notice, or they are saying that it is okay to not tell the client—the unemployed person; let us call a spade a spade—how they are required to comply with the notice. They are the government's own words. There is nothing much I can do about the fact that that is the basis upon which the government is not agreeing to our amendments.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
(23)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 98 (lines 16 to 23), omit the penalty and the note, substitute:
	 Penalty:	 30 penalty units.
(25)	 Schedule 1, item 6, page 100 (lines 10 to 17), omit the penalty and the note, substitute:
Penalty:	 30 penalty units.
I believe that Australian Democrat amendments 23 and 25 are the same as the Greens (WA) amendments. The purpose behind these 
 amendments is to remove the penalty that has been designated in the bill of six months imprisonment. We seek to replace the imprisonment as a penalty with a number of penalty units in relation to the refusal or failure to comply with notice.
I have a number of questions for the minister about this section. In particular, I am worried and curious about an understanding I have. Am I correct in my understanding that this particular penalty would apply not only to the young person in receipt of the youth allowance but also to the parent or the guardian if they are being paid the allowance? I will follow up some of those points, but a major concern, in relation to whether or not they notify the department, is that the penalty might apply not only to the young person but also possibly to the parent or the guardian of that young person who is receiving the youth allowance.
I know this has been canvassed many times in social security debates but I am wondering how many young people or people in receipt of benefits—there will always be a minority, presumably—will have some kind of event, whether it is major or minor, occur in their lives. Maybe it is not always the first thing that occurs to them that, yes, they must notify the department within a particular period. Of course it is within their legal rights to make that information known and to notify the department but, if they do not, are they criminals, and should they be subject to some kind of imprisonment? That is the fundamental objection that the Democrats have to this particular part of the bill. By all means, have a penalty—we have, on advice, put forward a penalty of 30 penalty units—but imprisonment? I look forward to hearing the minister's elaboration.
I have noticed while just looking over Senator Margetts's shoulder that there have been some arguments proffered by the government for a number of their objections on amendments. I have not actually seen that—I am not quite sure why. Perhaps that has gone to my office and I have not had an opportunity to read it. I do not really think that designating these young people, or in some cases their parent or guardian, as crimi 
 nals by enforcing up to six months imprisonment upon them is an appropriate punitive action. A penalty unit under the Crimes Act is the equivalent of, I understand, $110. It is probably worth noting that under Corporations Law I believe the penalty is $100, but it would not surprise me that there would be a differentiation in the way we treat people who are on benefits of some kind as opposed to people at the big end of town.
First of all, I ask the minister whether this penalty for failure to comply applies not only to young people in receipt of the allowance but to their guardians and parents as well.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

I keep reminding the minister of this, and that you are already dealing with many people who are struggling to survive. Of course, the deaths in custody reports consistently say that these kinds of penalties are inappropriate for what might in effect be breaches due to poverty. So I go along with the changes.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—It would be appreciated if the minister could clarify that question about failure to comply with notices by parents. It seems to be logical to me that, if under this bill a person's eligibility for this payment is dependent upon their parents' income, at some stage the parents must be required to notify the Department of Social Security about their income. Is there no such requirement? If there is not, how does the department assess that young person's eligibility based on their parents' income?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

 legislation in terms of the imprisonment penalty is the same as for all other social security legislation. There is nothing new or novel or strange about it; and it is rarely, if ever, used. Secondly, the requirement in all these cases of notification, et cetera, is imposed upon the young person and it is they who must satisfy the legislation or bear the penalty.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—That is exactly my concern.

I acknowledge the departmental officers' rationale for not supporting the substitution of penalty units. Does the minister really believe that, if you do not refer to a term of imprisonment and you put `penalty units' instead, `this would make the situation less clear for customers as they would not know what the maximum penalty for an offence was without reference to the Crimes Act or some other secondary source'? Is it not sufficient to explicitly state a penalty that is not in a form of imprisonment? I cannot see how any less clear the penalty or punitive aspect could be if you stated `penalty units'; if you stated what a penalty unit equals—if you made it clear that 30 times, I believe, 110 is a big fat penalty.

Is it really necessary that there is a reference to imprisonment?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

We believe our proposal is clearer to customers and it is consistent with other payments to leave that imprisonment penalty in the legislation. We certainly do not want to have the calculation of different penalties undertaken by 20,000 staff. You can imagine the difficulties that you would get with inconsistency and the concerns that Welfare Rights, for example, might have when people are not being treated consistently. It is very important in this area that there be certainty and consistency of treatment across payments. I think that is what we are doing with this and it is no more 
 onerous than any other provisions in this area in the act.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

If someone is recklessly doing something, that does not, to me, seem to amount to someone intentionally not complying. It would seem to me to include a situation where a person was negligent.

I would also like to seek leave not only to move Democrat amendments 6 and 7 on sheet 857 together but to actually deal with them first. I am happy to take the guidance of the chamber, but I think it makes more sense to deal with amendments 6 and 7 first before moving on to amendments 5 and 13. So I seek leave to move amendments 6 and 7 together, before amendments 5 and 13.

Person aged 18 years or more
(4)	 A person is independent if the person is at least 18 years old.
These amendments relate to how we define independence for students as well as young unemployed people and, in one case, the independent criteria and age for those who are disadvantaged. I understand there are a number of similar amendments. Indeed, the amendments proposed by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens (WA) seek to achieve the same purpose—that is, to define the age of independence for a full-time student at 18, similarly with young unemployed.
We have had a number of speeches in this chamber during the second reading debate on some of these aged base criteria. The Democrats have put on record a number of times that we believe the government's concocted ages of independence are inconsistent, irrational and a sham. That is why we seek not only to get some degree of consistency in terms of the age at which young people and students are considered independent, but also to call on the opposition to commit to their previous record, which was reducing the age at which a student was considered independent from 25 to 22. So I look forward to hearing Senator Neal's comments in relation to the age of independence for a student as well as that for young unemployed.
I do acknowledge some of the debates that took place in this chamber last week, in particular the very compelling arguments from Senator Harradine. I note that he put on record his concern at the pressure that the proposed bill would put on Australian families, that perhaps lower and middle income earners would be hit harder because they would be expected to look after their children not only in an emotional sense but also in a financial sense until these children were young adults—up to 21 in cases to do with young unemployed and up to the age of 25 with respect to students. The Democrats have made clear our objections to that, but it was good to hear Senator Harradine's concern with not only the impact that that would have 
 on families—negative or otherwise—but also the stress and inconsistencies it would have on our taxation system.
On Thursday I learnt that perhaps some changes had been discussed between the government and the Independent senator. I am just wondering, given that I am moving these amendments now, what assurances or deals or otherwise the government has made with Senator Harradine that will alleviate the financial and other impacts of this legislation on families. Perhaps it is not appropriate for me and others to go ahead with our amendments because the changes that were debated last week between the government and Senator Harradine are so good for families and so good for young people that we do not need to alleviate some of the harshest aspects of this legislation.
First of all, I would like the minister to explain: what assurances has the government given Senator Harradine? What changes will be made—specifically, explicitly—to the taxation system to make sure that families do not feel the increased burden of this legislation? Perhaps that might convince us that we do not need to reduce the age of independence. Of course, we would not actually do that. We are dead keen to go ahead with the notion that we recognise in law and tax and otherwise that young people are adults at at least the age of 18 and that this legislation—the Commonwealth youth allowance legislation and other social security legislation—should reflect that fact.
In the same way that it benefits the government under other legislative frameworks—be it to do with child support and maintenance or whether it is to do with the family tax initiative—it suits the government to define young people as adults at 18, or at 16 in the case of the latter, so why not with the common youth allowance? Why is it that there is this huge gap between 18 in some cases and 25 under this legislation? Why is the government going ahead with this ridiculous notion that for a full-time student to meet the independent criteria they have to be 25 years of age?
I am looking forward to the government outlining how this will not impact harshly on 
 families and the specifics of the deal or otherwise that has been done with the Independent senator in this place that is designed, allegedly, to alleviate some of that burden and to change our taxation system. I am looking forward to being enlightened now as to how this legislation and its framework will be changing as a consequence of the government's deal last week.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I have some questions to add to that for the minister to look at at the same time. In addition to what Senator Stott Despoja was saying in relation to the proposed tax changes, how will it help a family which is already disadvantaged and not paying tax if they get a tax advantage, considering they may be paying little or no tax to start with? So, how could you, in a tax system, alleviate the disadvantages that these changes are bringing about?
The Greens (WA) amendment is identical to the one moved by the Democrats under Senator Stott Despoja so we will be supporting this. It reduces the age of independence to 18 for both students and unemployed. This makes sense. It makes sense for young people to be considered as independent while they are developing their independence, not after it. The current definitions of `dependent' and `independent' are confusing to understand. The minister has, just this very morning, spoken on the mantra of consistency. On a number of occasions the minister has said how we confuse social security offices if we are inconsistent. Here is the government's chance. In relation to the age of independence, there is no consistency at all between government departments let alone with the norms of society.
In their submission to the Price Report, the Sydney University Students Representative Council stated clearly the contradictions of the current system. They said:
The government continues to force citizens, who in every other respect (voting, health, insurance, licenses, alcohol etc) are seen as full citizens, to be relegated to the status of ""dependent"" if they happen to choose tertiary education. Our case work overwhelmingly shows that the majority of students are financially self-supporting from age 18 even if they live in the family home. 

Given that a person on attaining the age of 18 is considered to be an independent adult for the purposes of all other laws, it is illogical that students be considered financially dependent on their parents. For instance, you can put them into prisons with adults, can you not, Minister? It is illogical that students be considered financially dependent on their parents. The age of 18 is also the time that people become responsible for their own debts, including HECS debts and the Austudy supplement.
So the government and the ALP are saying that it is okay to create a debt to the government independent of your parents, but not acceptable to receive assistance from the government independent of your parents. This is double standards of the worse kind. We understand that the idea of reducing the age of independence to 18 may be a pretty radical idea to some in the chamber. It is the position of students and welfare groups, those having to deal with the consequences of government policy, not those who sit in their ivory towers and create policy.
But I do make an appeal to the ALP as the potential government to seriously consider supporting the call from young people and the young parties to support this entirely sensible and consistent amendment. Up until 1996 it was the ALP's stated position that the age of independence be set at 21—with many ALP politicians stating in education forums that 18 was the desired figure in the long term. However, the ALP's policy position seems to have been omitted from their amendments. While we strongly argue for the age of independence to be 18, we ask the ALP, at the very least, to stick to their policy in government; that is, for the age of independence to be 21 for now with a view to lowering it to 18 in a progressive fashion.
 We will get to those other amendments later. At that stage I will talk about various past inquiries and studies into the age of independence, with a view to gaining some understanding of contemporary opinion on the matter. So when we get to the next amendment I will go further into that. If members of the ALP are going to stand up in public fora amongst young people who count and who 
 vote from the age of 18, then put your money and your vote where you mouth is and support the Democrats and the Greens (WA) amendment to reduce the age of independence consistently to the age of 18.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—The effect of this amendment is to make the age of independence 18 for both students and unemployed. You might recall that the opposition argued quite strongly last week that those who were unemployed be treated as adults and given the same benefits as other adults even though they are between the ages of 18 and 20. But this amendment goes substantially further than that. It also brings down the age of independence for students to 18. That is a step we cannot take and the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.
There will be some further debate about the exact age of independence for students. There is a foreshadowed amendment relating to the issue of the age of independence on the table. It has been circulated already by Senator Carr. I assume that all parties have a copy of that. You may wish to obtain copies of that if you have not already. I assume that you are all very well aware of it.
There is some difficulty arguing that a person who is not seeking work but has made a decision to opt out of work to take up the advantages of higher education should receive an income from taxpayers. There is some concern in the community that the taxpayers, as well as paying for some substantial part of their education, should be paying them an income from the time they leave school. That is why we are having to weigh it up with demands in other areas like health and education and with demands from people in very dire circumstances. We find it very hard to justify saying that from the age of 18 students who are having the advantage of tertiary education should also be receiving that sort of benefit almost immediately.
As to the exact age of independence for students, during our time in government we were moving to a point where we saw the age of independence for students as being 21 and we were moving gradually over time to reach that point. We still believe that we should be 
 moving over time to that point but have some concerns about adopting that position immediately. Senator Carr will be discussing that issue more when he moves the opposition amendment in that area. It is sufficient to say at this stage that we will not be going as far as this amendment and the opposition will be opposing it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I was presuming that the minister would like to speak next, but I thought I would clarify some of my more general questions earlier. I am just wondering if the minister envisages changes to the family tax initiative as a result of the discussions that took place last week. Will that be changed as part of the attempt to alleviate some of the financial hardship on families? Perhaps that would be one aspect of the assurances or otherwise that were given to Senator Harradine last week. I would like to get a sense of what changes are being envisaged.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—I apologise to the committee for being absent for 20 minutes or so. I understand there has been a question raised in the debate concerning discussions I had had with the government subsequent to a previous occasion that I stood on my feet. I am happy to reiterate what I deliberately asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the last occasion I had a question—I was going to say `without notice', but I will say deliberately that I had a question to direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
That question was deliberately asked of the Leader of the Government as representing the Prime Minister in this place. In effect, the essence of the question was, should not essential income transfers within a family be also recognised within the taxation system, and is it the intention of the government to include in its restructuring of the Australian taxation system a measure to give further recognition to the functions of parents in raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers?
That question was quite deliberately asked on the basis that we had been given quite definite statements by the Minister for Social 
 Security on behalf of the government, and indeed by other ministers in the government, publicly earlier last week that, if there were substantial amendments made by the Senate to this legislation, those amendments would obviously need to go down to the House of Representatives. The government had no intention of supporting those amendments in the House of Representatives. Under those circumstances, they would send the bill back to the Senate and, if we insisted, the bill would in effect go into limbo.
Under those circumstances I think we in the chamber needed to consider those matters, and the question was, when did we need to consider them? You might argue that it could have been a good idea to send the bill back there and give a bit of a chance to deal with the matter. But the problem is that, had we done that, we would have disadvantaged some 27.5 or 28 per cent of current youth allowance recipients who stood to gain from the legislation.
As I understand it, 64 per cent of youth allowance recipients would not in fact have their youth allowance changed, six per cent would incur some sort of reduction in their youth allowance and two per cent would lose the youth allowance altogether. The other 0.5 per cent would not be eligible because they would take a deliberate decision not to be involved with this measure. Under those circumstances, I did deliberately ask that question of the minister, having, as some of you may have seen, spoken to the Prime Minister. The government leader stated quite categorically:
I can, therefore, assure Senator Harradine that in restructuring the Australian taxation system, to which this government is committed, the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.
I am aware, and others will be aware, that there are some in government who may not wish to see that situation, but the Prime Minister is committed to it and he committed his government, not just himself, not to consider further recognition but in fact to give further recognition and help, to use his words, 
 to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities.
—No guarantee.
—Senator Stott-Despoja, I would love an opportunity later this afternoon or some other time to go into the question of the importance of the family, even from a human rights perspective. I am happy to do that and I am happy to put my record against your party's record over a number of years on this particular matter. Please, let us continue it at some later time.

I think it is very disappointing that the minister has not answered my question, especially since the grand prix has now come and gone. Any opportunity to take advantage of the minister's answer has now been lost by that event. I point out that the minister has had plenty of notice that this was coming up.

That the Senate take note of the document. 

The Auditor-General's Report No. 35 of 1997-98—Performance audit—DEETYA International Services: Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs  highlights yet again another difficulty with that department. While the concept of promoting and expanding export opportunities in the field of education and training is one that I fully support and encourage, I do think that this is, yet again, an opportunity to highlight some difficulties that are emerging with the administration of this portfolio.
It is unfortunate that the problems that the Auditor-General has identified with this particular division are now becoming indicative of a broader problem within DEETYA. What the Auditor has established is that this particular section was not operating successfully in a range of areas which included financial planning, management of risks and cost methodology. As a result of its shortcomings in the way in which this program was administered there seems to be an accumulated cash deficit of $1.4 million.
While that may not be a particularly large sum of money in the context of this department it is nonetheless worthy of note. I want to emphasise that I actually support the expansion and promotion of Australian export opportunities in education. What I do not support, however, is the problems that are now emerging within DEETYA as a direct result of the decline in the resourcing and staffing of this department. It seems to me that the levels of staffing within this department are now such that issues surrounding overall accountability, management and monitoring of programs raise serious concerns within this parliament at large.
DEETYA is not alone when it comes to the problems surrounding these particular matters. This has been highlighted by DEETYA and senior officials of DEETYA itself before the estimates committee last Friday. What has been highlighted there is the inability to keep an accurate track of the spiralling increase in the use of consultancies. In my view, Dr Kemp has to take direct and personal responsibility for this because he has attempted to cover up the extent to which this department has become dependent upon consultants. We 
 have seen the way in which its agencies as well as the department have now used consultants in a very limited period. A small window has opened to us, through which we have been able to establish that some $7 million has been spent on consultants.
We have seen that this department has been gutted by this government. It has lost 80 per cent of its staff. This was the second biggest spending department in government. Its staffing figures, as revealed before the estimates by the secretary to the department, highlight that it has moved from 16,000 people two years ago down to some 2,500 people over the next financial year. This department has been gutted. The situation has now arisen where this government is seeking to spend millions and millions of dollars in consultancies to cover up the failure of this particular portfolio.
What we have here is a government engaged in a callous exercise of job replacement. Thousands of public servants are being shown the door and they are being replaced by consultants at an ever increasing rate of expense to undertake the work that was once done by officers of the department.
The secretary to the department has admitted some embarrassment with regard to the way in which the department itself is not able to maintain its record systems properly any more. He has been able to identify to us that three separate lists of consultants were provided to the estimates committee as a result of questions that I have raised.
The fact remains that the department still has not got it right. For this limited period of time during which we were seeking information, they were not able to distinguish between a consultant and a service provider on a consistent basis. This government has shown that its attempt to use the idea of a service provider has meant some $1 million of the $7 million can be reallocated away from the publicly declared requirements under the annual reporting provisions that are a normal part of public administration into an area which does not require public accountability at the same levels.
What we have seen is an attempt to hide the massive blow-out in consultancies by this 
 government and by this minister, who is engaged in a consultancy binge in an attempt to secure the advice that he wants—not independent, impartial, analytical advice from a fearless, independent public service but advice that he can control in a manner which is not subject to the normal rigours of the parliamentary system. In so doing, he increasingly provides that advice to consultants or service providers depending on what day of the week it is and depending on which officer actually engages the contract. Sometimes it can only be one officer. Only one officer is now required to make up a selection panel for some of these very expensive consultancies in a manner that means that the advice can be tailored to meet the demands of government rather than provide the independent basis of advice that we normally come to expect from the Public Service.
The fact that we have had a reduction in staffing in this department—the privatisation of this department by stealth from 16,000 people two years ago to 2,500 people in the space of two years—is deplorable. The fact that we have had to expose it through the estimates process is the bombshell that Senator Tierney is so anxious to avoid. It is the bombshell that they are so concerned about.
We have a climate of staff reductions, a department that is hideously embarrassed by the way in which these policies have been administered and a minister who shows no embarrassment, because he is shameless. We have a government that is shameless as to the consequences of its policies which will have a detrimental effect on the students and the unemployed of this country. We have an acknowledgment by the department of the inconsistent application of guidelines with regard to the use of consultants and service providers. We have clear evidence that the department's records are in a  complete shambles, despite the secretary's guidelines and despite the Public Service guidelines in terms of a procurement of government services.
What we have is the capacity now for individual officers to have the discretion to determine what consultancies should go forward and what should not. What we have 
 therefore is a government that has been working in a climate where DEETYA is not able to fulfil its obligations. There is little wonder that there have been so many scandals within this department? Is there little wonder that there have now been two ministers embroiled in the crises within this department?
—And how many secretaries?
—There have been three secretaries in this department. I thank Senator Mackay very much for that interjection. There have been three secretaries in the space of three years because of the scandals within this department, which is not the responsibilities of individual officers. It is because they have to carry the burden of government policy, which is totally inappropriate to the needs of this country. We have seen staffing reductions of 80 per cent. We have a budget demand by this government that, despite the fact that this department has 10 per cent of total government expenditure, it is required to carry 30 per cent—$4.3 billion—of the budget cuts.
Of course there will be problems and of course there will be crises as a result of the actions of this government. They have completely wiped out the corporate memory of this department. Is there any wonder that one problem after another is emerging as a result of the actions of this government which have reduced this department to a shadow of its former self.
It concerns me greatly that members opposite in this chamber express so little concern about the loss of service to the students and the unemployed of this country, so little concern about the consequences of a failure of government policy, so little concern about the loss of public moneys, so little concern about the questions of probity that are now emerging with regard to the employment market services and so little concern about the appalling failure in process that has resulted from 75 per cent of ANTA's consultancies going out in one period without a full and open tender process.
An increasingly small number of consultants are getting the benefit of an increasingly larger sum of money as a result of fewer and 
 fewer officers being made available to carry out the functions of this department. Is there little wonder that people ask why it is that everyone else in this country is required to operate on an open and competitive basis, as this government says, but the government operates on such a narrow, restricted basis—on the basis of selective invited tenders.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 35 of 1997-98</title>,Documents,13,2
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-03-09,"—The government welcomes Auditor-General's Report No. 35 of 1997-98—Performance audit—DEETYA International Services: Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs —a very valuable report which confirms a number of management reforms that have been introduced recently by DEETYA International Services. One of the major reforms has been the adoption of a new DIS operational framework based on a cost recovery model which addresses the areas which ANAO has highlighted needs improvement. These include financial planning, management of risk and costing methodology.
Following the adoption of this framework, DIS has revised its business plan to focus on continuing improvement links of output based budgeting and reporting, it is developing a comprehensive risk management plan and it is moving to full accrual based financial management. These reforms will further contribute to DIS's success in winning tenders and obtaining client satisfaction for services which are delivered.
The ANAO report on DIS acknowledged the vital contribution that DIS is making to export opportunities for Australian education, training and labour market providers in a number of regions, including the countries of South-East Asia, central Asia and eastern Europe. Over the last four years DIS has secured contracts worth $9.6 million in these very important export markets. The current financial difficulty in some countries in our region coupled with increasing competition and the imperative of Australian groups targeting markets carefully has been included so that DIS will work harder to improve the position to respond to current and future demands in the marketplace.
It was interesting that Senator Carr spent only a few minutes concentrating on the findings of the report and also the way in which the government has moved very quickly—even before the report was brought down—to institute a number of changes. It has established a relatively new organisation. It has been established in a Public Service culture, and it has to have a market orientation. Of course, this combination in the early stages does create some difficulties. It has recognised those difficulties and it is moving very quickly to reform this body.
Senator Carr's broader remarks relating to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs show a lack of knowledge of the history of DEETYA. He seems to indicate that the problems have come from the current change in arrangements. He obviously has no knowledge of the history of the sorts of things that were happening six or seven years ago—in 1991, when the Auditor-General did heavily qualify his report into DEETYA under Senator Carr's government eight years after they came into government. As a matter of fact, things were in such a shambles at that time that in the following year DEETYA appointed 40 internal auditors to try to fix up the mess in the accountability systems. Over the years since then, DEETYA has, to its great credit, got its act together and improved accountability arrangements. Over seven years I certainly have not seen any backsliding from that.
Senator Carr went on to talk about various things relating to consultancies and outsourcing. If we restructure the way in which we provide these services, which this government has done, and if we move to a more market based approach, obviously we do not need as many public servants. The test in the end will be the way in which services are delivered and the way in which people do end up being placed in real jobs. I would have thought that sort of outcome is the ultimate test that we should be looking at.
Look at the appalling record of Senator Carr's government in relation to not only the high levels of unemployment that developed during the time Labor were mismanaging this country but also the way in which they then 
 approached the problem. Sure, they employed an enormous number of public servants and committed billions of dollars to the exercise. I suppose in a way that is commendable—except that they did not get the outcomes, which meant they got the worst of both worlds: they wasted taxpayers' dollars and people were still in the unemployment queue. They had a totally hopeless approach to this.
In 1996 the voters in this country thoroughly recognised the hopelessness of Labor's approach in their `not Working Nation' scheme and threw them out of office. Voters wanted a totally different approach. This government has brought in this approach, and there is every sign that it will have a much better chance of success than the mess those opposite created in the unemployment area.

It is very clear that the NCA is engaged in a quiet but very effective war against drugs.
I would like the Senate to take note of the fact that over the past three months the NCA has made a number of significant arrests in 
 connection with the drugs war. There were five networks involving the use of heroin that were smashed, with 17 people arrested, including a number of senior crime figures. There were three arrests and the seizure of 21 kilos of heroin with a street value of $32 million. There were nine arrests and an interstate heroin ring broken. Twelve people were arrested in three raids with heroin, cocaine, firearms and stolen goods seized. In another case there were 10 individuals arrested and a syndicate was cracked that operated in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. While the war against these drugs is of course ever-present and far from won, it is clear that the NCA is making significant inroads into this very sad human tragedy in Australia.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Crime Authority Committee</title>,Committees,14,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—by leave—I would like to make some brief remarks about the report by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the examination of the annual report for 1996-97. The annual report has been examined by the committee and found to be satisfactory for a number of reasons—its improved presentation, its timeliness and its relationship to the corporate plan. These are indeed mostly housekeeping issues. But, more importantly for the Australian Democrats, we are concerned that where a person's name is included in a report in the context of them being charged, it is essential that, if the matter does not proceed or if the person is found not guilty, the matter be included in the annual report. The report states at paragraph 27:
The Committee acknowledges the fine line between `suspected' and `charged' prior to the matter going to court and sympathises with the NCA, as a law enforcement body, not wishing to breach its own enabling legislation.
I can only say that the reporting of not guilty and charges withdrawn matters are absolutely essential. This approach should be reconsidered in the near future to ensure the practice does not place undue hardship on those charged and later found to be not guilty or to have the charges dropped.
I also, for the record, would like to restate my concerns about the investigation into the 
 bombing of the NCA office in Adelaide. As we all know in this chamber, this was one of the most serious attacks on a law enforcement agency in this nation's history. It occurred in my home state of South Australia on 2 March 1994. That bombing killed Geoffrey Bowen and maimed Peter Wallis. Despite the fact that this happened more than three years ago, there has been no successful prosecution of this crime. Of course, there are many questions that remain unanswered; there are many outstanding questions. This is not good enough from the perspective of our law enforcement agencies. I believe that it is the role of this parliament, and our responsibility, to make sure that we get to the bottom of this particular tragic event.
I understand that security has been beefed up on NCA recommendations. I understand, for example, that all mail is now X-rayed and other measures are in place to protect from harm these agencies and the individuals that work within them. If this is not the case, however, if there are any loopholes whatsoever, something must be done to bring the protective measures up to standard. I note that the Democrats have raised these concerns in this place on a number of occasions. We believe that those people who are in a position of authority and who are charged with the responsibility of protecting others are entitled to the maximum level of physical and other security available. The lives of those in public service are indeed valuable, like all other lives, and we must learn the lessons of this particular tragedy to make sure that nothing like it at all happens again.
I am also concerned about the coroner's inquest. After three years the South Australian coroner's office has not convened an inquest into this tragedy because the police investigation has not been finalised. I understand that is the rationale and that this is standard practice in my home state. However, given the lack of prosecution after all this time—it is over three years, as I said—we should be seeking answers as to why the coroner's inquest has not even started. I believe this investigation is central to resolving this tragedy and learning the lessons so that this never happens again.

If there are details that affect the outcome of this bill they should be disclosed by the government immediately. More and more it seems that the government is making secret arrangements with particular members of the Senate in order to prevent open debate on issues that should be public.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,—I find it curious that the opposition is unable to accept the explanation that was given by Senator Harradine today. It is for Senator Harradine to talk to the Senate about any matters that he has discussed with the Prime Minister. It is not for me to discuss that.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Minister, you are a member of the government; you represent the government here today. You have a responsibility to disclose to all members of the Senate any issues that are pertinent to this debate. I 
 suppose it is up to Senator Harradine to disclose whether he has had personal discussions with the Prime Minister but I am concerned about what government policy changes are being made that will have an impact on this particular bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I made it perfectly clear last Thursday that this government has already evidenced its concern for families with dependent children. Virtually the first thing it did when it came into government was to honour its election commitment of a $1 billion family tax initiative to relieve families of some of the costs and burdens of raising children. Senator Harradine did believe, I understand, that that was a very valuable initiative. I do not think that there is any point in belabouring that issue. I would have thought that the opposition would have seen that that was a valuable example of the government's commitment to families with dependent children.
I also said last Thursday that the government's management of the national accounts has been such that we have had five reductions in interest rates since we came into government. This has meant that families have had, effectively, something like a $90 to $100 a week pay rise because of the reduction in the burden that they have had in meeting their family mortgages.
We have not been running around with rhetoric on those things but taking no action, like the previous government did. We have actually put those things into place which have benefited and helped families who are raising children. The Prime Minister and Senator Harradine may have had their conversation—and I am not able to help you on that—but I know that the Prime Minister has made it absolutely clear that tax reform is on agenda for this government and that we will go to the next election with people well and truly understanding what proposals are available for them to pass judgment on. It will be absolutely clear that one of the principles on which that tax reform is based is that we recognise appropriately the special demands placed on parents by the raising of children 
 and the need for that to be recognised in the tax system.
We have already moved to that partially with the family tax initiative when we first came into government. We have also talked about the need for compensation, where appropriate, for any change to the tax structure. I imagine—and that is for Senator Harradine to discuss if he wishes—that Senator Harradine has found that the assurances the Prime Minister has given him are satisfactory because, and here is the crunch, Senator Neal, this legislation will be beneficial for very many young people and their families.
—What about others?
—You might carp about things that you do not think are as good as they might be—because you have the luxury of that from opposition—but you were not prepared to move to do this when you were in government despite the fact that the welfare organisations were asking for you to move in this direction.
—They were not asking for us to move in that direction!
—They have told me that they were asking. They were very happy to be involved in consultations and make submissions as to how the youth allowance should be implemented. Do not be under any misapprehension that this important social policy reform was badly needed to send the right messages to young people that it is better to be acquiring skills than to be jumping out of school too early and remaining unemployed for a very long period and perhaps becoming unemployable over time. It is very important to send the right message to young people that we do not believe it is desirable that young unemployed people are getting paid more money than those would who are studying to improve themselves and their country.
There are a number of very important messages to young people in this legislation. Senator Harradine has clearly had the opportunity to study the bill thoroughly and believes that to stand in the way of a very important piece of social policy would be 
 wrong, given that he has been assured by the Prime Minister that this government is determined to tackle tax reform in a meaningful way so that it is advantageous to families with dependent children.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I could not let that pass without reminding the Senate that what we did get from the government in relation to family tax was a marginal tax system which was highly complex and extremely intricate. The reason it was set up that way was to try to make it look as if the gain was $1,000 when it was a lot less. The reality is that the government said they were giving $1,000 and in fact what people got in their pockets was a lot less. It was extremely complex; it is probably extremely expensive to administer as well. It was a con basically because it gave a lot less than what it promised—and it did not help much at all people who did not pay tax.
If the government are suggesting that they did such a good job with their family tax last time—their marginal tax effort—that they are going to do the same kind of thing again, we are on to them. It was a con last time. It was a scam to look as if the government were giving more than they did. As I recall, Senator Harradine at the time was very critical of the way the government put that together. So I certainly hope you are not going to came with the same kind of thing and add a figure on and pretend you are giving another $1,000 to Australian families because we are on to you. We have seen what you did before.
The important message that the minister is suggesting is perhaps one she took from Malthus, from a previous century, that you have to be cruel to be kind; that if you give the poor money they will only have babies. That kind of message is the kind of outdated, old-fashioned, inappropriate and cruel message that is coming from the government. The kinds of questions that we have been asking have not been answered by the government. What did happen about the explanatory memorandum the first time that suddenly meant we had an extra $100 million? When did we get the answer to that? Where are the figures from the government as to how the figures got changed by $100 million between 
 when the questions were asked and when the minister answered them and when the explanatory memorandum was published?
We are told that we should accept what the government is saying that people are going to be better off. We have had no figures at all to show that. The amendments we are asking for support for here are about the real impact on real people. The Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats believe that it is not just a matter of definition on paper; it is a matter of whether families will be able to survive. We do not believe that it is acceptable to say, `Oh well, if you have got kids who are in school or in training'—magically, considering the amount of money not available for schools and training from this government—`you might be better off if they are in those things.' If you look at the longer term picture that is not quite true. If you look at the impact on people who are unemployed for a longer period of time the picture gets worse.
None of those questions have actually been answered. Yet we are still being asked to accept that it is all right to discriminate against young people and to pick and choose what the age of independence is depending on whether or not the government feels it can save money; and that it is all right to call a person independent if there is a chance of getting money out of them—like their accepting debts and so on. But it is not okay to accept the age of independence as 18 unless you accept the responsibility that if those young people, like any other adult person in our society, are unemployed or need assistance with training or education they are entitled to receive it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—The name Malthus has got me to my feet. For the past 22 years I have been pointing out the nonsense of neo-Malthusians—amongst whom you can class yourselves, perhaps—in and out of this chamber. And now what have we got? On the population bomb we have a recent discussion at the UN expressing concern about the demographic disasters that are going to beset the world because of the ageing population, and there has been this campaign, supported by a number of people whom I will not mention 
 who are in this chamber, that there should be restrictions placed upon parents as to the number of children—indeed bordering on support for the Chinese one child per family policy. Over the years I have been pointing this out, and I have been proven right over all of those years, and now I hear the name Malthus in this particular debate.
—He was an economist—of sorts!
—Yes, a pretty crook economist. I often quoted the very good work of Julian Simon—who recently passed away—and I pay tribute to his work over the many years when it was not fashionable to tell the truth and to warn of demographic disasters. And that is what we are threatened with at the present moment.
Senator Neal has asked a question—and I think I owe it to her, the opposition and others to respond—but I would like to remind honourable senators that on 5 March the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), made a deliberate commitment, and I repeat it:
I can, therefore, assure Senator Harradine that, in restructuring the Australian taxation system . . . the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in  . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.
That undertaking was given in the context of the proposed restructuring of the taxation system. It was not a short-term thing as to what is going to happen in the next budget; I am not privy to what is going to happen in the next budget, on this or any other matter. I was more interested in the long-term outcomes for families as a result of the taxation restructuring situation.
As we all know, there is a government task force, chaired by Senator Brian Gibson, which is examining a large number of submissions. What the Prime Minister did, and this was confirmed publicly here in the chamber, was to give me that assurance in the context of the restructure. If the government ultimately goes to some sort of consumption tax—which I have considered over the years to be, either in fact or potentially, regressive—you then 
 have a look at what the Prime Minister has committed the government to. He has committed it to giving further recognition and help; not that they will give consideration to it, but they will, so that the outcome will have to be better for families than it is now, even under a consumption tax. That is a very important and significant undertaking, and I will not take it lightly.
Honourable senators will realise that over many years, both in the trade union movement and on the ACTU, I was involved in discussions, and Albert Monk actually came out as a very strong supporter of family payments and family allowances. I think it was at an ACTU congress in the early 1960s when we went through it and he came out as a strong supporter of family allowances supporting children. He was in opposition to some of those people who were on the population control bandwagon—the population bomb bandwagon—and I pay full credit to Albert Monk for what he did in those days against the sort of pressure that was being brought to bear on him and on the rest of us in the ACTU executive.
 No doubt Senator Neal will be as keen as I am to make sure that the Prime Minister delivers on his undertaking which was publicly stated here in the chamber by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I can assure Senator Neal that I will be as keen as she is, and the opposition no doubt will be, I hope, to see, as the Prime Minister has said, in effect, that families with children will be better off under the outcome of the taxation restructuring. If we can hold him to that, I think we will have achieved a good deal. I do not for one moment consider that the Prime Minister would renege on such an assurance, because I believe that he is very firmly committed to it himself. I have come to that conclusion from the way he has spoken on this particular matter.
So there it is. I had to ask myself this question: what could be achieved through this? Here we were in the Senate, as I said before, faced with the proposition that if we amended this legislation substantially it would have no hope. It would go back to the House of Representatives, the government would 
 defeat our amendments, it would come back up to the Senate and, if we insisted, the whole thing would be shelved—and with what result?
As I said before lunch—and I am not saying anything different this time after lunch; I have been there and done that on the RDA—there were winners in this. I have figures from the Parliamentary Library with regard to winners and losers. The government figures were that 27½ per cent of current youth allowance, or equivalent, recipients would be better off; 64 per cent would remain the same; six per cent would experience a reduction; and two per cent would lose the allowance, whatever allowance they were on.
That is not a satisfactory situation, I agree. But one has to look at it squarely and think, well, what is the best outcome that can be achieved? Rightly or wrongly, I decided that it was time to respond to a request for a meeting. That took place, and the outcome you know.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Senator Harradine, I do not doubt your desire to bring about a positive result for those families who might be affected adversely by this bill. But I suppose what worries me a little are the broad terms in which the undertaking was given by Senator Hill.
—Not only over this bill; it was a general undertaking for families.
—It says:
. . . further recognition . . . help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.
The difficulty, of course, is that that undertaking does not specifically say that people who are affected adversely by this particular aspect of the bill being debated at the moment will be compensated.
What there was particular concern about, which I think we discovered in the debate last week, was that the parents of adult children—and I say `adult children' because those between 18 and 20 are adults—were going to lose $135 million. On the face of it, it seems to me that this undertaking by Senator Hill does not give any sort of guarantee that that particular group of families who lose that 
 $135 million will be compensated in any way in this future tax restructuring, if the present government has the opportunity to bring that restructuring about.
Within the tax system, on nearly any interpretation that I have ever been aware of—and I am happy for people to correct me if they believe there is an example—`family' has been defined as `having children of less than 18 years'. So how can any proposal within the tax system compensate families with adult children between the ages of 18 and 20? If it is the intention of this government to make payments to families in that particular position, it is obviously a very relevant consideration and a matter that I believe the government should disclose openly.
The debates held within the Senate, I believe, should be carried out on a transparent basis. All decision makers involved, all senators, should have access to information which will affect their ultimate position on the bill. If the government says, `We have information that may affect your decision making on this issue but we are just not going to give it to you,' I think the government is treating the Senate and many senators with a lack of respect, and I do not think that is a very good precedent for this government to start with.
Certainly I would very much like to know as an individual senator—and I am sure that all opposition senators would like to know—whether the government is proposing to make changes to compensate this particular group of people. If the government is proposing to do so, it will obviously impact on our position, and we would very much like to be aware of it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-09,"—In terms of the amendments before the chamber at the moment which, as I understand it, relate to the relevant age level of independents, I would back up the request that Senator Neal has made as to detail and whether or not any more is available. Regardless of whether or not the Democrats support this aspect of the legislation, from my perspective, that certainly helps when going back out into the community and explaining to 
 people the rationale behind decisions that have been made.
I would very much appreciate more information, if there is any, from either the Minister for Social Security or perhaps Senator Harradine in relation to this tax reform and the further recognition and help that will be given to parents in raising their sons and daughters—whether those sons and daughters include those above the age of 18, and whether there will be any help in this tax reform specifically for parents' sons and daughters in that age group.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—As I said, it is not for me to say and I do not know, nor did I ask, in respect of the budget. This legislation is coming in from 1 July, as I understand it. What the government does in the budget might be one thing, but let us get it very clear that we have been told by the government that we will ultimately have a completely restructured taxation system, introduced sometime in the new financial year. I assume that that is going to be put to the people. I do hope it is going to be put to the people in the election campaign. That, I understand, is the intention of the government. So it will be open and transparent.
I was looking to an ongoing beneficial outcome to families, and I specifically mentioned parents concerning their responsibilities in raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers. I pointed out the need to recognise, in whatever taxation system that emerges, the intra-family transfers that take place. If they are going to assume that those are taking place and test the youth allowance on that particular assumption, it is only fair that the government should recognise that transfer for the purposes of minimising the tax of those parents and also helping those other parents who may, even though they are on a relatively high income, have an income tax neutral situation.
I agree with what Senator Margetts implied, that you have got to be paying tax to have something recognised in the tax system. That is one of the reasons that the word `help' is there. I do not think there is anything more that I can enlighten you on, other than to say that I look forward to assistance to ensure that 
 this undertaking is honoured, which I have no doubt it will be.
As to Senator Neal's reference to the specific parents involved in income testing, which will affect some six per cent, or eight per cent counting the other two per cent, of the youth allowance recipients, they will be covered by what was said, but it is not limited to those persons. It is an undertaking that the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents in that particular work that is their priority, that is, the raising and education of their sons and daughters.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—First of all, I point out that Senator Neal's contribution has to be the height of hypocrisy. Her government was perfectly prepared to parentally means test the families of students, many of whom are exactly the same families of the young unemployed. You had no problem in parentally means esting them. Not only that, Senator Neal, you were not prepared to lift a finger to give them any family tax relief. It was not until this government came in that any family tax relief was applied at all.
Senator Margetts is prepared to dismiss the family tax initiative as not being very important. She may have a very short memory. I point out to her that the welfare organisations of Australia came out very enthusiastically—
—Until they saw how it was restructured.
—They were saying how well the family tax initiative was targeted to low and middle income families, and that something like 50 per cent—
—Is that the first day—before they saw how you did it? That was before they saw how you did it.
—You will have your turn, Senator, when you get the call. Just now, you listen to me. Something like 50 per cent of the families were on low to middle incomes. Some of them were not in fact paying tax and therefore they received their assistance through the social security system. I would have thought you might have pondered on that somewhat.
One of the things that you also continue to ignore is how most families do not have just one unemployed young person in the family; they have young people in a mixture of age groups and their young are engaged in a mixture of activities. Just let us remember this—because we have been through it before and I do not want to go over and over it—two-thirds of the unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds will not be affected by the youth allowance parental means test, either because they are independent themselves or because they come from low income pensioner or beneficiary families. That is the first thing.
The second thing is that, where they have more than one young person in the family and the family income is below $30,700, a family with a student and an unemployed child both aged over 18 will be better off than they are now because the increase in the benefit that is paid to the student is greater than the decrease in the benefit paid to the unemployed person. Those are some of the things you are not factoring in when you are considering this measure. That is why I think you have gone off on your high horse to the wrong destination.
Senator Harradine has acknowledged that this legislation has a lot of benefits. It does have a parental means test to people that you would choose not to parentally means test. But the situation is that those families are parentally means tested now for their students of that age. There is no justifiable reason why they should not also be means tested, using the same means test, for their young unemployed. As I pointed out to you last week, DSS statistics show that the young unemployed are on average on benefits for five months, whereas the students are on assistance for anything up to five years. It is a very different commitment that parents make to their student children from what they are currently asked to make to their young unemployed people.
When there is a transfer within the family of the benefits such as I have just demonstrated to you, it is not fair or honest to suggest that these families are going to be worse off. Many of them will be better off. Although they will get a lesser payment for their young 
 unemployed person, they will be getting an increased benefit for their student. Surely we should be sending a message to young people that, if you possibly can, you should be studying to improve your opportunities in life. The way the current system is designed, you are going to do better financially if you go on the dole than if you go into study, and surely it is wrong to send that message to young people.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I am totally enraged by the minister's response. There are many people who believe that education is a benefit, not a cost, and should be treated so; but it is currently treated as a benefit. The reason there is a difference between education and unemployment for young people is that in no way, shape or form can you call unemployment a benefit—for a young person or anybody else. How dare you come into this chamber and express the fact that a person who is unemployed should be treated as though their unemployment is a benefit to them; that their unemployment is some sort of privilege to them and their families; that unemployment is a gift—something for which they have to be grateful and, if it is taken away, they should expect it.
—What rubbish!  Why don't you listen?
—I was listening when the minister said we should treat unemployment as if it were a training benefit. She said there is no reason why we should expect that unemployment should not be treated as if you were getting an education, and we should somehow expect that a young person who is unemployed has the right to have their family punished as if unemployment were a benefit to that young person. How dare she come into this chamber with that kind of proposal and expect us to accept that!
The real life implications are that a family who may have one unemployed person and who may not have a person who is studying in their house will not feel grateful to you, Minister, when you say, `We have taken this off you but we have given it'—or something fairly small—`to your neighbours or to someone else down the street.' They will not feel 
 grateful, funnily enough. You are suggesting, and we do not believe it, that it averages out. But a family who have had that $121 a week taken off them, funnily enough, will not feel grateful to you or your government. They will not feel that the averages work for them, if they do not have a student at home; they will not feel that it is okay that someone else might get some benefits, if you have taken it off them and they are struggling because they have had over $3,000 a year taken off them—funnily enough, they will not feel grateful and I do not know why they should.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I was a bit astonished by the minister's response, bearing in mind that I did not indulge in personal abuse—I just asked a question—but I will not allow myself to be distracted by that. I point out to the minister that, if she goes back to my speech during the second reading debate, she will see that I stated there were substantial benefits in the bill and we did appreciate those but there were also difficulties. I suppose we do tend to concentrate on the negatives rather than on the positives in this place; but I would appreciate a reasonable answer from the minister rather than the sort of personal response we received earlier.
It appears that certain undertakings have been given in relation to this bill which may affect the outcome. If undertakings have been given that provide families with adult children between the ages of 18 and 20 with some compensation, I will ask the minister again and ignore the other comments: what sort of compensation is anticipated to be provided? It is obviously very relevant to this debate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—If the minister is going to take on board Senator Neal's questions and concerns, I might add to that even more specifically. Like Senator Dee Margetts, I am similarly angered and getting rather depressed by these proceedings. I do not mean to be cynical or distrusting of governments but I am not happy with a general commitment by the Prime Minister—or anyone else for that matter—to consider how the taxation system can perhaps be restruc 
 tured or changed in some way to alleviate some of the financial burdens on families.
While I agree with that sentiment, I want some specifics. I want to know what is going to happen to the 4,200 young people aged between 18 and 20 who will no longer receive rent assistance—those who will lose at least $74.80 per fortnight or $1,944 per year in income. I want to know what will happen to the 33,600 young people between the ages of 18 and 20 who will receive a reduced level of youth allowance because they will be income tested on parental means. What will happen to the 12,800 young people between the ages of 18 and 20 who will have their benefits cancelled—the ones whom the government does not believe need to live away from home for the purposes of study, jobsearch or training? I could go on. I want to know how these young people are going to be compensated in the short term and how the financial burden on their families is going to be alleviated.
I take on board the minister's comment that a lot of these measures, and some of the measures contained in the bill, have been badly needed for a long time. She is right when she says that there are a number of things that could have been taken on board by the last government. One of those issues is parity between unemployment benefits and student financial assistance levels. Another is flexibility and streamlining of payment arrangements. I know about this—I was in a number of student groups that called on the former government to look into some of the more streamlined arrangements between departments such as DEETYA and the Department of Social Security.
I also acknowledge Senator Dee Margetts's interjection that a number of other issues which have been put forward by a number of community, youth, student and welfare groups have not been picked up in this legislation—whether it is to do with the strict, harsh and restrictive nature of the parental means test under this bill or the inclusion of that absolutely ridiculous actual means testing arrangement.
One issue that I think has been debated longer than most issues in debates on this kind of policy area is the age of independ 
 ence. It is something that we have an opportunity to rectify today, certainly with the amendments before us. I look forward to a recognition from all parties in this chamber—somewhat naively, I suspect—in respect of the age of independence for full-time students.
I remember Senator Neal's very brief rationale, before we went to question time, as to why the ALP will not support the Democrats amendment relating to the definition that the age of independence for a full-time student is 18. She said that it was because a young person in education at that time of their life is advantaged. They certainly are going to be advantaged under a government like this one where education is increasingly defined, as it was under the former government, as a privilege and not a community right! Yes, Senator Margetts, there are people who define education as a benefit and as an investment and not simply a cost.
I still do not understand the logic of the opposition, which is willing to consider a reduction in the age at which a young unemployed person is considered to be independent but not for a full-time student. This is not about being advantaged as a young person by being in the education and training system; this is an expectation under this legislation. Goodness knows what is going to happen to those young people who do not get into an education and training institution, who apply for TAFE places but are dealing with the unmet demand situation of something like 60,000 places last year alone. What happens to those young people who are not able to find some form of employment? How are they going to be compensated? I am still at a loss to understand.
I will acknowledge the positive aspects of this legislation, but I am also going to talk about and expose the harsh ones—throwing 16- and 17 year-olds who cannot get employment, education and training onto some kind of scrap heap. I will acknowledge, too, the few exemptions that exist. I take the government's conservative estimates: 1,600 will be thrown off benefits. What happens to them and their families? I want to know what the minister suggests will happen to those people under this bill. I want to know what 
 happens to them as a consequence of the so-called assurance put forward by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Prime Minister.
I am all for accepting the relevance and the appropriateness of negotiations behind the scenes, debate in committees or even discussions with individuals and party members in this place and with the Prime Minister—anyone. But I expect those amendments, changes, ideas or proposals to be put on the floor of this chamber at the committee stage. I am not going to make a decision on a bill such as this when people are talking about deals and assurances in the backroom. It is absolutely outrageous!",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—One of the themes that has been flowing from this debate about the age of independence is the impact on families. Of course, that is what the government wants us to concentrate on. But we should be talking most specifically about the impact on the unemployed young people. In that light, what sort of guarantees can the Minister for Social Security provide that the income paid to a student in training—let us face it, the allowances are not too generous for students who might be in some sort of training or education; they are just enough to cover that sort of training and education—or an unemployed person will flow to that person?
How do you make a dysfunctional family functional? How do you force income sharing if the young person is not getting along with their family? Heaven knows, this generation did not invent the changes that affect people between the ages of 14 and 18. Some of the changes, disruptions or the dysfunctional nature of families mean that there is no guarantee of an 18- to 25-year-old being able to go to their family and seek assistance if they are unemployed. Can the minister give the committee any assurances about what happens when a family is not prepared to assist—for the very normal reason that families have disagreements with each other—their young family member who is unemployed?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I do not know whether Senator Margetts is confused 
 here, but we are not talking about the under-18-year-olds, in respect of whom the money does go to their parents; we are talking about the over-18-year-olds, to whom the money flows. Why do you have a problem with that?
—Because basically you said it was means tested. How can you say that if they don't get it?
—The quantum is determined by the parents' income. The payment is made to the young person.
—But how can you force the families to give it?
—I find it strange, Senator, that you are in here as an advocate for parents with over $58,000 of income and those are the people who lose benefits altogether if they are living away from home.
—Do you want this debate to go on? I will answer every time you come up with nonsense.
—I know that you have a problem with numbers but, nevertheless, recognise that that is the advice that comes from my department to the Senate as to the income level at which it cuts out. You are advocating, in fact, for the top end of the spectrum. If you lived in my home state of Tasmania you would find that the average family income is just a bit more than half of that.
—Tell me what it is.
—Around $28,000 to $30,000—something in that region. They are accommodated by this and most families will, in fact, not notice any change at all because of the additional measures that are in this bill, such as the abolition of the education leave waiting period—$1,100 extra into that person's pocket which would not go in under the current arrangement—and, in addition, there are the people on Austudy, for example, who are not currently getting anything because their entitlement is under $1,000 and they will now get a proportional entitlement. That is, once again, parentally means tested. The parental means test, as it applies to students and young unemployed people, will be comparable. It is the means test that we have for Austudy now and that has been long 
 established in this country. It is slightly more generous in that you can include a number of other items such as I have mentioned.
You were talking about the young unemployed not getting the money—was it you, Senator Stott Despoja, talking about people having to ask for the money to go for a milkshake? You sounded just like your former leader. I remember very well when she cried out with a song and dance about young people having to ask for the money to go to the pictures, saying that somehow this was going to lead to family strife and it was going to mean we were going to have an increase in the numbers of homeless youth. I think one of you the other day also suggested there would be an increase in sham marriages.
Let me tell you what the facts are. The facts are that when the age of Austudy parental means testing changed there was little or no change in either the number of marriages claimed or the numbers of homeless people. So you can run these stories outside this chamber but the facts do not demonstrate them.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I promise I will confine my remarks to a question, but I cannot let those comments go without seeking clarification. Okay, I acknowledge that you have abolished the $1,000 minimum for those people in relation to Austudy and I acknowledge that 34,200 people will benefit from that. It is a lot. I acknowledge that. And what are their benefits?—a maximum gain of $1,000 per annum compared with—
—And eligibility for rent assistance now.
—We will have this rent assistance debate. As you can see, the Democrats have amendments in relation to the eligibility criteria for rent assistance. We have previously in debates acknowledged the extension of rent assistance to students as something that is welcome but 
 I am sick and tired of the figures being fudged in the sense that, yes, a lot of people will benefit from some of these changes but their benefits are minimal in comparison with some of the losses that people are making.
The minister is shaking her head but in the example I gave in the previous debate of the 1,600 unemployed under-18 year olds, their average loss per fortnight—not per annum—is $176.40. So it just does not weigh up when you are talking about 34,200 benefiting by, on average, $1,000 per annum compared with these people who are losing potentially hundreds of dollars a fortnight. Can you not see that there is a huge discrepancy? We can keep talking about all these people who are going to benefit incrementally, slightly, minimally, compared with those who do lose out, and lose out in a big way.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—As I say, if the minister wants this debate to go on she can keep making those statements that what we are arguing for is the people on high incomes. If the minister will recall, we asked questions specifically about a family on what is considered to be the average weekly ordinary time income of $36,000. We found out that an unemployed young person between the age of 18 and 20 will get the princely sum of $52.70 per fortnight to live on. I think the minister is suggesting that you will not have a situation where, to go out to get a milkshake, a 20-year old will have to ask mum and dad whether they can have the money. To have to ask, just to go out anywhere or to get a bus ticket, is not in the real world. Some $52.70 a fortnight to live on is not high income—this is average, weekly, ordinary time earnings, according to your own figures, Minister.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-09,"—I would just like to tease out one tiny bit further the issue that Senator Harradine was addressing a little while back and which I believe is relevant to Senator Stott Despoja's requests. When Senator Harradine was talking about the nature of the potential future commitments of the government he was talking about recognising the transfers that go on when families have to support students, their children and so on. As I recall, he said some 
 thing along the lines that it was only fair in restructuring the tax system that the government recognise those transfers, those extra cost burdens—I guess that is what we are talking about—by minimising the tax that would be paid by those parents, as a compensatory arrangement. I hope that in a garbled way I am reasonably accurately reflecting what Senator Harradine was saying.
I am simply again bringing it back to this issue of young people in this age group. I guess it is a question for the minister. Does the minister agree that it is only fair that the government does recognise those transfers in that way by reducing the tax burden? Is that something that is going to be addressed in this tax restructuring that the government is committed to?
—I have answered it several times already, Senator.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—Both the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA) have acknowledged that the age of 21 years is not their preferred option. When I spoke before about the request that the age of independence be reduced to 18, I promised I would talk about some of the views that were given in past inquiries and studies into the age of independence. This could give us some understanding of the contemporary opinion on this matter.
The 1975 TEAS Review Committee, the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee report Foundations for a clever country, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report on student financial assistance in 1991, the State Youth Affairs Councils and Networks' A living income of May 1992, the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee report on the inquiry into Austudy of June 1995 and the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Regional Development national youth housing strategy final report of December 1995 all said that the age of independence should be 21 years or lower.
Here we have a situation where government departments, community organisations, student groups, legal reform institutions, Australian universities' peak body and committees of 
 both house of this parliament have been suggesting for the last 23 years that the age of independence be set at 21 or below. One is left to wonder just whom the government has been listening to when it says it has conducted wide negotiations and consultations. It seems we would be hard pressed to find anyone outside of this government and perhaps the Treasury department who even vaguely concurs with the age of independence being set at 25. Where does the age of 25 come from?
—They would be in a nursing home before they got there.
—Yes, probably. It is certainly completely unrelated to the legal age of adulthood of 18 years or even the old coming of age at 21. I will tell senators where it comes from: from the old Commonwealth scholarship scheme of 1951. It comes from the very early years of the Liberal Menzies government. This is very telling: while it is clear to most Australians that community values have altered substantially in the last 45 years, including as to when people are responsible for their own affairs, this government seems hell-bent on recreating the values of the 1950s—values to which the Australian community no longer subscribes. I call it compulsory picket fences.
This is why the youth of Australia are turning their back on the government and politicians in general. Senator Stott Despoja probably has figures on the level of dissatisfaction amongst young people with the political process from some of the work she has done, but I believe the youth poll has found it runs at about 98 per cent. While the government continues to ignore the reality for young Australians, this will only get worse.
The age of independence also raises the question as to what is the government's definition of `youth'. For example, what strange biological metamorphosis occurs within the educational environment that renders a student a youth for four years longer than an unemployed person? As the National Union of Students has pointed out, the continuing definition of `youth' status for students aged 21 to 25 goes against one of the central stated aims of the youth allowance 
 scheme: to remove the disincentives to study. Can the minister explain to the chamber how making students dependent on their parents until the age of 25 while rightly maintaining the existing arrangements which allow for anyone aged 21 and above to receive a higher rate of payment on the dole removes disincentives to study?
As the National Union of Students pointed out in its responses to the youth allowance community discussion paper, the greatest transition between study and the labour market for students and unemployed people in receipt of benefits takes place when students leave tertiary education for the first time and begin to look for employment. This process of moving from study to the labour market typically takes place around the age of 21 to 24, as most tertiary students are school leavers undertaking three- to six-year courses. Given this large demographic cohort, the youth allowance age of independence is spectacularly unsuccessful in creating a simplified system and removing disincentives to study.
Remember the minister said it is about making it easier for bureaucrats. As I have demonstrated, the very people who are most likely to transfer between unemployment and education—that is, 21- to 24-year-olds—will still have to leave the youth allowance and register for Newstart or vice versa. So the age of independence for students achieves none of the government's stated objectives.
I agree with the National Union of Students submission that either the government is completely lacking in its understanding of the two systems or the government's claims of wanting to increase flexibility in the transition between education and the labour force are completely disingenuous and the whole age of independence issue is just an excuse to cut benefits to tens of thousands of young, and not so young, Australians.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

—It is just students—

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I will be brief because I understand that we have canvassed a number of these arguments, certainly philosophically, and now it seems economically. My only question to the opposition on this one is whether they are justifying this economically or they are justifying it philosophically. I note Senator Neal has asked the minister for a costing as to what this amendment would mean. I just want to know for the record, if indeed the opposition opposes this amendment, why they are doing it. Just which excuse are we going to be giving the community: is it that it is going to cost too much or is it all those arguments that Senator Neal gave quite eloquently in favour of a reduced age of independence for young unemployed people earlier on in this debate? Don't those arguments apply?
The youth allowance ages are contrary to community expectations and law, as I have said. I just want to make the point on the record that at 15 in this country you can get your own Medicare card. You can have sex—at least heterosexual sex. You can get a full-time or part-time job. At 17 you can be taken to an adult court if you break the law. You can be sent to an adult gaol if the court so orders. You can leave home without legal implications. At 18 you can vote and make a valid will. You are beyond the age of compulsory schooling and you are bound by legal contracts. You can drive a car and you can get married. According to the National 
 Children's and Youth Law Centre, `you are now in control of your life'. So why, oh why, is the age of independence for full-time students 25? As Senator Margetts said, my ambit claim was 18. Our preferred option was at least 18. It was a more realistic indication of when young people in Australia are adults. We are going for 21 now. Boy, I want to see what the opposition does on this one.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—You will be seeing very shortly, so you will not be in suspense for very long. This is a very difficult issue for the opposition. Surely you understand that, bearing in mind the comments you have just made. It has generally been accepted that, for those people who are not in study, their legal adulthood commences at 18. But I think it is also true to say—and I suppose all the reports that were cited by Senator Margetts indicated this—that there is a general acceptance within the community that the age of adulthood for someone in full-time study is somewhat older.
—No, that is not what the report said. They were saying 21 or below; that is what all those reports said. You were not listening.
—I did actually listen quite well. The mere fact that a report says the age should be 21 indicates that is a different age—
—Twenty-one or below.
—Maybe when I sit down you can get up again, if you disagree. It makes it very difficult when you are yelling from your seat. There is an accepted community norm which is different from age 18 for students. I do not believe that young people who are spending their time studying are in exactly the same position as young people who have decided to go out and seek full-time employment. Our position in the past has been, and will be when we are in government, that the age of independence should be reduced from what it was left at with the previous coalition government—from 25 to 21. We were in the process of reducing that age of independence to where it should ultimately rest at the time we lost government. The coalition response, once they were elected, was to take it back up to 25. Our 
 proposition is that it should be once again reduced over time to 21. We do not see that the opposition will be doing it in one go, as has been proposed in this amendment.
—Twenty-one or 22?
—It actually stopped at 22 because of the election. If we had remained in government, the objective was to take it down to 21. That was the ultimate aim. An amendment was foreshadowed by Senator Carr which proposed that the age be reduced over time from 25. I understand that is somewhere in the workings still. That is ultimately our position—that we would like to see it reduced from 25—but we cannot see that occurring in one go, as is proposed here.
When you are on the crossbenches and do not have to make some of the really tough decisions as to priority, it is extraordinarily easy just to say, `We will spend it all on this particular amendment.' I assume the figure of $178 million is at least roughly correct. When you have to weigh it up against all sorts of other demands—including services for people who are unemployed, child care, tax benefits for low income earners—there are extraordinarily tight and difficult decisions that have to be made about priorities.
Though the opposition would ultimately like to see the payment for students based on an age of independence of 21, we cannot see that being done instantly. That is why we cannot at this stage support the Democrats request that is before us. I know, in terms of the Democrats pushing all the right political buttons, it is probably very gratifying to them and I am sure that they will make hay while the sun shines.
—Young people vote, too.
—I am very aware of the fact that young people vote, and I am very aware, as a former student, that I relied on income provided by Austudy when I became old enough to be treated as an independent. But, that all being true and being very well aware of how difficult financial circumstances can be for students, it still remains that the priority decision made is that the age of independence should be reduced over time 
 and not instantly. I am sure the Democrats would prefer a simple and instant answer, but in life things are not always instant or easy. This is one of those difficult propositions. There have been many groups in the community—
—Twenty years this debate has been going on. This is not an instant answer.
—And the debate for rent assistance has been 20 years, too, and you got it.
—Maybe I will sit down and allow the government and the crossbenchers to slang at each other.

That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:

In relation to my requests for amendments Nos 4 and 5 for the Australian Greens, I would have preferred the Greens (WA) position of making 18 the year of adulthood for people in all circumstances, including their rights to benefits. I predict that the committee will not vote that way, because the government and Senator Harradine will not support that position.
I will call a spade a spade. It is $560 million all-up that will be taken out of the pockets of young Australians. You can measure a civil society pretty well by the extra effort—and that includes money—that goes to the more disadvantaged people in that society. The success of this piece of legislation is the 
 reverse—you measure it by the amount of money it will take out of the pockets of already disadvantaged people. That is the direction that the government is going in general. It is against a civil society. It is against a society that is moving under the flag of a fair go for everyone.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-09,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(6)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 127 (lines 13 to 26), omit subsection (12), substitute:
People who are disadvantaged
(12)	 A person is independent if the person is at least 16 years old and one or more of the following apply: 

	 (a)	 the person has full-time employment of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 12 months, or for periods that take at least 12 months; or
	 (b)	 the person does not live at the home of either or both of his or her parents; or
	 (c)	 in the Secretary's opinion, the person is specially disadvantaged with respect to education or employment; or
	 (d)	 the person is not receiving adequate financial support that is at least equal to the rate of payment the person would be entitled to if he or she was receiving youth allowance.
Note:	 For  parent  see section 5 (paragraph (a) of that definition).
Request for amendment No. 6 reduces the age for the disadvantaged test from 18 to 16 and makes the definition of independence more flexible so that, instead of having to meet all criteria, applicants would need to meet only one of the very strict criteria. These criteria are so onerous that there will be very few people who will be able to qualify. Our amendments would mean that people who are disadvantaged under one or other of the government's criteria would be able to qualify.
The government has to pull in its belt. In doing so, it is going to take the belt to young people. This legislation is about robbing and cheating young people of not just tens of millions of dollars but hundreds of millions of dollars. As the minister has said, it is to try to encourage young people to go into education, but at the other end governments are cutting funds to education. For example, in TAFE courses 60,000 people last year could not find a place so the increased number is going to be blocked from that avenue.
It will no doubt suit the government to continue to say, as the minister has quite erroneously said, that people who are opposed to what she is doing are in favour of rich people getting an advantage as a part spin-off from the government's legislation. The fact is that this is another effort by the Greens to roll back the disadvantage to disadvantaged young people, to make the disadvantage test less onerous. The government wants to make the disadvantage to disadvantaged young people more onerous, because it wants to take money 
 out of their pocket. It wants to force them to be mendicants on their parents, and it wants to transfer its cost cutting obligations to a more expensive life of disadvantage and therefore a more disadvantaged life for those people in our society who are least able to do anything about it. The numbers will be with the government. Senator Harradine is going to vote for this social disadvantage being increased—for what good reason I do not know. There are no specifics that I have been able to pick up on, but he is going to vote for this enormous impost on young people and the impact it will have on poor families.
The minister says that the difference between the government legislation and reducing the age to 18 alone for students and unemployed people being treated as adults would be some $560 million. This measure would make that figure greater. It is a massive incursion on disadvantaged people in Australia. I do not understand how Senator Harradine can support it, but he does. I do not understand how the government can glibly say this is to the advantage of young Australians because it is not. I put the amendment to the Senate knowing that it has a snowflake's chance in hell of getting through because of the cold face of people on the other side to the disadvantaged people in our society.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—A lot of the comments made by Senator Brown I feel the need to respond to. It may well be your intention to do what you describe, Senator Brown, but the way you have framed your amendment essentially means that anyone who satisfies the requirement of being age 18 is eligible for this payment. We would be happy to do that for the unemployed, as we have stated, but your amendment has the effect of including everyone who is 18—students or the unemployed.

That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(7)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 125 (line 8), omit ""of at least 10 years"".
This request has the effect of deleting the requirement that, for the purpose of being independent, both parents have to be in gaol for a minimum of 10 years. We are of the view that if your parents are in gaol, no matter for what period, that you must be regarded as independent.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—Opposition amendment No. 7 obviously will have the support of the Greens WA because our amendment is effectively the same.

So it looks as though there is very strong support for not requiring people, before their being declared independent, to have their parents in prison for 10 years.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—As Senator Margetts has pointed out, the Democrats have a similar amendment. I found the original part of this bill quite extraordinary. Regardless of whether the sole parent is, or both parents are, in prison for 10 weeks or 10 years, as it is specified in this case, I would think it pretty obvious that during such time they would not necessarily be able to support their children. So I am glad to see that the government has accepted that logic.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—This comes down—and it is a pity that the government has indicated that they will not be supporting this—to the very point that I was making before: that you will have situations where parents, basically, are not able, or refuse, to provide that support base for their adult children; and it is totally outrageous to suggest that somehow or other those people will be left destitute.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—I am waiting to hear from the government as to why this measure that has been moved by Senator Neal has been an absolutely crucial amendment which would not in any circumstances be accepted by the government. I am wondering, first of all, whether Senator Neal could oblige the committee with just rerunning it. It was very short time. There are time constraints, of course, but I would be grateful if she could rerun the argument.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—At present the act provides that, where a person cannot live with their parents because of sexual abuse or violence in the home, they are regarded as being independent. The act is presently moot on the point of a situation where, in fact, the parents themselves do not have a home that they can provide for their children. It can be because of their adverse financial circumstances—although that is probably unlikely because of the level of the means test. Alternatively, it may be that they do not have a permanent address—people living in caravans, travelling around, doing a world tour. Anything of that nature would mean that the parents do not have a home they can provide for their chil 
 dren. In that situation, the opposition believes that those adult children should be treated as independent.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—We do not support the amendment because, in our view, it is too broad. Young people concurrently qualify as independent when there is no parental home and the parents cannot accommodate the young person. For example, there is the situation of a woman who has to move to a refuge; she may not be able to accommodate her teenage son at the refuge. The current provisions would allow for that, and most such situations would be temporary.
If we were to move to broadening this, as suggested by these amendments, parents have a responsibility to provide a home for their children. It is only in unusual circumstances that the independent rate would be paid. A parent's refusal, on the other hand, to have the young person live at home is not enough on its own to qualify. It needs to be assessed in the context of whether extreme family breakdown has occurred. I would draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, if we simply accepted the statement that a young person is not allowed to live at home as evidence of homelessness, we would be inviting collusion between parents and children.
Senator Harradine, you may recall that, under the previous government, there was a lot of scepticism about the way that the homeless criteria were being administered. The member for Braddon, Chris Miles, and I waged a vigorous campaign to ensure that parents were included in the assessment by the social workers in the then Department of Social Security to see whether the young person's claims were true. It may be that in some cases the young person claimed that they were homeless when, in fact, they were not; that there was a family willing and keen to care for them. In some cases, there may well have been irresponsible parents who were prepared to collude with their child because the child was saying that they wanted to leave home and could get the money from the government. I am concerned that, if we 
 are not careful about this measure, we open up these sorts of situations.
As I understand it, the arrangements as they are here in this legislation are the same as are currently for youth training allowance; they are no harsher. What has happened since this government has been in office is that we have had a very careful look at the criteria and the way they are administered. But that is simply to make sure that those who are entitled do get their entitlement, and that those who are not do not abuse the taxpayer. I believe that there was an element of that in the way it was administered previously. I do not see any justification for expanding this and making it broader so that you can have families wrongfully claiming for support when they are perfectly able to provide a home for their child.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I do not know, Minister, whether you are intentionally misstating the effect of our amendment or you really do not understand. Our amendment does not extend to circumstances where parents refuse to have children at home. That is not included in our amendment and it is not envisaged to do so. All it does is cover a situation where the parents themselves do not have a home that their children, adult or under 18, can reside in. To say otherwise, to say it is extended to circumstances where parents might refuse, is not true.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I would not have wanted to mislead the Senate. I guess I was using a suggested response which actually applies to more than one of the amendments in this area. The amendment that is moved by Senator Neal for the opposition in fact does enable payment of the higher rate of youth allowance to young people whose parents do not have a home. Other similar exceptional circumstances include situations where parents are unable to provide a home for the young person because they themselves are homeless or in temporary accommodation because of a major personal crisis. I was referring to that earlier in my response. But extending the qualifications may encourage parents to rearrange their accommodation 
 without fulfilling their primary responsibility to house their children. Parents who choose to move to new premises or interstate are still required and expected to make arrangements for their children to remain or to go with them, not to artificially cause them to be homeless and for the taxpayer to support them in that way. Where the parental home is not conducive to study or job search, for example because the parents have an itinerant lifestyle, the young person may in fact receive the away from home rate of youth allowance. So, Senator, I am sorry if I gave you some information you are not yet ready to receive in relation to Senator Stott-Despoja's subsequent amendment, but I have now given you the government's response focusing on your amendment alone.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I really find it hard to believe that there are large numbers of parents in the community who would intentionally make themselves homeless for the purpose of avoiding the independence test for the youth allowance. It seems a preposterous suggestion. In terms of the example that the minister gave about a parent moving into temporary accommodation in a refuge, that particular circumstance is covered by the bill presently because it relates to circumstances of domestic violence. So essentially what has happened is that the government has covered one possible example of the cause of homelessness, which is domestic violence, but in my view there are many possible causes for homelessness in the parents' circumstances and I think that, whatever the cause of their homelessness, you still cannot expect that a young person will do without support because of that parental situation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Perhaps I could throw a question back to Senator Neal. If parents decided that they wanted to take a year off and take a tour around Australia and they had a young person in their care who fitted these criteria, would you regard it as being responsible of the parents to make no proper arrangements for their young person when they left? I would have thought your answer to that would have been no, but if you 
 want to say yes, you think it is proper, I would be surprised.
—When you sit down, I will answer.
—You're the one doing it to people; now you're blaming the parents.
—Order! Hopefully we can conduct this discussion in an orderly and cordial way.
—Mr Chairman, as you may know, I worked for a state Labor government on child protection for a number of years, so I certainly have a good understanding that some parents in this country are irresponsible; very few, but some are. It does not matter whether we are talking about babies, toddlers, primary school children or older young people, it is not acceptable for parents not to take on their responsibilities to the children they bring into the world. If parents were in fact to take this trip around Australia, which can be a great experience for anybody, we would expect them to make proper provision, whether by way of a family member to act in their place while they are gone or to pay for stable and reasonable accommodation for the young person. I hope you would see that we should not allow this to be broadened to allow similar circumstances to that, to allow people to shrug their shoulders and let the taxpayer provide.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—This bill really is not about making moral judgments about particular parents. You may say it is responsible or not responsible—
—Don't you? It is abandoning your child.
—Or adult, as the case may be.
—That is not the question. Whether we can say the parent has behaved badly or not, the repercussions of that behaviour, even if we make moral judgments about it being wrong, do not rebound on the parent. If you are actually going to collect the money from the parents and then pay it on to the children, I suppose to some extent I could understand your argument. But if you are saying that the parents have done something that you think is morally bad and therefore we 
 should punish the children by leaving them unsupported, I really do not understand the logic in that. If a parent is not providing a home for the children, whether or not you make the moral judgment that that is wrong, I think some people would have dispute with your view that past the age of 18 parents have a moral responsibility to support their children. I do not think that is the accepted view, that once you have children you have to support them until the day they die.
There are some community groups that believe that you have a responsibility to support your parents as well. That is not a view that we have included in our law, although I understand that they have in some countries such as Singapore. I do not think it is universally accepted that, once you have a child, you must support them until whatever age. But putting that argument aside for the moment, I do not believe we can punish the child of one of those parents who has not behaved properly by depriving them of support.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—Just a further question to the minister on that level: I wonder whether we could clarify it by putting in the legislation the example of the working couple who are perhaps close to the age of retirement and who have finally saved up enough to get in their camper van and go around Australia on whatever superannuation might be left to them. Perhaps you could write into the legislation that, if they are renting a house, they will have to take their 20-year-old with them and that would be a really nice way to spend their retirement trip going around Australia in their camper van.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—The amendment is that they are `unable to provide the person with a suitable home because they lack stable accommodation'. If they are homeless and they have their young person with them, then the entitlements do flow. If they set out to deliberately not have stable accommodation, then why should their neighbour be asked to support their child?  
—They are adult.
—They are a financially dependant child while they are on these payments just as they are up to the age of 25 if they are a student. Is it right that parents should be abrogating their responsibility and handing it over to their neighbours without making proper arrangements for the accommodation of their child?

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—This sort of red herring that the minister keeps raising about these irresponsible parents who intentionally become homeless themselves is quite preposterous. Some people's lifestyles quite validly involve moving around—occupations such as fruit picker, people who run shows and construction workers. There is a whole raft of lifestyles that provide some families with incomes all around Australia. We are not all professionals and small businessmen. Some people do have a shifting lifestyle.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—Senator Neal has made a very good point. It is one that I was going to raise. It is something that the minister should have a look at. I do not know how far it goes, but there may be some response. The example that was given by Senator Neal is a very good one. There are quite a number of people who are working casually in a particular industry. Shearers are another example.
—I was waiting for that.
—I thought you might have been, Mr Chairman. One of the purposes of this legislation is to encourage persons to get into work and to retain their work. Here is a situation whereby this might work in the other direction.

 around Australia taking work as he goes and he has his young person with him—
—Him or her!
—Yes, there are some female shearers now, aren't there? If there is no extreme family breakdown, the young person could receive the at home or away if appropriate but subject to the parental means test. The circumstances are that if there is extreme family breakdown then the young person would be deemed to be eligible because of independence criteria. The safety net is there, but the opposition's amendment is just extending the clause too widely.

It just seems to me that you are almost condemning—perhaps I am going too far here—the young people to shift with their parents when those parents are in the type of work such as described by Senator Neal. Or, indeed, it must be somewhere in the legislation that if a parent does have a transfer in a particular job from, say, Hobart to Melbourne, then the students or the unemployed aged 18, 19 and 20 surely do not have to shift. But, by the same token, I think you would need to do something to cater for the group that Senator Neal pointed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—Some of the current limitations in the unreasonable live-at-home provisions have been made clear to this chamber by virtue of the fact that at least three separate sets of amendments, albeit in slight conflict with one another, have been moved to try to value-add or improve this section in some way. I concur with the sentiments of Senators Neal, Margetts and Harradine in the debate so far. Of course, we think the Democrats amendment is the best one. 
Suffice to say, I am prepared to support the amendments moved by the other two parties because it is really important that we improve this section so that it does not simply take into account extreme situations—albeit it should take into account extreme situations in family and home life where it may be deemed unreasonable to live at home—but also some of the slightly unusual circumstances. Some of those have been described. As in this amendment's case, it may be the inability of a family to provide a stable home environment or it may have to do with itinerant work, or what have you. It has been demonstrated quite clearly to this chamber that such consideration should be included in the determination of this particular criteria.
The Democrats amendment is more comprehensive. However, we have all taken into account bits and pieces of not only the current provision but also each other's. I speak very much in favour of all the amendments so far but commend ours when the debate moves on. Minister, I implore you to take into account some of the issues that have been raised in this committee stage.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I hear the sentiments expressed by honourable senators. I emphasise that the government does not believe that people should be able to choose to not be subject to the parental means test. That is our concern in this area.

—They demand flexibility in the workplace.
—That is right. But here we have a situation where people, in order to earn a living, either have chosen a lifestyle or have not had a great deal of choice and follow a lifestyle in order to earn a living. It might be fruit picking or rodeos.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I  am rapturous to see that at least opposition amendment No. 7, which is the same as Democrats amendment No. 8 and Greens (WA) amendment No. 16, was passed. Therefore, it is not necessary for those to be put.
—Senator Stott Despoja, I have a note here which advises that your amendment 9 is in conflict with the amendment that we have just dealt with—amendment 7.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I think you are referring to opposition amendment No. 8, with which it was in conflict. Number 7 was the same as Democrats amendment No. 8. I acknowledge Democrats amendment No. 9 is in conflict with opposition amendment No. 8. I seek advice from the chamber. I recognise it is in conflict, but, as I mentioned, I think it is a good and a more comprehensive amendment. Is there reason why I cannot pursue the Democrats preferred definition of what is unreasonable circumstances for living at home?
—Senator Stott Despoja, the ball is in your court. You certainly can move the amendment and it is really up to the honourable senators to then decide how they are going to vote on it.
—Fair enough. I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(9)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 126 (lines 8 to 25), omit subsection (9), substitute:
Unreasonable to live at home
(9)	 A person is independent if: 

	 (a)	 the person cannot live at the home of either or both of his or her parents:
		 (i)	 because it would be unreasonable to expect the person to do so as there would be a serious risk to his or her physical or mental well-being due to violence, sexual abuse or other similar unreasonable circumstances; or
		 (ii)	 because there is no parental home or homes; or
		 (iii)	 because the parents refuse to provide a home; or
		 (iv)	 because of extreme family breakdown or other similar exceptional circumstances; and
	 (b)	 the person is not receiving adequate and continuous support.
As I said, the amendment substitutes `unreasonable to live at home' with a new definition. This amendment, I believe, is more comprehensive than the Greens (WA) amendment to follow or the amendment just moved by the opposition. We seek to ensure that young people who are genuinely independent of or not supported by their parents are not forced to become or, indeed, to remain homeless. If it is unreasonable that they live in the parental home, and no other support of a continuous nature is available, then they will be eligible for the independent rate and they will not be assessed according to the means of the very people who cannot or will not support them.
We seek to achieve a similar purpose to that of the amendment we have just dealt with and the Greens one to follow but, again, we think that perhaps we have encompassed some of their concerns, whether they relate to the issue of continuity of support or a range of other potential problems that have been taken into account with this amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I must say that I am at a bit of a loss to understand why the Democrats are proceeding with this. Obviously the amendment was constructed in a slightly different way but the end result seems to be much the same. I am a little bit concerned about the effect of having two amendments lumped on top of each other and attacking different parts of the legislation. Unless the Democrats can explain 
 to me what additional advantage we will gain from this I am a bit loath to support it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—As I outlined, what the opposition amendment has done is insert an additional line in relation to being unable to provide a person with a suitable home because they lack stable accommodation. What the Democrats and the Greens have done in consultation with the Welfare Rights Centre and other people is to draft an amendment which takes into account some of the sentiments and the gist of the government proposal—but we think it is more refined and comprehensive.
The reason we are proceeding with this is that we think it is a better amendment and it takes into account a range of other provisions including the lack of parental home or homes and the parental refusal to provide home or homes. We think ours is drafted in a better fashion. It is simply up to you, Senator Neal, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, as to whether you like it. We took on board a number of concerns and drafted this in a way that is different from your amendment; and, with all due respect, it is better.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—The opposition's amendment No. 8 states:
(8)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 126 (line 17), after subparagraph (ii), insert:
	 ; or (iii) 	 are unable to provide the person with a suitable home because they lack stable accommodation;
Certainly, the proposed amendments by the Greens (WA) add something else to that. Our amendment No. 17 largely is covered under what occurred in relation to opposition amendment No. 8 but there are other elements of it in relation to continuous support which have not been addressed in the opposition's amendment.
Senator Stott Despoja's amendment talks about a person not receiving adequate and continuous support. The main difference between that and the Greens (WA) amendment is that we have defined `adequate' as an amount which is equivalent to the maximum rate of youth allowance. That is for when you 
 are at home but your parents are not giving you any money. Just because you are at home does not mean you are going to get any support. Either way, if there were support for Senator Stott Despoja's amendment in relation to that I would think it would be a step forward.
Contrary to the advice we have just been given by Senator Neal, I think only some elements of those amendments are covered by the opposition's amendments and there are some improvements that can be made.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—I am just wondering why Senator Stott Despoja has just lifted the government's (ii) and put it as her (i). I think it is exactly the same, isn't it? It says:
because it would be unreasonable to expect the person to do so as there would be a serious risk to his or her physical or mental well-being due to violence, sexual abuse or other similar unreasonable circumstances;
That is there already. Those other ones taken together with what the committee has just done I see as dealing with the matter.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I acknowledge that as one component of our criteria we have one of the same aspects as the government's. That is because we thought it was an appropriate and good part of the eligibility criteria. We probably could have drafted the amendment around it but because we are substituting that proposed section we included that.
—It was well phrased.
—I think the government would like to hear that it is well phrased too. The difference—this is again a feature of the Greens (WA) amendment—is that, along with that particular provision, we specify, `because there is no parental home or homes; or because the parents refuse to provide a home.' That is my answer to Senator Neal as well. That is a major distinction and one that I would have thought was included in the opposition amendments. That is a fundamental difference and one that we 
 consider, as I am sure you would agree, Mr Temporary Chairman, quite important.
I take on board Senator Margetts's additions in the way that she has measured the level of continuous support against the youth allowance. I think that is an appropriate way to go.
Request not agreed to.
—We now move to Greens (WA) amendments Nos. 17 and 19. Do you intend to move those, Senator Margetts?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I think there is no need to move amendment 17 now because we have at least got an improvement on the issue of parental homes and compulsory movement of 20-year-olds around the country. It would seem quite obvious that there is little  support for getting fair and reasonable support for young people if they are at home. If they are not receiving it, it looks like they are not going to get the support of the government and potentially the opposition. So I will not be moving amendment 19.
—What about 18?
—I assume, Senator Margetts, that that is inclusive of amendment 18?
—Yes. To a certain extent, I think my amendment 18 may not be in conflict with what other people are doing. Amendment 19 related to a person `not receiving adequate and continuous support, whether directly or indirectly and whether financial or otherwise, at an amount which is equivalent to the maximum rate of Youth Allowance'. Amendment 18 was substituting `a person cannot' with `it is unreasonable for the person to'.
I seek leave to move those amendments because I think it is worthwhile putting them to the Senate. It is part of the debate we have had about what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. I think there should be the ability for discretion to be used in this case. When you have to prove that a person cannot, firstly, it can be very intrusive and, secondly, it can be very difficult in a family situation which may already be extremely difficult and also very difficult for people to try to prove. 
 I think unreasonability is better than to have something in legislation which says that the person cannot, because that becomes very difficult to actually prove.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—I do not actually think it is unreasonable. Line (10) starts with the words, `A person is independent'. We are substituting `cannot' with `it is unreasonable for the person to live at the home of either or both of his or her parents'. Then it has the reasons why. I think you should perhaps read it again, Minister. I see now—`unreasonable to live at home'.
—The first element is `because it is unreasonable to live at home'. It is repetitive.
—This is actually a subtitle—`Unreasonable to live at home'. It says, `A person is independent if the person cannot', et cetera.
—`It is unreasonable to live at home'.
—You have got subtitles, such as `Person who is self-supporting'. They are in italics and I am assuming they are a broad description of what is underneath it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Senator, if you want to have that amendment, you have it. We will call it `the Margetts amendment' and all it does is look like poor drafting.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—There is much in this legislation which is more than poor drafting, I would have to say, and this is not a sentence. You cannot read it, `It is unreasonable to live at home because it is unreasonable to live at home'. It is actually in italics, as in, `People who are self-supporting'. The next section does not say, `People who are self-supporting because people who are self-supporting'.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I hate to stop Senator Margetts having the last word but I did want to rise briefly in support of her amendment 19—extending the provision so that not only is the young person receiving adequate and continuous support, but that support is measured against the standard of the youth allowance. That seems entirely reasonable.
We do not think it is a particularly unduly or liberal request, given that it will apply only when the parent has absolved himself or herself of responsibility towards that young person by the previously mentioned conditions—for example, through violence, abuse, refusal of the parents to allow the young person to live in the parental home, et cetera. I think amendment 19 is a good amendment. I hope that the opposition will support it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I have to say I think there are again serious problems with the drafting of 19. In 
 terms of the intended principle, it would be very difficult to assess. But, putting that aside for the moment, in my opinion the amendment as presently worded says that if any parent provides less than the equivalent youth allowance, no matter how little less than the whole youth allowance, the person becomes eligible for the entire independent youth allowance. I do not know whether that is what you intended but it seems to say that.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(10)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 126 (line 31), omit ""20 hours"", substitute ""15 hours"".
We have moved this amendment to the section relating to people who are self-supporting for the purposes of establishing their independence. The change is to (b)—`part-time employment of at least 20 hours per week for at least 2 years since the person last left secondary school'. The Democrat amendment omits `20 hours' and substitutes `15 hours'.
We have moved this amendment in recognition that the criteria for independence in this bill have been made far too stringent. We are also aware of the government's attitude and policy—we have been debating it most of today—towards independence definitions. In fact, on 26 August last year, when asked in question time why the government had changed the definition of an employment placement for the purposes of paying a success fee for new private employment agencies from 20 hours a week to 15 hours a week, oddly enough, and additionally whether the government believed 15 hours a week was a real job, the former minister responded:
. . . the purpose of the employment services reforms is to make you independent, to give you sufficient work that you could at least say, `I am now responsible for myself,' and no longer be dependent. The calculation is that about that level of hours a week is when you will be in that position.
If 15 hours was good enough for the former minister, then why isn't it good enough now? 
 Why not be consistent in this particular legislation? I hope that we are not setting another double standard.
First of all, I would like to ask the government why the government chose the 20-hour figure per week for that two-year period as the criteria for independence. Perhaps this is based on Working Nation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—It might short-circuit things a bit if I indicate that the government is prepared to accept this amendment. It is also prepared to accept the next amendments—11 and 12—from the Democrats and amendment 20 from the Greens (WA).

I indicate that we believe that the Greens (WA) amendment 20 is slightly different from the Australian Democrat amendment 10 but is subsumed into Democrat amendment 11 and the effect is the same. If Senator Stott Despoja puts Democrat amendments 10, 11 and 12, we will be prepared to support all three.
—And withdraw yours.

This relates to changes to the definition of `youth allowance couple' and it includes same sex relationships. Basically a person is classed as independent if they are part of a youth allowance couple. There is no reason why we need to discriminate against same sex couples if they are covered under the normal criteria. There is no reason at all to actually single out a group of people and say, `You've satisfied all the other criteria except that you're a couple of the same sex.'

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Greens (WA) amendments. I understand these amendments amend the use of words `opposite sex partner' to recognise the de facto relationships of same sex couples. These amendments are consistent with the Australian Democrats proposal to have discrimination on the basis of sexuality outlawed—that is, removed from Commonwealth law. We believe it is unreasonable to disenfranchise persons in same sex relationships. Same sex couples are in large numbers in Australia and they contribute, as all other citizens, to taxes, laws, the running of our country, et cetera. They are entitled to the same consideration as couples of the opposite sex.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,—Essentially the whole Social Security Act does not provide for same sex couples.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—Not a good argument, Senator Neal. I can be relied upon to put this kind of amendment for just about every social security bill that comes through which deliberately discriminates against same sex couples. We could have changed half of the Social Security Act by now if we had had some support on this perfectly reasonable and rational proposal. If this means that if there is an opportunity in the future to have a multiple change—and I am not sure how you would actually effect a multiple change; perhaps it is possible—
—A private member's bill.
—And we have seen what has happened to private member's bills on sexuality—so far nothing, but we live in hope. Basically, I think it is perfectly reasonable to point the way where things can go and we all live in hope that the Labor Party, with the Greens and Democrats, will support sensible changes when those finally do come about in an all-inclusive way. Given that any of these social security changes do happen in a totally all-inclusive way, perhaps we might still work bit by bit and point the way. I would very much appreciate working with the 
 Labor Party for any ideas they have about a way that can be done en masse. Next time we come up with that proposal, I will look forward to their support.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-09,"—Given that the question was raised by Senator Neal, I would like to recognise, as I have done once or twice before in this debate and many other times on social security legislation, the potential problematic nature of having anomalies across the act. To that extent, I recognise the argument that Senator Neal has made. But if that is her sole problem with this amendment, I am quite sure, given that we do have other pieces of social security amending legislation coming up in this session, that an amendment could be provided to one of those future bills which ensures that this amendment, which Senator Margetts is putting forward here, does extend consistently across the entire act.
Perhaps Senator Neal would give some indication, if she has some support for the principle of what Senator Margetts is putting here, that she would be willing to support such an amendment and we could remove that whole problem of an anomaly that she is so concerned about at the moment. We could deal with that quickly now to save having to deal with it over an extended period the next time we deal with social security bills.

What we are dealing with here are changes in the definition of `youth allowance couple', so that a marriage-like relationship of 12 months or six months in special circumstances is recognised as a youth allowance couple. The 
 current provision is two years. I believe what we are suggesting is reasonable. If they have been in a marriage-like relationship for more than 12 months, we wonder what they are going to live on for the next year while they are waiting to be declared independent.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—Minister, I actually did not announce that I was withdrawing those amendments. That explains why people were not aware. I apologise for any confusion. I have withdrawn those amendments in favour of the Greens (WA) amendments. We agree with their proposal for a one-year waiting period, as opposed to those arrangements of two years set out in the bill. We will be supporting those amendments because we believe they are a reasonable compromise. I hope they will achieve and receive the support of the Senate.
I note for the record that it is not simple for those in the youth allowance categories to establish a marriage-like relationship, perhaps not as simple as it is for two people to go out and get married. Perhaps that is what the minister was suggesting earlier—that I was suggesting people would go off and get married. I am not. I am just hoping that the government's strict criteria and changed attitude to the independence of young unemployed does not convince young people to enter into such an arrangement out of desperation. Many of us have seen it happen.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Could I just explain, for the sake of the Senate, that this was the bringing together of two payments that had quite different eligibility in this area. We have tried to strike a balance whereby 
 young people on unemployment benefits, for instance, could have a de facto relationship declared from day one, whereas for young people on Austudy it would not have mattered how long they had a de facto relationship; it would not have affected their entitlement. That is why the government has brought it to two years—to try to meet the payments, if you like, halfway.
It was not through any attempt to make it very difficult for young people on the youth allowance. It was trying to bring together two payments and have something that was relatively consistent with somebody who is independent on the grounds of marriage. Two years we thought was a reasonable parallel. I would like to think marriage was going to be a great deal longer than two years.
—Are you accepting this?
—Yes, we will not oppose it, but I was trying to explain why we made it two years.

	 or  (iii)	 is under 21 years old and is an independent young person (see subsection 5(1)); or
			 (iv)	 is at least 21 years old and is living permanently and indefinitely away from the home of either or both of his or her parents;
The opposition is not proceeding with its original amendment No. 9. The new R10, which has been circulated, replaces the original amendment No. 9. The effect of this amendment is to extend the eligibility for rental assistance for two groups. The first group is the under 21 year olds. This is fairly strict criteria and I would not expect it to apply to a large number of people, but I think it is reasonable in the circumstances to allow for it—that is, where a person under 21 has been out of home for 18 weeks and has either been employed or registered as employed for 13 of those 18 weeks. The second category we are including is for those people over the 
 age of 21 years. If they are living permanently away from home then they should be eligible for rental assistance, in our view.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

That is talking about rent assistance being available to all dependent young people who need to live away from home for a variety of reasons, which I just listed. They are also entitled to rent assistance for safety reasons, because of exceptional circumstances in the parental household which pose a risk to the young person's physical or mental wellbeing.
Rent assistance is available to all independent young people who are living away from the parental home and to independent young people with partners and/or children who are living in their parents' home. I do not support the extension of rent assistance to young people who do not need to live away from home. To do so may encourage them to leave home unnecessarily. I believe that rent assistance should be directed to those young people who have no choice about incurring accommodation costs rather than to those who can choose to either live at home or away. For those reasons, the government will not support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I must say that this position the government is taking is really a bit extreme. To restrict it this much for people who are over 21 years old is probably taking it a bit far. I think it is not unreasonable that people over the age of 21 years who are in fact permanently living away from their parents' home should be entitled to rent assistance, and without having to establish that they have a need to. I think it is excessive in the circumstances to insist that adults over the age of 21 remain living with their parents.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—I am just wondering whether the minister could address the point that was just made by Senator Neal. Say, for example, 
 there are mates of a young person who want to have another person in a flat in order to share the costs and it is nearer to the university than the home of the parents. What about that situation? Isn't that reasonable if there has been an agreement reached between the parents and the young man or woman? Does this legislation cater for that situation? Will this amendment go to that problem? It is not a problem but something that I would have thought happens quite frequently.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Certainly, under this amendment anyone over 21 living away from their parents is covered. So anyone in the example you gave would be covered by this provision. Under the present provisions people in that situation would not be entitled to rent assistance, in my view—unless the minister has a different view.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—The example that Senator Harradine gave would depend very much on whether the young person had to go away from home to study or whether it was simply a choice to move down to the next suburb to rent. If they had to go away to study then, of course, rent assistance would be applicable. If it was purely a question of personal choice then there is no reason why they are compelled to live at home but it would not be up to the taxpayer to support that choice. They would be seen to have an alternative to live at home. That is very much a question for families to decide rather than governments. The role of government is to decide that where there is a disadvantage to young people, for instance, from living a long way from their educational centre, then that is when rent assistance should be applicable, and it is under the legislation that we have.
If the young people are involved in a variety of activities, as I said earlier, if they are dependent and need to live away from their parents' home for education or training or because they are searching for employment or engaging in an activity that prepares them for employment, like voluntary work, then they would be eligible for rent assistance. If dependent young people had to live away from home for safety reasons because of 
 exceptionable circumstances in the parental household which posed a risk to the young person's physical and mental wellbeing then rent assistance would be applicable. It would also be applicable to independent young people living away from the parental home and to independent young people with partners or children who are living in their parents' home. For example, if a young, newly married couple with a child choose to live in the grandparents' home because it assists with child care, et cetera and reduces their living costs while one of the young parents is a student then they would be eligible for rent assistance.
We have tried to cover all the areas where one could reasonably justify the payment of the taxpayers' dollar. But if people are choosing voluntarily to incur rentals that they do not need to for study or for job search then that is something that needs to be financed by the young person themselves or by their family, not by the taxpayer. Certainly this amendment would open the door very widely to increased costs for taxpayers. It would circumvent the whole purpose of rent assistance, which is to be very much targeted to people who have a special eligibility for getting it. As it is, that is something like 88,000 young people, which is a very reasonable coverage compared with the present availability of rent assistance, which is only to those who are unemployed. The government has expanded the coverage of rent assistance so widely that to expand it any more widely would be financially irresponsible of the Senate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I will not be proceeding with the next amendment but the reason I raised it initially was out of curiosity. So instead of moving my amendment I ask the minister how the government can, on the one hand, refuse to recognise de facto relationships—initially, until we change the amendment—until they are more than two years standing while, on the other hand, penalise young people living in what the secretary determines as a marriage-like relationship with either or both the young people being below the age of consent? That is, having made that determination, how can the government then establish that those young persons' youth allowance rate shall be reduced to a level which would be payable if they were considered to have satisfied the youth allowance de facto relationship criteria? We thought it was rather strange that their youth allowance rate could be cut in some way.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—The advice that I have received on Senator Stott Despoja's proposed request for amendment, which I understand she is now not proceeding with, is as follows: the request for amendment proposed by Senator Stott Despoja would remove a provision which has operated in the Social Security Act and for youth training allowance for some time.
The intention of the provision is to ensure that young people living in an illegal relationship, because they are under age, do not 
 benefit from the situation. It has been standard procedure to limit the rate for people in this situation to the rate they would receive if their relationship were legal. If the provisions were removed, young people living in a relationship which is not legally condoned would receive the higher single rate of payment and would not be subject to the partner income test—that is, they would be better off than young people in legal relationships. That is why the request for amendment is not acceptable to the government.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—As a matter of curiosity, the relationship itself is not illegal; it is only if their relationship involves sexual activities taking place. Isn't that correct?
—Under age.
—It is not actually illegal to be in a marriage-like relationship as long as you are not involved in sexual activities.
—Get real!
—The law is that you do not necessarily have to have a sexual element in your relationship to be `marriage-like'.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

Further requests for amendments to be moved by the Democrats and the opposition will seek to remove additional references to the means test. I think some of these arguments were canvassed in second reading debates. It is on record what a debacle the operation of the means test has been as it applies under the Austudy regulations.

At present, the rent assistance threshold rate, that is, the amount a person would have to pay in rent before receiving any rent assistance, is set at 21 per cent for most social security payments. However, as an anomaly, to make it more complex for the bureaucrats—and, of course, we do not want to do that—it is set for 27 per cent for the youth allowance. That means a person who is on youth allowance has to pay more before they are eligible for rent assistance. This request for amendment makes the youth allowance threshold 21 per cent. That actually makes it consistent with social security payments.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

In general, these young people are paying less than 30 per cent of their incomes in rent. This bill will improve housing affordability for young people and provide them with more choices in terms of type and location of accommodation.
I know that it may stick in the throats of some of the minor parties, but one of the major benefits of this legislation is that so many students—70,000—are expected to benefit by up to a maximum of $37.40 a week by gaining access to rent assistance for the first time. Around 350 young unemployed people aged 16 and 17 years will benefit by up to an average of $18 a week because of access to rent assistance. Those are important measures which should not be dismissed lightly.

They may be forced into more affordable housing, but I have not actually seen ads which say, `If you are under 24, you will get this housing at a cheaper rate.' In fact, I have not seen that at all. I am suggesting that it is reasonable for those either on social security or youth allowance to have the same threshold.

This request relates to rent assistance. I want to make the point to the Minister for Social 
 Security that we are not upset about the idea of rent assistance being extended to students. We have commended it at every opportunity, but we have pointed out certain ironies along the way, including the fact that last year this government made a number of cuts to rent assistance entitlements, including the cut in relation to people living in shared accommodation—a cut by one-third. This is something which this particular amendment seeks to redress in relation to the rate of rent assistance specifically for single people in shared accommodation.
I understand that the Greens (WA) will be moving a similar request. I will not hold up the debate, but I was curious to hear the minister's comments earlier about what was defined as reasonable rental costs for a young person on common youth allowance. Is it that the government is defining as reasonable the amount of rent assistance that is provided for accommodation? We strongly opposed at the time the cuts to rent assistance. We maintain that opposition. We seek to redress, by way of the request before the chamber, the cuts that have been made to rent assistance entitlements.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—This is another double whammy for young people. As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out, Democrats request 23 is the same as Greens (WA) request 28. What we are seeking to do is remove the provision that those in shared housing receive only two-thirds of the maximum rent assistance otherwise payable. This impacts specifically on students.
We believe there is a problem in that the two-third rate for sharers is already affecting those on Newstart and other dole payments. The Greens (WA) spoke up strongly at the time because of the fact that we were aware that the only way for many people to survive was to share the same accommodation. That was the reality for many people struggling to survive in society. The government is trying to ensure that people have to live on their own in order to get full rent assistance. It is saying that students living in shared accommodation will receive only two-thirds of the maximum rent assistance otherwise payable.

—Let me finish; you might be happy. This is a circumstance where I am prepared to take that step, bearing in mind there may be some difficulties with consistency, particularly because young people—whether they be students or unemployed—are probably the largest single group of people who share accommodation.
I remember when this particular item went through for everybody. It did not seem entirely logical because you are restricted in your access to rental assistance by the fact that you have to be spending a minimum on rent before you can even access it. That already cuts out a vast majority of young people. I cannot see why they should be cut out just because they are sharing. It could impact quite severely on the group of people covered by the youth allowance. Because this particular group will be more affected than anyone else, I think this anomaly is justified.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—Let me make it perfectly clear: the government is not prepared to accept a change to the rent assistance measure which went through the parliament just over a year ago. It is a very fair and equitable measure when you look at the comparison between how couples getting rent assistance are placed even by comparison now with the sharers. Two single people sharing are still substantially better off in terms of the rent assistance that is coming into that household compared with a couple. It was entirely out of kilter before.
You are adding complexity to the system. That is exactly what you are doing in a huge way. You are also adding substantially to the revenue implications. After the long debate that we had in this place a year or so ago, I 
 find it extraordinary that you would be prepared to take this step. There is no way that the government would be prepared to accept this. I find it amazing that you would try to overturn something which is established. As you said, the measure that was introduced goes very much to young people sharing, and there are a whole lot of reasons for them taking this preferred option.
The revenue implications would be substantial. I do not think I have them here tonight, but I make it very clear that we would not be prepared to add to the cost of the youth allowance package, which involves spending over several years, by opening up this door and changing the rent assistance sharers rate that you are proposing.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—We were opposed to this move when it first came in a year ago. We argued strongly against it. I remember you putting exactly the same argument then as you do now, which is somehow that there is a comparison between couples sharing and single people sharing. The obvious difference I would have thought the minister would be aware of is that generally couples share a room and they have to pay only for that one room. People who are single do not share the same room generally, unless they are in particularly desperate circumstances. As such, they have to pay for accommodation that provides additional rooms for each person. To say that they are the same circumstances is completely untrue.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—Just briefly, I take issue with the minister's claim that this somehow makes this more complex. I accept the minister's claim that this adds expense; of course it does. But it does not necessarily make it more complex. Indeed, we believe that it makes it more fair, and we did oppose this. Just because it has been mandated or legislated, or whatever you might say, by the parliament previously does not mean we thought it was necessarily a good decision by this place. Indeed, the Democrats and others were outraged by the cuts to rent assistance occurring at the same time the government insisted on boasting about its budget measures 
 and the proposed introduction of a common youth allowance, which did extend rent assistance.
I just find it extraordinary and quite hypocritical, on the one hand, to be boasting about extensions in rent assistance and, on the other hand, to be cutting back on the amount available to certain groups—and groups that, I might suggest, are often in the least position to get quality and affordable, and perhaps convenient, housing. Once again, I think we are just hitting hardest at those least able to afford it. So I see this, as the bill currently stands, as quite a retrograde provision. I seek in these requests to make it fairer in terms of the amount available to those people in shared accommodation.

1067G-F22A 	 For the purposes of this Module, the  relevant AWOTE  means the amount that, under the heading ""Trends and Estimates"" in the document entitled ""Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia"", published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in January in the year of income, is specified as being the full time ordinary earnings for Australia for the quarter to which the document relates.
These requests relate to the parental income-free area for the purposes of this section. The Democrats seek to change the amount specified of $23,400 in terms of the income testing arrangements by inserting the relevant AWOTE—that is, average weekly ordinary times earning. We think this is a fairer definition. I understand that the Greens (WA) have a comparable request for amendment.
As I say, we think this is one way of perhaps alleviating the harshness of one of the 
 measures in this bill, and that is income test arrangements that kick in at an unusually—and I think unfair—early period. So this is an attempt to perhaps raise that threshold in some way. Also I think it is not only economically but legislatively quite fair and appropriate that it is matched with the relevant average weekly ordinary times earning.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-09,"—As Senator Stott Despoja has indicated, in terms of the actual starting amount the Greens (WA) amendment seeks to achieve the same effect as the Democrats' amendment. The Democrats' amendment is linked to the average weekly ordinary time earnings index, which we believe makes it preferable to our amendment, which deals with a figure of $36,000. The current level is such that, even if only one parent is in employment, nearly 90 per cent of full-time adult workers are earning too much for their children to receive the full benefit. So, in some ways, it makes a bit of a farce of averages.
Given that it is commonplace for both parents to be in paid employment, the test should reflect this fact. We could be talking about one partner who is on the wages of an unskilled labourer—let us just say $25,000—and the other one may be engaged in casual cleaning; and they could very easily get up to $36,000. We are not talking about rich people. The test should not adversely affect families in low to middle socioeconomic classes. They are exactly the people the government should be targeting in terms of higher education.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I would just indicate that the opposition has a similar amendment, although I suppose it is a bit more restrictive in that it applies only to the means test applied to parents of unemployed young people rather than students. I would indicate that we will be supporting this amendment, and we will persist with ours only if this amendment fails.
Essentially, we believe that the means test commencing at $23,400 is too low. Certainly I do not believe that a family on such an income would have sufficient left over to support what is essentially another adult. This would mean that you are expected to support 
 three adults on an income of $23,400. I think that is far too strict. Also, I think the average weekly earnings—or the AWOTE, as they now call it—is probably a more appropriate level at which the payment should start cutting out.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I can understand that Senator Margetts and Senator Stott Despoja might like to play around with this. But I find it breathtaking in the extreme to discover that Senator Neal—whose government was perfectly content with a threshold of $23,400 for families with two, three, et cetera, students—somehow finds it difficult to accept when it also applies to those same children during a period of their unemployment—
—They are not children.
—They are children in the sense that they are financially dependent upon their parents. I am happy to say `young people' if you would like me to. But the reality is that your government considered $23,400 a perfectly reasonable threshold for the purposes of Austudy. Now that is translated for the purposes of youth allowance, which means for students and for the young unemployed—and sometimes they will be one and the same person, and sometimes they will be separate.
I find it incredible that the opposition would somehow find $23,400 all of a sudden to be an unacceptable threshold level. You know as well as I do that this means test for youth allowance is in fact slightly more generous than the one that you have had all this time for Austudy. So I find it just beyond belief, Senator. It is more to be expected perhaps from people who have not been in government and are not likely to be in government, where the cost of their promises does not count. But I warn you that you will be held accountable for the cost of amendments that you make of this type.
Let me just make it clear the sorts of thing we are talking about. To increase the parental income threshold to either the level suggested by Senator Margetts, $36,000, or to the level suggested by Senator Stott-Despoja, $34,000 or $37,000, depending on which AWOTE is 
 used, would add over $100 million per annum to the cost of the program. If you are authorised to go out endorsing that sort of expenditure, we will be asking Mr Beazley next where the money is coming from.
This measure would not assist families most in need, that is, those with incomes below $23,400, because they are already completely provided for. You are trying to protect families with income in excess of $76,000 a year and allow them to a receive some assistance if they have two children living away from home. The current youth allowance parental income threshold applies also to Austudy and to the above minimum family allowance, and it seems strange that in all those years in government you found it was perfectly acceptable. Let me tell you that if you limited it simply to the unemployed, as you were talking about, I understand from the briefing note I have got here that it would be $30 million of expenditure purely for the unemployed, and it would be $70 million for students. I urge you to give serious consideration—
—Can you repeat those figures, please?
—Certainly. The extra expenditure from either of these two measures proposed by Senator Margetts and Senator Stott-Despoja would be in the order of $30 million of extra expenditure for the unemployed and $70 million for students.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

I will not say none, but I would say to you that that is the advice I have received, that, where theoretically, on paper, it will cut in at $23,400, because of the additional money that comes into that family's hands for some of these complementary measures in this package, that is where it would really start to reduce on the basis of one dollar for every four dollars.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1

These requests were foreshadowed in the previous debate. They request that the means test for the parents of unemployed young 
 people should be raised from $23,400 to average weekly earnings, which is presently $36,000 but obviously that figure will vary. These requests attempt to soften and to apply more fairly the means test for what the government has been describing as `unemployed children'—but, in fact, being over the age of 18 years they are unemployed adults. I understand that the children of adults are always `the children of' but, in common usage, the term `children' is not normally defined as a person over the age of 18 years.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(26)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 159 (line 20) to page 160 (line 22), omit Module G.
My understanding from the reading of my amendment is that it is not inconsistent with what has just taken place. My amendment seeks to omit module G in relation to the family actual means test. I will proceed with that amendment. I will not engage in debate if that facilitates progress.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-09,"—I state here that I will be supporting Democrats amendment 26. It has the same effect as Senator Margetts's amendment.
Request not agreed to.
—On behalf of Senator Margetts, I will move her amendment.
—Senator Brown, just to save you some time, I have been advised that it is an identical amendment. It has been disposed of and you cannot move it again.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-03-09,"—At this point, may I ask a question of the minister about the amendments that we have just dealt with because it has a bearing on where we are going?
—You can certainly ask the minister a question.
—Senator Neal might also answer this. On the running sheet, it says the opposition amendment which was agreed to was to omit module G.
—No.
—Was that withdrawn?
—Senator Brown, opposition amendment No. 11 that you are referring to was not moved, on the basis of an agreement that was reached between the government and the opposition. Senator Stott Despoja decided then to proceed with her amendment, which was lost. Democrats amendment No. 26 and Greens (WA) amendment No. 30 are identical. The reason I said to you that you cannot move it is for that reason.
—Chair, your understanding is exactly the same as mine. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—I am not proceeding with an amendment; I am actually asking in the committee stage for clarification from the minister, or indeed from Senator Neal. I want to clarify the intent of what you have organised in terms of the module. You are actually seeking to have it—
Senator Neal interjecting—
—You do not want me to ask that question? Perhaps I could ask the minister, then. My understanding is that you have just arranged for this amendment in relation to module G to be dealt with in a different way—essentially, it is the module that provides for the actual means test. So you are not objecting, as such, to the 
 actual means test and its operation in the context of the common youth allowance? So you are not objecting to the application of the AMT to the CYA; you would just prefer the module to be somewhere else?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—We did object and, as you might recall, we actually moved amendments to it. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful. Putting that aside, we think it is preferable to have it incorporated in the act rather than to have it separate so that people are aware of what is contained and there can be some certainty. It is not our preferred position but it deals with some problems that we see in the present act.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—Thank you for that explanation. With all due respect, I make the point that the amendments we have just dealt with would have had a similar effect to those amendments we dealt with previously; that is, in relation to deleting references to the actual means test. May I suggest, and I am not sure whether this procedurally is unfounded, that had my amendment, which was identical to the Greens (WA) amendment, succeeded in relation to deleting references to the actual means test, we would have taken on board consequential amendments that would have done the same thing in the relevant and other sections of this bill.
I do not accept, as an excuse, the fact that the amendment previously was not supported by the opposition because the amendments that we dealt with earlier in the committee stage in relation to AMT were not successful. I am sure that had mine been successful we could have gone back and fixed up the rest. I just wanted to get on record who was and who was not supporting the actual means test.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-03-09,"—I think Senator Stott Despoja sees something nasty in the wood pile—there is not. Could I just go through the items now and see whether Senator Neal nods her head that she is in agreement with what I am saying, because this is the true source of events. Module G stays in the legislation because it empowers us to use an actual means test. Very soon, as 
 soon as we possibly can, we will be tabling regulations in the Senate to implement that. Then, as soon as practicable, we will incorporate the regulations into the legislation. Did you understand that—and, in spite of all that, you said all that?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-09,"—No, I understand that. I was interested in getting on record the rationale for the opposition's agreement and decision to withdraw their amendment. No, I understand what is happening. We just have a different philosophical position on the actual means test and whether or not it should stay, regardless of where it should stay, in the legislation. I was just trying to clarify what the opposition had actually achieved through their amendment. We disagree with the actual means test. That is the point I am making, Senator Neal, and you guys obviously do not do so.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-09,"—It is not our position. We have attempted to deal with the matters relating to the means test on separate occasions. There are three or four different amendments that have dealt with that issue. This is a different aspect of it. Whatever the means test is, or is not—and we have debated that already—we think it should be in the act so people are aware of it. It is quite a separate issue. To try to say that because we want it to be contained in the act we support it as it now stands is really unfair and dishonest; and I really wish you would stop saying it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-03-09,"—As I understand it, this matter can be the subject of debate when the consequential legislation comes forward.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments: 

(1)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 149 (line 12), after ""1067G-E18"", insert ""1067G-E18A"".
(2)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 149 (line 18), after ""business"", insert ""which includes the provision of professional services"".
(3)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 149 (after line 27), after point 1067G-E18, insert:
Interest in business assets when business includes carrying on of primary production.
1067-E18A Subject to point 1067G-E19, 100% of the value of a person's interest in the assets of a business which includes the carrying on of primary production is disregarded if the person, or his or her partner, is wholly or mainly engaged in the business and the business:
	 (a)	 is owned by the person; or
	 (b)	 is carried on by a partnership of which the person is a member; or
	 (c)	 is carried on by a company of which the person is a member; or
	 (d)	 is carried on by the trustee of a trust in which the person is a beneficiary.
This is not the first occasion that I have moved these amendments. I was saying that, in fact, these are amendments that I have moved before on many occasions, including when the current position of seating in the chamber was the reverse to what it is now. In fact, on a number of occasions over the years colleagues of mine have moved similar amendments. They are amendments which attempt to help farm families. Senators will know that the current government are friends of farmers and so, no doubt, now that they are in government rather than in opposition, they will be prepared to look very kindly on this amendment which was defeated on a number of occasions over the years when there was a different government in the Senate.
It is to do with Austudy, particularly the assets test for farming families. Senators will know that, as the proposed youth allowance replaces Austudy for students under 25 years of age, this again brings into the debate the issue that under the Austudy assets test farmers can discount the value of their farms by 50 per cent. That is already in place. I note that under the new arrangements this 50 per cent discount is to be retained. I must say that I was really quite amazed at that. If my amendments 1, 2 and 3 are not passed then in amendment No.4 I will be happy to remind 
 the government of their promise during the last election.	However, I am trying to achieve a little bit more than the government promised. I am actually trying to achieve what they agreed to prior to the election, when they were in opposition.
I refer the committee to a report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee dated March 1995. It was a report on an inquiry into the impact of assets tests on farming families access to social security and Austudy. It was quite an extensive inquiry. It was held over eight months and it received 250 very substantial submissions. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy gave evidence that about 5,400 students from farming families were being denied Austudy because of the assets test. Just to remind the Senate, the problem is that many farms have a book value which is quite high but, certainly over recent years, those same farms have had negative or very low incomes.
Yet despite the fact that there have been farmers who for years have been struggling even to put food on the table, their children have not been able to access Austudy in order to continue their education because the assets test—the book value of the farm—has ruled them out. The phrase that is used so often is that they are asset rich and income poor. The report states:
The Committee, however, considers that the assets test applied to farming families in order to determine eligibility for AUSTUDY, is an inappropriate policy instrument that does not take into account the nature of farm assets and their relationship with income.
The majority recommendation of the committee was that farm assets should be excluded from the Austudy assets test. This recommendation was signed by the Chairman, Senator Brownhill, and also by Senators Calvert, Crane, Troeth and me.
The amendments that I am moving tonight will implement that recommendation of the committee report, that is, to exempt the farm assets from the Austudy assets test. I have moved them in confidence that the government will agree to them, as there was such strong support from those particular members 
 of the government, when they were in opposition, for the report of the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. At least on this matter the Labor Party has been consistent in that they did not agree with that report. I presume they still do not agree.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-03-09,"—Defence support is now one of the four major industries of the Northern Territory. At a time of increasing political instability, it is salutary to focus on our defence assets in northern Australia. The Army Presence in the North project, the APIN project, stems from the 1987 defence white paper, Defence of Australia , and commenced in 1992 with the relocation of an armoured reconnaissance regiment to Darwin. It is a task of national importance and will significantly change the thrust of Australia's defence, particularly with the emphasis and priority given in recent years by the Howard government and the ministers Ian McLachlan and Bronwyn Bishop.
APIN involves the relocation to Darwin of approximately 2,300 personnel, 200 armoured fighting vehicles, including Leopard tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles and M113 armoured personnel carriers and 500 support vehicles. A total of $850 million is to be spent on infrastructure development and relocation activities over the 10-year period from 1992. By the year 2001, Australian Defence Force numbers in the Northern Territory will stand at over 4,400. The total Defence Force `family', including dependants, will number well in excess of 10,000 people.
In addition to APIN, there are many other exciting defence related activities taking place in the Northern Territory that will have a significant beneficial impact on the local economy and population, which I will get to shortly. Major focuses for APIN in 1998 
 include the completion of APIN stage 1, which is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 1998. This will see capital works costing $198 million finished, with most of the work completed at Robertson Barracks. APIN stage 1 includes new or additional facilities being built for the following units: Headquarters 1st Brigade, 1st Armoured Regiment of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, 104th Signal Squadron of the Royal Australian Signals, the 161st Reconnaissance Squadron, Headquarters Army Support Unit Darwin and the 7th Training Group. There will be some additional facilities for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.
There will also be the important opening in May 1998 of a 70-place defence child-care facility at Fairway Waters, a suburb of Palmerston, greatly expanding child-care places available to all Palmerston residents. Palmerston is now the fastest growing town in Australia. It is adjacent to Robertson Barracks and is a satellite city in its own right of Darwin.
APIN stage 2, which will cost $268 million, is proceeding and expected to take until the year 2000 or 2001 to complete. In 1998 there will be the biggest single move north under APIN. The 5th/7th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment of the 1st Brigade, will be relocated from Sydney to Darwin. As the mechanised infantry battalion of the 1st Brigade, 5/7 RAR is a key component and is the largest unit in the brigade. It has a current strength of 518 soldiers and is not expected to exceed 540 this year.
Due to the fact that 5/7 RAR is a combat unit, it is an all male organisation and currently comprises 326 single soldiers and 192 married members. Approximately 675 dependants will be moving to Darwin with the soldiers of the 5/7 RAR. This important link and relocation is very important because Territorians have embraced this integration of defence families into the social infrastructure of the community, and the extra residents and expenditure they generate underpin programs in housing, health, education and recreation. I know and can say confidently that Territorians openly welcome ADF personnel and their families into the community. Additionally, the 
 capital works program spending of $143 million this year is very much alive. Additionally, we have the participation of personnel in defence exercises.
Based on these figures, a total of almost 1,200 people will be moving to Darwin and Palmerston in late 1998 and early 1999. Defence has worked very hard to ensure that the move will go as smoothly as possible and that integration takes place carefully. With the experience to draw on the move north of the 1st Armoured Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, Defence do not anticipate any problems and there is excellent cooperation with the Northern Territory Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry, in particular their Defence and Space Industries Group.
The Australian Defence Force will also ensure, through a community integration committee, that people will assimilate well into the community. It is a credit to the Northern Territory government that it is the first state government to create a ministry of defence support, and I note it is held by the Chief Minister. The Defence Force realises the importance of a soldier's family settling in and is taking great lengths to make sure this happens in the Top End.
In 1998 infrastructure developments will be extended and relate to fields such as the Bradshaw Field Training Area. Fifty-four million dollars has been approved to develop Bradshaw, an 8,710 square kilometre property 600 kilometres south-west of Darwin, into a live fire and manoeuvring area to be used primarily by 1st Brigade. Approximately $14 million will be spent in 1998 on Bradshaw, with the remainder being spent through to the year 2000.
At RAAF Darwin expenditure of $10 million this financial year will take place. This will see work continue on the $60 million development of operational facilities that include the provision of ordnance loading aprons for 10 FA18 or F111 aircraft, an operational and technical support facility, a base command post, additional fuel storage, a rescue and firefighting facility, and associated civil works and engineering services.
At RAAF Tindal, whose personnel did such an excellent job recently in the Katherine flood disaster, work on stage 4 of development will proceed. About $13.5 million will be spent this year out of a budget of $31 million for the whole of stage 4. This will see the completion of facilities much like those described for RAAF Base Darwin with additional deployment accommodation and apron extensions. In Alice Springs a tremendous amount of work is being carried on for infrastructure development associated with the joint defence facility of Pine Gap. Total defence capital works spending in the Territory for 1997-98 is $143 million, an increase of $37 million over 1996-97 and a significant part of the annual defence expenditure of $385 million for the 1997-98 financial year.
The Defence Force's annual program of exercises will also take place, and personnel from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Singapore and Indonesia will participate in Australian Defence Force exercises in the Northern Territory. It is estimated that some 5,500 personnel will take part in exercises in 1998 and approximately half will be ADF personnel not normally based in the Northern Territory—a complementary exercise to Northern Territory tourism. This is another boost of tens of millions of dollars into the Northern Territory economy.
In 1999, Exercise Crocodile 99, a replacement for the Kangaroo exercises, will take place in the Territory. Planning has commenced for this very significant operation.
There is also significant economic benefit for Darwin and the rest of the Territory derived from visiting warships. Already this year six large vessels have stopped over in Darwin. These have included USS Peleliu, USS Juneau, USS Blue Ridge, USS Fife, USS Port Royal and USS Curtis Wilbur. They carried in total over 5,300 sailors, and the length of their stays varied from a couple of days to a week. At a very conservative estimate, these visits have injected $5 million into the Northern Territory economy.
I believe the importance of defence to the Northern Territory cannot be overstated. I have described many examples in 1998 alone which will result in massive injections of cash 
 and capital works into the Territory economy. There is also the fact that ADF personnel are now an integral part of the Territory's communities. I think it could safely be said that in past years many defence personnel based in the Territory left their hearts down south and returned to what they viewed as home after their stint in the north was finished. I do not believe this is now the case.
The extension of time of people living in the north will be a credit to both the Defence Force and the Territory community. The majority of ADF personnel based in the Territory are there for the long term, and I believe they will view the Territory always as home. Their unstinting and selfless service in the Katherine flood disaster shows just how much a part of the community the ADF have become.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Adjournment,19,1
