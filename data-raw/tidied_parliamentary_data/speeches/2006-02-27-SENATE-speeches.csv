"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-02-27,"—The point here is that, presumably, this is becoming a part of a non-temporary order that is being extended by the government. I think that the Senate ought to look at that to determine whether it does become permanent or whether we revert to the standing orders as they are. Otherwise, we will be repeating this motion more down the line. That is just a request to the minister to have a look at it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-27,"—Briefly, I concur with those comments. Also, it is worth noting and reminding those who have forgotten the effort of the former Leader of the Government in the Senate last year to use the existence of this sessional order to bring in a motion without notice at 4.29 on a Thursday afternoon. It would be nice to at least have an assurance that that type of behaviour is not going to be repeated if we are going to be agreeing to these sorts of motions.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-02-27,"—While everyone is contributing to this, I think this is a matter that can be referred to the Procedure Committee, for them to consider it. It was a sessional order that came from there. Those matters are usually dealt with there. We can certainly look to see how we can it get back to the Procedure Committee so they can give it some consideration.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—Just to remind the chamber where we are up to, when we finished debating the amendments on the last occasion, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, had just responded to amendment (1) that I was putting forward. The amendment was to accept, in principle, a national energy efficiency target and to move that the Senate set up a task force to work out how that target would be implemented. The amendment also requires companies to do as the government asks—that is, to do an audit of the energy efficiency opportunities that may be available to them—but my amendment goes further and requires companies to implement that target. Also, it would require them to have a payback period.
As it currently stands on the sheet circulated by the Chairman, we are dealing with my amendment (1) on sheet 4784 revised. I ask senators to be aware that we are looking at the revised sheet. I ask leave to also incorporate amendment (2) in this body of amendments. So, when we vote on this tranche of amendments, it would include amendments (1) and (2) and (5) to (7), as they all go together.
Leave granted.
—I move Australian Greens amendment (2) on sheet 4784 revised:
(2)    Clause 4, page 2 (after line 8), after the definition of monitoring warrant, insert:

payback period means the period of time it takes to recoup the cost of the initial capital outlay of an energy saving project.
I add this amendment to the amendments I mentioned before. I would like to speak to them now and respond to Senator Ian Campbell. Senator Campbell said, in his rejection of my proposed amendments, that there is a moral imperative to see strong economic growth continue. He implied that, by requiring companies to implement the findings of their energy efficiency audits, somehow that would not be good for economic growth. Once companies have identified the energy efficiency savings, my amendment says that they must implement those measures if they can get a payback on those measures within two years. It is not going to impact on economic growth because if the company gets the audit and it says, ‘You could take this measure, but in fact you wouldn’t get a payback on that for 10 years,’ my amendment would not come into play. My amendment is saying, ‘Let’s force them to implement the audit findings.’ In the first stages, between 2006-07 and 2007-08, we would say to them, ‘If you can pay it back and if you’re going to get benefits within two years, do it,’ and then it would gradually extend it to a four-year payback by 2010-11 and 2011-12. That way you gradually increase the pressure on companies to implement the findings.
I do not accept the minister’s statement that an interventionist approach such as this would have larger costs to industry, because he also went on to say later that in fact the idea of this is that companies would identify the savings and, once they have seen the savings as a result of their audit, naturally they would implement them. That is where my difference with the government is in regard to this. There has been no evidence to date to show that companies, when they have looked at what they could do in a voluntary capacity, would actually go ahead and do it if they have other short-term imperatives—for example, expansion and other things that the company’s strategic plan might have in place. This is not asking them to lose money. All this is doing is requiring them to prioritise energy efficiency over other strategic objectives that they may have in their company’s forward planning process. What the Greens are proposing will in no way undermine the bottom line.
The other thing that it will do is give a level playing field to the companies who want to do the right thing. At the moment, the government’s bill applies to the 250 largest energy users in Australia. What if they all do their audit as required by the government and they all see before them a number of initiatives that they could take which will cost them some capital in the short term? If those companies that want to do the right thing take those measures in the first three or four years, there will be a capital up-front cost. Then there will be the laggards who have no intention whatsoever of taking on those up-front costs. So the progressive companies will have a barrier to doing the right thing because they will be constantly held back by those who have no intention of doing the right thing. If you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia and reduce the amount of energy that companies use, you have to allow the good, progressive companies to take the action they need to take without then being at a disadvantage on a non-level playing field.
This just goes to pure, simple, sensible economic management. I have talked to a lot of people in the private sector. What they have said is that they do not mind government regulation but they do not like being told how they have to do it. I am proposing that the government’s measure with my amendments would do exactly that. It would set a regulatory framework that would require them to do an audit and tell them they must implement the audit. But, as to how they do that, the measures they take are the measures they identify for themselves. I do not see a downside in the amendments I am proposing. Furthermore, I am proposing a strategic plan of identifying a national energy efficiency target for the long term. I am not suggesting how that target would be developed or how it would be implemented. What I am proposing is that the government moves to set up a task force which, within the next 18 months, would report and work out how to actually do that, as indeed has occurred in many European countries.
Finally, the government makes the statement that the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill will apply to the 250 largest companies and it will have a good outcome because it will reduce energy use. That is the leap of faith that the government makes. I would like the government to identify what its performance objective is and where the accountability is in this bill. I am proposing a mechanism which would give accountability. The minister has identified 250 companies. I am asking the minister to stand up and tell the Senate what he identifies as his objective energy saving as a result of this bill and what the time frame is, because there is no time frame either. I would like to know exactly how much energy he anticipates saving in the next three years as a result of this legislation. What is your target? What do you require these companies to save? If they do not, will you then move to do as I am proposing and put in a requirement to implement these particular measures?
It is no use going with this plan in the same way that the government currently is going on greenhouse. We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent in the next 50 years, yet there is no mechanism for doing it. There is no target to say whether we are on track, what our objective is and how we measure anything against it. The criticism that I am putting to the government now is that it is putting something out there which says, ‘Do an audit,’ and by osmosis the audit will lead to a reduction in energy use. I am asking the government to give us the target so that we, the Senate, can measure the government’s performance on energy efficiency as a result of this legislation by determining the performance level of the 250 largest companies in response to its legislation. If you do not have a target then you are just talking hot air about energy efficiency. We will not know for the next couple of years how many companies actually implement any measures as a result of the energy efficiency bill.
The downside and the big cost of this is that state governments right now are considering building new energy infrastructure at great cost to the taxpayer. The Australian taxpayer is once again subsidising energy use by large companies while the federal government is not prepared to put any pressure on them to use energy efficiently. We all know that energy efficiency is the cheapest way of saving energy. It is the low-hanging fruit in the whole energy debate. We do not need to be building new power stations and new sources of supply if we can reduce the volume of energy being used by the same amount that those new power stations would bring online.
I spoke last time about the potential to run a major education campaign to let people know that, when they turn off their energy appliances at home using standby remote control, they are actually using energy. About 12 per cent of energy use in Australia occurs when people are not there and they thought they turned the appliances off with the remote but in fact they are still using energy. There are a number of ways of doing it. My point here is that, with state governments moving again to look at the supply issue, why can’t we see energy efficiency as a substitute for new supply by saving the same volume that would be provided through development of new infrastructure that would cost a great deal more both in upfront capital cost and cost to the planet through greenhouse gas emissions and long-term problems?
And so I put to the minister that, rather than just reject the amendment I am putting forward, he should respond to the criticisms I am making. What is your target for these 250 companies? How will we judge whether this initiative is a success or not? If it is not a success—if you have not reached your target in the next 12 months—will you then do as I am asking and have a requirement to implement the audit findings over a period of time, where there is a reasonable pay-back period, and to provide a level playing field for progressive companies instead of continually rewarding those who are not and will never be prepared to do the right thing until they are required to?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-27,"—The Democrats will support the amendments moved by the Australian Greens. The problem that we have at present is that there is no significant driver for energy efficiency in this country; electricity is still cheap enough for big corporations to ignore this as being an issue for them. I recognise the problems associated with putting up such complex amendments as these. I also realise that the government is not likely to agree to them. But I also sense that there is deep frustration on the part of non-government members in this place about the lack of progress on this issue. This is an attempt, and I congratulate Senator Milne on it, to put in place measures which could provide that driver.
I will give an example of where big industry does not take up measures which have very short payback periods: cogeneration. Cogeneration is a system for use where, mostly in big manufacturing operations, a lot of heat is generated. Cogeneration can harvest that heat and use it to generate electricity, usually with the use of natural gas and generators. Enormous savings can be made over time as well as energy being fed into the grid. But when last I looked at the figures, only a very small proportion of the potential for cogeneration had been picked up. That is despite the fact, as I said, that the payback period is very short.
As Senator Milne has already indicated, the problem is that businesses make their decisions on infrastructure based on other priorities. If the government were really serious about getting across to them the message that Australia has to reduce its greenhouse emissions massively—by at least 60 per cent by 2050—this would be one very good way of doing that. I would hope that the minister, if he rejects this out of hand, which is what I think we are all expecting, will at least take up some of the ideas and come back to this place in the future with legislation which puts in place something similar. To reiterate, the Democrats, like so many people in this country, are disappointed that there has not been much of an effort at all on energy efficiency. Voluntary measures have not worked up until now, and there is no reason to suggest that they are going to work over the next five or 10 years either. This is a mechanism which would at least ensure that they do.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The opposition acknowledges that there has been some serious thought put into the propositions embodied in the amendments that have been moved by Senator Milne on behalf of the Australian Greens. As Senator Allison has conceded, this is a complex set of propositions with, I think, quite laudable aims in terms of promoting the achievement of energy efficiencies and putting in place a number of measures to require corporations to identify the areas in which those savings can be achieved. They are complex, and that complexity is something that the opposition would rather look at and assimilate in a better time period than is available for the consideration of this legislation.
That in itself does not completely direct our consideration of the amendments. As I intimated earlier in this debate, our concerns also arise because this would become yet another measure creating a slush fund for the government to administer. The amendments put in the hands of the minister the distribution of moneys collected under these measures. Those moneys are to be expended at the discretion of the minister on particular projects. I have had some involvement, through this place, in looking at measures administered by this government where ministers had the final say on where particular moneys—accumulated under this or that budgetary measure or by the collection of revenues, such as the levy on milk products—were spent. I have seen the way that the government has abused the process of distributing those funds to garner political advantage. Looking at the Dairy RAP program, we have seen millions of dollars distributed across the country, not necessarily into the areas most affected by dairy deregulation but into areas which the government considered advantageous for it in the electoral advantage that such expenditure might garner. We saw such edifying propositions under Dairy RAP as the expenditure of moneys for a private school in Toowoomba for running wine appreciation classes. That was supposed to help the dairy industry in the Toowoomba region. In Beaudesert it was used to fund the purchase of property for a polocrosse field. There was of course a world-class polocrosse facility within an hour’s drive, but that did not stop the funding of this facility. As I understand it, it is not much more than a paddock with a shed, a gate and a sign. But that expenditure enabled the announcement to be made and some political advantage to be generated.
Of course, under the Regional Partnerships program, better known to the public as ‘regional rorts’—and this is probably most germane to this legislation—we have seen an amount of money approaching $1.2 million paid to a company called Primary Energy Pty Ltd. Primary Energy Pty Ltd have an idea. They have been funded for that idea. They do not have financial backers; they do not have an ethanol plant under construction; they do not, indeed, have any idea of when they will actually have that plant under construction. The final amount of money—a small amount of the original grant of something in excess of $1.2 million—will be paid when they finally get a financial backer. In excess of $1.1 million has been paid to Primary Energy to date to achieve precisely nothing. Of course, when I say ‘nothing’, I mean that there was nothing in it in a public sense. But, in a party political sense, we have seen a series of announcements and the promotion of the expenditure of this public money as an opportunity for the electorate of the then Deputy Prime Minister in the seat of Gwydir.
So we have seen the government administering these pots of money under various programs, allegedly to promote particular outcomes, and in some cases achieving them. But, in many cases, they achieve not the promotion of the public interest but the promotion of the political interests of the National Party and the Liberal Party, depending on which part of the country this falls in. We saw on the weekend the release of another paper that analyses a number of government programs, including the Roads to Recovery program. The Prime Minister promised that the Roads to Recovery program would not be used to advantage coalition seats, yet a Mr Leigh from ANU published a paper on the weekend that shows that there is a weighting in the Roads to Recovery program in funding National Party and Liberal Party seats, giving them an advantage over non-government seats, and attributes to that funding an outcome in terms of votes. I have called for the government to respond to that paper because it makes a very serious allegation. The Prime Minister, in the case of the Roads to Recovery program, faithfully promised that it would not be used in any way to distribute funds disproportionately or to the advantage of the coalition, yet that is precisely the allegation made in the paper Mr Leigh recently produced that has been the subject of some discussion over the weekend.
We want to acknowledge that in many respects this is a worthwhile proposition that has been put forward by Senator Milne, but we still think it needs some work done to it and we are not happy to give our support to a proposition that would create yet another slush fund for a minister of this government to administer when its form, in relation to those propositions, has been so bad.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-02-27,"—I think I would be more amused to see Senator Milne respond to that fairly pitiful approach from Labor, which I guess reflects the total paucity of any policy ideas when it comes to greenhouse gases or climate change. They have not had a new policy in 10 years. I guess it would be shocking for Senator Milne to expect anything greater than a repeat of the Labor Party’s hatred of regional Australia and Regional Partnerships programs and the continuing attack on Primary Energy, the company of which Ian Kiernan is chairman, after a personal attack on Ian Kiernan recently. Then, of course, there is a slamming of the Roads to Recovery program, which picks up so much of the road funding that is required around Australia because state Labor governments, state by state, have dropped the ball in relation to road funding. These are direct grants to local governments to build roads. I think Senator Milne’s propositions deserved far more attention than was given by the Labor Party.
During the last sitting week I set out the reasons that we were opposed to the more interventionist approach of Senator Milne, but I do not think it is fair to say, as Labor has said, that it is a complex set of arrangements. I do not think it is that complicated. I think Senator Milne proposed the establishment of a task force with four members. This task force is to be established within three months. The task force would report to the minister within 18 months of the commencement of the act. The minister would have to make the report public. You would establish an energy savings fund, which I imagine would be funded by the industrial corporations or companies required to comply with this part of the law. The fund would do certain things: promotion, public awareness building and encouraging energy savings, for example. I do not think it is a complex set of proposals at all. I think it is a cop-out for Labor to say that it is too hard for them to devour this over the last 10 sitting days and come to a conclusion on it.
My view, however, is not as negative about the response that Australians make to the need to protect our climate, to protect our environment and to do so through voluntary measures. The history of the past decade or so shows how the government works in partnership with the private sector, and we have done that very effectively through the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program. We work with them, for example, through the Solar Cities program. There are 11 fantastic short-listed proposals—private-public partnerships again, which I think will transform the impact of the roll-out of renewable energy across Australia. We work together in a range of programs: the building energy rating systems that the Commonwealth has supported; the water energy labelling systems, which again put information into the hands of consumers; the appliance rating systems—all of these world leading systems have the government working in partnership with the private sector to inform people about the consequences of their decisions.
In a way, this mandatory measure—it is not a voluntary measure—mandates for the first time in Australian history that around 250 companies, our biggest energy users, representing around 60 per cent of the energy consumed in Australia, will be required to make an energy efficiency audit and to publish those audits. They will also be required to publish compliance with those audits. That puts a very powerful new measure in place. I think it is unfair to the Australian community and to Australian industry that have in fact responded so strongly, community by community, business by business, household by household, to the challenge of sustainability. How do we ensure that we have a strong economy with job security where people can look forward to the future knowing that they will have an economic environment where their children can get an education and jobs and where the main breadwinners in each household will have some job security? How do we also ensure that they live in that environment of economic security alongside a natural physical environment where the damage done in the past is being repaired and that environment is made sustainable for the future?
More and more people are becoming aware that we cannot keep pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the rate we have in the past. We have put about a trillion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere over the past 150 years. If we do not make the sorts of changes that we are part of making here today, we will pump another couple of trillion tonnes into the atmosphere over the next 50 years. The consensus of science says that that could change the climate dangerously and put at risk not only human life but also ecosystems across the planet. We have to find the most efficient and the most effective ways to do what Senator Milne says. It would be terrific—an incredible economic and environmental outcome—if you could, through energy efficiency measures, save us building a couple of fossil fuel powered stations.
Senator Milne is quite right: the state governments between them have about 25 fossil fuel powered power stations on the drawing boards at the moment, and yet they have the temerity to blame the Commonwealth government for not setting up a carbon-trading scheme. They do nothing themselves. They have virtually no program other than very small greenwash proposals to put the odd solar cell on a library here and there or change 20 per cent of the ministerial car fleet to Priuses—all those sorts of greenwash things. Virtually no state government has any serious public investment program to substantially change the greenhouse footprint of Australia. They do have 25 fossil fuel powered power stations on the drawing board, and many of them will get built to fund the increasing number of desalination plants that they have got on their books. So the states really are getting away with murder when it comes to greenhouse gas policy. They can always point the finger at Canberra, but the reality is that here in Canberra the government is committing billions of dollars to investment programs and we are bringing in this new mandatory measure for Australia’s top 250 energy-consuming companies.
I think that Senator Milne is making a very good point in terms of the payback period. Companies will have to look at the payback period of all of these investments and they will have to make an assessment of where they put their investment. The reality of these audits is that for the first time many of these companies will see the bottom line benefits, the energy consumption benefits and the greenhouse gas benefits of reducing their energy use and improving their efficiency. Perhaps, for example, in the case that Senator Allison raised, going to cogeneration will force many companies, for the first time, to look at how they better use heat from existing processes and whether they can use that heat to produce energy and to save energy from the grid and from fossil fuel powered power stations. They may well do it. I think this is a substantial step forward. I think the higher regulatory approach that Senator Milne puts forward would not be effective in the view of the government in improving Australia’s energy efficiency.
Senator Milne asked me to say what this bill’s objectives were and how we would measure effectiveness. We will measure effectiveness when we see the 250 companies do their audits and publish their audits and their compliance. That is what we seek to set out here in terms of the overall targets that the government has set our country. We have set our country a target of limiting our greenhouse gas emissions to 108 per cent of 1990 levels. That is our Kyoto target. We are on track to achieve that. There are many risks to achieving that in a rapidly growing economy but, according to our latest figures, we are on track to achieve that target. We are one of the few countries in the world that is on track to achieve it. Of the annex 1 signatories, the handful of countries that have commitments under Kyoto—and I think there are only 35 of them; less than a third of the world’s emissions are covered by Kyoto—very few will meet their targets through domestic action, as Australia will. That is our target. The government also accepts—or, as the environment minister, I accept—that the globe needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 to 60 per cent by about the middle of this century, as Senator Allison has said. Australia cannot do that unilaterally. Australia may actually be able to make a bigger contribution or it may make a smaller contribution, but the target for the world is a 50 to 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Australia has also committed, as a very high policy priority, to take on its share and its role in achieving that target as a responsible member of the international community. That is why we are deeply engaged in all of the international processes through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, through the G8-plus process and through the Asia-Pacific climate change partnership through a series of technological partnerships and a world-leading program of domestic action.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-27,"—There are a couple of other things I want to mention. The minister keeps referring to the appliance-rating system as an example of the government’s energy efficiency measures. It is one of the recommendations that came out of the urban water inquiry that was conducted. For the record, I remind the minister that that was not a government initiative; it was in fact a Democrat initiative. The government came to us and said that they wanted to transfer some money out of a fund, which we were a party to negotiating, into other programs, and this was our suggestion. The point is that we did not sit around waiting for the appliance industry to do audits to see whether they would like to put rating systems on. They had shown no interest in this matter up to that point. It only happens when government acts and says, ‘This must be done and it must be done by this date.’ I hope that the mandatory labelling system that applies to appliances will soon move to a mandatory energy efficiency rating so you will not just see how many stars you have got but you can be sure that the appliance you buy meets minimum standards. That is where we need to be moving.
I think we have given big industry lots of time to look at their energy efficiency and where it might be going. Now is the time for us to move from what is a voluntary measure. They cannot possibly say that the government is not interested in reducing efficiency. Given Kyoto and the great debate there is around greenhouse, they cannot possibly say they have not noticed that this is an issue or that a lot of people in this country would like them to move to greater efficiency. To think that if they have an audit they will suddenly change their mind about this is ludicrous and laughable. That is the reason, Minister, that some of us in this chamber are talking about obligation and the need for the government to put in place that obligation.
I have a question. I am not sure whether I missed this in the debate. Regarding the 250 companies that are required to report that they have conducted audits, is there a reporting-back process that indicates when and if they accept those audits and go on to do the work which is demonstrated to be viable?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-02-27,"—Yes, it is an annual public report. We did cover that earlier.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—I appreciate the minister saying that they will judge the performance of this legislation on the basis of the number of companies that comply with the mandatory requirement to audit, but that is not the point I was making. I am expecting that they will all oblige and meet their mandatory obligation to audit the opportunities they have for energy efficiency. I think the minister well understands the point I was making, which was not whether they agree to do their audits and then do them but what government then expects them to do. You are putting a lot of faith in companies doing the right thing after they have done their audits.
I agree with you that if you are a company it makes sense to want to save money, and if you find a way of saving money it is not very sensible to think that you would not take that action. But the point is that companies have a number of competing objectives at various times and, unless you prioritise energy efficiency, they may well choose to spend any capital they have up front on other initiatives rather than investing in energy efficiency, even if there is a relatively short payback period. I do not think two years is excessive. That is the absolute easiest hurdle. It is not an unduly harsh measure to propose that they identify energy savings that will pay them back in two years. Then it can be taken out to four years over a period of time so they know what is coming.
I still have not heard the minister respond to the idea that, by failing to have a mandatory requirement for them to implement, you are not creating a level playing field. You are not offering an incentive to progressive companies who might wish to take that action but might see themselves as disadvantaged with respect to other companies who are not required to take that action and are able to spend their money on other things. That will slow it down. That is why I will be moving an amendment later in relation to a performance objective to force a requirement to look at this in a couple of years.
But again, it will be a lost opportunity. There is a lost opportunity factor. The minister talks about Australia’s compliance with Kyoto. Let us remind ourselves: the only reason Australia will come in—if it does—on our target of 108 per cent of 1990 levels is the windfall gain the Australian government was able to achieve by counting the avoided emissions from stopping land clearance. It is not because we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions in either the transport or the energy sectors. If you take out the one-off windfall gain Australia got under the Kyoto arrangements as a result of its land clearance policy, you find that Australia’s emissions in the transport and energy sectors are well above—20 to 30 per cent—the Kyoto level.
Let us be realistic; let us not kid ourselves about Australia performing or outperforming other countries on the Kyoto targets. We got the most generous target in the world—an eight per cent increase on 1990 levels while other countries tried to set themselves reductions. Having got that generous target, we have had the windfall gain. You cannot have many more windfall gains unless you manipulate the system in order to generate credits from something else so you do not have to take any action.
I am talking about the transport and energy sectors and, in the case of this bill, the 250 large companies in particular. I am not persuaded about this, having looked at the aluminium sector, some of the other big industries around Australia in the last few years and the subsidies. They already get incredible subsidies for bulk power contracts. I have not seen them take energy efficiency initiatives so that when the bulk power contracts run out they can continue to compete. I am seeing them now mounting major pressure on governments to continue bulk power contracts rather than reduce their dependence on energy.
As to the state governments, you are absolutely right. It disgusted me to see the previous Carr government in New South Wales—I recognise that the former Premier has now left politics—set up a greenhouse gas office and approve a new coal fired power station and a desalination plant. It is the height of hypocrisy. It disgusts me. Then I look at South Australia and I see BHP Billiton’s planned Roxby Downs expansion. In order for that to happen, they want the government to build them a desalination plant so that they have the water to sustain the increased mining of uranium, to send that offshore. The whole thing is a disgrace. I do not see BHP Billiton—except in the headlines over the Wheat Board scandal of course, undermining appropriate processes and systems around the world—out there accepting the full-cost responsibility of anything they want to do. No; they have their hands out for the government and the government is rushing to help them, not only with a desalination plant but also to subsidise their expansion through the provision of energy to run their desalination plant.
It is time that people started to look at the whole cradle to grave aspect of production and energy costs, because energy is embedded in everything. I think we should recognise just how urgent the crisis is. We need action now. We cannot wait for companies to get around to it. That is why I do not accept the minister’s explanation about how you are going to judge the performance, the effectiveness, of this legislation. I will not be judging the effectiveness of this legislation on whether companies comply with the need to do an audit—I expect they will. But I want to know, in the absence of a mandatory requirement for them to implement the findings of these audits, at what point the government is going to say: ‘These 260 companies use X amount of power now. If they have not reduced that power consumption as a result of these audits within three years and by X amount then we will take some action to force the implementation.’ That is what I want to hear from the government. I cannot understand why you have an objection to moving on this now, especially when, as I have said, there is in my view a very generous two-year payback period. That is the concern I have.
As to the Labor Party’s opposition to the amendments, I am disappointed, because there has been quite a period since we last sat for the Labor Party to think about and look at these amendments. I did draw them to the attention of the shadow minister. There has been adequate time to look at them. It is another lost opportunity to move forward on this, especially when I recall that, Senator O’Brien, in relation to the Greens sun bill a few years ago it was the Labor Party that derailed that Senate committee report into the implementation of the Sun Fund. That was another attempt by the Greens to generate money to put into the development and roll-out of photovoltaics across rural Australia. That is something that I am still passionate about.
I am inspired by the German experience and by the visit to Australia this week of Dr Hermann Scheer, who has been the brains behind German energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation. He is here giving a seminar at this very time. I regret that I am unable to be at that seminar because I am here in the chamber. He has talked about the way in which in Germany they stimulated a revolution and created 160,000 jobs in renewable energy technology by moving to a relatively simple conceptual framework that said, ‘We will require power companies to buy renewable energy at a fixed price over a period of time.’ As a result, people could go to the bank and borrow to install renewable energy—photovoltaics, wind or whatever it is—because there was a guaranteed price over a period of time. As a result, Germany has created a solar revolution.
We could be doing the same in Australia. I am seriously disturbed by the fact that we have abandoned the whole renewable sector in favour of so-called clean coal and the fossil fuel industry. I certainly resent that going on at the moment and the shift in research priorities at the CSIRO. Even just lately we have had in South Australia a situation in which Tim Flannery has been virtually censored for saying that climate change is the greatest security threat facing humanity. The federation of commercial television stations said that they objected to that wording. How can we have a situation where people get censored for their opinions?
Sir David King, Tony Blair’s chief scientist in Britain, has come out and said exactly the same thing. People are saying it all over the world, but apparently in Australia we are not allowing people out there in the community to hear the message that this is urgent, this is serious. We are beyond voluntary action. If we do not act now we could have some major climate catastrophes. The science is showing that this will not be an incremental process; this will be a threshold process. The point is that we do not know when we will reach the threshold, but when we do there will be no going back. That is the frightening thing. Around the world we are seeing the acidification of the Southern Ocean, the slowing down of the great ocean conveyor and the melting of the ice caps. Surely in Australia we can require the 260 biggest energy users to do an audit of energy efficiency opportunities and to implement them if the payback period is less than two years.

(Senator Barnett)—Senator Milne, could you confirm that you are moving amendments (1) and (2), then (5) to (7) on revised sheet 4784, and R(7) on sheet 4784 revised is the new R(7)? Is that correct?
—That is correct.
Question put:
That the amendments (Senator Milne’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—by leave—I move Greens amendments (3) and (4):
(3)    Heading to Part 3, page 6 (line 2), at the end of the heading, add “energy use threshold”.
R(4) Clause 10, page 6 (lines 26 to 28), omit subclause (1), substitute:
         (1)    The energy use threshold will be prescribed by the regulations.
      (1A)    The regulations must set a sliding scale for the energy use threshold of a minimum of 0.5 petajoules for a controlling corporation’s group for each financial year commencing in the 2006-2007 financial year reducing annually to a minimum of 0.2 petajoules for a controlling corporation’s group by the financial year 2011-2012.
       (1B)    A controlling corporation’s group meets the energy use threshold for a financial year if in that year the total energy used by the controlling corporation’s group is more than the energy use threshold nominated for the relevant financial year as prescribed by subsection (1A).
As the bill is currently structured, the energy use threshold relates to companies that use more than 0.5 petajoules of energy, thereby restricting the bill’s capacity to draw in all of Australia’s small and medium scale businesses. At the moment the bill deals with Australia’s largest 250 companies. I think it is entirely appropriate that we target the largest companies to begin with, but we also want medium sized companies to look to energy efficiency as a way of becoming more competitive, reducing their costs, contributing to Australia’s reduced greenhouse gases and contributing to reduced pressure to build new supply.
What I am proposing with these amendments is that, instead of just leaving this bill to capture the largest companies in Australia, the threshold be reduced over a period of time so that by the year 2011-12 it would apply to companies using more than 0.2 petajoules. At the moment the bill is saying, ‘Okay, we recognise it is just going with the largest 250 companies.’ By having a sliding scale so that the threshold reduces over time, we are giving notice to medium-sized companies in Australia—those that use between 0.2 and 0.5 petajoules—that, over a period of time, they too will be captured by this legislation. It is really telling corporations that, as we roll into this legislation, they too will be captured by the need to do energy efficiency audits.
Again, this is not saying that the government’s initiative is not worth while; it is saying it is worth while but it does not go far enough because it is not capturing the next level of industry in Australia. I think it is entirely appropriate that middle-sized industries in Australia are on notice that this bill is coming down the track and will apply to them and that they have a period of time to adjust to the idea that they too will be involved in the energy audits. I regret, of course, that the legislation—with my amendment having been defeated—will not require them to implement what they find, but at least having a sliding scale will increase the number of industries across Australia to which the legislation applies. It is a simple notion: a sliding scale, reducing the current threshold of 0.5 petajoules down to 0.2 petajoules.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-02-27,"—We have two problems with the proposed amendments. Firstly, what we are doing by requiring those within the terms of the bill to be captured is to embrace something like 60 per cent of the energy use by businesses in Australia—around 250 companies. We are requiring them to spend a lot of money. It is a big expense. The rationale for this—and I am biased of course—is a sound one. We are requiring 250 companies to spend a lot of money and, by doing that, we are capturing more than half of Australia’s energy use in the equation.
On our best estimates at this stage, by lowering the standard to 0.2 petajoules, you will capture somewhere between two and three times the number of companies—so you are massively expanding the reach, which I am sure is what Senator Milne would like us to do—but there will be only about a 10 per cent improvement in the size of the energy market. So by capturing nearly three times the number of companies you only go from 60 per cent to 70 per cent. So the efficiency of the measure drops off rapidly.
I know that there is a philosophical difference between the government and Senator Milne on this issue, but we believe that by mandating that these 250 companies not only go through an incredibly expensive energy audit but also are required to report annually on the implementation of the audit you will do a couple of things. Firstly, you will create a public register, effectively, of all of these companies using all this energy showing what they can do to reduce their energy use and become more efficient and annual reporting on what they are doing. So you will be able to identify the best practice companies and you will also be able to identify any company that is falling behind best practice or becoming a laggard, which might have been a word that Senator Milne used. You create a new public accountability process—a league table, effectively—of companies in terms of their performance in reducing energy use, increasing efficiency and, of course, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The other thing you will do is create a large demonstration effect. You will create efficiencies and economies of scale in the very business of doing energy audits because you will have this massive number of energy audits. It will be a lot more affordable. It should bring down the price of going through this process for a lot of those second-and third-tier companies that Senator Milne is talking about.
So I think we are aiming in a similar direction. We are very cautious about putting in new levels of red tape and new costs on top of businesses because ultimately that flows through to consumers and puts up the cost of living for people. We want to achieve the very best we can for improved energy efficiency, improved greenhouse performance and improved environmental outcomes and do so with the lowest possible cost to the consumer and to the economy. We think this is the right policy setting to achieve it. I respect the fact that Senator Milne would like a more interventionist, hands-on approach. We are trying to do it in a way that minimises the cost to consumers, particularly low-income earners.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The opposition will not be supporting these amendments. I am advised that it is our view that at this stage the thresholds which have been established of picking up 60 per cent of business picks up the largest businesses. The measures as proposed in the amendments would introduce complexity for the smaller end users, which we would not support at this stage. We think that that is a measure for the next stage in this process, so we will not be supporting these amendments.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I would just like to respond to the minister when he says that he does not want to put the additional cost on second- and third-level industry to conduct the audit and report. The whole point about energy efficiency is that it is designed to save companies money. Frequently, unless they are forced to do the audit in the first place—which is, I am sure, why the government is moving on the large companies—often they do not identify just how inefficient their operations are in terms of the amount of energy they are using and the cost savings that are achievable. Frequently they surprise themselves at how much money they can save.
I object to the notion that the government is about not passing on cost increases to consumers, implying that energy efficiency is going to cost. Energy efficiency will save businesses money directly but it will also save the community and the world a long-term cost associated with increased energy supply. It is the supply and demand issue that has to be addressed here. I think it is reasonable to say that once the large companies get into energy audits there will be a template for how you actually go about it. It is a quarter of a million dollars for the large companies. I am sure it is not going to be a flat fee of a quarter of a million dollars for medium and smaller companies. There will be other ways of doing it. It will be less complex for less complex operations, and so on. So I reject the notion that it is going to be a quarter of a million dollar fee for everyone, regardless of whether it is BHP or some medium-scale business in a regional centre, for example. There will be cost efficiencies in terms of scale.
I agree with what the minister is saying—that at the moment by targeting and carefully focusing the legislation on the 250 largest companies you are looking at 60 per cent of the energy use, and that is a good thing to do. We are also looking for cultural shifts here. We are looking for regional leadership. We are looking for community leadership. We are looking for people to be able to show that, at any scale of business, energy efficiency is a good idea. So by moving to capture more medium-scale businesses, you take this from just the 250 around Australia into, as the minister has himself acknowledged, thousands of businesses across Australia.
Not only are we talking about leadership in energy efficiency, cogeneration and take-up of renewables but we are also talking about competitiveness. Reducing the costs of production is one thing the government ought to be conscious of since it goes into these free trade agreements that put increasing pressure on Australian business to be able to compete with prices when you have China, in particular, sending manufactured goods to the global market that are heavily subsidised by the environment, human rights abuses and low wages. Everywhere I go, Australian businesses say to me that their main problem is that they just cannot compete against low-wage economies that subsidise levels of production by destroying the environment and by poor occupational health and safety standards as well as low wages.
So, given that, if we can help companies to be more efficient and reduce the costs of production it must be a good thing. It is my contention that the only way you will get them to do this is by requiring them to do the audit, which is the very rationale the government is using for big business. I am arguing that the same rationale applies to medium and small business—although 0.2 petajoules would not be a small business, so we are talking medium-scale businesses. Let us encourage these businesses to do their audits and find ways to make the audits affordable. Let us look at that. I do not know what those cost savings are going to be. If the government chooses to reject this, as the Labor Party has in the short term, let us have a look at what the costs would be for businesses of that scale to undertake similar audits. Surely once we get it down to a fine art with the large companies it will not be that difficult to modify for medium-scale companies.
Again, I think that this is a lost opportunity to spread the cultural change—the shift that is required—across the whole of Australia, and rural and regional Australia in particular. I cannot see that by staying with the 0.5 petajoule threshold we are actually spreading the message about energy efficiency and achieving the cultural change and the shift that we need to assist business not only to be better for the environment but to be more competitive in their fields.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—I move:
(8)    Page 30 (after line 26), at the end of Part 9, add:
42 Review of operation of Act
         (1)    The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of this Act to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
         (2)    The person who undertakes the review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
         (3)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 12 months after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
During the course of this debate, I have argued that one of the main problems with the bill is failure to require the outcomes of the audits to be implemented. The minister has just said that, by virtue of creating, effectively, a league table amongst big business as to who is doing the right thing by implementing the energy efficiency measures that have been identified, the public pressure will be such that they will do the right thing. That implies a whole new round of activism and requiring the community, shareholders and activists to go out there and start running campaigns on this when there is absolutely no need to do so if the government would actually require the companies to do it.
I have also said that we should establish the goal that we are trying to achieve and the time frame we are trying to achieve it in, and the minister still has not responded to that. What is the level of energy saving the government would expect to achieve within three years as a result of this bill? We need to know so that we can see whether it is in fact being effective. You will have your audits which will tell you what could be done and what has been done, and I guess you will have a running sheet of what has been saved and what is achievable, but I am moving for an independent review of the operation of the act to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the act.
In other words, five years after this act is implemented let us have an independent review of exactly whether this Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill has been effective in reducing the amount of energy that these companies use. The review should be given, as a written report, to the minister, and the minister must then table a copy of that review in each house of parliament within 12 months of the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this act. In other words, an independent review will take place after five years, that will be given to the minister and the minister will table it within 12 months of that.
I do not think that that is unreasonable. I expect the government will say, ‘We will be reviewing it all the time as it goes on in terms of the audit.’ But at least if you have an independent review of the act after five years, if companies have not done as the government expects they will do—and that is actually implement the initiatives that would save the greatest amount of energy—it gives us an opportunity to come back and take whatever steps might be necessary at that point. So I think it is more than reasonable.
We have a difference of philosophical opinion here as to whether requiring companies to do the right thing by enforcement measures or asking companies to do the right thing in a voluntary capacity is the right way to go. We have a different philosophical view on it, and mine is that we should require them to do it, within reason, if there is a reasonable payback period. However, since that is not the government’s view, and I have not been able to prevail upon the Senate to accept that view, I now ask that the Senate supports the notion of an independent review after five years so that we can then take other measures if they are necessary. Again, this is not because we have some idea about going after big business. This is about two things. It is about climate change and doing the right thing in terms of the global environment, and it is about saving taxpayers from investing in new energy production on the supply side, which is hugely expensive. However, it is also about helping companies, in spite of themselves, to be more competitive in a global environment by reducing their ongoing costs of production.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-27,"—I indicate Democrat support for this amendment, as we supported the previous amendment put forward. It is a modest request of the government, and the government has in the past acceded to such requests by the Senate, so I encourage Labor to support this and the government to agree to it. It is perfectly reasonable. We cannot know if this has worked unless we have a review. This simply asks the government to do that.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The opposition will be supporting this amendment. We do think it is a modest request but very worthy of our support. We agree that the issues which have been canvassed in this debate are extremely important to the Australian public and, indeed, to the whole of this globe, and we think it is extremely reasonable to ask that the operation of the propositions which the government have embodied in this bill with the amendments that they have proposed ought to be subject to an independent review and that review should not just sit on the desk of the minister when it has been conducted—it should be made public. Therefore, subclause (3) of this amendment, which would require the report of that review to be tabled in each house of parliament, places the matter fairly and squarely before the public and requires the government of the day—whoever it might be at that time—to table that report so that there can be full public knowledge. We know of no reason why the government would not support this other than that they may be unhappy about scrutiny of their actions. Their support or otherwise of this amendment will show whether the government are prepared to be open and transparent in their dealings with issues as important as this.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-02-27,"—This is an important issue, and I think all parties have acknowledged that. It is sending the right signal—that as parliament we need to ensure that we are encouraging all to do more with regard to energy efficiency. As I said, all parties have agreed that it is an important area, and we are sending a strong signal to business that they must look at energy efficiency opportunities. The issue here is that we should have a review after a certain period of time to have a look at how well the program is working and see whether extra measures need to be taken. Family First support this amendment, and I am hoping to see it put through.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-02-27,"—On page 41 of the explanatory memorandum the government sets out a timetable for evaluation and review of the program. It sets out the process in some detail—the completion of a baseline survey this year; ongoing data collection and analysis from company reports from 2006 to 2010; yearly efficiency review and reporting, as I have mentioned previously, throughout those four years; yearly ‘running changes’ throughout 2006 to 2010 to give us an ongoing update about performance against the audits; special evaluation data collection in 2009; a draft evaluation report written in January 2010; the circulation of the draft report in February 2010; and the final evaluation report written and released in July 2010.
That is full evaluation, reporting and public release to occur in four years, not five. So the government’s proposal is actually more stringent than the amendment that Senator Milne—without any doubt with the best outcomes in mind—is proposing. We go over and above that and say we will have a review evaluation for the five months after the final report, up until December 2010, and then implement evaluation findings in the ongoing program. We regard this as an ongoing program. It is the beginning of a substantial change to the way companies in this country look at their energy use. It will help them change their energy use and become a lot more efficient, and it is a program that the government are committed to.
The energy white paper, which is a substantial piece of policy work and has been analysed and copied around the world, identified through studies done within the National Framework for Energy Efficiency that projects within the residential energy sector could see savings of 13 per cent. I think Senator Milne was looking for some idea of the sort of savings that could be made. I am not saying these are targets; these are achievements that have been identified within the National Framework for Energy Efficiency. Page 109 of the energy white paper reports that they looked at energy use reductions in the order of 10.4 per cent for the commercial sector and 6.2 per cent for the industrial sector. They are substantial achievements in terms of greenhouse gas reductions and energy efficiency improvements. Within the government’s own explanatory memorandum before the Senate is a program for review that is more stringent than Senator Milne’s. The government are keen to make this work, to make sure the program is a success and to see it reviewed comprehensively. We have made a commitment in the explanatory memorandum, and I now make my own commitment, to ensure that that review is public.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—The issue here is the independence of the review. We have seen many government reviews in the past which we have later found out have left out significant detail because pressure was brought to bear and changed the tenor of the reporting. The key is that the review be independent. We have just had the example of a recent report on climate change where we found that the recommendations had been lifted out of the review and had never seen the light of day. The recommendations in that report on climate change have only been reported recently. They were for strategies and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and they were rejected. My requirement here is for an independent assessment that is then made public. That is the issue of concern here. Yes, the government has put in place an evaluation process, but I am moving that it be independent and not government controlled.

Does the minister recall saying last week that he would conduct an investigation into the allegations of abuse at the George Vowell centre ‘during the next few days’, and saying, ‘I intend to be very open about this whole process’? Has the minister’s investigation examined why no action was taken after relatives wrote to the department, complaining about neglect at this facility in May 2005, other than to write back and request that the complaint be made formal? Under the Aged Care Act, isn’t it possible to investigate anonymous or informal complaints or refer them to the standards agency?

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2006-02-27,"—I thank Senator McLucas for her question. I reject outright any suggestion that I or, in fact, my department have failed to investigate, as I committed that we would do, the allegations of lack of response or lack of proper and timely response. Senator McLucas should be very careful in tackling this particular issue because it is not an issue that we would want to politicise. As I said repeatedly during many media conferences, we all have grandmothers and grandfathers and we all have relatives in nursing homes who deserve and, in the main, right throughout Australia, receive the very best attention that our publicly funded aged care facilities can provide. I caution Senator McLucas not to become political on issues such as this. On the rare occasions when this sort of abuse occurs, it is required to be treated very sensitively.
I can assure the Senate what I assured Senator McLucas would be the case—that is, I asked for an immediate investigation to take place. That investigation is taking place. I have been advised that it will be concluded by the end of this week, and at that point in time I will do whatever I can to make the public aware of those details. More importantly, when after the end of this week the Senate resumes in three weeks time, I will come back to the Senate and I will inform the Senate on this matter, bearing in mind that there are also very delicate privacy considerations included in this particular issue. I will be very forthcoming and open, as I said to Senator McLucas I would.
What I am saying to the Senate and to Senator McLucas, through you, Mr President, is that the commitment I made is being maintained. I was advised just before I came into question time that the investigation is taking place.

Further, is the minister aware of any alternative policies in this area, which is of critical concern to Tasmanian workers and their families?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tasmanian Forests</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-02-27,"—I thank Senator Parry for his question and note his longstanding interest in supporting a sensible balance between jobs and conservation in Tasmania. I can say to Senator Parry that I am aware of an alternative policy to the Howard government’s very balanced approach in this area. The policy announced by the Tasmanian Greens yesterday would be a disaster for Tasmania’s sustainable forest practices and for Tasmanian forest workers, their families and their communities. The simple fact is, according to their own policy, the Greens want to lock up more forest in Tasmania, preventing it from being sustainably harvested or, indeed, used for tourism. This is despite the fact that after the Howard government’s Community Forest Agreement over 40 per cent of Tasmania forests are now unavailable for logging and an astonishingly high figure of 100 million trees are protected. But, of course, for the Greens that is not enough. They always want more, even if it costs sustainable forestry and tourism jobs in Tasmania and even if it means sourcing our timber from the unregulated forests of South-East Asia and South America.
With this new policy, the Greens have once again moved the goalposts. First, it was old-growth forests. Then it was native forest. Now we even have the prospect of regrowth forest not being available for harvest. Despite all their pretences of supporting tourism jobs in Tasmania’s forests, the Greens simply want to lock the forests up totally and utterly. To the extreme Greens, trees really do come before humans and their sustainable jobs—even tourism jobs.
The scary thing is that it is entirely possible that in just a few weeks the Greens may be in a position to implement this job-destroying policy in an accord with the Tasmanian Labor Party. That would see the productive and renewable forests, such as the Weld, Blue Tier and Wielangta, being completely shut down. Jobs will be clear-felled and confidence in the Tasmanian economy will be severely damaged all because the Lennon Labor government is so desperate to hang on to power. They have already bankrolled the Greens over Recherche Bay and refused to rule out a minority government with them. Less than a year ago the Tasmanian resources minister had this to say about Recherche Bay:
The Tasmanian Government has achieved the appropriate balance between protecting cultural heritage values and allowing the land owners access to and use of the land.
I agree. What has changed since April last year? Nothing, other than the grubby attempt by Paul Lennon to hang on to power with a Greens-Labor accord. My message to the Tasmanian forest workers and tourism operators who rely on the forest industry is very simple and straightforward: as with the last federal election, only the Liberals can be trusted to protect their sustainable jobs and their communities.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-02-27,"—I thank Senator Lightfoot for the question. We are introducing a new trade skills training visa. This will be a great opportunity for regional Australia to build and a great opportunity for young Australians in regional Australia to ensure that they can undertake apprenticeships. This is simply because there are some opportunities in regional Australia not being taken up by Australians, and that means that some of the off-employment training that takes place has got fewer students in regional Australia. That makes some of those courses not viable. If the course shuts, it means that the Australian students in the course obviously cannot go on with it, so it makes it hard for them to get an apprenticeship.
We were approached by employers and trade-training companies to allow overseas students to come and take those positions if Australians are not available to take them up, and we have acquiesced to this proposition. We have said that the regional certifying bodies, the people in the local area, will have to certify that an Australian was not available to take up the position. Once that has been done, we are happy for an overseas student to come and pay the full fee for the trade place. This is something that senators on the other side well understand in terms of universities, and, if it is good enough for overseas students who can afford to come and pay money to get Australian qualifications and take them home or maybe decide that they want to stay here, it is good enough for kids who are doing a trade as well to have that opportunity for their families to invest in them to get world-class trade qualifications.
Of course, the regions are happy about this because it means that you will have a baker in Mount Isa or a mechanic in another town where they had a shortage and that the training courses that might otherwise become not viable in regional Australia will have extra students in them. The important point is that all the fees are paid by the overseas student and a local certifying body has to certify that an Australian was not available to take up the job.
I was asked what we have on the other side as an alternative policy. There were some remarks put together by Tony Burke, the opposition spokesperson. It frankly shocked me to hear Mr Burke say: ‘What is going on in Australia? We will be having apprentices from Beirut, Bombay and Beijing.’ You do not have to be very bright to figure out what is going on there. Why did Mr Burke select Beirut, Bombay and Beijing?
—Perhaps it was the alliteration!
—It is pretty clear what is going on there. This is a return to the old Arthur Calwell Labor Party—absolutely. If all he was after was some alliteration, Mr Burke could have said, ‘We don’t want apprentices coming from Belfast, Blackpool, Brighton or Bristol.’ But he did not say that, did he? No. He left the English towns out. He only chose the Middle East, the subcontinent and Asia to complain about. I think the Labor Party needs to get their immigration spokesperson quietly in a backroom and just ask him whether they really want to go back to the days of Arthur Calwell. Is that what you are really on about?
—What was Costello on about?
—We have made it clear that the money is being paid by the overseas students, that Australian jobs are protected, and all you can do is go out and have a big dog whistle. You should be ashamed of yourselves!

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-02-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Ageing (Senator Santoro) to questions without notice asked by Senators McLucas and Forshaw today relating to aged care.
Six years ago Australians were horrified at the revelations that elderly residents in residential aged care were subjected to kerosene baths, that residents were neglected and that the care that was being provided was far from standard. Confidence six years ago in Australia’s aged care system was seriously undermined. The minister at the time, Mrs Bishop, convened meetings, consulted and set in place systems that she said were designed to protect vulnerable Australians in residential aged care. And here we are in 2006 with horrific allegations of elder abuse in residential aged care—allegations that have horrified every single one of us whether or not we have a relative in aged care. The allegations in Victoria and in Queensland have once again shaken the confidence that Australians have in our aged care system.
The response from the Minister for Ageing today—and, I might say, last week—was one of the best applications that I have ever seen for a scriptwriter for the TV program Yes Minister. Despite his assurances, the minister did not respond openly, transparently or, in my view, honestly to questions put to him in question time today. I asked the minister why no action was taken after relatives of the alleged victim wrote to the department in May 2005 complaining about neglect and asking why the department had not acted in the way that they can.
Under the Aged Care Act it is quite possible for an allegation that has been sent to the department or the minister to be sent, through the department, to the standards agency. That option was not taken, but the minister did not use question time today to explain to the community why it did not happen. As we know, it is quite possible for that to occur. Senator Santoro did advise the Senate that the investigation by the department will be concluded this week. He then obfuscated—he was not clear—about what was going to happen to that report. I call on the minister to make that investigation public, to provide it to the Senate, so that confidence in our aged care system can start to be restored in the community.
I further asked the minister about an aged care facility in Queensland—the Immanuel Gardens Nursing Home. I asked him to confirm reports that the carer involved in the allegations got another job at another nearby residential aged care facility after he got the sack from the first one. The minister did not even attempt to clarify that situation. We have to make sure that confidence in aged care can be restored. It is encumbent upon the minister to use the opportunity of question time, to use the opportunity whenever possible, to restore confidence in aged care by coming clean—by telling people what has happened, by telling people what his department has and has not done and by telling people what he and the previous minister have done.
The minister did explain that on 11 and 12 August 2005 an examination of Immanuel Gardens Nursing Home was undertaken—and now, at the end of February 2006, finally, sanctions have been imposed. That is on top of the fact that the report that was done in August 2005 said that the problems were systemic, that they had been going on for three years. So the report said that these problems had occurred and then the department did not act promptly. It has been seven months since the first inspection happened and we finally have a response this week.
I reject absolutely the minister’s assertion that the Labor Party or in fact anyone involved in this matter is trying to politicise this issue. Aged care is a significant sector of the care component of the Australian community. We have to be confident in it. It is our job as the opposition to monitor the actions of government—and I take that job seriously. But the bottom line is: it is the minister’s responsibility to restore confidence in aged care—and we are providing that opportunity. (Time expired)

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2006-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the issue at hand, which is the motion to take note of Senator Santoro’s answers to questions. It pays to have been around here for some time, because I remember very clearly the state of aged care facilities when Labor was in government. It was disgraceful—and in Victoria, in particular, it was nothing short of an appalling situation. In Victoria there were large nursing homes which had run down in terms of capital and leasehold nursing homes where the facilities and the services offered to older people were enough to make you want to vomit when you left after visiting.
I visited nursing home after nursing home after nursing home, particularly in Victoria, and it was nothing short of an absolute disgrace. Labor did nothing. Labor had a report written by Professor Gregory. Professor Gregory said that there was not sufficient funding for nursing homes and there was not sufficient means for using the resources of people who go into nursing homes. I have always given credit to the Labor Party for the reforms they undertook in hostels by allowing an ingoing, which meant that there was the ability for providers to have capital for nursing homes. But Professor Gregory said that something like 80 per cent of people were living in rooms with four to five people, 75 per cent of nursing homes did not meet building standards, 11 per cent of homes did not meet basic health standards and funding to nursing homes had been cut by 75 per cent over a four-year period—the four years before we came into government in 1996. So Labor have nothing—no record, no credibility, nothing to stand up and be able to say, ‘Look what we did.’ When they hold a mirror up to themselves, they will see the disgraceful state that existed in nursing homes, particularly in my state of Victoria.
A range of measures have been introduced by various ministers for aged care since we have been in government. A system of accreditation has been introduced—the first nationally legislated quality assurance program for aged care. Directors of nursing homes and providers around the country say that the government’s accreditation system is the best thing that has happened in aged care. It has lifted the standards. We now have an aged care system that most countries would be proud of. We have introduced certification providing standards to ensure that the buildings and the physical environment are what Australians would expect for older Australians needing care.
I admit that the allegations that were made about what occurred in a nursing home in Victoria are very serious. Senator Santoro, a very new minister, has responded very rapidly to those allegations. He announced that a special meeting of the aged care advisory committee will take place in Canberra on Tuesday, 14 March. This meeting will explore solutions to allegations of abuse in Australia’s aged care facilities. Short of having a video camera in every room, unfortunately there will be situations like this. What we have to do is minimise the likelihood of it happening. I am sure Senator Santoro is going to be discussing that in great detail with the aged care advisory committee.
That committee comprises representatives of the aged care industry, staff and residents and is regarded as a representative committee. The government is keen for members of the public and aged care industry professionals who have ideas and suggestions for improvement to have input into that process. Senator Santoro has called for people to email the task force at aca.taskforce@health.gov.au with any views or any suggestions they might have. If requested, they will be treated confidentially. I think that is important. There are people out there who may have suggestions and ideas about what should happen. Senator Santoro has met with the granddaughters of one of the alleged victims to hear a first-hand account of their experiences and he assured them that he would do all he could to bring about an improvement in the aged care system with a view to preventing the sort of abuse that their late grandmother experienced.
All of us are shocked, no doubt, by the allegations of this abuse. But, as I said, you can put all the best measures in the world in place and unfortunately, whether it is in child care—and the states know this because the states have to regulate and monitor child care—or aged care, there will be people who find their way into those systems who are less than desirable. That may be the thing we need to be looking at, but Senator Santoro has made a very immediate start on this issue. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2006-02-27,"—I rise to take note of answers given by the new Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro, during question time today. Although he has not been in the seat long, any objective observer would have expected him to be across this most serious and important issue. Indeed, this very issue is a litmus test for him early on in his ministerial career. Is he going to be a minister who fudges and hides behind his bureaucrats or is he going to be a minister who is prepared to call a spade a spade and decry mismanagement and scandal? Is this a minister who will seek to sweep things under the carpet, as so many of his predecessors have done?
Not since the kerosene baths of Bronwyn Bishop have we faced such outrageous and disgraceful treatment of elderly Australians in the nation’s aged care facilities. The revelation that four dementia patients aged in their nineties were allegedly raped and assaulted at a Victorian nursing home are a national shame. No amount of clouding or fudging can hide it. This is a test for Minister Santoro—a test of frankness and openness, a test of the strength of his mettle—for while I am sure all senators in this place are appalled at what has happened it is to Minister Santoro that we turn for a resolution of this disgraceful situation.
That is why today I am saddened. I am saddened that, with the opposition seeking legitimate answers to questions, Minister Santoro has gone the bluff and bluster instead of being open. He has told us in this chamber today that he will review a review of a review of the complaints resolution scheme. Let me say this to you, Minister Santoro: while your feet are barely under the table you cannot be held personally responsible for these instances, but the government you represent can, and the government you represent will be held to account for its mismanagement. Do not fall into the trap of blindly following the line established for you. Blaze your own trail.
In the aftermath of these recent Victorian cases, we see a litany of failings resurface from our aged care sector. Today in the Herald Sun we hear of a woman conducting a bedsheet sting to see how often her mother’s sheets were being changed and discovering they were not changed for a month. Families bring food in, particularly fresh fruit, because of concerns over their loved ones’ diets. Homes provide only two pads a day to incontinent aged care residents. There are concerns about theft and inappropriate standards of care. It all smacks of a system failing.
Aged care Australians deserve more than this. Working Australian families deserve more than this. Aged care has become an increasingly important service as our lives grow more complex and busy, and life expectancy in our community rises. Traditional extended family models have given way to nuclear families and, with parents and partners working full time, the capacity for families to care for aged relatives is constantly diminishing. It is only going to get worse as the impact of the government’s new Work Choices act is felt in our community, and working hours and conditions become even more demanding. It is only going to get worse as demand for aged care places increases in line with our ageing society.
We need to arrest this problem now. We need real solutions from this minister to the national aged care crisis. But what has happened? We are getting no answers or solutions from this minister in this place. We are getting a summit at some time in the future so he has the breathing time he needs to get his lines right. But, as Kim Beazley said last week, this government has had all the breathing space it needs. This government needs to do more than just concede that standards are not being met; it needs to ensure that they are met.
For almost seven years we have had a system in crisis. Consider this time line from the Herald Sun. In 2000, 57 residents were given kerosene baths to treat scabies. Also in 2000, a Caulfield aged care resident was sprayed in the face with fly spray when found covered in ants. In 2001 a woman was found to have lost a leg to gangrene due to a lack of proper care, and another was found to have been left alone, restrained in a chair, for five hours in complete darkness. Also in 2001 a woman died of head injuries after being assaulted by a male resident at the home where she lived. In 2003 another woman died after being assaulted by a fellow resident. Skip ahead a few years and it is the same all over again. An advocacy group highlighted claims of bed linen not being changed for weeks at a time, of patients’ teeth not being brushed and of Jewish patients being fed pork. And then we have these latest explosive allegations—and bear in mind that this is just Victoria that we are talking about. It is time for real answers and solutions to our aged care crisis.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-02-27,"—I have not often seen such a shameless beat-up on the floor of the Senate as I have seen with this issue today. Frankly, I think the members of the opposition do no credit to themselves by using the language that they do about Australia’s aged care system. ‘A system in crisis,’ we hear. ‘A system that isn’t working,’ we hear. Members opposite not only are obviously quite content to play politics with this issue and to take what information they have to paint a picture which is a very serious distortion of what is taking place in Australia’s aged care system at the moment but are also quite prepared to do so in circumstances where they treat the sensibilities of those in that system and the families of those in that system as merely pawns in this rather tawdry game that they play.
The fact is that Australia’s aged care system, while far from perfect, has experienced enormous improvement in the last 10 years under this government, and nobody could objectively look at the way in which Australia’s aged care system operates today and not honestly come to that conclusion. Senator Carol Brown jumped up in this debate and made a series of claims about things that have gone wrong in nursing homes around Australia. I do not have any evidence to suggest that the things that she listed did not at one stage occur, but I think Senator Brown and those with her on that side of the chamber need to answer two questions. First of all, can she honestly say that incidents of that character did not occur during the 13 years before 1996 when the Labor Party was in government? Of course she cannot guarantee that. Secondly, can they really promise to the electors of Australia that somehow under a Labor government incidents of that kind would not occur? Of course they cannot.
The question is not whether in isolated cases around this country there are failures in the standards that we expect of our aged care system. The question is: have we done enough to lift that standard, to better fund the aged care system and to provide an adequate safety net for those who enter aged care facilities in this country? I believe that we have taken very important steps towards achieving just those goals. The fact of the matter is that we have in place across this country today, for the first time, a comprehensive accreditation system of nursing homes and aged care facilities which never existed under the previous Labor government. The fact is that in many cases we would not know whether the sorts of incidents that Senator Brown listed in her speech actually occurred, because there was not an accreditation system to pick those things up.
Today, we have standards in place. They are very high standards. Obviously, not every aged care facility in this country is able to meet those standards to the same degree as every other. We have the enormous irony of those opposite attacking the government because certain homes on occasions—I suggest fairly isolated occasions—do not meet the standards that they themselves could not be bothered to put in place when they were in government in this country for many years. You did not have those standards and now you criticise us because on occasions people in this country do not meet the standards that we have put in place.
We have required the certification of aged care facilities so that a certain standard has to be met in terms of the infrastructure and the quality of the fabric of those buildings in this country, and we have backed those demands for higher standards with funding to the aged care system to ensure that it is better able to meet those new standards. We have also of course greatly increased spending on aged care across the board in this country, including more than doubling the amount we spend on aged care by, for example, enlarging the number of places available in Australia for those who seek residential accommodation.
That is about doing something to improve the system. It is a comprehensive response to that problem. It is a response to a system which was left to us in disarray and disrepair 10 years ago when we came to office, and we make no apologies for the fact that we have made enormous strides in meeting those new standards. Senator McLucas describes this as a system which is not working. That is a disgraceful claim, and it is not borne out by the evidence. (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro, arrived late for question time today, and he may as well not have turned up at all, given his failure on at least three occasions to answer serious questions put to him by the opposition. Senator Santoro attempted to fob off the outrageous, terrible things that have been reported in recent times that have occurred in at least one nursing home in Victoria, where allegations of rape have been made. He said he is going to have a summit, he is going to have an inquiry, he is going to have a review and he is going to have a meeting of the state ministers.
Senator Santoro has recently been appointed as the minister, and it has become very obvious, through the estimates hearings two weeks ago and his performance here in question time, that he either fails to read his briefs or he is completely ignorant and fails to understand them. I suspect it might be both. It is an outrage that the minister dealing with serious issues such as this can stand in this parliament and say we should depoliticise this issue. In other words, the opposition, according to Senator Santoro, should not ask him questions regarding his responsibility as Minister for Ageing. He wants to get off scot-free.
Let us have a look at the situation to date. The Howard government have been in power for 10 years. They are making a big thing about celebrating this anniversary. In 1996 the newly elected Howard government introduced the new aged care legislation. I remember it well because I was in charge of it from the opposition benches when the debate took place in the Senate. It was a long, drawn out debate and the legislation was very detailed. The new coalition government at the time promised a new world for aged care.
Senator Patterson, who has once again made a contribution on this issue, as she has been doing for many years, talked about the supposed terrible, disgraceful years under the previous Labor government. The coalition government said they were going to change and improve things. Today in this debate Senator Patterson could not address the issues that are occurring now under this supposed new beaut system. All Senator Patterson did was once again go back to those old arguments that it was pretty bad back in the eighties, as if somehow that excuses their failure to resolve issues and ensure that standards are kept and our aged people in this country are not mistreated in nursing homes.
It is happening today and it has been happening with regularity since this government came to power. Senator Humphries a moment ago could not think of one example to point to from when we were in government, but he said: ‘There must have been some. We just assume that it happened.’ The fact is that under this government some of the most outrageous situations have occurred, and we have raised them in this parliament time and time again. We all recall the outrageous conduct in a nursing home where patients were given kerosene baths. Senator Brown in her excellent contribution told of a litany of problems that have occurred under this government. We have had situations under this supposedly great accreditation scheme where homes have been given accreditation and passed all tests one day and then three months later failed half the tests after a particular serious incident has occurred.
We now have this terrible situation where a person has been charged with the alleged rape of elderly patients in the nursing home. That is happening now under this government. You have to accept responsibility for it. You cannot walk away from it and you cannot try and point to what you think may have happened 15 years ago as some sort of an excuse. You have to start acting on this serious issue. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-02-27,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following are matters of urgency:
Telstra’s secret plans to remove at least 5 000 payphones throughout Australia, including nearly 1 300 phones in rural and regional Australia;
The revelations that under the current regulatory regime Telstra would be able to remove around 25 000 of its 32 000 payphones;
The fact that the Minister was unaware of Telstra’s plans before they were reported in the media;
Telstra’s failure to reveal these plans under questioning on the issue during Senate Estimates; and
The fact that the Government’s privatisation agenda is already resulting in telecommunications services throughout Australia being slashed.
I rise today to discuss the disturbing revelations of Telstra’s plans for its 32,000 payphones throughout Australia. Last week we learned, not through the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts but through a leak to the Australian Financial Review, that Telstra has decided to dump 5,000 payphones across the country. These cuts amount to a 15 per cent reduction in the total number of payphones operated by Telstra in Australia. More disturbingly, the impact of these service cuts will be felt most keenly in rural and regional Australia, where many areas will experience a 50 per cent reduction in the number of payphones in their area.
The loss of these payphones may not seem like a dramatic issue to the chattering classes with their offices on Collins Street. However, these payphones are a lifeline to many people in Australian society. They are an essential service to the young and the elderly in our community. Payphones are a necessity for those Australians who are unable to make use of mobile phones for either financial or coverage reasons. They are often used by those in our community who are most in need. Kids Help Line has stated that 30 per cent of the calls it receives each year are from payphones—a point that makes sense when you consider that children who are in need of this service are often not in a family environment that would allow them to make such a call from home. Anyone with a young family will appreciate the importance of payphones to enable children who are too young to be given a mobile phone to call home and ask for a lift from soccer, the movies or an unsafe situation.
Payphones are also essential for allowing the marginalised and homeless in our community to stay in contact with society. Recent developments in voice mail services have enabled homeless people to be contactable by phone through payphones, allowing them to stay in touch with potential employers, service providers and landlords. Itinerant workers in outback Australia also rely on these payphones for staying in contact with their families and employers while working in isolated areas. Telstra’s plan for its payphones will leave these vulnerable people without any options for communications services.
While it might not be obvious to some, these payphones do provide an essential community service. Unfortunately, they are not profit drivers for Telstra and, as such, post privatisation, they will be on the chopping block. This is, of course, one of the many reasons why the Labor Party opposed the privatisation of Telstra. The current management of Telstra is pursuing exactly the strategy that one would expect of a private company—the maximisation of the bottom line. The provision of essential community services is coming a poor second to propping up the share price.
We all know what has been going on with the Telstra debate. We all know that this government has been engaged in a conspiracy with the previous board and management of Telstra to dividend-strip Telstra and take the profits it had earned over the last 10 long years of the Howard government. Instead of reinvesting its profits in its own network, it has been dividend-stripped by this government. All of the money has gone to the shareholders, including the government, to prop up the share price. Despite all of that, and despite flogging off Telstra 2—T2, as it is known—for $7.40, the price of Telstra shares languishes below $4 today. So all of the efforts of the government and the previous board and management of Telstra have failed miserably to deal with the fundamental lack of investment and lack of foresight by the Telstra management. It has been an ideological binge specifically designed to prop up the share price. That is all it has been.
So it is no surprise that unprofitable but essential community services like these payphones will be the first to go post privatisation. Do not say you were not warned. Do not come into the chamber and cry crocodile tears. Did we all see the photos in the newspapers last week of Senator Coonan slamming her fist on the desk and hear her demanding to know what was going on and saying, ‘I have called in Telstra today’? And what did Sol Trujillo have to say for himself at the interview he did after that? He said, ‘Senator Coonan has given me the green light to get rid of uneconomic phones.’ As usual, the minister talked tough one day and rolled over to Telstra the next, just as has been happening for the last six months since Telstra was taken over by Mr Trujillo.
The protestations of outrage from coalition members over the past weeks have been pathetic. We have seen Senator Barnaby ‘I won’t sell Telstra under any circumstances’ Joyce trying to cover for the fact that he talked tough but that in the end ‘Backdown Barnaby’ gave in and voted for the sale of Telstra. That is why he has to cry now. That is why Senator Fiona Nash has gone missing from today’s debate. I am pleased to see in the chamber some people who I know care about some of these issues: Senator Adams, welcome. But Senator Nash and Senator Joyce have run away. Senator Ronaldson, I am sure your mum will be watching, as usual, for your contribution. You do not need my help to publicise yourself; you have your mum on the job. But, having said that, you do have a genuine interest in trying to hold Telstra to account. It is just disappointing that you have failed so miserably.
What we need is a wake-up call, and last week’s leaked document should be that wake-up call. It should be a wake-up call to Senator Robertson, Senator Adams, Senator Joyce and Senator Nash because, as we saw at the Senate estimates, we were once again completely misled by the evidence given. I have read some of Senator Adams’s comments over the weekend where she was saying, ‘I did ask a question about this.’ Funnily enough, Senator Adams, they did not tell you the truth, did they? No. And what are you going to do about it? Nothing. You are going to sit here. You will talk a lot of pious words and express a lot of outrage but, in the end, just like Senator Ronaldson, you will do nothing. You will keep telling Senator Minchin and Senator Coonan to sell it. So do not cry crocodile tears in the chamber for the people of Western Australia who are going to lose their mobile phones, because you, Senator Ronaldson, Senator Joyce and Senator Nash, are the cause of it. Each and every one of you put up your hand to sell Telstra.
The sale of Telstra was always going to result in Telstra’s management slashing services in this way. That is what private companies do. Telstra’s payphone plans are just the first wave of service cuts that will occur as a result of the Telstra sale. Labor warned that a privatised Telstra would leave town faster than the banks and it is now doing so at a breakneck speed. It was inevitable that a fully privatised Telstra would cut back essential services in favour of fattening up the bottom line. Liberal and National MPs who voted for the privatisation of Telstra now have to accept the consequences of their votes with no crocodile tears. They should be honest with the electorate and accept responsibility for the inevitable results of what they voted for. Crocodile tears from the communications minister, Senator Coonan, will do nothing to lessen the impact of these service cuts on their communities. The only thing that will save services for those communities is for the government to abandon its extreme privatisation agenda. So, if you want to make a difference, Senator Ronaldson, to the communities that you or Senator Adams are going to cry for, stand up today and say, ‘It’s time the government had a rethink.’ That is the only thing that is going to save these phones—nothing else.
Unfortunately, Telstra’s secret plan to dump 5,000 payphones post privatisation is just the tip of the problem. The documents obtained by the Financial Review reveal that Telstra originally planned to dump 25,000 of its 30,000 payphones—that is 25,000 out of 30,000—and believe that the existing regulations do not stop them. That is the truly frightening part of this, and you all signed up to it. That is what Telstra believe, and the minister was given the opportunity in question time today to say, ‘No, that is wrong.’ Telstra believe the existing regulations will allow them to dump up to 25,000 payphones in Australia. When the minister had the chance to deny that, she went missing again. Senator Coonan today gave the green light to Telstra to slash and burn payphones in this country. Sol Trujillo has admitted it again. He is quite an honest man, Sol. He is not interested in the misleading attempts by some senators in this chamber to pretend that they care. Sol says it as he sees it. He repeats what he is told. Senator Coonan in question time today gave a green light to Telstra to slash and burn payphones in Australia. That is a fact. That is what Hansard will show.
The universal service obligation, a law that is supposed to guarantee a minimum level of basic service for Australians, currently allows the number of payphones in Australia to be reduced by more than 80 per cent. The universal service obligation that the government intends to enforce on Telstra is a plan that, as I said, allows payphones to be slashed by 80 per cent. Incredibly, the local presence plan, which the government claims ensures Telstra’s presence in the bush, does nothing to prevent the number of payphones in rural and regional Australia being cut by up to 50 per cent in many areas. That is right, believe it or not: Senator Coonan’s local presence plan does nothing to stop a 50 per cent cut of payphones in many regional and rural centres. In light of these revelations, the Howard government’s claim that the government would be able to ensure that a fully privatised Telstra maintained adequate services in the bush now lies in ruins. If the government has been unable to guarantee the provision of an essential service like payphones post privatisation, what other services can Australians expect to be slashed in the coming years?
Telstra executive Kate McKenzie belled the cat when she stated that the government’s new regulation to protect service levels in rural and regional Australia will ‘achieve very little except more words on paper’. So do not let us have any crocodile tears today, Senator Ronaldson and Senator Adams. Telstra is making it perfectly clear that it is nothing more than words on paper. The government’s local presence plan has been proven by this debacle to be completely useless. The plan does not include one single binding commitment from Telstra to maintain service levels and has not deterred Telstra from planning to slash these payphone services in the slightest. That is just the truth—not one single binding commitment from Telstra.
What has been the response of the Howard government to these cuts? It has not abandoned its extreme privatisation agenda that is driving the cuts. It has not acted to actually give teeth to Telstra’s local presence obligations and include some binding commitments from the company with respect to service levels. No! We do not want to bind Telstra to meet their obligations. Instead, the minister, Senator Helen Coonan, has asked Telstra to provide her with a list of the phone booths that it intends to remove. When we asked for it to be tabled, when we asked for the map, when we asked in question time today for the list of 5,000 phone booths to go, the minister joined the cover-up. The minister would not table the list or the map because she is engaged in rolling over to Telstra, and it would be too embarrassing. So, instead of acting to stop these service cuts, the minister is asking Telstra to tell her in advance the services that it is going to slash. Maybe this is just so that it can make sure that it is in as few marginal government seats as possible. I am a cynic. Come clean, Senator Coonan. Do not cover this up. Come clean with the Australian community. Let us have the map, let us have the list and bring on the debate. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-02-27,"—Senator Conroy says he is a cynic, and I suspect he is also someone with a very short memory because, when it was last in office, the Labor Party’s regional telecommunications record was one of neglect and utter disinterest in the need to provide modern telecommunications to the people of regional Australia.
Under Labor, consumer safeguards of today, like the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee, simply did not exist. These and other consumer and regulatory safeguards will remain in place under this government regardless of the ownership of Telstra. Under the Labor governments of Hawke and Keating, before the Howard government’s introduction of the consumer service guarantee, some consumers could wait more than two years just to have a telephone service connected. Now, under the Howard government, consumers are guaranteed a connection within 20 working days. What a major transformation that is! Given its previous abysmal record, the Labor Party’s new-found interest in regional telecommunications is certainly welcome, but I must say it is something of a surprising development.
Turning to the specific issue of payphones, the government acknowledges that access to payphones is an important community service, particularly for those of a low socioeconomic status who may not be able to afford a fixed-line or mobile connection and for people in remote areas that do not have access to mobile telephone services.
That is why the government has made the supply, installation and maintenance of payphones part of the universal service obligation. That means that these payphone services have to be supplied as part of the USO. Having said that, it should be acknowledged that payphones are no longer as crucial as they once were. Today, mobile telephones and mobile telephone coverage are far more readily available throughout this country. This is highlighted by the increasing trend of people to dump their fixed line connection and rely solely on their mobile phone.
Thanks to Howard government policies, mobile phone penetration now exceeds 90 per cent of the Australian population, with close to 19 million mobile phone subscriptions. The government’s subsidies to extend coverage to small and remote communities and along national highways mean that 98 per cent of the population of Australia now has mobile phone coverage. This means that demand for payphone services has declined. Indeed, Senator Conroy might care to inform the Senate of the last time he used a payphone.
Telstra operates some 32,000 payphone terminals in Australia. It has decided to remove 950 payphones, with a further 4,050 under review. I would ask that the Senate not rush to criticism but examine the detail of Telstra’s proposal. According to advice from Telstra, nearly all of the 950 payphones will be removed from sites where there are multiple payphones, and planned removals are in areas that are under-utilised and where other commercial services are available. Importantly, none of the approximately 7,500 payphones covered by the universal service obligation will be removed.
David Moffatt, Group Managing Director of Telstra Consumer and Marketing, said:
Telstra is not considering removing pay phones required for public health and safety reasons, stand-alone pay phones in remote areas, or those subsidised by the universal service obligation.
A large number of the pay phones we are considering removing are in metropolitan areas on sites with more than one phone. Of the remainder, the majority are located on private property and could be replaced by privately owned pay phones.
Senator Conroy might be interested to know that there has actually been a slight increase in the number of Telstra payphones provided in rural and regional Australia in recent years. More importantly, most of the payphones removed in recent years have been in urban locations, where there are alternatives readily available.
The government will insist that no-one is disadvantaged by having a payphone removed from their community, and Telstra has assured the government that, when it intends to remove any single-site payphone, it will conduct a three-month consultation process, with stickers placed on the phone. People concerned about the loss of a payphone service will be able to contact Telstra in order to provide the company with feedback on that proposed loss.
Senator Conroy has asserted that the government’s privatisation agenda has resulted in the slashing of telecommunications services throughout Australia. Personally, I would have thought a Labor senator would not want to go there, given Labor’s record on deficient services in regional areas of Australia. It is undeniable that today’s telecommunications services are far superior to how they were when the Howard government first came to office. There have been a number of telecommunications reviews, and the government has responded with a range of relevant initiatives to improve telecommunications services and infrastructure around Australia. Prior to the recent announcement of the $1.1 billion Connect Australia package and the $2 billion Communications Fund, the government had already spent more than $1 billion on telecommunications services since 1997 in rural and regional Australia alone. From 1997 to mid-2005, the government directed $1.016 billion in funding to regional telecommunications.
Following the successful passage of the T3 legislation, the government has, as I said, invested $2 billion into a communications future fund in order to future-proof telecommunications services in rural, regional and remote Australia. Spending from that Communications Fund will be tied to independent and regular reviews of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia. The first review will be conducted in 2008, with further reviews to follow every three years. This is hardly a story of neglect of the need of people in regional Australia to have good telecommunications services.
The $1.1 billion Connect Australia package, also announced not so long ago, will roll out affordable broadband connections to people living in regional, rural and remote Australia, as well as further extending mobile telephone coverage, building new regional communications networks and establishing vital telecommunications services for remote Indigenous communities.
Let us not forget, and let us make the point very strongly, that Telstra is going to remain in rural and regional Australia because, in August 2005, the government imposed a licence condition on the company requiring it to maintain a local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. That means—among other things—that, under the universal service obligation, payphones in regional, rural and remote Australia will be maintained.
In conclusion, far from the government’s privatisation agenda resulting in reductions in services to regional Australia, it has to be said that the people of regional Australia are reaping the benefits of improved services, thanks to Howard government policies. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-27,"—I rise to join in this debate on this important urgency motion relating to Telstra’s announcement about removing payphones around Australia—or, at least, what we have heard about Telstra’s plans to do so. When the Democrats opposed the privatisation of Telstra—the very many tranches of the Telstra sell-off, including the most recent one which made that complete—we warned that Telstra would put shareholder interests ahead of the national interest and that the government’s framework to protect the universal service obligation and ensure the bush had state-of-the-art services was very flawed. Just six months later, Telstra, without informing the government, are pursuing plans to slash payphones in key areas around Australia. I think this is a clear indication that Telstra are putting shareholder interests above national interests. I also imagine this is only the beginning.
Telstra’s obligation to provide payphones is one element of its universal service obligation. The USO, as it is called, is provided for in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act. One object of the act is that the fulfilment of this universal service obligation should generally be open to competition among carriers and carriage service providers. To this end, the TCPSS Act gives the minister the power to designate a universal service provider with primary responsibility for delivery of the USO, and secondary USO providers for particular services in particular service areas.
Telstra is the current universal service provider for the payphone service obligation for Australia. Loss-making payphones are subsidised through the USO levy. But, according to the Australian Communications Authority in its Payphone Policy Review, published in February last year, payphones provided by Telstra in response to this obligation comprise about 50 per cent of all payphones in Australia, the other 50 per cent being provided on a commercial basis. Given the government’s privatisation agenda, clearly the government must reconsider how it deals with aspects of telecommunications that are in the national interest.
Access to payphones and other telecommunications services such as broadband is critical for the vast majority of Australians, especially for people in rural and remote areas, Indigenous communities, children, overseas tourists and the many Australians who cannot afford mobiles or who simply choose not to use them. I do not think we can stress enough that, with the development of the market for mobile phones, it is the case that payphones are no doubt used far less often than they once were. But I would argue that that does not diminish the responsibility for providing them and that payphones will be used by people in emergency situations, people who do not have a mobile phone and people who may not have a phone at home. The necessity to keep them in those areas so people have access to them has not diminished. These payphones may not be commercially viable; they may not be commercially profitable; nonetheless, that does not mean that Telstra should be entitled to remove them from where they are currently located. At the very least, the communities around which these payphones exist should be consulted, and the removal of any payphone should be with the consensus of the local community. Quite frankly, I doubt very much that that consensus would be reached.
I was interested this week in the comments made by communications expert Paul Budde. He argued that the government should be considering mobile alternatives: turning phone booths into information terminals with access to government services connected with social problems, employment and a whole range of other services that are rapidly becoming difficult to access by telephone. If you need a job and you do not have access to the internet, you are out of luck. If you are homeless and you do not have a mobile phone, the same applies. I think Mr Budde’s idea is an excellent example of a potential whole-of-government approach to community services. I strongly encourage the government to both talk with Telstra about their proposals—in fact, require Telstra to talk to the government about their proposals—and focus on some of the interesting ideas that have come up.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The Howard government disregarded the views of more than 70 per cent of Australians when it voted to go ahead with the privatisation of Telstra—more than 70 per cent of Australians who know that a privatised Telstra is all about profits, not people. Both Liberal and National Party MPs voted for the privatisation of Telstra. We raised the issues of concern on this side of the chamber. We said that a privatised Telstra would inevitably increase prices and desert communities if it could not make a profit, and those on the opposite side of the chamber did not agree. And now we learn that Telstra is secretly moving along the road of its cost-cutting program with its plans to axe 5,000 payphones throughout Australia, a devastating blow to thousands of Australians living in cities and in regional and rural Australia for whom these phones are in many ways a lifeline.
Telstra’s secret plans to do away with 5,000 payphones—so secret are their plans that apparently even the minister was not informed of them—demonstrate how inadequate the government will really be in ensuring a fully privatised Telstra maintains adequate services for all Australians. Payphones are an essential service to many in our community, particularly the elderly, the young, the homeless, the socially disadvantaged and many in regional and rural Australia, including those travelling through these areas. For many who use payphones, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this is their only form of timely communication. The availability of payphones in emergency situations must be considered with regard to both safety and lifesaving applications.
We have previously heard arguments about the country’s high mobile penetration rate, but there exist genuine reasons for concern about the proposed reduction of pay telephones across Australia. Senator Conroy has already raised the issue of the Kids Help Line. A submission to the review of payphone policy in 2003 from Kids Help Line—a 24-hour national telephone counselling service for children and young people aged five to 18 years—highlighted the vital role of pay telephones in providing access to the service. Kids Help Line counsellors play a role in intervention and crisis intervention, responding to concerns about suicide, mental health issues, child abuse, homelessness, pregnancy, grief, bullying, domestic violence and drug and alcohol use. To quote from the submission:
Payphones play a significant role in facilitating children and young people’s access to the KHL telephone service. Each year, Kids Help Line answers over 400,000 calls from children and young people from all parts of Australia. In the 2003 financial year, KHL counsellors answered 461,000 calls. Approximately 30% of these calls are made from payphones.
The report further highlights that 56 per cent of calls regarding homelessness, 44 per cent relating to violent assault, 39 per cent relating to sexual harassment, 36 per cent relating to physical abuse and domestic violence and 28 per cent relating to sexual abuse were from payphones. Again I draw your attention to the fact these calls on payphones are made by children and young people. When Telstra surveys the use of payphones, it must be remembered that children under the age of 15 are not included in the surveys. The removal of payphones will have a considerable impact on access to these and other services for many in our communities.
Another submission, this one from Women with Disabilities Australia, also claimed significant importance of the availability of payphones, stating that women with disabilities are more likely to be dependent on payphones for communication with friends and family and in emergencies than any other group. The submission highlights reliability, availability and accessibility of payphones as being of vital importance to women with disabilities. With regard to the future, particularly relating to the issue of mobile phones, cost is raised as a barrier for many people with disabilities who are living on the disability pension and also for people with low dexterity, who would have difficulty operating a mobile phone.
The removal of the 5,000 pay telephones is just the beginning of what we can expect from a privatised Telstra. And what of our guarantee of service? Telstra’s universal service obligation in relation to payphones is:
... to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible on an equitable basis to all people in Australia, no matter where they live or conduct business. Telstra’s obligation extends to the supply, installation and maintenance of Telstra operated payphones in Australia, including the process for ... resolution of any complaints about the location of payphones.
Note that it says ‘reasonably accessible’ and ‘on an equitable basis’. What this government fails to comprehend is that what Australians want is affordable and accessible telecommunications across all of Australia, and this includes access to pay telephones. What we have is a plan to remove 5,000 payphones, including 1,289 in rural areas, with some areas in rural and regional Australia losing up to 50 per cent of their payphones. And how does Telstra tell the Australian people that the payphones are to be lost to their community? By marking the targeted phones with a sticker claiming the phone is to be relocated, when the reality is, in some cases, that it will be removed and not replaced.
According to a report in Monday’s Financial Review, which appears to have more information than the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had at that stage, a Telstra Country Wide briefing note:
... reveals a strategy to minimise consultation with local governments over the move, divert complaints and avoid media scrutiny.
According to the article, the briefing note reveals that Telstra had investigated a proposal to remove more than 25,000 payphones but were concerned about the potential political backlash. If we go to the Telstra website, we will find a heading citing criteria for public payphones, and in that section it says:
In making a decision as to whether a request for a Telstra operated payphone is justified, Telstra will have regard to the following factors:
whether the request meets the criteria ... for Telstra to fulfil its universal service obligation, or can be commercially justified …
This government has failed to listen to the Australian public and has pursued its extreme ideological agenda to privatise Telstra at the expense of those people who rely on it the most: rural and regional Australians and the socially disadvantaged in our cities and suburbs.
Let us consider some of the targeted areas, according to the table printed in the paper. In my home state of South Australia, in the south-east, Mount Gambier will lose 122 payphones, Port Lincoln 112 payphones and Adelaide 334 payphones. In New South Wales, Albury will lose 192 payphones, Newcastle 55 payphones, Sydney—north, south, east and west—985 payphones and Goulburn 273 payphones. In Queensland, Brisbane will lose 274 payphones, Rockhampton 125 payphones and Toowoomba 76 payphones. In Victoria, the Melbourne area will lose a total of 749 payphones. In Western Australia, Perth will lose 203 and Kalgoorlie 43 payphones. In the Northern Territory, Darwin will lose 147 payphones. In Tasmania, Hobart will lose 49 payphones and Launceston 107.
Telstra has targeted thousands of jobs in rural and regional Australia, and now our payphone services are being targeted. It appears the minister supports this rationalisation of services. The government previously accused Labor of scaremongering about the impact of the privatisation of Telstra. Well, we are not even there yet and we have information being made available to journalists—a Telstra briefing note—revealing cuts to payphone services that the minister was not even aware of. This was a document detailing 5,000 payphones being slashed, removed from the communities. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-02-27,"—I have heard some quite remarkable speeches from Senator Conroy, but today’s was an absolute doozy: dripping in insincerity. There are some on this side who do not like Senator Conroy; I think he is sometimes so silly and so insincere that he is almost lovable. That was a speech which, I am sure, he will have no pride in re-reading. In fact, I rather suspect that he will not re-read it, because he does not believe one single word of it.
I think what is quite clear today is that this is not a matter about payphones. Senator Wortley admitted it and let the cat out of the bag: this debate is about the privatisation of Telstra. It comes from an opposition that is desperately trying to claw back some public goodwill. The most remarkable part of today was that it was led by someone who is spending not one single minute in regional and rural Australia. He has spent every waking hour rolling candidates from the Left in Victoria.
—In downtown Melbourne.
—In downtown Melbourne. He is not spending any time in regional and rural Australia. He is quite comfortably ensconced down there at 4 Treasury Place, and he does not go out. He has no idea what the requirements of regional and rural Australia are. I look in this chamber today and I see myself, Senator Adams and Senator Eggleston—who spends a lot of time in regional and rural Western Australia—who have some understanding of it. The Australian Labor Party could not even get someone who has got any background in regional and rural Australia to come into this chamber and talk on this matter today.
I want to go back to some of the points that Senator Conroy made. This was a privatisation debate, not a payphone debate. The payphones were just the excuse. I want to read to the Senate—as I have done on numerous occasions—comments made by Senator Conroy about privatisation. He came into the chamber today pleading on behalf of Australians that privatisation is a bad policy for Australia and that Australians do not support it. On 16 August last year, on the Jon Faine show, Senator Conroy said:
It makes no difference to the majority of Australians one way or the other about the ownership structure.
Those are the words of the man who came in today, and Senator Wortley joined in as well, and started to beat up on the outcome of privatisation. Then he had the gall and the temerity to talk about the Commonwealth Bank and to compare this with the banks leaving town. Who sold the Commonwealth Bank? Who sat back and watched the banks leave country towns all over Australia—and did absolutely nothing about it? The Australian Labor Party was responsible for that. Which party unilaterally did away with analog and did not have an appropriate regime in place to replace it? The Australian Labor Party. I have not heard one person from the Australian Labor Party apologise for what they made regional and rural Australians go through in that analog debacle. It was a debacle, and not one word of apology was given.
The big difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition is that we put in place mechanisms to support regional and rural Australians. Senator Eggleston talked very articulately about the amount of money that we have put into regional and rural Australia, and I will go through that again in a moment.
What I want to talk about now is the ‘secret plans’ by Telstra that the Labor Party have been talking about. It is as if the Labor Party had stumbled across something that fell off the back of a truck. I have here the briefing that they are carrying on about: a Telstra press release. Congratulations! How secret is that? The Telstra press release has fallen off the back of a truck and the Labor Party are quoting from that. Get serious! They are going out and spreading the story amongst the media that this is some secret plan. It is not secret; there is a media release from Telstra. I say to the Labor Party: let us debate the payphone issue, but let us not clothe it in some semblance of secrecy and act as if you have gone out and cleverly got something. Telstra have said what their plans are; if you want to talk about that, I am happy to do so.
I would have thought that the very least that Senator Conroy could do today would be to make up his mind about how many payphones there are in Australia. In the space of about two hours, between lodging this urgency motion and asking a question at question time today, there seems to be a difference of about 2,000 payphones. Senator Conroy could at least get his facts right in relation to that. Senator Stephens alleged quite falsely in question time that the majority of the reductions in payphones were in regional and rural Australia. With the greatest respect, Senator Stephens, that is not right. If you want to debate this, that is okay. We on this side are happy to debate it. But please do not come in here and make statements which are quite clearly incorrect and have no veracity at all.
As Senator Eggleston said, there are plans for some 950 payphones to go. There are some 400-odd which are being looked at. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has said quite rightly—because she is a great supporter of the payphone requirement under the universal service obligation—that those phones are untouchable. The USO payphones are untouchable. Telstra will not be touching those payphones. The minister has quite rightly insisted on Telstra going through a community consultation process in relation to the removal of payphones. I do not think there is one person in Australia who would not agree that, if a phone is not being used, it is costing a lot of money and there are other alternatives, that payphone need not remain.
I think it was back in 2004 when there was an inquiry by the Australian Communications Authority into payphone policy. The ACA found that, in the main, this policy was working well. They made some suggestions, for example, in relation to Indigenous Australians. The government responded to that. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-02-27,"—I support the urgency motion moved by Senator Conroy. It is important that this chamber debate the direction that Telstra is going, which is highlighted by the plan to reduce the number of payphones in Australia. The direction is the same as that being taken by the government—as we reflect this year on 10 years of the current government being in office. I have been here for all of those 10 years, and it has been a period in which the rich have got richer much faster than the poor. And the gap between the rich and the poor, despite the arguments coming from elsewhere, has grown. The wherewithal of the poor has not expanded anywhere near as fast as the galloping ability of the very rich for consumption.
This has been highlighted over the weekend with the announcement by the Treasurer that two people representing the wealthy will look at what changes could be made to the government’s taxation regimen. One has no doubt that that will be concocted to reduce the need for the wealthy to contribute, as they have in the past under the rules of the past, towards the benefits that all Australians gain from not just having a democratic country but the semblance of an egalitarian country where basic needs are met. This debate today is about removing a basic right. The removal of access to payphones for the poorest Australians or those in greatest need deprives them of a right which wealthy Australians take for granted at all times no matter where they are.
I wonder just how many people in executive authority in Telstra, let alone those in this chamber these days, have used a payphone this year. Very few, I will guarantee. I know we get Telstra cards, which enable us to use payphones. But I wonder how many members even get Telstra cards these days. We get them free of charge; the public does not. But they are very important as far as I am concerned because I do travel quite a lot in rural Tasmania. I know the value of that service, particularly if you are out of range of a mobile phone. I could bank on the need for that service being so much greater if you happen to be an isolated person who may or may not be rearing a family, who occasionally reflects on whether they are going to need emergency assistance at some time and where the nearest payphone is, if they are not able to afford a conventional phone.
We are seeing a great move to mobile phones, but they are still an expensive component of the poor people’s budget in Australia. I wonder who is assessing that. In this country we need to assure the basic right to communications, because it is a basic right for all Australians. When we start removing payphones from rural and suburban Australia, we are starting to erode those rights. Certainly there will come a time when for some reason a local population moves on and there is not the need for the same infrastructure. But that is rare in Australia these days. In fact, the opposite is occurring: there is somewhat of a drift to the bush. So I support the motion. I think that, at the very least—and other speakers have said this—the government must direct Telstra, as far as it can, to conduct seminars in the local areas where these phones are to be removed. Not just a sticker in a phone box but the announcement of a meeting, with Telstra personnel present, to discuss the removal of that payphone is when we will get a little democracy back into this process of high-handed decisions being made in the velvet lined boardrooms of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-02-27,"—I wish to address Senator Conroy’s matter of urgency in relation to the provision of payphones by Telstra throughout Australia. The government has made the supply, installation and maintenance of payphones part of the universal service obligation. We have done this because we recognise that access to payphones is an important community service, and those opposite have described this very well. Under the USO, Telstra is required to make payphones ‘reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis’. This is backed up by detailed rules on how Telstra will remove and relocate payphones, as well as its service quality and fault rectification standards. I spoke at length on this at Senate estimates. I said:
I would consider that surely it is a social obligation, and Telstra is the only provider in the area that I am talking about. There is no way those phones are going to be profitable, but they should be there.
And Mr Pinel from Telstra said:
If they are captured by the universal service obligation, then we have an obligation to provide them. As I say, I am happy to take the specifics from you and explore the issues. If there are community issues that we need to take into consideration that we have not already, I am happy to give you that undertaking.
So I was very happy with that reply. For Senator Conroy’s information, the local presence plan has not been finalised. This plan will protect payphones.
Failure to comply with the USO or the rules is a breach of the Telecommunications Act and carries significant penalties. Telstra is paid a subsidy to allow it to provide non-commercial standard fixed line and payphone services. There are at least 7,500 payphones covered by the USO—most of them in rural Australia. Telstra has advised that nearly all of the 950 payphones earmarked for possible removal will be from sites where there are multiple payphones and that planned removals are in areas that are underutilised and where there are other commercial services available. I have a list of those payphones that are being looked at in Western Australia, and I must agree with their statement because a lot of them are with mining companies, there is a lot of duplication and people are no longer living in some of those areas.
The number of payphones is at odds with Senator Conroy’s claims of 5,000 payphones throughout Australia being earmarked for removal, including nearly 1,300 in rural and regional Australia. I can inform the Senate that under no circumstances will payphones be removed from areas where the USO requires them to be. The minister for communications, Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan, has affirmed that the government considers payphones an essential community service. As a fellow rural senator, I know she understands the importance of payphone services to country areas. She was quoted in the Age of 21 February 2006 as saying she:
... wants to make sure that no-one is disadvantaged by having a payphone removed from their community.
She underlined this position when she stated:
The message is loud and clear that the Government will not see people in rural and regional areas stranded without a payphone.
Not everyone has access to mobile phone services. This particularly applies to senior citizens living in rural areas and regional towns who are not always comfortable with mobile phone technology, may not appreciate the higher costs involved with using mobile phones or do not have mobile coverage in their area. On this last point, the need for payphones is particularly important in small towns where the mobile phone coverage is not dependable or is nonexistent.
Whilst I know that this situation will be alleviated to a very large extent in time because of this government’s huge financial commitment to improving communication services in the bush, the fact remains that at the present time many people in country areas depend on the local payphone. It is a lifeline for people who for whatever reason do not have access to either a mobile phone or a residential landline phone. In that situation, many people, both young and elderly, depend on that payphone down on the main street of the town to link them to the wider world to conduct business on a multitude of different matters. By her comments, the honourable minister not only has demonstrated her understanding of these people’s needs but is committed to protecting their access to a payphone.
Last week I travelled to the Northern Territory with other members of the Community Affairs References Committee as part of our inquiry into petrol sniffing in remote areas of Australia. As part of this trip, we flew by charter plane to Yuendumu, a remote Aboriginal community 460 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs, and then travelled by troop carrier for a further two hours to Mt Theo, an out-station off the Tanami Road. I have been to some remote places in my time, but it does not get much more remote than Mt Theo in Central Australia. There, to my amazement, in the middle of a small cluster of buildings was their lifeline and link to the outside world—a solar-powered Telstra payphone. I could not help being struck by the fact that this was an essential link being provided by Telstra to this small community in this remote corner of Australia using the most up-to-date technology available—so much so that I took several photos of the phone box.
There is another side to this: unfortunately, this payphone and the one in Yuendumu were jammed with coins and could only be operated by a phone card. It was reported two months ago, and they have still not been fixed. I intend to follow this issue up personally with Telstra and remind them of their obligation to these communities.
In the past ten years, the coalition government has invested more than $1 billion in rural and regional telecommunications, meaning regional and rural Australians now have more access than ever before to high-quality, modern telecommunications. To future-proof telecommunications services, a $2 billion dedicated Communications Fund has been established and is administered by an independent board. The $2 billion of capital in the fund will be invested to deliver an income stream to fund the government’s responses to the recommendations made by legislated regular reviews of regional, rural and remote telecommunications services.

RESPONSE BY PROFESSOR BARBARA POCOCK PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(b) OF THE SENATE OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988
On 29th November 2005 in question time Senator Abetz, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, said that I had misled parliament. He went on to question my independence calling me ‘supposedly independent’.
Specifically, Senator Abetz referred to my appearance before the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee’s Inquiry into the Work Choices Bill. Senator Abetz said that I had ‘failed to disclose union-funded research totalling well over $500,000. She also failed to disclose a period of full-time work with the United Trades and Labour Council and two years working for the former leader of the Australian Democrats.’
I regard the statement that I failed to disclose facts to a committee of the Parliament as a serious allegation. My reputation as a reliable person who does not lie or mislead is of great importance to me, both professionally and personally.
Senator Abetz is factually wrong on the three charges of ‘failing to disclose’ that he levels at me under privilege. These facts are easily tested by reference to public sources and to Hansard.
Since 1987 I have received funds from the ACTU for research projects (including ACTU contributions to research projects funded in the main by the Australian Research Council) to the value of $55,000 ($30,000 for research on long hours of work, $5,000 for research on precarious employment and a $20,000 contribution to an ARC Linkage grant).
I have received research funds of $87,000 for other union-linked projects. This includes the project I mentioned to the Committee that I am undertaking with unions on the effects of low pay, to which union organisations are contributing funds of $72,000 (much less than my estimate before the Senate Committee).
Since 1987 my research has been supported by funds of over $1.4 million. Of this, only 10 per cent is made up of funds from union sources ($142,000). This is close to the level of support I have received from non-ARC government bodies (federal, state and local), and less than support from large corporations. This is well below the $500,000 alleged by Senator Abetz. The bulk of support for my research has come from competitively won, peer-assessed ARC grants through the Commonwealth Government.
Over my twenty years of active research I have undertaken significant projects on vocational education, industry restructuring, industrial relations theory, work and family, family friendly conditions in Aboriginal legal services, work/life balance, part-time and casual work, equal pay, and women’s employment, as well as women’s representation in unions and union reform.
Senator Abetz implies that having received funds from unions, I am no longer independent. In fact, I have been a critic of many union activities as my publications show. However, my research often pursues analysis of employment issues as they affect the disadvantaged, including the low paid and women. These issues are also of obvious concern to trade unions. This coincidence of concern explains union support for my research into low pay, long hours and precarious employment and their effects upon Australian workers and their families. It does not, however, mean that I am a paid advocate for unions, just as I do not become a spokesperson for a corporation or a Commonwealth government agency when they contract me to research a particular issue. I guard the independence of my analysis with vigour. However, this is the conflation that Senator Abetz suggests. It is wrong.
The second allegation that Senator Abetz makes is that I failed to disclose that I had worked for ‘a period of full-time work with the United Trades and Labour Council and two years working for the former leader of the Australian Democrats’. As is readily apparent from public web sources (including my own web site and that of the University of Adelaide), I worked for the United Trades and Labour Council from 1986-88 and for Senator Stott Despoja for fourteen months in 2001-02. I have also worked—and for longer periods—for the Reserve Bank of Australia and the NSW Government and, for the last seventeen years, as a university academic. I did not disclose any of these facts to the Senate Committee for the simple reason that I was not asked. To suggest that I ‘failed to disclose’ my employment history is disingenuous to say the very least.
Senator Abetz makes his misstatements in an attempt to undermine my reputation as an independent researcher. He fails to acknowledge that I have been an academic for seventeen years and my research has been widely published in Australia and internationally. It has been funded from many sources, and I have received seven ARC funded projects following a rigorous process of peer-review. I have a national and international reputation as an expert on industrial relations, best exemplified by my Queen Elizabeth II Research Fellowship 2003-2007.
My research is on the public record and has been for many years. However, Senator Abetz’s attempts to malign my reputation were made a short time after I represented, with others, the shared grave concerns of 151 Australian academic experts about the Government’s Work Choices Bill before the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee. At that appearance, Hansard records that Senator Murray suggested that questions from Government Senators about sources of funding for my research were ‘McCarthyist stuff’. This is a suggestion which deserves close study. It will not affect my own efforts to bring research evidence to bear on questions of public importance in Australia, and I hope that it will not affect other researchers, whose work should be considered on its merits, not sullied by factually inaccurate personal attacks made under privilege in our parliaments.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 extends measures which were implemented on a trial basis for the 2001 census. This followed a report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—yet another very impressive committee report, I might say, which reflects the important role of parliamentary committees, which is much underestimated by the current government.
—I remember what Mr Keating said about them.
—We remember what you used to say about them and how little regard you have for them after 10 long years in office, Senator. The report, entitled Saving our census and preserving our history, recommended retaining name-identified census information for future research with appropriate safeguards. The amendments increase penalties for breeches of secrecy in relation to information entrusted to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The maximum two-year penalty comes into line with compatible offences in other Commonwealth legislation and reinforces the seriousness of the unauthorised disclosure of personal information gathered under the act.
The main purpose of the bill is to codify the circumstances in which name-identified information collected in the 2006 census and all subsequent censuses may be obtained by the ABS and stored by the National Archives of Australia. The bill sets out that name-identified information will only be retained for those households which provide explicit consent. I want to emphasise that. It will only be retained for those households which provide explicit consent, and the information will only be released after a closed-access period of 99 years. Again, I want to emphasise that: information will only be released after a closed-access period of 99 years and where the household has provided explicit consent. Prior to the 2001 census, all name-identified information from past censuses has been destroyed once processing was complete.
For privacy reasons and to encourage households to consent, the name-identified information should not be available for any purpose within a 99-year closed-access period, including access by a court, tribunal or other government agency. The closed-access period of 99 years contained in this bill is much longer than the usual 30 years for most archived material, as specified in the Archives Act 1983. I can think of one example. We have the release of cabinet information after, I think, a 30-year period—the 30-year rule. You could argue that that is certainly much more sensitive in terms of name identification and the information that is released on a specific name basis. Here we are dealing with persons in the community and the release of information with their explicit consent after 99 years.
The bill makes some consequential amendments to the Census and Statistics Act 1905 which arise from the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and some amendments to the criminal provisions of the Census and Statistics Act which harmonise the criminal provisions of the CSA with the Criminal Code in accordance with recommendations received from the Director of Public Prosecutions. Amendments are made to existing provisions in the Census and Statistics Act to make a refusal or failure to fill out a form or answer a question when directed to do so by notice in writing a strict liability offence. The office of the DPP has indicated that, prior to the commencement of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, the offence outlined in section 14 of the Census and Statistics Act was understood and accepted to be a strict liability offence. The intent of the amendment is to restore strict liability to the offence and bring it into line with the general principles of criminal responsibility in chapter 2 of the Criminal Code.
The penalty for a breach is one penalty unit, and strict liability is considered to be appropriate in this instance to encourage compliance. Amendments are also made along similar lines in respect of existing provisions that make it an offence to provide false or misleading statements in relation to a request or direction for statistical information in accordance with the act. However, the existing penalty, which is lower than the equivalent provided by the Criminal Code, will be retained.
Further amendments are to be made to the secrecy provisions of the Census and Statistics Act to harmonise with the offences under the Criminal Code. Amendments are also made to the applicable penalties. The current sanction is equivalent to 50 penalty units or two years imprisonment. However, this is inconsistent with the fine/penalty ratio of five penalty units to one month imprisonment in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914. The bill proposes an increase in the penalty to 120 penalty units, which would be consistent with the application of the ratio to the two-year term of imprisonment. This would also bring the penalty into line with compatible offences in other Commonwealth legislation and reinforce the seriousness of the issue in relation to the protection of information entrusted to the Australian Statistician and the officers of the Australia Bureau of Statistics.
Speaking on behalf of the Labor Party, we believe that census data is very important. It is very important that this material is collected. It is very important to the long-term economic and social planning of the country, amongst other things. I understand the Democrats are to move an amendment to prevent the Australian Statistician or ABS officers from disclosing census information to any government agency under any circumstances. We believe that that is an inappropriate amendment, for the reasons I have outlined. We do not see good reason to support the Democrat amendment. It is true that the secrecy of census information is important to encourage people to provide truthful answers without fear, but there is no reason why people cannot consent to make that information available to researchers via the National Archives after 99 years. We see the safeguards and the balances presented in this piece of legislation as appropriate. We will be supporting the bill and we will not be supporting the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>CENSUS INFORMATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-27,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005. This bill amends the Census and Statistics Act 1905 and the Archives Act 1983 with the purpose of ensuring the preservation of name-identified information collected from those households that provide explicit consent at the coming census this year and in all subsequent censuses. The information is intended to be used for future genealogical and other research following its retention for a closed-access period of 99 years.
The bill follows the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report called Saving our census and preserving our history. That report and that inquiry came out of, if you like, a lot of lobbying and agitation in various sections of the community for something along these lines. I should note the work of former Democrat senator Vicki Bourne from New South Wales in highlighting the views about the desirability of this bill. It is also worth noting the concerns directed at this bill by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who are concerned that the retention of name-identified information may negatively affect the primary purpose of the census. Whilst the preservation of information for a century down the track for genealogical and other sorts of historical research is valuable, that is not of course the core purpose of the census. This is, if you like, an attempt to get a positive by-product out of the census for people 100 years down the track.
The core purpose of the census is the collection of accurate statistical data for today through the encouragement of completely full and open responses from the public. One of the concerns expressed by the ABS has been that, despite the giving of consent by individuals in relation to this information, answers provided may be less than comprehensive and totally complete if there is that seed in the backs of their minds—that is, that it is less than 100 per cent confidential—because in the past the identifying information was destroyed once the statistical data had been extracted. As consent will presumably not be limited to certain questions, there is the possibility that, while individuals will have no problem honestly answering some questions, they may object to, or even subconsciously resist, supplying complete information for others.
Another issue that may arise from an arrangement such as that provided for in this bill is consent. It has been suggested that the environment in which the census data is collected reduces concern about consent, as you must proactively tick the box to opt in. The Democrats recognise the government’s commitment to the requirement for explicit consent in relation to this bill, but we do call on the government, as part of this legislation and this debate, to ensure that the process for acquiring this consent be strictly controlled. Issues of voluntariness and coercion are always important where the provision of consent is required and the collection of data is not monitored.
At the very least, it is vital that individuals are fully informed of the consequences of providing their consent. The government has a responsibility to ensure that this information is provided and understood, not just because of some nice adherence to principles underlying this issue but because, as we believe, it is central to maximising the chances of getting the highest degree of accuracy and completeness in the information that people provide in the census. So extensive public education should be undertaken prior to the census to ensure fully informed consent is given. This is especially important for participants for whom English is not their first language.
The Democrats also think it is important to note concerns relating to the collection of information on those under the age of consent. We do recognise that it is difficult to legislate for future rights; however, the rights of children whose parents are providing the information on their behalf should not be dismissed as being of no consequence. Australians also need to always consider the ability of future legislation to override any commitment that the current government or parliament gives to protecting the relevant information for the 99-year closed-access period.
The Democrats have done work over a long time in the areas of privacy and the protection of personal information, and Senator Stott Despoja in particular has been heavily involved. To a large extent, I am presenting remarks also on her behalf today, as she is not able to be here, to ensure that some of the views she has about this legislation are put on the record as well.
The bill itself currently provides that future amendments to the act may allow for the release of this information. The proposed non-disclosure provision of the bill, section 19A, substitutes the previous section 19A, which restricts statisticians and officers from divulging, communicating or voluntarily providing such information to an agency during the closed-access period—that is, during that 99-year period—‘other than in accordance with this act’. The concern with those words is that they could potentially be used as a loophole for future use of the relevant information if the act itself is amended down the track. The wider issue about the sharing and exchanging of information between different government agencies for different purposes is of concern, of course, and always has been, but I think it is particularly relevant these days. I think any suggestion that this sort of information may end up being released for purposes other than what is specified in the legislation we are debating today is serious.
In saying that, I am not suggesting that there is a hidden agenda somewhere—next week or next month, or under the next government—to sneak through an amendment to this act that will allow all this information to be put in the back pocket of ASIO or anything like that. I am talking again about the importance of preserving the integrity of the core purpose of the census. If there is any perception of a lack of protection of this information for any purpose other than what is outlined here—the National Archives and the 99-year release period—then that could affect the completeness and accuracy of the information people provide. So I just wanted to clarify that the underlying rationale behind the concerns expressed is that, if there is any feeling amongst the community that this information is going to be preserved but there is no guarantee that it will not be passed on other than after the 99-year release period through the National Archives, people may be less inclined to give consent, which undermines the purpose of the census. Indeed, they may give consent but not give full information, which is even more of a concern because it undermines the overall accuracy of the census.
As referred to by Senator Sherry, there is an amendment circulated in the name of Senator Stott Despoja that seeks to address this issue. Given the numbers in the chamber and, indeed, given the issues that have been raised about technical aspects of this act and the status of the National Archives under the Archives Act, I might just signal to the minister that the intent behind the Democrat amendment, as I hope I have made clear, is to try to get absolute clarity for the general public that there is no loophole for any future government to exploit that would allow this information to be released for other purposes. I realise no government or parliament can guarantee 100 per cent the actions of any future government or parliament, but what I might do is put a question along these lines to the minister, in the committee stage of the debate, to see if we can get a clearer commitment and statement from the government that any use or release of this information down the track under the provisions of the act would not be for anything other than the general intention outlined in the explanatory memorandum and the government’s statements surrounding this legislation.
It is also relevant to mention the relationship between this bill and privacy concerns surrounding a proposal by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to create a statistical longitudinal census data set or SLCD. That proposal aims to link future census data in one database. In one sense, that is separate and it is still being developed but if you link the sorts of privacy issues that the Democrats have raised today with regard to this legislation with the proposal of the longitudinal census data set and you combine those two potential concerns then it multiplies as well. I think it is important to emphasise the overall thrust and intent of what is being done here. As I said, it is something which many have called for—indeed, Senator Vicki Bourne called for it—in the past and which will be of significant value to historians many years hence.
Ninety-nine years does seem a fair way away. It is perhaps something that all of us here do not have to worry about, although, as I think I heard Senator Sherry say in a totally different debate once upon a time, for children born these days, such as his daughter, there is a fair prospect that they will live to 100. So it is quite possible that this legislation will be relevant for our children if not for ourselves, even if 99 years does seem a long time away. It is in that context that we should recognise that there is a potential for the valuable intent of this legislation and of course the crucial importance of the census to be undermined if there is any perception that the information, now that it is going to be preserved, could somehow or other be authorised to be accessed for purposes that people would be less comfortable with. Hopefully I have made that reasonably clear in outlining some of the issues that this legislation brings up. I flag again that, rather than proceed with the amendment, I would rather ask a question or two and get a clarification or commitment from the minister during the committee stage of the debate about the concerns that we have raised.",SENATE,<title>CENSUS INFORMATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-02-27,"—The purpose of the Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 is to amend the Census and Statistics Act 1905 and the Archives Act 1983 to ensure that name-identified information collected at the 2006 census and all subsequent censuses will be preserved for future genealogical and other research and released after 99 years. This information can only be stored if the occupants of the household give their explicit consent.
By way of background explanation: in 1998 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs brought down a report, Saving our census and preserving our history. This report recommended that name-identified information contained in forms from future censuses be retained, that the records be closed for a period of 99 years and that census information continue to be processed and handled only by officers of the National Archives of Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
This bill is of special interest to me as in a former life I was an area coordinator for the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the 2001 census. This was the first time that people were given the option of agreeing to the retention of their census form with a minimum closed-access period of 99 years. The previous Australian practice had been that all name-identified information collected in the census was destroyed once the ABS had extracted statistical data from the forms and they were no longer needed for processing.
The 2001 census experience showed that people were delighted to be part of this trial, with some 52 per cent of responses choosing to have their information retained. The percentage in the area I covered was far greater than this. The option of preserving family information for future generations of family history researchers and genealogists added momentum to the whole census experience. I come from a rural area, and we have a large number of farming families who have been in the area since the 1890s. Now, with internet access, they are very keen on their genealogy. When you go to most people with a census form they are not very keen about it, but these families really were delighted to be able to take part in it. I think this is a huge breakthrough, and I commend the committee for their perseverance in being able to bring the bill up. This bill includes explicit protection from disclosure under compulsion to any Commonwealth agency, and the public can be confident that their privacy will be respected, whilst future historians and genealogists will still be allowed a unique and comprehensive glimpse of Australian life for our descendants.
The census is carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in accordance with the Census and Statistics Act 1905. Its main purposes are to measure accurately the number of people in Australia on census night in order to provide a reliable basis to estimate the population of each state and territory and to provide information for small geographic areas and for small population groups. The next census is due to be held on the night of 8 August 2006.
This bill amends the Census and Statistics Act and the Archives Act 1983 to ensure that name-identified information collected at the 2006 census and all subsequent censuses, for those households that provide explicit consent on the form, will be preserved for future genealogical and other research. There will be a closed-access period of 99 years rather than the usual Archives Act closed-access period of 30 years. The bill contains provisions to ensure that, during the 99-year period, the name-identified census information will not be released under any circumstances, not even to a court or a tribunal. Under this legislation, upon the expiry of the closed-access period, the name-identified information of those households which have explicitly consented to this happening will be released so that it can be used for research purposes. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CENSUS INFORMATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-02-27,"—In August this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will conduct the 15th census of population and housing, which will provide invaluable information about our country to be used in research and decision-making by governments and the community and will also provide the opportunity to preserve a picture of our society for future generations. In the 2001 census over 50 per cent of respondents elected to have their census forms preserved, and this information will be retained by the National Archives of Australia for a closed-access period of 99 years before being released for genealogical and other research purposes. The Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 seeks to extend this practice of retaining census information where consent is provided to the 2006 census and subsequent censuses. Consequently, for persons who give consent, their 2006 census information will be retained by the National Archives with access provided in the year 2105.
In censuses prior to 2001, all name-identified information was destroyed by the ABS; in 2001, where a person did not provide consent, their information was also destroyed. This process will continue for the 2006 census of population and housing and all subsequent censuses. The origin of this bill—as has been stated by other senators here today—lies with a recommendation by the Standing Committee on Legislation and Constitutional Affairs, in its report Saving our census and preserving our history. The standing committee’s recommendation was that keeping name-identified census information for future research, with appropriate safeguards, will make a valuable contribution to preserving Australia’s history for future generations. The bill includes provisions to ensure that Australians can trust the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the National Archives of Australia to protect the information provided and not release any name-identified information in the 99-year closed-access period. During processing, the confidentiality of the information is protected under the Census and Statistics Act 1905, as is all information provided to the ABS. There are also provisions to protect the information once it is passed to the National Archives, and it will not be available to other bodies—including courts, tribunals and Commonwealth agencies—for any purpose.
At this point, I will deal with some issues that Senator Bartlett raised in the Democrats’ proposed amendment. The amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats will have the effect of precluding the transfer of census information to the Archives for those Australians who have elected to have their census records kept. The phrase ‘other than in accordance with this act’ is included specifically to allow the transfer of census information to archives, as legislated in section 8A of the Census and Statistics Act, to take place. This is the only instance of the Census and Statistics Act allowing the transfer of census information to an agency. No other transfers of census information to agencies are allowed for or included under the Census and Statistics Act or these proposed amendments.
The Australian government will also not be supporting the amendments to this bill proposed by the Australian Greens. The content of the census is determined every five years on the basis of community consultation, followed by thorough testing. The content of Australia’s census is not set in legislation; rather, it is contained in a determination that was tabled before parliament on 29 November last year. With the content finalised, the forms have been printed, so any changes now would require the forms to be redesigned and reprinted, delaying the census by up to one year and costing around $20 million. In addition, it is unlikely that the topic proposed by the Greens could be included in the census, as great care has been taken in choosing the topics, assessing the importance of the issue, the need for data, the quality of the responses and the reaction of the public. Consultation on the content of the 2011 census will take place in 2008, and the Greens, along with all members of the Australian community, will be welcome to make suggestions for census topics at that time. If sexuality were suggested as a topic in this process, whether or not it could be included in the census would be assessed then, using the criteria I have already described.
To return to the present: the 2006 census of population and housing will be held on Tuesday, 8 August. For this undertaking, the ABS will be employing approximately 30,000 census collectors to deliver and collect census questionnaires, and the Australian public will also have the option of completing their 2006 questionnaire online. The recruitment of field supervisors has commenced. My colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Chris Pearce, launched the recruitment campaign two weeks ago. Already there are more than 15,000 applications for the 3,500 supervisor vacancies. This augurs very well for a successful census. The 2006 census requires the participation of all Australians, and I thank the Australian community for their support of the work of the ABS in its ongoing activities, and I look forward to their cooperation in the project.
As a result of the census, Australians will have accurate information on the number and key characteristics of people in Australia on census night and the dwellings in which they live. The census will provide a snapshot of our society, who we are, how we live and what we do. As before, topics will include ancestry, education, occupation and transport to work. Additional insights will come from new questions about people with a disability and unpaid work done. All this information will be valuable for research and planning activities of governments and other users. I think senators for their contributions and commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CENSUS INFORMATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004. This bill was originally introduced and debated prior to the 2004 election. When this legislation was considered in the previous parliament, Labor and the minor parties combined in this chamber to amend it. Unfortunately, the amendments were not accepted by the government and the bill lapsed. Labor believes that the rationale for those amendments still stands, and I will return to that point later in my remarks.
The bill arises from the panel of experts’ review of the law of negligence conducted by Justice Ipp back in 2002. Justice Ipp’s review was initiated following widespread community concern about skyrocketing public liability insurance premiums. Public activities and events were put into jeopardy because affordable insurance cover was simply not available. Justice Ipp developed a set of recommendations designed to reduce claims costs and put downward pressure on insurance premiums. In response, all states and territories introduced tort law reforms to bring claims costs under control. Evidence now is beginning to emerge that these reforms have improved the availability and affordability of public liability insurance. Labor has consistently stressed the need for Commonwealth action to support the efforts of the state and territory governments to reduce public liability premiums.
In the previous parliament, Labor supported amendments to taxation laws to facilitate structured settlements which reduce costs to insurers. Labor also backed the principle that the TPA needed to be amended to allow people who engage in high-risk recreational activities to be able to waive their rights to sue. In addition, Labor endorsed legislation to remove the personal liability of volunteers performing work for the Commonwealth. The Ipp review recommended that the Commonwealth should ensure that reforms to the law of negligence at the state level should not be undermined by the practice of forum shopping by litigants—that is, claims that cannot be pursued at state law should not be the basis of an action under Commonwealth law.
Since 2002, Labor has supported appropriate amendments to the Trade Practices Act to ensure that public liability claims costs did not blow out on another front following state tort law reform. However, the opposition has always argued that the need to reduce insurance premiums which threaten the viability of community events must be balanced against the rights of injured consumers. This bill fails to strike that balance. A number of provisions of the Trade Practices Act can give rise to an action for personal injury damages. This bill is concerned with actions under part V division 1. The key provision in this part of the TPA is section 52, which prohibits corporations from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. Other provisions of the TPA which can give rise to an action for personal injury damages include part IVA, which deals with unconscionable conduct, and part VA, which imposes liability on manufacturers or importers of defective goods.
Labor is concerned that the government has adopted an inconsistent approach to addressing the potential for forum shopping. Where personal injury or death is caused by misleading and deceptive conduct, this bill seeks to abolish the rights of both individuals and the ACCC acting in a representative capacity to recover damages. In contrast, where an action for personal injury damages is based on other provisions of the TPA, such as for unconscionable conduct, damages will still be available. In 2004, the parliament established a new compensation regime in part VIB to apply to personal injury damages claims arising under the TPA. Labor supported this legislation. Part VIB imposes limitation periods, caps and minimum thresholds for damages to eliminate small and trivial claims.
This compensation regime is broadly consistent with the limitations on negligence actions which have been imposed by state and territory law. The regime does not, however, apply to all actions for personal injury arising under the TPA. While it applies to personal injury cases arising from unconscionable conduct or the sale of defective goods, it does not cover actions for misleading and deceptive conduct. In the last parliament, the opposition argued that the capping regime in part VIB should be extended to cover these cases. Labor remains convinced that this is the best course of action. There is no need to completely abolish long established consumer rights.
In the two years since this legislation was first proposed there has been no evidence of an explosion in TPA claims where plaintiffs have been seeking to get around state law. When this matter was first presented to the parliament back in 2003, Labor sought to have the matter considered by a Senate committee. The committee examined the government’s claims about the impact of this bill on consumers. The government has argued that consumers will not be adversely affected by the removal of the right to seek damages for misleading and deceptive conduct, because damages for negligence will still be available under state law. However, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee was presented with a number of scenarios where consumers would have no remedy available to them if this bill was passed. One possible example cited related to a case involving a defective drug where the defendants destroy or ‘lose’ test results. In such a situation, plaintiffs would lack the crucial evidence needed to make out a negligence claim. Labor believes that this bill has the potential to undermine the culture of care that has developed in Australia since the enactment of the TPA. As a consequence, consumers may be exposed to a greater risk of injury.
During the committee’s hearings, the Law Council noted that the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct in section 52 of the act has led to general improvements in community safety and cautioned against restricting its scope. The consumer watchdog, the ACCC, also strongly opposed amending the TPA to remove liability for personal injury under section 52. The ACCC’s argument was based principally on literature known as the economics of accidents. Simply stated, this analysis suggests that liability for the cost of accidents should be assigned to the party that could most easily and cheaply take the actions needed to minimise the risk of an accident.
I will outline some of the significant points made by the ACCC in relation to the effect of the government’s proposal to abolish consumer rights in this bill. The ACCC noted that section 52 of the TPA provides an important incentive for business to behave fairly and to have regard for consumers’ safety. Without the availability of this important remedy, the standard of behaviour that consumers are entitled to expect may break down. This is a very significant concern. Furthermore, the commission has noted that limiting the scope of section 52 is economically inefficient. This is because it forces consumers to incur greater search costs in order to determine which suppliers are reliable. Finally, the ACCC has argued that removing liability for misleading and deceptive conduct which causes personal injury actually damages the competitive process. It allows firms that engage in misleading and deceptive practices to win customers at the expense of those who play by the rules.
Given this evidence from the ACCC, why is the government intent on eliminating an important consumer protection provision? The government has placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that section 52 is a strict liability provision. This means that the intent of a company that misleads and deceives is not relevant in determining liability under the act. Consequently, the government asserts that it is easier to bring an action under the TPA as there is no requirement to prove fault, as is required in negligence cases. Labor does not accept this argument. The fact is that section 52 of the Trade Practices Act has been a strict liability provision since 1974. As the Law Council told the Senate committee, if it were significantly easier to bring an action for personal injury under section 52 rather than for negligence, it would have been used in many more cases.
Provided that the quantum of damages available under the TPA is broadly consistent with the amount available under state or territory law, there is no reason to believe that the availability of a TPA remedy will drive forum shopping. Companies that engage in misleading and deceptive conduct which causes personal injury or death should not be excused of responsibility for their actions. As the ACCC’s Jennifer McNeill told the Senate committee:
In a situation where a business misleads or deceives a consumer and the consumer suffers damage ... the commission thinks that, as a matter of principle, they should be held accountable and liable for that damage, irrespective of intention.
McNeill said that this was because:
... it is much more within the control of the business involved whether and how the representations are made; it is not within the control of the consumer whether and how the representations are made.
The danger of forum shopping, which this bill seeks to address, can be dealt with in a better way. All that needs to be done is to ensure that plaintiffs are unable to recover damages under Commonwealth law that exceed those available under state and territory law.
During the committee stage of this bill, Labor will move amendments to ensure that the capping regime in part VIB of the TPA also applies to actions commenced for a breach of section 52. This will remove the economic incentive for forum shopping while maintaining a fundamental consumer protection provision of the TPA. Labor’s approach is a practical one. We support action to bring claims costs under control and put downward pressure on premiums. At the same time a balanced approach is required. This bill must be amended so that the rights of people who have suffered injury as a result of misleading and deceptive behaviour are not eliminated. Labor believes that this is the only fair way to deal with this issue.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-27,"—I, too, rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004. This is the latest in a long run of bills attempting to attend to this area of tort law and of trade practices law. The amendments in the bill relate to part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act. Part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act contains key consumer protection measures, the most commonly used ones being those that deal with misleading and deceptive conduct and false and misleading representations.
The Bills Digest No. 170 of 31 May 2005 had some concluding comments which well captured the nature of discussion on the bill. They said:
The amendments in this Bill implement Recommendation 19 of the negligence review, so that individuals will be prevented from recovering damages for personal injury and death brought about by a breach of Part V Division 1 of the TPA.
These amendments reduce consumer rights under the TPA. These amendments do however close a loophole in the law that has the potential to undermine the Ipp Report’s recommendations and hence the Government’s policy response to the insurance crisis.
The insurance crisis has abated and some may therefore argue that these amendments are unnecessary. Those who support these amendments suggest however that premium pricing may again increase if the reforms to negligence laws are undermined by claimants relying on other avenues of legal redress such as Part V Division 1 of the TPA.
The Bill is also a reminder of the broader policy issues at play and in particular whether the review of the laws of negligence has achieved the correct balance between premium affordability and access to compensation for those who are injured. This question is particularly pressing given the fact that the review that led to the overhaul of the country’s personal injury laws was completed within such a very short period of time and was a reaction to a crisis in the insurance market.
Missing in that conclusion is what should be the strongest criticism of all of this sort of legislation—that is, that it is built on assertion. It is built on assertion about the consequences to maintaining a provision in law which has identifiably not been abused. There is no record whatsoever that this provision in the Trade Practices Act has ever been abused and there is no credibility to the assertion that it will be abused. The departments are bound to say, ‘Such and such a case did such and such a thing.’ I am talking about wholesale, universal, systemic abuse. It just has not happened.
The Australian Democrats stridently, again, oppose the amendments in this bill because they further curtail the rights of people who have suffered an injury from pursuing legal action for damages for pain and suffering arising from their injuries. The government’s argument has been that unless it takes these steps there will be an increase in litigation to the level of countries like the United States and that insurance premiums will again rise exponentially. The government argues that this is the only way to curtail litigation: by taking away a person’s right to it. These proposed changes to the legislation have been achieved through successful lobbying from the insurance companies and through an overhasty response to a crisis to which the government has now doggedly stuck. In every state of Australia the large insurance companies did push tort law reform and were successful, even in the face of opposition from plaintiff lawyer groups, which they painted as greedy and bloodsucking. Some insurance companies and some plaintiff lawyers might indeed be greedy and bloodsucking, but certainly not all are. We need insurance companies and we need plaintiff lawyers, and we need to find a balance between their vested interests.
This legislation does not provide that balance and nor do its predecessors. Plaintiff lawyer groups were attempting to retain the rights of injured people to bring actions for damages while the insurance companies were attempting to maintain their profit margins and to keep their businesses as viable as possible. This amending bill has been introduced because there is a suggestion that people who have lost the opportunity to pursue damages claims under tort law will now use section 52 of the Trade Practices Act to bring actions to recover damages. The government argues that if this particular amendment is not passed there will be a flood of actions pursuant to section 52. There is no evidence to support this contention.
The Law Council of Australia made a submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on 5 August 2003 which dealt with this issue at that time. At that time it identified nine cases where action had been taken pursuant to section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. It said: ‘None of these cases would appear to be frivolous. The council notes that the apparent volume of claims overall in this area could not be described as excessive given that the Trade Practices Act has been in force for almost thirty years.’ In his second reading speech, Mr Brough stated that this amendment was ‘to assist governments to formulate a consistent approach to the problems of rising premiums and reduced availability of public liability insurance’. This point was reiterated in Senator Minchin’s second reading speech. That was the argument that state governments also ran with in respect of changes to a plaintiff’s right to action for damages arising from negligence. Of course, there is vested interest always in these things because governments themselves are subject to those actions. However, the premiums have continued to rise and sections of the community have now lost their right to compensation commensurate with the injury done to them. This is typical of this government—decrease rights, decrease access to justice; increase obligation, increase your liability for action taken against you by the state.
In general, the Democrats support the rights of aggrieved parties to take claims for damages and compensation to the courts and for those matters to be decided by the courts. While we support necessary restraints on ambulance chasers and excessive litigation, the so-called reforms in this area have gone far too far, and we have consistently opposed them. The argument was that, if there were a limit to common-law actions, then insurance premiums would be reduced, the number of claims would drop and genuine complainants would survive. Claims have dropped, insurance profits have risen significantly, premiums remain high and cover is more difficult for small organisations to get than ever. There is no indication as to why these further changes should reduce insurance premiums and it further and unnecessarily limits the ability of injured people to bring an action.
A panel of experts reviewed the law of negligence in Australia after a ministerial meeting on public liability insurance in 2002. The panel recommended the changes so that the law at state and federal levels would be consistent. However, although the Hon. Minister Brough states that this consistency will be achieved by the passage of these amendments to the Trade Practices Act, it should be pointed out they will not. These changes are styled upon the New South Wales legislation. Not all states have followed the New South Wales legislation, and consistency will therefore not be achieved as has been asserted. According to the government, these measures are being introduced so that the Trade Practices Act cannot be used to undermine state and territory civil liability tort reforms. As far as any inconsistency remains, they can be used to do just that.
I also point out that, in the government’s anxious desire to keep the insurance industry contented, they appear to have completely overlooked the impact this legislation will have on future budgets. Generally the payouts made by the courts include provision for the ongoing care of an injured person calculated at the cost of the care and the number of years they are likely to require the care. Courts will no longer have to do these long and complicated sums because the injured people are now forced to rely exclusively on Centrelink and Medicare payments for the rest of their lives. So, in aggregate, what this bill does, as do the other bills, is to transfer liability from the insurance companies to the taxpayer.
I would like to point out some other points which, instead of simplifying matters and taking them out of the hands of lawyers, appear to increase the likelihood of litigation. In particular, the calculation of the date of discoverability is rather open ended. It is three years except in those circumstances where it is up to 12 years. There is certainly an attempt at specificity. However, it appears to open up avenues for long, drawn-out litigation processes to determine whether or not a person can bring an action. This takes time, money and energy, which an injured person may not wish to expend, so there will be a reduction in litigation, as the government wants, but also a reduction in real justice. In the case of some injuries, three years is a very short period of time. The current proposed time limit will put off people who may have a legitimate claim but not sufficient funds from pursuing it. That is not justice; that is intimidation.
I concede that this aspect does not apply to smoking related diseases, but I do believe there are other conditions which may have a long gestation period. The Democrats support the notion that people can bring actions against tobacco companies. Tobacco companies were well aware by at least the 1960s of the scientific evidence which showed the link between smoking and lung, throat and mouth cancer, but they continued to promote smoking as part of a healthy, trendy lifestyle. However, the limitation period and the calculation of the limitation period proposed in this legislation appear to create opportunities for lawyers rather than certainty for plaintiffs.
I am also aware of some of the definitions contained in the proposed amendments. The definition of a most extreme case is ‘a case in which the plaintiff suffers non-economic loss of the gravest conceivable kind’. I suggest that this again does not promote certainty in the law and appears simply to create an opportunity for lawyers to offer up different determinations of exactly what the ‘gravest conceivable kind’ really means. It is a matter which is going to be subject to jurisprudence.
It again appears to lend itself to much preliminary examination of issues rather than dealing with the question of the amount of damages that a person can claim for a certain type of injury. The government has reiterated that the purpose of the bill is to reduce insurance premiums. The changes to state legislation were for the same purpose, but there has been no notable reduction in insurance premiums. I certainly have not had constituents ringing me up and saying how wonderful it is that insurance premiums have dropped or that they can get cover for whatever they need, particularly for small not-for-profit organisations. Therefore, there is no reason to suggest that these amendments will achieve any end other than a loss of consumer rights for potential legitimate claimants. They will, in fact, further disadvantage injured Australians and taxpayers, who will now carry the burden of Centrelink and Medicare payments for the injured, which would have been carried by insurance companies through court decisions. For the reasons outlined above, the Australian Democrats oppose this bill, as we have previous bills which have had this intention.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-02-27,"—On behalf of the Australian Greens, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004, because it deals with a very serious issue—namely, the right of those who have suffered injury or death caused by products made by companies or corporations to gain help, redress or compensation from the courts. These amendments reduce consumer rights under the Trade Practices Act.
At its core, with the exception of tobacco products, this bill prohibits people from being awarded payment of damages for death or injury under part V, division 1, of the Trade Practices Act as it currently stands. A glance at the act reveals that part V is headed ‘Consumer Protection’, whilst division 1 is titled ‘Unfair practices’. If this bill is implemented, people will not be able to take action if, for example, death or inquiry has resulted from misleading or deceptive conduct or false or misleading representation. Will companies be able to get away with misleading and deceptive conduct or false or misleading representation that causes death or injury, while people have no rights to take action? This bill strips these protections, which I believe were once one of the envies of the world, from the act and renders them useless. The Senate will be endorsing the removal of consumer protection and enshrining unfair practices. I believe this is unfair and disgraceful.
The Senate should query why tobacco products remain outside this amendment. I do not want you to think that we think that they should not be, but why not other products? Many other products will gain full statutory immunity. What about the many and various claims of new technologies—for example, genetically modified products, particularly in foods? We do not know at the moment what impacts these will have. We also do not know what claims will be made about these products. There are claims now about how much healthier we are all going to be.
Why is the government so concerned about tobacco products and not the raft of other dangerous products? I believe this is policy making on the run. This bill, as has already been highlighted, had its genesis in 2002 with the review of the law of negligence in Australia undertaken by a committee chaired by Justice David Ipp. The final report of the committee was presented in September 2002. The justice and his committee were forced to work with terms of reference that can only be described as narrow. For instance, they were asked to develop and evaluate:
... options for amendments to the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals commencing actions in reliance on the Trade Practices Act, including actions for misleading and deceptive conduct, to recover compensation for personal injury and death.
This legislation is the result of a fundamentally predetermined report. The Greens are opposed to this bill because it makes it harder for plaintiffs or injured people to successfully sue corporations or companies when those very same corporations or companies caused injury or death.
While we agree that high insurance premiums are a problem for the community—and I have dealt with this on many occasions, having worked for a long time for non-government organisations—we do not believe that undermining consumer rights is the answer. In fact, this bill makes it easier for corporations to avoid liability. That is a very significant outcome of the legislation before us, and I believe it is patently wrong. What kind of message does this give to corporations which make faulty goods—life jackets that do not float, cars that explode, blenders that electrocute or drugs that deform? The message is that it does not matter if you use deceptive language or if a product has an adverse outcome for the community. We believe that this legislation should be opposed. We do not support the reduction of consumer rights. We believe that we should be protecting and improving consumer protection in this country. We agree with other senators who have spoken on this legislation. Previously we have opposed this legislation; we oppose it now.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-02-27,"—I would like to thank all the speakers who have participated in this important debate today, which deals with the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004. The bill is a final plank in the program of tort law reforms pursued by both the Commonwealth and state governments over the past few years. These reforms will benefit all Australians by making insurance more affordable and available. A number of speakers have touched on this. A great deal of research has gone into this. The expert panel which was chaired by Justice Ipp has been mentioned. This bill will implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the review of the law of negligence. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-27,"—I want to commence by making it clear that Labor supports the passage of the Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 and related bills before the Senate. The Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 is effectively a rewritten and renamed version of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, which has been the primary legislation for the administration of Australia’s offshore petroleum resources for 40 years.
The legislative package before the Senate amends the structure and style of Australia’s offshore petroleum legislation and implements a modest number of minor policy amendments. According to the government, the management regime for offshore petroleum exploration, production, processing and conveyance will remain largely unchanged. In his second reading speech in the other place, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources—who was, incidentally, dumped in the recent reshuffle—said the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and incorporated acts have become complex and unwieldy. The changes are designed to reduce compliance costs for the industry and the state and territory governments who administer them. My colleague the member for Batman noted these comments and compared the size of the current act—less than 600 pages—with its replacement, which is more than 600 pages. The explanatory memorandum is itself over 300 pages long. Legislation is rarely simplified by making it longer, something Australia’s accountants know only too well following the introduction of the government’s new tax system.
There are many challenges confronting our energy sector. In 2003-04 we exported $8 billion worth of crude oil, LNG, and LPG, and a further $1 billion worth of refined products. This sounds good until you understand that, in the same period, we imported well over $10 billion worth of crude oil, LPG, and refined products to fuel our transport sector. In a country which, due to its size, is so reliant on transport, we cannot afford to be complacent about the future of our domestic oil and gas industry. The International Energy Agency’s 2005 review of Australian energy policy noted Australia’s thirst for oil, saying that the transport sector could particularly benefit from efficiency efforts with its fuel efficiency standards at the lower end of IEA countries. The review noted too that transport accounts for 40 per cent of final energy consumption and is projected to grow by two per cent annually over the two decades to 2020.
At the same time, oil production in Australia by 2020 is likely to be less than half of what it is today and demand is likely to exceed production at least threefold. Our reliance on imported oil is already having repercussions. Many motorists are struggling to keep their tanks full and afford other necessities of life. The impact of oil prices is starting to show in patchy retail spending. The transport sector is also feeling the squeeze. Australia is consuming oil three times faster than we are finding it, and we already import 60 per cent of our domestic oil needs. The Howard government has never addressed this fundamental problem of Australia’s reliance on imported fuel or the need to apply the competition blowtorch to the petrol industry. We are running out of time, and Mr Howard is leaving Australia unprepared for the future.
There is no simple solution to the problem of high petrol prices, but there are things the Howard government can do to make a difference. There are responsible steps which the Howard government could take now. First, instead of increasing our reliance on imported oil, the government should help develop an Australian gas to liquids fuel industry. We want Australia’s natural gas developed to make us more self sufficient in transport fuels and less vulnerable to future global oil shocks. Australia’s competitors in the gas industry are way ahead of us, particularly in the Middle East where countries like Qatar already have major gas to liquids projects making refined products for the global market. Second, it should provide a real future for the biofuels industry held back by continual Howard government incompetence, cronyism and mismanagement. Third, it should apply the competition blowtorch to this industry to make sure Australians get the lowest possible prices at the bowser.
I commend to the Senate Kim Beazley’s blueprint speech entitled ‘Developing the Australian fuel industry’. I also commend Mr Beazley’s blueprint speech on skills and schools, which outlines Labor’s plan to address Australia’s growing skills deficit. No industry sector has been harder hit by skills shortages than the energy sector. I also commend to the Senate the many sensible things Martin Ferguson has had to say as Labor’s resources spokesman, including the detailed remarks he made during the debate on these bills in the other place. These bills do not address the big issues facing Australia’s energy sector. They do not address our future domestic fuel needs. They do not address our need for skills. They do not address the provision of infrastructure to support industry development. Having said that, these bills are unlikely to do any harm. It is not high praise, but it is the basis on which Labor extends its support for their passage.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 and the five related bills that are being considered by the Senate today. The Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 is an extensive revamp of the longstanding Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, which the government has argued needed rewriting to reduce compliance costs for the industry and for the state and territory governments. The Democrats note that the bill, in addition to reducing complexity, makes some minor changes to the current regime, the majority of which we do not have a strong objection to. We do, of course, have some concerns with the principal act, which enables petroleum exploration in marine parks, a matter which my colleague Senator Bartlett will talk more about later.
I want to say tonight that we are very critical of the fact that efforts have gone into this major rewrite of offshore petroleum policy instead of addressing the more critical issue of the impending oil crises and rising petrol costs. The latest research shows that oil peaking presents the world with a risk management problem of global proportions. There is now an energy security planning vacuum in Australia, as there is in other countries.
When oil consumption begins to exceed production by even a small amount, the price of oil could soar to well over $US100 a barrel, greatly increasing the cost of transport fuels and the petrochemicals used to make thousands of plastic products, fertilisers and pesticides for food production. Within a year or so this could create a global recession. The impact on the wellbeing of Australians, particularly those with outer suburban lifestyles hinged on two-car families and constant car trips to work, school and supermarkets, will be disastrous. I think people need to realise that oil production is not just about transport and the cost of getting to work; it is also about manufacturing, farming and the availability and cost of everyday products and food. Oil decline will have a huge impact on world food production and will have a devastating effect on developing countries in particular.
Since 1980, the gap between oil demand and oil supply, once considerable, has steadily narrowed, and today it is almost negligible. Since 1965 the amount of oil discovered each year has inexorably plunged despite all our advances in technology. Because of the lack of access to accurate data, there is no certainty about when oil production will peak and then decline. Some governments are very concerned about this uncertainty but our government is either unaware or is choosing to ignore the serious threat of reduced oil supplies as we reach 2025.
We know that the United States hit peak oil in 1971; the United Kingdom with its North Sea oil peaked in 1999; and Australia peaked in 2000. The Middle East remains one of the only areas that has not reached peak oil. Many of these countries do not release details about how much oil is extracted from the reservoirs or what methods are used to extract that oil. Nor do they permit audits by outsiders. Indeed, the condition of the Saudi and other OPEC oil fields is a closely guarded secret. According to a report published in the New York Times, Sadad al-Husseini, one of the most respected and accomplished oil men in the world and ex-director of Saudi Aramco, revealed that the Saudi government was seriously overstating its reserves. The report states:
“You look at the globe and ask, ‘Where are the big increments?’ ... if demand and depletion patterns continue, every year the world will need to open enough fields or wells to pump an additional six to eight million barrels a day—at least two million new barrels a day to meet the rising demand and at least four million to compensate for the declining production of existing fields. “That’s like a whole new Saudi Arabia every couple of years,”... “It can’t be done indefinitely. It’s not sustainable.”
Husseini’s message, like that of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, is that the world is heading for a devastating oil shortage and contradicts the calming speeches of the Saudi oil minister and predictions of the US Energy Information Administration.
The US Department of Energy called for an investigation. The report, entitled World oil production: impacts, mitigation and risk management, states that action must start 20 years before peak oil to adapt to declining oil supplies. It says:
Prudent risk management requires the planning and implementation of mitigation well before peaking. Early mitigation will almost certainly be less expensive and less damaging to the world’s economies than delayed mitigation.
Based on estimates of peak oil, several scenarios have been identified: (1) that oil production peaks then declines around 2010 inducing a world-wide depression, wrecking the Australian economy and producing mass unemployment; (2) that oil peaks between 2015 and 2025, making a less painful adaptation possible, provided that most developed nations agree to reduce oil dependence with strong government market intervention, the introduction of fuel rationing, fuel efficiency standards and so forth; (3) that oil peaking after 2025 allows a timely adaptation with mutually agreed supply and demand side oil conservation measures recommended by the International Energy Agency.
While many governments are banking on a peak after 2025, the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas predicts that oil will actually peak around 2010. The association’s data shows world oil production increasing by 2.2 per cent per year, which is the rate at which it increased in 2004, according to IEA, and then peaking between 2008 and 2012 followed by a 2.2 per cent per annum decline in production to 2045. Further, as conventional oil production begins to peak, the light, sweet crude gets used up first and the remaining conventional oil gets heavier and more sour with more impurities reducing the energy return on the energy invested and producing more greenhouse gas emissions. Non-conventional oil produces far more CO emissions than conventional oil.
The Energy research Centre in the Netherlands supports the hypothesis that an oil peak sometime in the period 2010 to 2020 is far from impossible, saying:
While there are many events that could postpone an oil peak till after year 2020 there are equally many events that could lead to an oil peak before the year 2020.
                  …         …           …
… an oil peak in the near future is indeed plausible and … it would be very useful to consider the possible consequences for global energy markets and the resulting drive for system innovations.
… we are referring to the period up to 2020 rather than any one particular year. … scenarios with limited availability of oil and sharply rising prices deserve serious attention in terms of the consequences for European energy transitions and related energy research, demonstration and development strategies.
Eric Streitberg, Managing Director of ARC Energy, asked participants at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference to put up their hands if they thought that we had reached peak oil. Fifty per cent of the people in the audience put up their hands, saying that they believe we are at peak oil. These are practising petroleum industry professionals.
Chevron, the US’s largest energy group with a good environment record, has set up a website warning of the pressures of high demand and fewer fields, and offering a forum for discussion. On the website, Chevron says:
One thing is clear: the era of easy oil is over.
It also says:
We call upon scientists and educators, politicians and policymakers, environmentalists, leaders of industry and each one of you to be part of reshaping the next era of energy.
Chevron has also said, ‘Inaction is not an option.’ Even Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest energy group with a bad environmental record, said in a recent advertisement:
The world faces enormous energy challenges. There are no easy answers.
Just last week President George Bush, in his State of the Union address, for the first time admitted that America’s reliance on oil is a real problem. He said:
America is addicted to oil …
He also said:
Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy.
President Bush then went on to announce a 22 per cent increase in clean energy research. He recognised the need to change how we power our homes and offices and invest more in solar and wind technologies. He also argued that Americans must change how they power their automobiles, and promised greater research into better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and into pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. He said:
We’ll also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks, or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years.
While there were some criticisms about the practical effects of President Bush’s announcement, it did signal an important shift in energy policy for the United States.
The question now is: where does that leave Australia? Transport predictions to the year 2010 in Australia for single-occupant car commuting, car travel generally, air passenger travel, intercity road freight and intracity commercial vehicle traffic all show an unsustainable growth in oil dependency. Over the last 40 years, Australia has become addicted to cheap oil, especially for transport, which uses almost 80 per cent of Australia’s petroleum. Fifty-five per cent of road transport fuel is petrol; 39 per cent, diesel; and six per cent, LPG. The oil-dependent transport sector is responsible for 76 per cent of oil consumption; that has to be reduced, as it poses a very serious threat to Australia’s future economy.
Achieving energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy requires action to be taken by individuals, companies and governments, but it is government who can encourage and discourage energy efficiency in so many ways. A key priority in guaranteeing Australia’s energy security is, in our view, to reduce the transport sector’s overdependence on oil. It does not matter that there is uncertainty about when peak oil will occur; what matters is the consensus that that peak will occur. We must act now.
We suggest the following initiatives be undertaken by government. Firstly, the government should develop car fuel efficiency standards to ensure that, by 2015, the average fuel consumption of the car fleet, including most four-wheel drives, be four litres per 100 kilometres and, for the SUV and light truck fleet, 6.5 litres per 100 kilometres, giving an overall 50 per cent increase in fuel efficiency. Secondly, we should conserve oil reserves through the use of natural gas as a transition fuel, the manufacture of energy-efficient hybrid electric cars and LCVs, and the building-up of a strategic six-month reserve of diesel and petrol. Thirdly, we should absorb the costs of oil depletion into the price of diesel, petrol and aviation fuel and utilise other green taxes designed to decouple the growth in oil consumption from the growth of GDP, and use the green taxes to rebuild and enhance rail infrastructure in all urban areas.
Fourthly, the government should promote and fund the uptake of telecommuting, eco-driving, car-pooling and TravelSmart programs in all urban areas. Fifthly, the government should change current land-use planning practice to eliminate residential sprawl, and provide public transport services in new residential and industrial areas. Sixthly, the government should change the constitution of road planning and building agencies to make it their responsibility to reduce the demand for road space and travel by car. Finally, the government should build urban bikeway networks for bicycles and electric bicycles, provide secure bicycle parking at all modal interchanges and railway stations, and encourage the use of electric bicycles with solar electric and/or overnight battery charging.
To implement these recommendations, an Australian energy security policy, with both demand- and supply-side measures should be produced to mitigate oil dependency. As Professor Peter Newman, a transport academic from Murdoch University, pointed out on the television show Catalyst late last year:
We have lots of preparedness for terrorist attacks; but where’s the plan for peak oil? We don’t have one.
In my contribution to the debate on the energy efficiency bill during the last sitting week, I called on the government to make the 2006 budget about the future of Australians and Australia and to invest in energy efficiency schemes, renewable energy, water and other areas in which energy efficiency can be found. Today I add to this list and call on the government to invest in an energy security policy with both demand- and supply-side measures. This is a matter of urgency.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-02-27,"—The Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 and its associated bills replace the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. Although we are told that these new bills aim to simply rewrite the 1967 act to make it more user friendly, we are confronted with these new bills that increase in size from some 400 pages to over 600. Of course, in these days of extensive explanatory memoranda, this also runs to about 300 pages. It is interesting that, to make something easier for industry to operate and for government to regulate, it somehow requires more words than the act it is replacing. It puts one in mind of the new fairer, simpler tax act that doubles the length of the tax act. So we should not ever be surprised about how this government talks about the need to simplify but it always ends up with more and more provisions to do so. There must be some perverse logic along the lines that, by making it more complex, longer and more verbose, we are in fact simplifying it.
Having said that, I believe that we, like other industrialised nations, need to do better when it comes to our love affair with petroleum and its products. It is passing strange to hear no less than the President of the United States say exactly the same thing to the people of America in his State of the Union address. Quoting President Bush is not something I thought I would be doing, but the point he made about our overreliance on petroleum was a point well made. Petroleum and other energy products such as LPG represent nearly 10 per cent of Australia’s export revenue. It is an important part of our country’s trade performance and, as such, it deserves our close attention. But the fact remains that, although we exported over $8 billion worth of petroleum and gas and a further $1 billion worth of refined products, we imported over $10 billion worth of the same products. So, whichever way we want to consider it, we are a net importer of petroleum and gas.
So, just like President Bush said to the American people, we also need to do more to reduce our reliance on oil and gas imports. It is simple supply and demand, really. As demand increases, especially in China and India, and as supply remains at its current levels, prices will continue to rise. There is no way to change that simple law of economics. So if we as a country continue to rely on importing oil to drive our cars and fuel our transport sector then we will have to face up to increasing prices. It is estimated that, by the year 2020, the demand for energy in this country will have increased by some 50 per cent. We are looking at a situation in which, by 2020, over 60 of Australia’s requirements for fuels will be imported.
In fact, in March 2003, when I spoke on the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill in this place, the price of oil at that stage was $37 per barrel. Now, a short three years later, the price is around $60 per barrel and rising. The reality is that our oil reserves are being used at such a rate that, by 2020, we will be producing less than half what we currently produce. Over that same time, demand is likely to increase threefold. The United States Energy Information Administration, in an article posted in 2004 entitled ‘Long-term world oil supply scenarios’, concluded:
Will the world ever physically run out of crude oil? No, but only because it will eventually become very expensive in absence of lower-cost alternatives.
This is the reality that exists for all users of oil. It is a reality that is not often acknowledged. That is why I am pleased to have seen President Bush raise the issue. We all need to understand that, unless we find alternatives, we are destined to eventually reach the position that although oil will still be available we just will not be able to afford it. The report goes on to say:
In any event, the world production peak for conventionally reservoired crude is unlikely to be “right around the corner” as so many other estimators have been predicting. Our analysis shows that it will be closer to the middle of the 21st century than to its beginning. Given the long lead times required for significant mass-market penetration of new energy technologies, this result in no way justifies complacency about both supply-side and demand-side research and development.
Although the Energy Information Administration article concludes that scarcity will not be a problem for decades, it is also clear that the long lead times that are required to move to new technology means that we can no longer afford to wait. If we continue to rely on foreign oil to fuel our transport requirements, we will be facing a substantial decline in our living standards because of increased fuel prices.
However, there are answers and solutions to this dependence on foreign oil. Firstly, we can continue to encourage exploration and investment to bring additional sources of petroleum online here in Australia. We need to engage more actively with industry to find new sources of oil. We need to ensure that the regulatory framework is as efficient and as appropriate as possible. As a nation, we need to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place and that there are sufficient skills in the Australian labour market to ensure our maximum exploitation of this industry.
Secondly, we can do as President Bush suggests and use technology and research to find alternative sources of energy. It is a fact that we already possess the technology and raw materials to do just that; what is missing, however, is leadership from the government. Consider these points. We have large reserves of natural gas, particularly in my home state of Western Australia. We have a car industry that already has the capacity to manufacture LPG dedicated vehicles. A motor vehicle travelling 20,000 kilometres a year that is powered solely by gas produces 600 cubic metres fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a car burning petrol. The saving at the petrol station for a car travelling 20,000 kilometres per year is at least $1,200 dollars per year based on current prices.
What is needed here is national leadership. There is no reason why Australian car manufacturers could not become the world leaders in the production of gas powered vehicles. As many of us know, most taxis in this country now run on gas; so why does this government not take a lead by announcing that all new government fleet vehicles must be solely powered by gas? Consider the boost to Australian car makers. Over time, there is no reason why we could not move to phase out petrol powered cars in favour of those powered by gas, especially if the government were prepared to lead by example. The way to do that is exactly the same as we have done in the past. When the manufacture of cars was changed with the introduction of unleaded petrol, the doomsayers predicted all sorts of chaos and pain. However, we have seen that this was not the case and over time we have largely made that transition.
Let us be clear, though: this is not the sort of change that comes about in a short time. It is a change that comes about over decades. That is why we need to start moving towards gas powered vehicles now, to ensure that we make the most of those decades. The worst thing we can do is to not start to address the problem. Why don’t we offer worthwhile rebates to car purchasers to encourage more of them to switch to gas powered vehicles? The current cost for a Ford Falcon powered by gas is $37,280, as opposed to $34,880 for one powered by petrol. If we could, as a nation, increase the market for cars powered solely by gas, I am sure that the price would fall. We have a unique opportunity here to take a lead on this. Why wait until petrol is so expensive that we suffer a decline in our living standards?
Having said that, I believe we also need to consider what we are doing about developing our gas resources onshore. We confront the same situation that we have confronted in this country for many years: we have abundant natural resources, we extract them and then we export them offshore. There is no reason why we should not be developing an Australian industry that converts gas to liquids. I understand that in Qatar they have just spent over $10 billion developing a major infrastructure project to do just that. I fail to understand why Australia is not developing a similar project. Should we end up exporting our gas to Qatar so that they can process it and we can import the refined product back to Australia? We should be taking the opportunity currently available as a result of the resources boom. We need to use the proceeds of this boom to fund the development of new industries that will provide the future economic growth that this country needs, because the current resources boom will not last forever.
Our oil and gas industry does not simply need a rewrite of the previous bill. What is needed is a decent, long-term plan of action that ensures the viability of the oil and gas industry. As I have said before, if we continue as we are, then as the cost of petrol continues to increase so will our standard of living fall. Australia is blessed with abundant natural resources. What we are not blessed with is the vision to use those natural resources most effectively. We need a Commonwealth government that has a plan to reduce our reliance on foreign fuels. Surely, now that the President of the United States is running the argument that the US needs to reduce its reliance on foreign fuel and find alternatives, the Commonwealth government will wake up and confront the same issue.
Compare our approach to the oil issue with that of Sweden. Sweden has just announced the establishment of a committee made up of industrialists, academics, farmers, car makers, public servants and others, which will report to its parliament in several months. The aim of the Swedes is to replace all fossil fuels with renewable energy within 14 years. As their Minister for Sustainable Development has said:
A Sweden free of fossil fuels would give us enormous advantages, not least by reducing the impact from fluctuations in oil prices. The price of oil has tripled since 1996!
Consider the head start the Swedes already have: 20 per cent of all their energy needs in 2003 came from renewable resources. Only 32 per cent of their total energy came from oil, which was down from 77 per cent in 1970. Before Australia takes the option that some have called for, of considering nuclear energy, we should be following the lead of Sweden and beginning to plan for an economy that is not reliant on imported oil.
I would like to conclude my remarks by talking about the state of the oil and gas industry in Western Australia. In the last financial year, the growth of exports from WA’s oil and gas industry has soared. Crude petroleum oils were up $650 million, which is a more than 80 per cent increase over the previous year. Natural gas exports in the same year were up $337 million, or over 64 per cent from the previous year. Those figures speak for themselves. In the June quarter of 2005 the value of oil and gas exports from Western Australia was over $2.5 billion. That is just for one quarter. Currently in Western Australia over $10 billion worth of oil and gas projects are approved or awaiting approval. These are huge projects, which will continue to earn revenue for the Commonwealth and valuable export dollars for Australia. The state government of Western Australia is spending over $180 million on infrastructure projects in the north-west to support those industries. The Commonwealth, however, is spending nothing.
It is all good and well to rewrite the petroleum bill, but when is the Commonwealth going to put its money on the table for infrastructure projects that will support the ongoing growth of Australia’s oil and gas industry? I would like to place on the record the superb work that has been done by Alan Carpenter, now Premier of Western Australia but previously the minister for state development, and his predecessor Clive Brown, in encouraging the expansion of the oil and gas industries and ensuring that the state’s infrastructure plan meets the needs of those industries.
We have a unique opportunity to start working towards reducing our reliance on imported fuels. We must grasp this chance, which is provided on the back of the current resources boom, to build for Australia’s future. What is needed is a vision for the future, not a rewrite of existing legislation.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-27,"—I want to make a few brief comments on the Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 and related bills. The broader issues that are raised by the proposed laws clearly touch on some of the longer term issues around our country’s reliance on oil and petroleum resources. When even President George Bush is talking about the need to break the addiction of the United States to oil, however genuine or otherwise that pronouncement is, it is a recognition of the significant problems that can occur when nations do not recognise the problems but plough ahead, business as usual, and assume that we will just continue to find more and more oil and petroleum resources to meet our ever-growing consumption—let alone issues like potential export desire.
A couple of aspects need to be emphasised. Other senators have already talked about peak oil. Regardless of different views about when peak might be or how it might be manifested, the simple fact is that we are dealing with a resource that is not renewable and the consumption of which continues to grow. We are also dealing with a resource that is a significant contributor to greenhouse emissions. These bills are a reminder to highlight the importance of putting just as much energy—renewable energy—vigour, and broader assistance into developing alternatives.
The other aspect that needs to be emphasised—and I note that there is an amendment dealing with this—is the environmental impact of petroleum exploration and extraction on the marine environment. Broadly speaking, we know a lot less about the marine environment than we know about the terrestrial environment. That includes knowing less about the total impact of some of the things we do in the marine environment. That should be a reminder about the importance of adopting a precautionary approach. One of the consequences of the continuing demand for oil and petroleum products is the continuing push for exploration in more and more remote areas where we do not know much about the marine environment that we are exploring or extracting from. Not only is there a risk of doing damage; there is a risk of doing damage to things that we do not even know are there. There could be a loss of biodiversity or other impacts before we even realise that it is there to be lost. There needs to be a lot more focus on that.
I take the opportunity to remind the Senate and those who are following this debate that the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee has an inquiry currently under way into the effectiveness of our protected area regime throughout Australia. I am pleased that that committee, of which I am the chair, is including marine protected areas in its examination. It is not looking only at how much more marine and land environments we can lock up, throw away the key, and keep people away from. It is also looking at how effective we are in protecting our marine environments, particularly those areas that we recognise as having special values, and designating those protected areas.
I have a particular interest in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, being from Queensland. It is a marine environment that is not only of mind-blowing biodiversity and spectacular beauty but also of enormous economic importance to my own state of Queensland. I have attempted in the past—and I have had a private senator’s bill introduced in this place—to try to expand the protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from the potential risks of offshore petroleum exploration and extraction. It is a simple fact that waters to the east of the designated Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are not protected from exploration and extraction. Clearly, there is always a potential for flow-on negative consequences to the marine park if significant oil reserves are extracted in areas adjoining the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That is an issue that deserves to continue to be explored. It is something that I have explored in this chamber and in committees over a few years, and I am pleased that an amendment has been circulated that touches on some of those issues.
I think it is important, with legislation like this, to raise these issues and make sure that we do not glibly brush them to one side. Obviously there is a lot of economic opportunity, prosperity and wealth to be generated from oil reserves. I am not blind to that, ignoring it, or saying that it cannot be of value, but we should not ignore the value—including the economic value—of the marine environment. It may be longer term and it may be harder to measure, but that does not mean that it is not there. We need to do a lot better at recognising that and factoring it into the cost benefit analysis of the various things that we undertake. With those brief comments I conclude my remarks and allow the chamber to proceed to some of the amendments.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-27,"—I rise to say how absolutely shocked I am that in a supposedly comprehensive rewrite of a piece of legislation, the Offshore Petroleum Bill 2005 and related bills, at this period in our history the environment is practically ignored. For all the talk about ecologically sustainable development, for all the talk about triple bottom-line accounting and for all the public awareness that goes on in relation to whale strandings, seismic testing and the ecosystem approach, neither the word ‘marine’ nor ‘ocean’ appears in the bills. Can you believe that? In 2006, neither the word ‘marine’ nor ‘ocean’ appears in the offshore petroleum bills. Where is offshore? Offshore is the marine environment. I find it absolutely disgusting that these bills have been written with, effectively, a prehistoric approach to our oceans.
Australia has been running around the world in international fora talking up its oceans policy. Australia has an oceans policy, but it writes offshore petroleum legislation that fails to mention the oceans and the marine environment and uses the sea only in jurisdictional reference—as in territorial sea. The generic term ‘environment’ is used but only in a very short section on restoration of the environment—that is a matter of a couple of pages in a massive bill. Even then, it only goes to minimal restoration of the ecosystem and environment.
This legislation should have been framed in the context of Australia’s oceans policy, which was introduced in 1998, and in the context of ecosystem based management—environmentally sustainable development, multiple-use management and regional marine planning. And yet it is not framed that way, not at all. It makes some fundamental assumptions that the marine environment is a free good; that it is there for the sole purpose of providing resources to humankind. So the marine environment only exists as long as it can provide oil, gas, fishing and whatever else humans decide they want to use the marine environment for—and use it for as long as it takes to destroy it without even understanding the complexity of it.
At the World Parks Congress in Durban a couple of years ago, it was recognised that 10 per cent of the world’s terrestrial area is in national parks protected areas of some kind but that less than one per cent of the world’s oceans have the same level of protection. It was moved in Durban that we should aim in the next decade for 10 per cent of the world’s terrestrial environment to be put into protected areas. It has long been understood that if you make marine parks then you not only protect ecosystems but you actually support fisheries, because those marine parks act as breeding grounds. They are protected areas for the fisheries to maintain resilience, breed up fish stocks and so on and maintain the wild fisheries outside those marine protected areas.
—Not true.
—It is absolutely true of marine parks and protected areas. There is a vast amount of literature demonstrating the value to fisheries of marine protected areas. I would suggest that you read some of that literature if you dispute that. It is a matter of fact in ecosystem based management and in fisheries management.
Over this last summer we have had whale strandings around Australia. At the time we had a whale stranding off the south-east coast of Tasmania, we had naval vessels there using sonar and we had the oil and gas industry in Bass Strait also using seismic testing. Both of those things are in fact proven. The Navy admitted that it was there this summer using seismic testing and, indeed, the oil and gas industry were also testing in Bass Strait at the time.
What is Australia supposed to be doing in terms of strandings and tissue testing in regard to the impact of seismic testing on cetaceans? We were supposed to be developing a national network and protocols for rescue and post-mortem. As far as I am aware, little has happened with regard to the development of that protocol for rescue and post-mortem. There has been no word on that for many months. We have to have a protocol that includes investigation of noise pollution in cases where it seems likely that noise is involved. That is currently what is going on in the US. A noise protocol is being developed in the US as a result of court action that was taken because of the impact of noise from seismic testing and sonar activity on whales. The requirement for tissue testing of stranded cetaceans for possible seismic impacts is an issue that ought to be considered in this particular legislation. The marine environment is not a driver in the legislation, and it does not provide sufficient direction in terms of what should be done in relation to offshore petroleum and exploration.
The other problem with this legislation is that there is no reference to other stakeholders: other agencies or authorities of relevance to the marine environment with a stake in knowing what the oil and gas industry is up to. There is nothing about consultation and referrals with those other agencies. The government should have taken the opportunity to better integrate one of the major marine resources statutes—the oceans policy—into this particular legislation, and it has completely ignored it.
Another issue that concerns me is that an exploration permit lasts six years, the renewal of an exploration permit lasts for another five years and the option for a retention lease could last for another 15 if the area is not economically viable in current circumstances. On an initial read of the legislation, it seems possible for a company to have a commercial interest in an area for up to 26 years before production occurs. Add the production time onto that and it could be argued that this is effectively a property right over a public resource that could be used to stymie efforts to establish marine national parks due to claims by the industry for compensation. This cementing of rights appears again in several clauses and in the explanatory memorandum as well: the creation of the express right to recover petroleum in a retention area.
Once again, there is this idea of resource security. So we are giving a public good—the global commons, the marine environment—over to companies effectively for 26 years. If we move because the culture changes and people realise how important the marine environment is and we go to protect marine environment areas, you are going to have the petroleum companies arguing that they should get compensation for not being able to proceed even though they have not proceeded earlier because it suited them and it was not economically viable to do so.
There are no objects in this bill. Can you believe that? We have a complete rewrite of this legislation, and there is no object in the bill. One of the amendments that I intend to move on this bill tonight is to put an object into the bill to ensure that any offshore activities relating to petroleum exploration, recovery, storage and transport are carried out in a way that is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, especially in relation to the conservation of marine resources. I would argue that that is an entirely appropriate object for a bill of this kind. To bring to this parliament a bill which is effectively an administrative bill to cover the activities of offshore petroleum exploration, mining, drilling, seismic testing and so on and to not have an object in the bill is disgraceful.
Much more environmental detail needs to be in the bill, and it is not there. We need to have a public process with notices in major relevant daily newspapers, on the web, to various organisations and so on. There is no requirement for that. The application process for an exploration lease does not require an environmental constraints assessment; it only requires a statement of the economic viability of the company applying. Before exploration leases are allowed, there should be an environmental constraints assessment. It is unbelievable that a company can apply for an exploration lease but it does not require any assessment of environmental constraints.
This legislation might as well have been written in 1900. That is how backward it is in terms of current oceans policy around the world. This is from a government that, as I said, goes to marine conferences and argues that it is passionate about cetaceans, that it has got an oceans policy and has set up an oceans office. To do what? This is an oceans policy that has no legislative backing. None of the principles of the oceans policy are incorporated into this bill. I would expect that, when Senator Colbeck gets to his feet to explain the government’s position, we will get an explanation as to why there is no reference to environmental or ecosystem management; why there is no reference to ecologically sustainable development; why there is no object in this bill; and why there is carte blanche for the oil and gas industry. It is going to be even more critical in the coming years as we face the oil crisis.
As other senators have mentioned earlier tonight, we are facing an oil crisis. That is why the Greens in this house moved for a reference to a Senate committee to start looking at the strategic planning issues for energy security and oil supply for Australia. The government did not recognise the need for it, because it takes the view that all you have to do is give people more concessions, give companies more corporate welfare, incentives, tax breaks, environmental breaks and whatever else to get them to drill and somehow they will find more—that is, we have a planet which is infinite.
We have a finite planet. The oil and gas companies have pretty well combed the entire planet. They know where the reserves are that are easy to get, and most of them have already been accessed. I believe we have already reached the rollover point where demand has exceeded supply and, if we have not already reached peak oil, we are likely to do so in the next decade. I agree: we need to have some strategic planning to get Australia off the oil drip in the same way as has been talked about for the United States. But that is separate from this issue that we are discussing here tonight, which is a bill about how Australia deals with its offshore petroleum activities.
It should be noted that Australia has the largest marine jurisdiction in the world. We have twice as much water as land, and only five per cent of the world’s ocean area has already been discovered biologically. We hear virtually every month that new sea mounts are being discovered. People are moving rapidly to try to protect the biodiversity around these sea mounts before the trawlers get there and smash the areas as they have currently been doing. The best thing this government could do, if it wanted to take some leadership on the marine environment, would be to protect the sea mounts and ban trawling in Australian waters. That would make a significant contribution, but I do not expect that kind of leadership from the government.
Simply saying that all you have to do when you apply for an exploration licence is give a statement of economic viability of the company, not the environmental constraints of the area, demonstrates precisely where the government is coming from. I am really shocked that the people drafting this bill did not think to incorporate the principles of ecological sustainable development and ecosystem management into this particular legislation.
Senator Bartlett mentioned a moment ago the issue of marine parks and cetaceans—and one of the Australian Greens amendments tonight will be moving to prohibit oil exploration in marine reserves. That is entirely appropriate. If you are going to stop fishing in marine reserves and recognise that marine reserves protect the ecosystem then you do not favour the oil industry by kicking out the fishermen in order to give access to the oil companies, which is effectively what is happening around Australia’s coasts. In goes the oil industry, and what sort of damage do they cause in marine parks, especially when they get involved in seismic testing? It is extremely noisy, as we know, and can have a significant impact on marine species.
It is entirely appropriate that we do not have oil and gas exploration in marine protected areas, and I will be moving that in these amendments. We are also putting an object into the bill that offshore activities relating to petroleum exploration be carried out according to the principles of ecologically sustainable development; that an environmental plan must be required before any petroleum activity is given any kind of approval; that any plan for exploration must comply with an improved environment plan; and that operations must not continue where new environmental risk is identified in compliance with something apparently the drafters and the government have not heard of—that is, the precautionary principle. It is a new idea in Australia, it seems. It is well recognised in other parts of the world and is especially recognised by people who take marine protected areas and ecologically sustainable development seriously.
The other problem is that there is no cradle-to-grave approach to environmental protection from the industry. No mention is made of the EPBC Act at all. Where is the integration between this act and the EPBC Act? It seems like a disjointed approach that will not add up to marine protection and could never be satisfactory. A moment ago I raised the issue of whether the seismic guidelines are in place. Senator Colbeck seems to think that they are. I would like to ask specifically what has happened to the Department of Environment and Heritage seismic steering committee dealing with the EPBC seismic operations and cetacean guidelines. I want to know whether they have been updated, whether the new guidelines that were being drafted are in fact out there and implemented and, if these new guidelines have not been implemented, why haven’t they, because they were hideously outdated and there was a strong recognition that they needed to be.
So we have some big issues with this. We are simply seeing a premise in this bill that the ocean is a free commodity for the benefit of the offshore oil and petroleum industry, providing maximum resource for use in the whole fossil fuel industry and that the environment can be compromised. It is disgraceful and I never want to hear the minister for environment, Senator Ian Campbell, stand up in this place again and talk about oceans policy and how he is the great champion of cetaceans. He is not here tonight. I would like the minister who is representing the minister responsible for this legislation to explain how you can bring in here an offshore petroleum bill which has no object for the bill, no recognition of the problems with cetaceans and in the marine environment, no recognition of the concept of ecologically sustainable development and no recognition of environmental management and does not mention the words ‘oceans’ or ‘marine’ once.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-02-27,"—That was an interesting presentation by Senator Milne. I thought that some of the things she put on the record she might have been au fait with—certainly in relation to the tissue sampling. My advice is the guidelines on that have been completed. I am sure that you will look forward to getting some advice on that particular matter and some of the others that you raised in your presentation. It is disturbing that issues like blaming the Navy for whale strandings around Tasmania in the last 12 months were placed on the record in the way that they were. The Navy were in the area during two of the whale strandings but they were in fact in port.
—No, they were not.
—They were in port for the first two of the strandings, Senator. They were actually at sea during the third. Obviously, there are investigations going on with that, but to place carte blanche blame on the Navy for all of the events that occurred is, I think, quite disingenuous. It does nobody’s cause any good, including the Greens, to make comments of that nature. I think the public would expect more of us, that we would put these sorts of matters on the public record correctly rather than making broad, sweeping statements that apply blame rather than deal with the specifics of the issue as they stand. It stands us all in poor stead. It certainly does not help those who are genuinely involved in looking at these issues on a proper basis.
I would like to thank everyone who took part in this debate. Australia’s marine jurisdiction is extensive, as has been said, as are the hydrocarbon resources held within those areas and their contribution to the nation’s economy. It is therefore not surprising that a substantial legislative package such as this is needed for encouraging exploration and managing Australia’s offshore petroleum industry. This legislation is also conspicuous by the thoroughness of consultation that was undertaken in its drafting, both with the offshore petroleum industry and state and the Northern Territory governments. I express my gratitude to the Prime Minister, who gave approval for exposure drafts of the bill to be widely circulated to stakeholders during the drafting process. I am particularly grateful to those industry members and officials who examined the draft bills and provided critical comments and constructive suggestions about them. This was important with a view to avoiding inadvertent changes in rewriting provisions from the current acts into the new texts.
We now have before the Senate these best practice items of legislation. Technological developments, global energy markets and the world economy all exert impacts which mean the regulatory framework for offshore petroleum exploration and development is unlikely to stand still for long. Change is inevitable, at times involving subordinate legislation, at times the act itself. That said, I have no doubt that if the bills we are voting on today are passed their titles will become part of the energy resource sector vocabulary for a long time to come. More than that, I am confident that this legislation, by reducing compliance and administration costs for industry and governments, will help make Australia a more attractive place for petroleum exploration and development. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-02-27,"—I remember in the early 1970s, when I was a schoolboy first coming to political awareness, it was the custom of my family on Sundays at noon to watch on the television a short program by BA Santamaria called Point of View. Mr Santamaria would warn against the threat of communism. He would talk about the tyranny of communism. I can still remember the lurid diagrams—the hammer and sickle across so many nations of the world and the downward-thrusting arrows in South-East Asia—and it was obvious to me, even to my schoolboyish eyes, that Mr Santamaria was very much against the prejudices of his time. Indeed, he subsequently entitled his memoirs Against the Tide.
For those were the days when Mao Zedong was regarded as a great historical figure, when there was more sympathy for the Vietcong than for the Australian and American forces deployed in Vietnam, when Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were cult heroes, and Mao jackets and fatigues, red-star adorned workers’ caps and T-shirts displaying the latest item in communist kitsch were the last word in radical chic. It was a time when brilliant parliamentarians—men of outstanding intellect such as WC Wentworth, the member for Mackellar, and Senator Ivor Greenwood—were mocked and ridiculed as right-wing extremists when they sounded the alarm to an apparently unseeing world on the gravity of communist tyranny in so many nations.
With the passage of the years, the world’s eyes slowly began to open. By the middle of the 1970s, Soviet scientists like Andrei Sakharov and writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were received in the West, and the West heeded their warnings about what the Soviet system stood for. Solzhenitsyn in particular exposed the Gulag. We in Australia witnessed at relatively close quarters the genocide of Pol Pot in the late 1970s, and then later in the 1980s we saw the Tiananmen Square massacre and the fall of the Berlin Wall. By the early 1990s, the collapse of communism had led to the opening of the Kremlin archives, and the full magnitude and horror of the system which had prevailed in the eastern European nations and in the Soviet Union were exposed for all to see. Solzhenitsyn’s dire warnings were demonstrated to be nothing more than a stark picture of an awful reality. The world began to reassess.
However, to this day there is for some—particularly among the bourgeois left in the West—a selective capacity for outrage. There are still some who practise discrimination in their condemnation of political tyranny and selectivity in their pity for its victims. It is in that context that I want to draw to the attention of the Senate a most important resolution of the European Parliament that was carried some four weeks ago, on 25 January. It was resolution No. 1481 and it was moved by Mr Goran Lindblad, a Swedish parliamentarian of the European People’s Party. The resolution, which acknowledged and condemned the extent of communist atrocities in the 20th century, came on the heels of a report to the European assembly of its political affairs committee.
This is the first comprehensive audit of the number of deaths directly attributable to communism in the 20th century. Although there have been numerous estimates by writers, academics and think tanks, the Council of Europe’s document is the first comprehensive study by a major government body. For that reason alone, it is an occasion of historic significance. According to the Council of Europe, a conservative estimate of deaths worldwide which are directly attributable to communist governments and revolutionary movements since the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917 is 94.5 million souls. That figure does not include people who died in wars fought by communist regimes against other nations. It does include deaths from genocide, purges, deportation, famines, civil wars, wartime reprisals, deaths in gulags and other concentration camps, and all other forms of domestic state-sponsored killing.
The countries in which the greatest number of deaths are estimated to have occurred are China, 65 million; the Soviet Union, 20 million; Cambodia, two million; North Korea, two million; Africa, 1.7 million; Afghanistan, 1.5 million; Vietnam, one million; and Eastern Europe, one million. According to the Council of Europe, the death toll attributable to communism in the last century was almost one million people per year. On average, more than 2,500 people a day for every day of every year of the 20th century were exterminated in the service of ideology.
To put those figures into context, the most reliable estimate of the number of people, military and civilian, killed in the First World War is between 10 and 15 million and, in the Second World War, between 50 million and 60 million. In other words, the number of people killed by communism in the 20th century—even on the most conservative estimate—exceeds by some 20 million the number of people killed in both world wars. Unlike war, the death toll from communism was the result of the deliberate policy of communist apparatchiks, driven by ideology to liquidate their own countrymen.
It has been rightly said by historians that the 20th century was the most bloody century the world has ever seen. It was the most bloody century because of the development of war and killing on an industrial scale. It was the most bloody century because of the rise of tyrannical regimes across the world. But of all the causes of human suffering, death and bloodshed in the 20th century, the deliberate, advertent imposition on domestic populations by communist governments and communist movements of a policy of extermination of those who did not fit into their particular ideology—almost 100 million people—was the greatest.
I think it is important that this Senate acknowledge the resolution of the Council of Europe. Some six years into the 21st century, it is not too early for us to assess the 20th century with the beginnings of some sort of historical perspective. It is not too early for us to begin to grasp the awful magnitude of the experiment that was communism. Even though our minds can barely comprehend the almost astronomical numbers of human souls involved, including men, women and children, we can at least in relative terms appreciate that in the century of industrial scale warfare, communism—an ideology, the fruit of the brains of men and women—was responsible for more slaughter than both of the great wars.
We should be pleased that the Council of Europe, which presides over the jurisdiction in which much of the slaughter took place, has at last published an audit of that tyranny. We, on all sides of politics—professed practitioners of liberal democracy—should note it with solemnity and humility, and we should resolve that that should never be allowed to happen in this century, and the moral blindness which saw the West avert its eyes in the 20th century should never be suffered to happen again.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Communism</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
