"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to make some remarks on the Australian Citizenship Bill 2006 and cognate bill. In doing so, I acknowledge that many of the aspects of the legislation are non-controversial. I want to particularly highlight some recent events that occurred with regard to a citizenship ceremony in the Sutherland shire on Australia Day which certainly were controversial. When this bill was first introduced the then minister, in his second reading speech, stated:
Today I have the honour to present the Australian Citizenship Bill 2005 which deals with the core of our national identity—Australian citizenship.
This bill, once passed by the Parliament will replace legislation which introduced the concept and reality of Australian citizenship on Australia Day 1949.
During debate in the House, many members reflected on citizenship ceremonies they had attended. They commented on the obvious pride and joy of former migrants and humanitarian entrants to this country making the pledge, which is the final step in becoming an Australian citizen.
Like all members of parliament, both in the House and in the Senate, I have attended many Australian citizenship ceremonies over the years. I refer particularly to Australia Day citizenship ceremonies held in the Sutherland shire each year. These are very large occasions. Indeed, usually there are some 150 to 200 people taking out citizenship that day. It is a major event on the shire calendar and, as Sutherland shire people are prone to be very parochial, they regard this part of Australia as the birthplace of the Australian nation, when Cook first landed in 1770. They are always significant events. All the state and federal politicians and local councillors attend, and it is a great day. After the ceremony is concluded there is always a good old-fashioned Aussie barbecue. It is wonderful to see not only the new Australian citizens who attend that day and take out citizenship but also the many families and friends who come along to enjoy that special occasion.
They have always been bipartisan events. Indeed, as I said, I have been attending these ceremonies since I came into this parliament in 1994. I can say, without contradiction, that they have always been treated appropriately by the respective members of parliament, whichever political persuasion they come from. My federal colleagues Danna Vale and Bruce Baird and state members always treat the occasion as an opportunity to express their appreciation to new citizens and to welcome them as part of the great Australian nation. Until this year, I cannot recall any one occasion where there has been an attempt to use that event as a political platform. But, sadly, this year that is what happened. The Australia Day ceremony received a fair amount of coverage in the media, both in print and on radio in Sydney, so I want to set the record straight.
Prior to Australia Day, the leader of the New South Wales opposition, Mr Debnam, approached the council requesting an invitation to attend and speak at the Australia Day ceremony. He is not a local member of parliament for that area; he is in fact the member for Vaucluse. He sought not to attend an Australia Day citizenship ceremony in his own electorate but to come to the Sutherland shire and attend one in that region. I think the reasons are pretty obvious. Firstly, the Liberal Party hopes to win two state marginal seats in that area, Miranda and Menai. The second—unfortunately, as we all recall—is the Cronulla riots two years ago. There is no doubt in my mind, and in the mind of many others, that the NSW Leader of the Opposition sought to use the occasion to try to gain some cheap political advantage by attending and speaking at the ceremony in Sutherland. He sought an invitation and it was granted. The mayor—who happens to have been a member of the Liberal Party but decided to run as an Independent for mayor—extended an invitation to Mr Debnam and welcomed him to the occasion. Indeed, as a result of that, other local members of parliament declined the opportunity to speak on that occasion because it would have extended the ceremony for a much longer period.
Mr Debnam provided a copy of his speech to the council, to the mayor, prior to Australia Day. There were a number of paragraphs in that speech which were blatantly political. For instance, he directly referred to candidates for the Liberal Party in the two seats I have just mentioned. He sought to highlight the fact that they were running for the seats and to give them some support. He also made a number of comments which were clearly an unfortunate reflection upon the history surrounding the Cronulla riots, which, I must say, people of all political persuasions in the shire have been working hard to overcome. I pay particular tribute to my federal colleague Bruce Baird. Along with the council and other members of parliament, he has endeavoured to improve community relations in that area. For instance, a program has been running where young people of Muslim faith have been encouraged to join the local surf clubs and train to be lifesavers. A range of programs such as this have been initiated and I think they have been working well.
On Australia Day, the leader of the Liberal Party opposition in New South Wales decided that he wanted to go to the Sutherland shire and make a big partisan political speech to try and promote his state candidates. Naturally there was an objection from the mayor and the council to the content of the speech and Mr Debnam was asked to take out the offending paragraphs. I might interpose here by reminding all senators, not that they need reminding, that it is a specific requirement of the government, and an appropriate requirement of the government—it has been a longstanding requirement of governments, whether they be Labor or Liberal—that these ceremonies be treated in a bipartisan way. I quote from the letter forwarded to me and other members of parliament by Andrew Robb, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in January this year. In the section that refers to the conduct of ceremonies the letter states:
The Code makes clear, at page 28, that “All elected local representatives, at the Federal, State/Territory and Local Government level, shall over time have an opportunity to provide a welcoming speech ...”.
I stress that the reference is to ‘elected local representatives’. It continues:
There is reference to the possibility of brief messages of welcome from local clubs and associations and/or any local celebrity—
I do not think Mr Debnam is a local celebrity in the Sutherland shire; he might be trying to be one—
and that “ ... it is essential that the dignity and bipartisan significance of citizenship ceremonies be maintained at all time. Citizenship ceremonies shall not be used as forums for political or partisan expression ...”.
I read that out because it was very clear that the first speech prepared by Mr Debnam which he intended to give on that day contravened those specific requirements for bipartisan and non-political content. When Mr Debnam was asked to take out the offending paragraphs in his speech he embarked upon a media campaign in Sydney. He claimed that he was being banned from speaking, that he was being muzzled, that he was being censored. On one occasion he said that he did not really care whether or not the mayor liked his speech. He said he would give his speech either inside the council centre at the citizenship ceremony or on the footsteps of the council building. He became very defiant and built it up as if his right to make a speech was being rejected. The fact is that he had no right, technically, to make the speech. He had sought an invitation which had been acceded to and then he sought to abuse it.
Eventually Mr Debnam redrafted his speech and took out the offending paragraphs. At least he backed down in that respect. However, on the morning of Australia Day he was all over the radio running this campaign, attacking the mayor and attacking the council, saying they were trying to ban him. Indeed, there were articles and editorials in the newspapers—I refer particularly to the Daily Telegraph of Saturday, 27 January, the day after Australia Day—which picked up the theme that Mr Debnam was promoting and which were critical of the mayor and the council for seeking to have Mr Debnam abide by the code.
The fact of the matter is that on that day Mr Debnam, I thought in a most outrageous and disgraceful manner, tried to hijack an Australian citizenship ceremony for base partisan political motives. You ask the question: why would the state member for Vaucluse, the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, on Australia Day seek to travel to the Sutherland shire—an area with which he has had no association at all up until recently—to give a citizenship speech? Normally members do that in their own electorate, or they might attend a major function in a capital city. But no; it was quite obvious what Mr Debnam was doing. During his speech he referred to what had happened at Cronulla. As I said earlier, there has been a lot of good work done by a lot of people to heal the wounds that were so disgracefully opened in late 2005 with the Cronulla riots. Frankly, I think Mr Debnam’s conduct deserves to be condemned.
I am particularly concerned that radio commentators such as Alan Jones picked up on this, and again ran Mr Debnam’s mantra that he was being denied free speech. We all recall—the record is very clear—the conduct of Alan Jones on the radio in the weeks leading up to the Cronulla riots. He was on the radio, some might say, inciting people to come down to Cronulla that weekend to those protest rallies. Certainly they turned ugly. I am particularly intrigued by that because Mr Jones, like Mr Debnam, would normally have trouble even finding his way to the Sutherland shire. I can give a direct instance of that. A couple of years ago Alan Jones was the guest speaker at the opening of an art exhibition at the local gallery in the Sutherland shire. I was there. Mr Jones came out, and in his opening remarks to the assembled gathering he commented upon the fact that it had been a long, long time since he had been to the Sutherland shire and that he had really had trouble finding his way there. He normally only drives on the outskirts of the shire as he heads down to his country estate—somewhere in the Kangaroo Valley, I think. Probably the last time he had visited the shire was when he was coaching Balmain, back in the days when they were not terribly successful—they were probably playing a game at Shark Park. Why do I mention this? It is because Alan Jones is on the radio speaking as if he is an expert on community relations, crime, ethnic tensions and so on in the Sutherland shire, when he would not have the first iota of knowledge of what happens in our community.
I wanted to put this on the record today because I find it intriguing that members of this government have, from time to time, taken the opportunity to condemn mayors or other politicians—generally from our side of the fence—for making what they believe are partisan political speeches at citizenship ceremonies. If they did make those partisan political speeches then I would accept that they should not have done so. But this is the government’s code. I find it incredible that the person who seeks to be the next Premier of New South Wales would so abuse the requirements of a code that is laid down by his fellow Liberal government here in Canberra. People in the Sutherland shire, like any other community, do not appreciate people from outside coming in and stirring up trouble—and that goes for politicians like Mr Debnam as much as it goes for anyone else.
Question negatived.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked Senators Wong and Sterle today relating to climate change.
Today we saw quite extensive reporting in the media, including on the front page of a number of Australian papers, of the Energy Supply Association of Australia, the ESAA—which represents electricity and gas businesses, which contribute more than $14 billion to the Australian economy—calling on the Howard government to back a national emissions trading scheme. So the energy suppliers themselves are calling on the Howard government to back an emissions trading scheme. We asked Senator Minchin about this and a couple of other matters today. We asked him about the fact that even industry is calling for the government to set clear policy settings to drive more sustainable outcomes and to drive a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Let’s just get this in context: not only have we had in recent times a range of major businesses calling for the government to take leadership on this issue—and I include, for example, the Insurance Australia Group, BP, Origin Energy, Visy and Westpac—but also we now have the industry which produces energy, the Energy Supply Association, which represents electricity and gas businesses, saying, ‘We need to look at an emissions trading scheme and we need to do it soon.’
What do we have with this government? We have a government of climate change sceptics, a government that is not prepared to show national leadership on this issue. And how did Senator Minchin deal with that in question time today? He tried to suggest that actually the Energy Supply Association was motivated—I think he said he detected this motivation—by a desire to ensure that other sectors of the economy receive similar scrutiny for their greenhouse gas emissions. It was really a pathetic answer, to try and suggest that their motives in calling for what is a substantial policy initiative were driven only by a concern about other sectors. That may well be an issue but that is no answer given the fact that you have significant parts of Australian business, leading Australian business operators, calling for the government to show leadership on this issue and calling for an emissions trading scheme. And what do we have? Frankly, we have climate change sceptics—climate change troglodytes—on the other side of the chamber refusing to do anything.
People should understand that the Howard government is well behind Australian business on this issue. I want to quote briefly some of the comments of Mr Brad Page, who is the Energy Supply Association of Australia’s chief executive:
“We’ve recognised for some time that climate change is a big issue,” Mr Page said.
“ Investment decisions about base load generation are going to be needed in the next few years if we’re to meet the expected growth in demand out to 2030 … So our position on emissions trading is about recognising that if politicians conclude we’ve got to move to a low emissions economy, we can’t do it overnight.”
So we have business taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this, recognising that there is likely to be in the future an increased pressure on business for a reduction in emissions. In fact, they are recognising that there already is that internationally, in terms of our competitor economies and also in terms of investors and the community. The only people who have not woken up to the need for this are the members of the Howard government.
Today Senator Minchin went back to the hoary old chestnut. He went back to that old line: ‘We’re not going to do this; we’re not going to go down the national emissions trading scheme route until the rest of the world signs some.’ In other words, despite the calls by business for certainty and clear signals, the Howard government’s position is ‘let’s sit on our hands’. We know that the government is running a couple of different messages here. Perhaps it is because Senator Minchin’s position actually differs from that of some of his colleagues. We know he is a climate change sceptic. I want to remind the chamber that the possibility of the introduction of a domestic emissions trading scheme ahead of any global scheme was in fact raised in an issues paper produced by the task force on emissions trading commissioned by the Prime Minister. While we know there are differences of opinion within the government, the key issue here, and people should clearly understand this, is that leading Australian businesses—many in the financial sector and in the insurance sector, because they understand the risk, and in the energy sector; today it was the Energy Supply Association, which includes gas and electricity generators—are well ahead of the government on this issue.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2007-02-26,"—What surprises me about the argument that the opposition mounts over the criticism that it offers of the government for not rapidly ratifying the Kyoto convention is the obvious omission of the considerable unemployment that ratifying the Kyoto convention would have brought upon the workers in this country. I think it is just another case of the Prime Minister taking up what has been the usual role of the Australian Labor Party in past decades and becoming the champion of working-class people.
The government certainly believe that the emission of carbon is a significant contributor to global warming. But, as the Prime Minister has said, we are not so much sceptics as realists. The reality of it, if you have a program that wants to stop the mining of coal in Australia, is that we are the biggest exporters in the world of both thermal and metallurgical coal. They are of the highest possible standards that you would find anywhere on earth. They contribute enormously to the coffers of Australia that not only allow for what we believe is full employment but also allow for an extraordinarily high standard of living.
The coal does not come from Western Australia, as do a lot of our exports goods that contribute to this unbelievable standard of living that we in Australia sometimes take for granted. In fact, the coal comes from the more populous states of New South Wales and Queensland. Victoria has brown coal, which is seen as the bogeyman of all electricity generation. Victoria, under a Labor government—as all the states and territories are—is the major contributor of CO and other nasty gases in Australia.
The government believes that, if you are going to replace something as fundamentally important as coal to the Australian economy, you must have a plan in place. The coalition government’s plan is that uranium could play a major role. I have visited several power plants throughout the world. I do not mean that I have just gone up to the gate and had a look; I have been into the reactors themselves, in countries such as the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Argentina and the United States. I have been into the power station at Calvert Cliffs, for instance, in the United States. Calvert Cliffs has two 1,000-megawatt uranium derived power stations. The production at Calvert Cliffs is on the edge of Chesapeake Bay, which is arguably one of the most environmentally sensitive areas of the United States. It produces electricity at about 3½c per kilowatt hour in United States currency. It is near Washington, District of Columbia—not the state—and Maryland and other populous states of America, but people see nothing wrong with that. The farmlands go right up to the concrete wall of the outer perimeter of the power station. If you are going to deny the production of uranium, which is cleaner, greener, safer and economically more viable than any other form of power generation, as well as ask not to have CO emissions from coal-fired power stations, you are leading Australia down a disastrous economic path.
I do not know what is wrong with the opposition sometimes, but I lose faith in ever having a real alternative, viable government, not that I ever want one but it would be nice to know that in the case of some of the sorts of political catastrophes that are going on at the moment—with the state government in the west and with the state government in New South Wales and with the state government of Queensland, and no doubt the others will pick this up—there is a viable government to replace these people at least at a federal level. But there is not. You cannot possibly have a government that caves in to the green movement; we all know that they are left-wing existentialists. You cannot have that without alternative, viable people at the helm of this nation. We are the ones that will do it. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-02-26,"—In response to a question today, the minister, Senator Minchin, said that his government was not going to ‘rush down a path’ in response to climate change. No, Minister, there is no way that anyone in this country could ever claim that the government was going to rush down any path in response to the incredibly important issue of climate change. In terms of process, what people in the community have been saying is: ‘What is the government doing?’
When we ask straightforward questions about what is actually happening in the government’s planning, we are given a list of publications that go back several years—and, indeed, there have been publications on various issues to do with climate change and our future. We are told, consistently, that the government did set up the first Greenhouse Office over 10 years ago, and we acknowledge that. There has never been, from this side of the chamber, any rejection of those statements from the government. However, we—and not just us but also the community—are demanding and expecting more.
We heard from Senator Wong, in one of her questions today, about the processes being put forward by businesses across Australia. These are not the people that the government usually dismisses lightly and labels. We heard in the recent contribution from Senator Lightfoot the tired old arguments, the labelling of people who have genuine concerns about the environment and have been pursuing these issues for many years. Once again, it is really easy to just whack a label on them and dismiss them, to call them ‘lefties’ and say they are people who have not got a realistic approach to the world.
Given that that is the background to the government’s arguments, it must be a little confronting for a government that has dismissed the arguments about the need for immediate and strong action on climate change to be confronted by such an amazing group of leftie radicals as the Business Council of Australia and the large businesses at the Global Roundtable on Climate Change, including General Electric, Ford, Toyota, Goldman Sachs and Wal-Mart! They are significant organisations and they are saying that there is an expectation of and a need for action.
We had, towards the end of last year, a gathering of faith groups—people who usually gather to talk about their natural concerns about their own lives and the future of our community. One of the priorities for this gathering of faith groups was to say that there needed to be an identification and acknowledgement of, and a unified plan to look at, the impact of climate change in our community. That is not too demanding. That is not asking for too much. And it certainly is not asking for someone to rush down a path. However, when there are other groups that come forward—as we have heard today from Senator Wong—to talk about environmental demands, what happens is that the government tries to attribute motivation. They look at the statements that are being made and, instead of looking at what the demands are—which are that there needs to be action taken—they attribute motivation. Well, I think, Minister, the motivation is concern and a need for a future.
During the recent Senate estimates processes, considerable numbers of questions were asked of various departments about what processes had been undertaken specifically on economic modelling of the impacts of climate change. I think there has been much more awareness, both at home and internationally, since the release of that significant report in the UK. But, nonetheless, we asked quite specific questions of the government and their public sector workers about what economic modelling had been done. I would have thought that there would have been a simple answer, ‘Yes, this has been done,’ or ‘No, it hasn’t.’ But after sustained questioning, it became clear that there has not been any formal economic modelling by this government about the impact of climate change. There has been the production of documents; there have been reviews; there have been reports. Senator Minchin mentioned a number of those in his response to questions without notice today.
But the specific question is: what has this government done, through its economic facilities—through the Treasury, through the department of finance—on the economic costs and impact of climate change? That, to me, is something that all Australians need to know. It is something that cannot be dismissed lightly. People cannot be labelled just for wanting to know what economic position has been taken. Instead of hearing that all-too-easy abuse and rejection of people who have alternative views, we want to know what is happening. Creating structures is not taking action. Writing papers is not taking action. And if we are all going to be sitting here waiting for the report on 31 May— (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-02-26,"—The Labor Party in this debate are referring to Senator Minchin’s answers to questions without notice today on climate change. We just heard a comment to the effect that Senator Minchin had responded to one of the questions by saying ‘we are not going to rush down a path’ with regard to climate change and emissions trading. That is a very correct response from the minister because this is an issue that requires very careful consideration and a considered policy response. After all, in recent times, with regard to emissions trading, we have seen the value of carbon credits in Europe fall by some 75 per cent, with, obviously, financial and economic consequences attaching to that—the danger of financial uncertainty. So, if we are going to introduce a dramatically different system, a new system, to deal with this issue, we need to be able to ensure that it is going to be a stable system, that it is a practical system that will work and that it will be sustainable in the long term. So it does need very careful consideration.
In that context, the government has provided billions of dollars of funding in recent times for its Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund. Those funds have been made available to a number of organisations to enable them to conduct research and development with regard to emissions trading. There are the coal sequestration projects—several of those are receiving funding. Solar Systems has received funding to establish a major solar energy project in Victoria. So the government is taking very positive initiatives in this regard.
The comment reported today by the Energy Supply Association of Australia with regard to an emissions trading scheme is one more contribution to the debate. The statement of the ESAA highlighted the complexities involved in designing and implementing an emissions trading system—again, an issue that demonstrates the need for very careful consideration before we move forward on this. Last week we had the report from the National Generators Forum which highlighted the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue. It highlighted the fact that, under the Rudd-Garrett plan for deep emissions cuts, the future use of nuclear power would be inevitable. Without nuclear energy and nuclear generated electricity there will be massive and unsustainable increases in energy prices for all Australians. Australians are very sensitive to increases in energy prices. Even though they are, as is the government, concerned about the future of our environment, they have a strong and legitimate concern about the future cost of their energy. Unless we are prepared to adopt the nuclear option as part of emissions cuts, then those energy prices will increase unsustainably. The National Generators Forum report showed that there will be billions and billions of dollars in costs in requiring the full range of low emissions technologies to be applied. As I have already mentioned, nuclear energy will be an important part of minimising or avoiding those costs.
Even with nuclear power and clean coal technology, under Labor’s scheme electricity prices are projected to double. I am sure the community would be very sensitive to that projected increase in energy prices, including the price of household electricity and the electricity used by industry and business. It would be an unsustainable increase in energy costs certainly in the short term, and even in the long term it would severely damage the competitiveness of Australian industry. We already know in our current circumstances that energy prices are going to rise, but the result of Labor’s policy, especially with their ratification of Kyoto and their refusal to consider the nuclear option, will be energy price increases, a detrimental impact on industry and, importantly, a detrimental impact on jobs. Australian people and Australian workers in particular are rightly concerned about their future employment prospects. They do not want jobs destroyed as a result of government policy.
We have no explanation from the Labor Party as to how they are going to achieve their promised 60 per cent cut in greenhouse emissions. They pretend they can wipe the slate clean and achieve these emissions without any pain but, as I have already said, it will in fact involve significant increases in energy prices, significant loss of industry competitiveness in this country and significant cuts in employment opportunities. We need some policy hard work to be done by Labor on this, which they have not done. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration and Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, on the issue of emissions trading in Australia. The answers given by the senator indicate just how out of touch this government is. I think the contribution that has been made by two of the senators from the other side makes that very clear to us on this side.
Another year and nothing has changed with this government. The Prime Minister and his key ministers remain sceptical about climate change and in the process are neglecting to take action. By the time they wake up and see the damage that has already been done it may well be too late. While the Howard government have in the past repeatedly ignored the warnings of scientists on climate change, they are now ignoring international business warnings on the effect climate change will have on our economy. The Global Roundtable on Climate Change has called on all governments to accept the science that climate change is real and set strong targets for greenhouse pollution reductions. This recommendation includes encouraging energy efficiency and carbon trading.
The global roundtable of business is not small fish in the business world. It includes companies like General Electric, Ford, Toyota and Wal-Mart. These companies, which are household names, have joined the growing list of those concerned that the cost of inaction on climate change will far outweigh the price of acting now. Australian businesses are already worse off as a result of the Howard government’s continued failure on climate change. Australia’s economy is on the line here. Australian jobs will be lost if action is not taken now.
Yet it still seems that the Howard government is oblivious to the effects of climate change. Despite delivering 11 federal budgets, the Treasurer has never mentioned climate change. That is 11 years in a row without a single mention of what could be the greatest challenge ever to face mankind—although, after comments Mr Costello recently made in the Age newspaper, it now appears that he is leading the Howard government in displaying at least some level of commonsense. He has said that he is now prepared to accept that the science is correct. He concedes that human activity is responsible for carbon emissions that are a direct factor in the changing environment. Even with this revelation, it appears that the difference of opinion within the government continues, with the Minister for Finance and Administration telling the media that he is still sceptical about climate change and opposed to emissions trading. For a minister in a key portfolio such as finance to openly display his cynicism is sure to have an effect on whether the Howard government makes any attempt to meet its responsibility to look at a carbon price.
While the Howard government continue their squabbling over climate change, debating no doubt whether the scientific proof fits with their agendas for Australia, business is suffering. Australian jobs are already being forced offshore—my home state knows that only too well with the recent closure of Blundstones—because businesses are functioning without access to the multibillion dollar carbon trading market, without access to new markets through the clean development mechanism and without the prospect of planning for a shift to a low carbon economy.
The Prime Minister has paraded his usual rhetoric on climate change and carbon trading. He says his government will not be panicked into making a decision that impacts on the economy. I do not think that taking action after 11 long years is showing any sign of panic. While the Prime Minister takes his time, the economy is already hurting and the Howard government will find that it is a long way behind public opinion and business on the issue of climate change. Australians know that climate change is an issue that must be tackled now, and a major step towards that is establishing an emissions trading scheme. With the current government unwilling to take the action so urgently required on climate change to ensure Australia’s future prosperity, Australians will also realise that the only way they will see the kind of action that is needed to tackle this issue is with a change of government to a Rudd-led Labor government.
But it is not only on the issue of carbon trading that the Howard government is failing Australians and the environment. In other corners of the globe governments are embracing the prospect of wind power, and in 2006 the industry experienced yet another record year, with expansion at 32 per cent. In Australia it is a different story, with $13 billion of stalled projects across the country. The Howard government’s refusal to commit to a carbon trading scheme is leaving our electricity producers unwilling to commit to clean coal technology or able to provide extra capacity for our major residential corridors along Australia’s coastline.

 ACT
 
 2600


Dear Minister


I refer to the Approved Code of Practice for Manual Handling (Maritime Industry) made under subsection 109(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993 that specifies a code of practice for manual handling activity in a maritime environment.


The Committee notes that section 2.28 of this Code requires records to be kept concerning the implementation of the National Standard for Manual Handling.

Dear Senator


Thank you for your letter of 19 October 2006 concerning provisions in the Code of Practice for Manual Handling (Maritime Industry) (the code). Specifically, you asked about requirements under section 2.28 of the code which relate to record keeping.


It is intended that the code‑including section 2.28‑should be read in conjunction with section 11 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. This provides that an operator has a duty of care to maintain appropriate information and records relating to their employees’ health and safety.


Section 2.28 envisages that appropriateness will vary according to the particular maritime activities engaged in and circumstances of the business concerned. It consequently does not specify either a form or a minimum timeframe for the keeping of these records. However, it should be noted that these records must be accessible to employees’ representatives on an ongoing basis to allow for their review and evaluation. I therefore do not consider it appropriate to prescribe this requirement in the code.


I trust this information addresses the issues raised in your letter.


Yours sincerely

Approved Form for Application for Initial Approval as a Rehabilitation Program Provider


Approved Form for Application for Renewal of Approval as a Rehabilitation Program Provider


Variation of Criteria for Approval or Renewal of Approval of Rehabilitation Program Providers

The Hon Kevin Andrews MP

Dear Minister


I refer to the following instruments made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.


Approved Form for Application for Initial Approval as a Rehabilitation Program Provider


Approved Form for Application for Renewal of Approval as a Rehabilitation Program Provider


Variation of Criteria for Approval or Renewal of Approval of Rehabilitation Program Providers


The Committee raises the following matters after considering each instrument.


First, each of these instruments requires an applicant to provide information about certain types of legal actions against the applicant, its principals or employees.
 
 In each case, the relevant clauses specify that civil actions (eg for negligence) older than six years from the date of application, or bankruptcy declarations older than seven years, need not be declared.
 
 By comparison, professional misconduct or criminal proceedings, and breaches of antidiscrimination or privacy legislation do not have any time limit specified.
 
 The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to why time limits are not specified for the latter types of action.


Secondly, section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business.
 
 Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate.
 
 The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken.
 
 The Explanatory Statements that accompany these instruments make no reference to consultation.
 
 The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.
 
 The Committee also seeks an assurance that future Explanatory Statements will provide information on consultation as required by the Legislative Instruments Act.


The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 24 November 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these instruments.
 
 Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator


Thank you for your letter of 9 November 2006 concerning matters raised by the Committee in regards to instruments made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.


The first issue raised concerns about why time limits were not being specified for certain types of legal actions against applicants, particularly those referring to professional misconduct or criminal proceedings, and breaches of antidiscrimination or privacy legislation. I am advised that statutory time limits are not required for these types of legal actions in their primary legislation. Any matters that might be raised under these criteria would allow Comcare to take these into consideration when assessing applicants against the criteria for their initial approval or renewal of approval (which occurs every three years).


The second issue concerned appropriate consultation not appearing in the explanatory statements. While Comcare is aware of its obligations, it was an oversight not to include such details in the explanatory statements, for which it apologises. Consultation via written correspondence was indeed undertaken with the approved rehabilitation providers, their association body ‑ the Australian Rehabilitation Provider Association ‑ and rehabilitation authorities in the Commonwealth over the course of July to October 2006.


Thank you for taking the time to write on these important matters.


Yours sincerely

Dear Treasurer


I refer to the Direction Relating to Foreign Currency Transactions and to North Korea made under regulation 5 of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959.
 
 This instrument prohibits foreign currency transactions involving certain entities and one individual associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
 


The Committee notes that the prohibition applies, amongst other things, to any transaction that relates to property, securities or funds owned or controlled indirectly by those entities or that individual, and to any transaction that relates to payments indirectly to or for the benefit of those listed persons.
 
 It is possible that a person might engage in such a transaction without knowing of the indirect relationship with one of the listed persons.
 
 The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether this Direction is intended to apply in such a circumstance.


The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 17 November 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Direction.
 
 Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Thank you for your letter of 12 October 2006 to the Treasurer relating to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances’ consideration of the Direction Relating to Foreign Currency Transactions and to North Korea under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959 (the Direction). In particular, you sought advice about whether the Direction is intended to apply in circumstances where a person engages in a transaction with a party who, unknowingly to them, is indirectly related to those listed in the Direction.


The intention of the Direction is to capture and prohibit all foreign currency transactions involving the transfer of funds or payments to, by the order of, or on behalf of entities or individuals listed under the Direction without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). It is expected that any person dealing in foreign currency would take all reasonable steps to identify the parties with whom they are dealing and be aware of the Direction.


However, offences under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959 are subject to the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 (Criminal Code) and are not ones of strict liability. As such, the effect of the Criminal Code is that a person must have known or recklessly disregarded the identity of the person taking the benefit of the dealing in order for an offence to occur.


Information regarding the financial sanctions is distributed widely with the RBA lodging the legislative instruments, each with the list of sanctions-designated individuals or entities attached, with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and arranging for their inclusion in the Australian Government Gazette.


Following this, the RBA notifies the financial sector regulators, including the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and the Australian Securities Exchange, in writing of the financial sanctions. These institutions alert their stakeholders, which include banks, building societies and credit unions and foreign exchange dealers, to the restrictions so that monitoring can occur.


The RBA also issues a media release advising of the implementation of financial sanctions, which includes the list of individuals or entities with which dealings are prohibited.


I trust this information will be of assistance to you.


Yours sincerely

Prescribed Courses for Applicants for Registration as a Migration Agent

CANBERRA

Dear Parliamentary Secretary


I refer to the Prescribed Courses for Applicants for Registration as a Migration Agent made under paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Migration Agents Regulations 1998.
 
 The Committee notes that this instrument, commencing on 1 October 2006, provides that a prescribed course of study is either a Graduate Certificate course at certain higher education institutions or a formal course of study or self-directed study completed before 15 July 2006.
 


According to the Explanatory Statement the effect of the instrument is that persons who have not completed a formal course of study or self-directed study before 15 July 2006 must complete the Graduate Certificate course in order to become registered migration agents.
 
 This appears to operate to the disadvantage of persons who have completed a formal course of study or self-directed study between 15 July and 30 September 2006, by compelling them to complete the Graduate Certificate course.
 
 It is not clear if this is the intention of the instrument.
 
 If so, the Committee would appreciate an explanation as to why persons who are affected in this way should be compelled to complete the additional course of study.


The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 24 November 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument.
 
 Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Thank you for your letter of 9 November 2006 concerning the Explanatory Statement for the Prescribed Courses for Applicants for Registration as a Migration Agent and your concern that it may disadvantage persons completing a formal course of study between 15 July and 30 September 2006.


On 4 May 2006 the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) announced that the Migration Advice Professional Knowledge Entrance Examination (MAPKEE) would be replaced with the Graduate Certificate in Australian Migration Law and Practice. The final MAPKEE was held in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and London on 15 July 2006. As preparation for the MAPKEE, applicants undertook either formal or self directed study. Delivery of the new Graduate Certificate, both face-to-face and online, commenced at the Australian National University, Griffith University, Murdoch University and Victoria University in July this year.


As the final MAPKEE was held on 15 July 2006, no individuals should be disadvantaged by the new Instrument. This is because individuals would have undertaken the MAPKEE on or prior to the 15 July 2006, or enrolled for the new Graduate Certificate. Upon completion of the new prescribed course and examination, intending agents have 12 months to apply to register with the MARA.


Please note that whilst persons who hold current legal practising certificates are not required to undertake the Graduate Certificate, they are required to satisfy yearly Continuing Professional Development to maintain their registration.


I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention.


Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Watson


You have requested advice on the reason for the delay in registration of the following instruments, and assurance that no person, other than the Commonwealth, has been disadvantaged as a result of that delay. These instruments were both made on 22 December 2005, and registered on 13 October 2006.

Social Security (Asset‑test Exempt Income Stream (Market‑linked) ‑ Payment Factors) (FACS) Principles 2005
Social Security (Partially Asset‑test Exempt Income Stream ‑ Exemption) (FACS) Principles 2005

The effect of these instruments is to allow:

the continuation of a 100 per cent exemption from the assets test where a lifetime or life expectancy income stream is created on or after 20 September 2004 from the commutation and rollover of an asset test exempt lifetime or life expectancy income stream purchased before that date;
the use of payment factors to determine the total amount of the payments to be made under a market-linked income stream for a financial year.

My department delayed registration of the instruments, to explore with other departments responsible for social security legislation, a consistent approach to changing the legislation. However, following discussions with those departments, it was decided to register the instruments without further delay to allow customers to take advantage of the beneficial effect of the instruments.


While my department cannot rule out the possibility, I am advised that it is not aware of any people who have been disadvantaged by the delay in registering the instruments.

Dear Minister


Thank you for your letter of 30 November 2006 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the delay in registering two Social Security Principles made in 2005 that provided for exemptions and payment factors for the asset-test exempt income stream.


The Committee notes that the reason for the delay was the desire to ensure that a consistent approach to changing the legislation was adopted with other departments responsible for social security legislation.
 
 We appreciate that consistency across legislation is important when legislation is managed across a number of agencies.
 
 However, we are still concerned about the possible impact of the delay on any individuals affected by this legislation.


In your response you advise that the department is ‘not aware’ of any people who have been disadvantaged by this delay.
 
 From your advice it is not clear what steps have been taken to ascertain whether disadvantage has occurred.
 
 While appreciating that the number of people involved might make it a difficult task, it would be helpful to know how the department determined its awareness.
 
 Also, given the acknowledgment that it may be a possibility, we would appreciate your advice about how the department proposes to deal with any instances of disadvantage that do come to light.


In the meantime, we have given a notice of motion to disallow these Principles to allow time to further consider the delay in registering these instruments.


The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 2 February 2007, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Principles.
 
 Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Thank you for your letter of 7 December 2006 requesting further details regarding the delay in registration of the following instruments:

Social Security (Asset‑test Exempt Income Stream (Market‑linked) ‑ Payment Factors) (FACS) Principles 2005
Social Security (Partially Asset‑test Exempt Income Stream ‑ Exemption) (FACS) Principles 2005

Officers in my department are in regular contact with Centrelink regarding the administration of the income streams rules and have made specific inquiries in regard to whether any customers have been disadvantaged by the delay in implementing these Principles. To date, we have received no notification that any customers have been disadvantaged by this delay. If my officers did become aware of any particular case where there was potential disadvantage to a customer, we would make every attempt to investigate whether the customer’s situation can be addressed.


I would note that, in particular, the first of the above Principles is beneficial to customers as it stipulates that, under certain conditions, where asset-test exempt (ATE) income streams were purchased before 20 September 2004 and then rolled over to purchase a new non-commutable lifetime or life expectancy income stream, the new income stream should retain the 100 per cent exemption from the assets test that was accorded the original income stream. Accordingly, any disallowance of the instruments could potentially disadvantage those customers who have purchased a new income stream from the proceeds of a previously commuted ATE income stream, and who would otherwise qualify for retention of the 100 per cent assets test exemption.


Yours sincerely

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I seek leave to slightly modify the terms of the matter of urgency motion in accordance with changes I have given to the various whips.
Leave granted.
—I move the motion as amended:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian government to unequivocally guarantee that the latest group of boat people, reportedly including 83 asylum seekers from Sri Lanka, will immediately have access to independent assistance, have their refugee claims assessed openly and fairly and will not be subjected to the risk of refoulment, consistent with our international obligations.
The changes clarify and slightly refine the motion put forward but do not change its substance. This is an urgent matter not just for the asylum seekers who are directly affected; it is also because it is crucial we get this right and send the right signals about what we are doing. The last thing Australia needs is a re-run of the pre-election poison that we had in 2001 regarding the treatment of asylum seekers. This should actually be unremarkable. I hope that the government speakers will indicate their support for it because it is to ensure that these asylum seekers immediately have access to independent assistance, have their refugee claims assessed openly and fairly and not be subjected to the risk of refoulement—that is, being sent back to face potential persecution. It should not be necessary to put this forward, but we have seen in the last week, since the boat of asylum seekers was first detected, a lot of very strong reminders of the 2001 approach of this government.
There has been a lot of talk in the last year or two about a culture change. Indeed a lot of money—millions of dollars—has been put in by this government to effect a culture change in the department of immigration. As I and the Democrats said repeatedly at the time, unless you change the law and the policy of this government, with all of the other things, you are not going to have a genuine culture change. I fear we are witnessing that being demonstrated at the moment, and that will make all of those millions of dollars for the so-called culture change of the immigration department a waste of money.
We are seeing, once again, the government restricting access to information and preventing easy access to the asylum seekers for those who would provide them with advice. We are seeing a dribble of propaganda from the minister and, even more extraordinarily—and which goes further than even what we saw in 2001—we are seeing immediate consultation with other governments and commentary from ambassadors from Sri Lanka, the country that the majority of the asylum seekers are said to have fled from. They are involved, in the loop in some way, with what happens to these people. That is even further down the wrong path than what happened in 2001. Of course, these people’s claims need to be assessed before we can say whether or not they have valid claims of persecution, but there should be no doubt at all that it is a reasonable prospect that these are genuine claims, given that they are reportedly from Sri Lanka and given that quite a number of them are reportedly Tamils.
I draw the Senate’s attention to the position of the UNHCR—that is, the United Nations refugee agency—on the international protection needs of asylum seekers from Sri Lanka which was issued just in December last year. I remind people that this is a country in serious civil war; the ceasefire has broken down. Just last year there were 17 national staff members of the French humanitarian aid organisation, Action contre la Faim, killed in their office. The assessment of the UNHCR, particularly with regard to Tamils from the north and east, where some of these people are reportedly from, is that Tamils in and from these regions are at risk of targeted violations of their human rights from all parties to the armed conflict—from government forces, the Tamil Tigers and paramilitary or armed groups. They can be attacked for being seen to support the government and they can be attacked for being seen to not support the government. It has been shown there is nowhere for them to hide safely anywhere within the country. The UNHCR specifically says:
All asylum claims of Tamils from the North or East should be favourably considered.
It says that even where the individual does not fulfil the precise refugee criteria under the 1951 convention a complementary form of protection should be granted in the light of the prevailing situation. It goes on to say:
No Tamil from the North or East should be returned forcibly until there is significant improvement in the security situation in Sri Lanka.
That should be the starting point for our government when looking at the situation. They should not immediately be floating talks about sending them across to Indonesia, which is not a signatory to the UN convention. Asylum seekers who were sent to Indonesia five years ago by this government are still there today, languishing in limbo in places like Lombok and Jakarta, being paid for by the Australian taxpayer. That is a breach of our international obligations. We have our government again talking about doing the same thing to people from a country where we know, from the latest evidence from the UNHCR, they are at serious risk. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled. This an urgent problem. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-02-26,"—Any suggestion that Australia would agree to an arrangement which would see refugees returned to a country where they face persecution is wrong. Citizens of other countries who are persecuted by their governments should, in an ideal world, always find safe haven. This country has a very proud record of that, particularly since the Second World War. After revolution in places like Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and after the Indochina war, this country took many refugees—I might add, despite Mr Whitlam’s objection to taking Vietnamese refugees. Under Mr Fraser, this country did take them, and it was one of the best things we have ever done as a community.
At present throughout the world there are millions of people who are homeless and many millions of people dislocated by war. There are refugees on nearly every continent. I remember back in the early nineties when I was working with the United Nations on the Thai-Cambodia border I spend much time among them. Many of those refugees wanted to live in Australia—and, indeed, many do.
In this country we take about 13,000 refugees each year from all around the world, and that makes us perhaps one of the most generous receivers of refugees in the world on a per capita basis—about second behind Canada, I think. My friend Senator Bartlett mentioned Nauru and offshore processing. There might be some objection taken about the time it took to process some of those people, but in the end everyone’s applications were processed—the vast majority successfully—and they were dealt with fairly. There has been no objection about the process undertaken in Nauru. But there is a problem when people arrive by boat. Why? Because a business has been spawned: people-smuggling. It is a business that imperils desperate people on the open sea and lines the pockets of money-hungry people smugglers. People smugglers prey on the poor and the very desperate. They have done it for years and continue to do it. This government is committed to maintaining a strong and determined focus on protecting our borders and ensuring that Immigration, Customs, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian armed forces combine to do just that.
I think it would be useful to go back in history and look at how many individuals arrived by boat in the years prior to Australia’s tough border security policies, in particular on offshore processing. How many people fell prey to people smugglers before the new arrangements—in particular on offshore processing—came into force? It is good to report to the Senate that there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of unauthorised boat arrivals. The people-smuggling business has fallen on very hard times since the Howard government adopted tough policies against unauthorised immigration. The figures speak for themselves. In 1999 there were 3,722 unauthorised arrivals by boat in Australia; in 2000 there were 2,939; and in 2001 there were 3,751. In this regard 2001 is an important year because that is the date at which the Howard government’s offshore processing policy came into force.
What were the effects of these measures? What sort of impact did these policies have on this particular dark form of human trafficking? Until this time, each year there were on average 3,000 to 3,500 people arriving on our doorstep. I remember the debate in the party room, in the parliament and in the public. It was all about how terrible the offshore processing would be—that it would undermine our obligations under refugee conventions and that it would undermine our human rights obligations. There was enormous discontent throughout the community. But what has happened? In 2002—and that was the first calendar year after the Howard government’s measures went into effect—the number of unauthorised arrivals by boat in Australia fell to zero—yes, zero. So we had, on average, over 3,000 in the previous three years—in total about 10,000 unauthorised arrivals. In 2002, the year after the new policy came into effect, there were zero. So no people struggling across the ocean were taken advantage of by people smugglers—no people putting themselves and their families at risk; no people falling prey to people smugglers—unlike the three previous years when 10,000 people did so. In 2002 there were zero. Is that because desperation throughout the world was somehow eclipsed? No. It was simply because this government put on record the fact that it would not allow people smugglers to succeed. It has been one of the most successful border protection policies of this government. It has been a marvellous achievement.
I must say, though, we do not get much credit for it—for the lives that the government saved by people not putting themselves at risk across the open seas; for saving the poor and the desperate from the clutches of people smugglers. We did not receive any gifts from the opposition, the Greens or the Democrats for that. No—we were seen as heartless. And yet, when that policy came in, there were no people placing themselves or their families at risk from people smugglers—not one in 2002. Those lower numbers mean lives were saved, because the people-smuggling criminals care not a whit about the wellbeing of their cargo. Anything that might encourage this form of human trafficking would constitute a subversion of our policy’s purposes and a perversion of its moral intent
 Anyone who is the subject of persecution by their government deserves the protection of other countries. It has been a very proud record of the coalition—and, indeed, in many cases, the Australian Labor Party—of protecting those people. I cannot help but think that this country has done so much to protect refugees throughout the world since World War II. As we speak, people are being processed in refugee camps throughout the world and they will be resettled here in Australia. We do not do it because it necessarily serves our national interest in the immediate sense. We do it because it serves humanity’s interest, and it does. That is why we do it. In conclusion, the people smugglers who exploit the hopes and dreams of impoverished people are criminals, pure and simple. It is Australia’s humanitarian responsibility to do what it can to stamp out that trade, and we should do it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—Maybe Senator Mason believes in the speech he just gave, and it may be relevant at some time. Unfortunately, it is not relevant to the urgency motion that is before us today. That urgency motion, provided for under standing order 75, contains three major points:
The need for the Australian government to unequivocally guarantee that the latest group of boat people, reportedly including 83 asylum seekers from Sri Lanka, will immediately have access to independent assistance, have their refugee claims assessed openly and fairly and will not be subjected to the risk of refoulement, consistent with our international obligations.
That is what the debate in the chamber is about. What Senator Mason went to—and I took very careful note of what he said—consisted of reliance on the government’s record. That might be something that Senator Mason wants to trumpet, but the Labor Party does not, because that record harks back to ‘kids overboard’ and the deceit surrounding that. As far as I can see, to date this government has only put out one press statement dealing with this issue, titled ‘Group transferred to Christmas Island’ and released on 24 February 2007.
Senator Mason did not go to that in any detail other than to make the sweeping statement in his opening remarks that he agreed that people should not face persecution and that it is wrong to return people to countries where they would. I agree with that: it is wrong. Then Senator Mason went on to a range of other matters which are not related to the motion although worthy in other debates. It is true that many refugees have settled in Australia and that Australia openly embraces them. The Labor Party agrees with all of those sentiments. It does not agree with offshore processing—that is clear.
There is a problem, though, with Senator Mason’s speech in that he did not go to the issue at hand—I will point out why. Although this motion relates specifically to the group of Sri Lankan asylum seekers that are now on Christmas Island, in the absence of the full details of their circumstances this debate really goes to the principles of how we process claims for asylum. Labor has sought a briefing from the government on the specific circumstances of this group of asylum seekers which will take place later this afternoon. But the Howard government have form in this area. Their form is deception and misinformation. Earlier I mentioned the ‘children overboard’ affair, where the then Minister for Defence produced photographs in the middle of an election campaign, stating that they depicted children who had been thrown into the water by their parents. So, when we examine the issues, we must constantly remind ourselves of just how little credibility the public statements by the government have—that everything they say must be taken with a grain of salt and viewed through that prism.
Labor’s principles in this debate are clear: Labor want to see people smugglers prosecuted to the full extent of the law. So, to the extent that Senator Mason diverged into the area, we agree. We do not want them to be given a second shot at smuggling people into this country and we do not want to see refugees returned to a country where they face persecution. We agree on that. Most of what we now know about this matter, though, comes from reports in the media. I was hoping Senator Mason might have been able to contribute on some of the issues actually relevant to the debate. But the government has not, and perhaps the government’s second or third speaker in this debate might be able to contribute some factual details of the circumstances, or at least provide a little more than the minister has to date.
As I said, the minister has made some public statements on the issue; they are far from complete, and his last formal statement was the press release of two days ago that I mentioned earlier. This is what he has told us: 85 people were intercepted by HMAS Success on 21 February, 83 claiming to be Sri Lankan and two claiming to be Indonesian. We know that the group has been moved to Christmas Island for health checks and information gathering. We know that the government is considering a range of options for the handling of this group. But there remains plenty that we do not know. Hopefully, the remaining government speakers will not do what Senator Mason did but will in fact provide some of the answers. We cannot know what options the government is considering. We can only speculate about what the claims of these asylum seekers actually are. So it would be helpful if the government could provide information on the options it is considering and the claims of the group.
At present there do remain conflicting accounts about the details and circumstances surrounding this group of asylum seekers, and Labor wants the government to clear the air. You have the opportunity to provide some of those answers today. You can lay all the facts of these issues on the table here and in this afternoon’s briefing. Labor will be seeking a complete chronology of the events, such as the interdiction, the origin of the ship, the current circumstances on the processing and the current state of negotiations. The government must fill in the blanks on those questions as well as the many others that surround this group of asylum seekers.
Let me reinforce the principles which underpin Labor’s approach. We do not want to give people smugglers a second shot. Labor want to see people smugglers prosecuted to the full extent of law. The government must make sure that its policy does not see people smugglers set free to breach our borders again. At the same time, we must make sure that we meet all of our international commitments in this area. In particular, Labor do not want to see refugees returned to countries where they face persecution. Labor want to see effective international cooperation to fight people-smuggling and strong penalties for criminals who engage in this despicable action.
It can only be Mr Kevin Andrews and Mr Downer who would allow the debate to date to continue without the full facts. There is an onus on the government to provide the circumstances that surround this issue, because otherwise you end up with various reports in various papers about what the circumstances are, which does not help the debate here. It certainly does not help the people who are being processed, and it does not help this government’s prosecution of the issue.
It has been reported that Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Indonesia said Australian and Indonesian officials had told him the asylum seekers would be sent to Jakarta and then returned home. He expected the men to arrive in Sri Lanka within days. Australia and Indonesia had said they would help with the repatriation, he said. In their statement, of course, Mr Andrews and Mr Downer said the government would not allow the refugees to be returned to a country where they faced persecution. It went on to say that, while the government is considering its options, clearly no action would be taken which would breach our international obligations.
But this type of speculation continues. It is not the media that are speculating; it is Mr Downer and Mr Andrews who are allowing the speculation to continue. They can bring it to a conclusion quite easily and provide the information as to what the circumstances are. Therefore, we can have a situation where we get proper and appropriate media comment and reporting of the issue. Instead, to date, we have heard from the government a potted history and a slightly one-sided view of the history of people-smuggling, and offshore processing more particularly. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-02-26,"—The Greens support this motion. I express at the outset the enormous anxiety that I have for the 85 people who are now on Christmas Island, and in particular the 83 Sri Lankans. In the three minutes I have, let me refer to the recommendations on this matter in the briefing document of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees:
... UNHCR recommends that all asylum claims of individuals from Sri Lanka be examined carefully under fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures.
…            …            …
All asylum claims of Tamils from the North or East should be favourably considered. In relation to those individuals who are found to be targeted by the State, LTTE—
that is, the Tamil forces—
or other non-state agents, they should be recognized as refugees under the criteria of the 1951 Convention, unless the individual comes within the exclusion criteria of the 1951 Convention.
The following is addressed to states, not parties, to the 1951 convention—that is, Indonesia and Nauru:
Where states are not parties to the 1951 Convention and do not have refugee status determination systems, individuals originating from Sri Lanka and who are in need of international protection, as indicated above, either because of a wellfounded fear of persecution in the meaning of Article I(A)2 of the 1951 Convention, or because of a situation of generalized violence with no internal flight alternative, should be protected against forcible return, and be permitted lawful stay as well as possibilities to exercise their basic rights under relevant national laws until the situation in Sri Lanka improves substantially.
How, in the face of that, could we be arranging with the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Indonesia—and I draw the government’s attention to questions I have put on notice about that particular ambassador and his background—for the potentially illegal repatriation of these asylum seekers? It would be an outrageous thing for the government to do. They should be brought within Australia’s immigration laws and given the rights that are available under those immigration laws. Otherwise this country will not only be breaking international law; it will be turning its back on the very basis of United Nations protection for refugees fleeing violent and potentially deadly situations. Are we going to feed these people back into a situation where disappearances and 4,000 deaths have occurred in the last year in a very violent and bloody conflict? (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2007-02-26,"—It is always very difficult when we have situations such as this, where we have these men attempting to get through to Christmas Island. I am sure that many Australians feel very concerned to know that somebody from another country is in such difficulty that they are trying to find a way forward. This happens not only in difficulty; sometimes it is just because they feel the need to change their geographic location. There are many reasons why this nation has to deal with people who are attempting to arrive illegally by boat.
I refer to one of the previous speakers. I think it was quite right for Senator Mason to outline the government approach to these issues, because it is very important that we take into account and understand why the government approaches these situations as it does. In spite of the fact that Senator Ludwig was at pains to point out that Senator Mason had not directly addressed the question, I think we must look at the overall parameters and the overall environment through which the government approaches these situations.
Those 85 men on board that ship need to be dealt with in the manner that this country sees fit so we ensure the integrity of our borders. I do not think there is anyone around this country who would not want us to find the right balance between doing the right thing by those people on that boat and doing the right thing by the people of this nation. There is an expectation of this government to protect this nation, to ensure this nation is safe and secure and to ensure the integrity of our borders. It is important that we do that. That is our role. As a government, it is our role to ensure the integrity of our borders.
I think it was quite right of Senator Mason to point out the number of arrivals prior to 2001. Not only do I think it was right; it is important to look at that again: almost 10,000 people came to this country by boat in that three-year period from 1999 to 2001, and after the government’s offshore processing laws were in place, as Senator Mason said, that number dropped to zero. That absolute fact supports that what the government are doing is right. We have a humanitarian basis on which to deal with those people who try to get to this country by boat—that they will not be at the mercy of people smugglers. It was the right thing to do. It was the right decision to take. It has given us the right environment in this country to ensure we have that right balance between looking after people who are in genuine need—and this government will never back away from that; we will always assume the responsibility of looking after people in genuine need, and it is very important that we do that—and, by the same token, ensuring the integrity of our borders.
If we look at Labor and what they plan to do, we find their message to the rest of the world would be that Australia’s borders are open, and that we will go back to those days of having 3,792 people in one year, 2,939 the next and 3,751 the next. I do not want to go back to that and I do not think that the majority of Australians do either. We have got it right. We have got the right policies in place, and we can see that we have because they work. While we all feel for those people who believe they need to leave another country for whatever reason—and, as I say, this government will always look after those genuinely in need—this government has a responsibility to the people of this nation to make sure we do not place them at risk. We have to make sure there is a process in place, the right process, to ensure that the people in genuine need are looked after and those who are not have an alternative.
What would we be saying to people smugglers if we went back to the days before 2001 when we did not have the current arrangements in place? We would be saying: ‘It’s open slather. Come on in. Let’s have everybody back. Let’s have thousands of people coming through the doors because that’s okay.’ That is what Labor want to do. They want to open up our borders again. They are not concerned about the integrity we have in place now. That is what we would go back to. I do not believe that is the right thing to do. I do not believe the majority of Australians think that is the right thing to do. We have got the right process in place and we have to ensure that genuine refugees will be looked after.
For these 85 men who have, through whatever circumstances, taken the decision to try and arrive by boat, a range of options will be looked at. While we are hearing from the other side, ‘We want to know now,’ this happened a few days ago and the government are right to take the time to look at the range of options for these people. We would be irresponsible if we did not do that. We are not standing up here in this place saying to Labor: ‘Yes, of course we will answer your questions straightaway. Absolutely. Here’s all the information. This is what we’re doing.’ That would be irresponsible. The responsible thing for this government to do is to ensure that we look at all the options and that we get the right outcome. It is about a balance, as I said earlier. It is about helping those genuinely in need. We will never back away from that. That is what our policy entails and that is what it takes into account. But it also has to be balanced against what is the best thing for this nation. What is in the national interest? What is the right thing to do? The government will consider the range of options that we need to look at. We will do that thoroughly and exhaustively. We will not be pushed by the other side to run to their agenda and their timetable. We will do the right thing by these men to ensure that they get the best possible outcome.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise this afternoon to provide a contribution to this debate on the motion that has been moved by Senator Bartlett. I understand that Senator Ludwig, who is our spokesperson on immigration matters in this chamber, very clearly said that the Labor Party have sought a briefing this afternoon on this from the government. While Senator Nash suggests that we have demanded answers to questions and postulates that we want to know now, I heard Senator Ludwig less than half an hour ago very clearly put on the record that the Labor Party have been cautious about this and have waited for an opportunity to get a briefing—which is probably occurring as this debate is happening. We have not in fact rushed to press the government into any statements. In fact, I had Mr Tony Burke in Darwin over the weekend and he was quite careful to not make public statements about this. He wanted to be quite assured that the information we were getting was accurate. He did not push to make public statements that were uninformed or ill informed. I think to portray the Labor Party’s position in any other way is disingenuous here this afternoon.
In talking about the issue of refugees and asylum seekers in this country under the Howard government, we would portray it as being under a cloud of deception and misinformation. That is one thing that has been proven—and is in the history books of this country—no more so than by the events of 2001. We all remember the infamous ‘children overboard’ affair when the defence minister at that time produced photographs in the middle of a federal election campaign and, backed by the Prime Minister, wildly claimed that children had been thrown overboard. It being a couple of days before the election, there was not a lot of time to get to the truth of the matter. But from a Senate inquiry, an honest, open inquiry which kept the government accountable—which we can no longer do anymore, but this was back in those days when the Senate was actually able to have inquiries that called this government to account—we did actually find that it was a campaign meant to deceive the Australian public. At the end of the day that inquiry proved that children were not thrown overboard—that in fact that boat was sinking and people were getting into the water to save lives: those of adults and kids.
We know that this government has a reputation for providing the general public with misinformation about what happens in the Immigration portfolio. In recent months we have seen the previous minister for immigration demoted because of the handling of a whole range of cases, such as that of Vivian Alvarez Solon. For myself, I chaired a Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee inquiry into the operation of the Migration Act which uncovered many irregularities. We had the Ombudsman’s report that showed us that things were not up to scratch in the immigration department and that the general public of this country ought to be asking some questions about how we treat not only people who are genuinely seeking to migrate but also refugees in particular.
Senator Nash and other previous speakers have talked about the thousands of people who have travelled here by boat. I also want to place on record that we now know, many years later, that quite a large percentage of them have been found to be genuine refugees, so their claim for refugee status was genuine and honest. In the last couple of days we have seen another group of people arrive by boat, some of whom claim to have come from Sri Lanka and a couple of whom claim to have come from Indonesia. This latest incident raises very important questions. What is this government doing to actually stop the people smugglers who make money out of moving these people from one place to another to the extent that we have seen in the last 24 hours? How effective is any agreement that this government has got with Indonesia? How effective is any operation that is in place to ensure that this does not happen when in fact it is still happening? You would have to assume that it is not as effective as this government would like it to be.
Our position is that the people who make money in this way—out of moving, from one country to another, refugees or people who claim to be refugees—ought to be prosecuted and feel the full extent of the law. They are trading in human suffering, something we do not think is acceptable. Not only that but we do not believe they should be allowed to do it a second time around. If what I read in the papers today is correct—that these people actually flew from Sri Lanka to Indonesia and were there for many months before getting aboard a boat—what are we doing with the Indonesian government to assure ourselves that that boat never leaves the land of Indonesia again and never again travels across the sea to get here? You have to ask yourself: if this is happening again, how successful has the policy been in the past and how effective are our strategies to supposedly ensure that this does not happen and, also, how effective is our cooperation in the international sphere?
Another thing that I think we need to be mindful of is this—and, while we make no comment in this chamber about whether or not people are genuine refugees, we do know this: before that assessment has been made and even after it has been made we need to satisfy ourselves as a country that we do not return people to a place where they believe they will face persecution. We are a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. I might add that Indonesia is not, so that poses a severe, real problem for us as to the way in which we should approach refugees and handle refugees on the international scene, as opposed to the way that Indonesia does. We have signed on the dotted line a document that says we respect the rights of people who are genuine refugees, that we will take them into this country and that, for those who have not been proven to be, we will ensure that we will have a return-to-country assessment.
Our analysis of the Migration Act showed very clearly that this is an area in which the department of immigration needs to improve and that this is an area in which there need to be much more comprehensive checks and balances. We do not want to see refugees returned to a country where they may face damage to their lives. When you hear reports of people having been returned to countries and having been killed, imprisoned or persecuted, you understand that the stakes are extremely high. We have signed a United Nations convention that says that we will take that situation very seriously and that we will do our utmost to ensure that any outcomes for refugees are not frightening, that people are in fact safe, that if are they returned to a country they will not be persecuted. If we get it wrong, people are at risk of losing their lives.
I think the message in this debate is the following until we have further information about this group of people, these 85 men, that we are listening to and dealing with: the smugglers need to be dealt with; they need to face the full force of the law; and we need to ensure that any agreement we have with Indonesia is working, as it would seem that somehow there are boats still slipping through the net. We need to ensure that refugees are not returned to a country in which they feel they will be persecuted, for whatever reason. We need to make sure that our assessment of that is thorough and comprehensive. At the end of the day, we are responsible for people’s lives. We have signed up to an international convention that says we will be mindful of that and we will do all that we can to ensure these people remain safe and remain alive. So we need to ensure that refugees are not returned to a country where they face persecution, where their lives are put at risk. If these people turn out not to be genuine refugees then we need to ensure that we are not sending them back to a place where they may well be harmed or imprisoned or where their lives will be put at risk.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-02-26,"—You would not know it from the contributions from those opposite, but Australia actually has a very proud reputation for and a proud history of accepting refugees from around the world. We are among the most generous and compassionate nations on earth. In 2005-06 our humanitarian intake was 14,000. This is one of the most generous intakes in the world on a per capita basis. But, even if you put per capita measures aside, Australia is one of the top three nations in absolute terms in relation to its humanitarian intake. We are up there with the US and Canada—nations which are much larger than us. We are one of the top three nations in the world in absolute terms in humanitarian intake.
We are generous, and this is as it should be. We are a prosperous nation; we are a free nation; we should be generous. We have the capacity to take refugees. We also have a moral obligation to do so. And an orderly, fair, equitable and thorough process for assessing claims for asylum, for determining status, is not inconsistent with compassion. In fact, an orderly assessment process is an expression of that compassion.
There are thousands—tens of thousands—of people around the world who would like to move to Australia. For some it is because of a desire for a better economic environment. For others, it is because they are in genuine fear of persecution in their home countries. For others, it is a combination of these reasons. None of these are invalid or wrong or inappropriate reasons to want to seek to come to Australia. We can hardly denounce anyone for wanting to move to what we all believe is the greatest country on earth. We all find it entirely understandable that people want to come to Australia. But to give advantage to those who have the means or the opportunity to gain access to the Australian migration zone is perverse. To give a particular advantage to those who arrive in an unauthorised fashion is to be unfair to those around the world in refugee camps or who apply through Australia’s posts and missions. To give earlier access to immigration processes to those who arrive illegally is actually to demonstrate a lack of compassion for those who apply in more regular ways. To give earlier access to immigration processes to those who arrive illegally is to reward and encourage people smugglers and to put the lives of people at risk.
At this stage, the identities and nationalities of the 85 men intercepted on 20 February have not been positively determined. Eighty-three have apparently identified themselves as Sri Lankan nationals and two as Indonesian nationals. What we have been told is that the boat was first detected by an Orion P3 aircraft on 19 February. The vessel was intercepted, we are told, by HMAS Success on 20 February and at that stage the vessel was not operating. The crew from the Success went onto the vessel and repaired the engine, and after this the vessel moved off but then stopped moving again. Crew from Success again boarded the vessel and observed that further damage had been done to the engine and to the hull. The full circumstances are yet to be determined, but I would just observe that the vessel was not engaged in a commercial activity. Damage was done to the engine and the hull of the vessel, which is a curious thing to do, whether you are a passenger or a member of the crew. It will be interesting to ascertain the full elements of the journey.
The Age quotes Sri Lankan community sources as saying the Sri Lankans flew from Sri Lanka to Indonesia. We have heard mention of Vietnamese boat people. I stand to be corrected, but I do not recall the people fleeing Vietnam jumping on a plane, flying somewhere else to another country then getting on a boat and coming to Australia. They came direct. These people in question here today, according to media speculation, flew to Indonesia. If these people in question did fly, it indicates that Australia was not their first available overseas safe haven.
Australia does have international obligations, which it meets, and a duty of care to people in distress. But it also has a moral obligation to ensure that people are not advantaged who seek to enter Australia in an unauthorised manner. The government is meeting and will meet its obligations in relation to these people. The group of 85 people will be accommodated temporarily on Christmas Island, where health checks will be done and information gathered. We will honour our international obligations and there is absolutely no suggestion on the part of the government that these people, if they are indeed found to be refugees, will be returned to an environment where they could be in danger. That is not something that the Australian government has countenanced or would do.
There is one thing we know: although, at the time of the 2001 election, Labor said there was not a cigarette paper’s difference between their policy on border protection and our own, Labor now have an entirely different policy, and we know that if Labor were in office they would give the green light to people smugglers. We do operate a very compassionate and fair immigration system.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to speak in favour of the motion put by Senator Bartlett. We are all aware that the motion has arisen out of the recent circumstances of the 85 Sri Lankan asylum seekers who arrived just off Christmas Island, I think on Saturday. I understand that 83 of them are Sri Lankan asylum seekers and that there are two who are believed to be Indonesian nationals. The difficulty we have here today is that we do not have full details of the circumstances of these individuals. I understand that we, the Labor opposition, have sought a briefing from the government on the specific circumstances of this group of asylum seekers and that this is going to take place later this afternoon; but, as it stands, there is an absence of information that would enable us to fully get our heads around what has occurred. For my part, I am relying on media reports that I have gathered on this matter over the last few days, and it is on that basis that I address my remarks to the chamber today, but it is important to realise that until we are made fully aware of the circumstances—exactly who these people are, where they are from and their individual circumstances—the extent of our knowledge of these individuals is that all of them are adult men.
We are pretty much relying on what has been made available by the government and put into the public domain. When this happens it makes many of us, including me, somewhat nervous because we know that this government has what can only be described as ‘form’ in this area. When the issues of refugees and asylum seekers have been publicly debated, more often than not we have seen nothing from the government but deception and misinformation. It is for this reason that I am hesitant to make remarks until we are made fully aware of the facts—and often the facts are very difficult to garner when we are talking about asylum seeker matters vis-a-vis the Howard government.
All of us would remember the shameful ‘children overboard’ affair when the then Minister for Defence produced photographs in the middle of an election campaign and stated that they depicted children who had been thrown into the water by their parents. At the time many people believed that had occurred, but it was subsequently shown, as a consequence of the long and comprehensive Senate inquiry into the matter, not to have happened. So you can see why one is always somewhat suspicious of information that comes from the Howard government when the subject matter is asylum seekers and refugees. We have to examine these issues as they arise and remind ourselves that there is often little credibility in the public statements that flow from this government in relation to these matters. It is probably best to err on the side of caution and take what is said with a grain of salt rather than relying on the statements that are made.
There are some matters that Labor is very clear on when it comes to asylum seekers, and particularly those who have been trafficked by people smugglers. Labor, contrary to what Senator Fifield said, is adamant that people smugglers be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Those people who take advantage of asylum seekers in order to make a profit, whom we know as people smugglers, really are disgraceful individuals and Labor is absolutely clear that it will not give these people a second chance to smuggle people into this country. We are absolutely clear that these people must be punished and prevented from acting in the same way again. The other thing we are absolutely clear about is that we will not see refugees returned to a country where they face persecution. As you know, this is clearly contrary to the refugee convention.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—To summarise, we have heard lots of nice-sounding statements from everybody that under no circumstances would they ever allow somebody to be sent back to somewhere where they face persecution. Most of the Liberal Party speakers, quite rightly, proudly clasped to their bosom the record of the Fraser government and the way they treated asylum seekers who came here. They then proceeded to completely trash the whole approach the Fraser government took and said that anybody who took that approach would be compromising the integrity of our borders, opening the floodgates and giving comfort to people smugglers. They cannot have it both ways. Do they think the Fraser government did the right thing or not? How can they possibly keep saying, ‘We have a proud record, look at what Fraser did,’ and then defend the current policy which is the absolute antithesis of what Malcolm Fraser did and which, as you all know, he is fiercely critical of?
I do not particularly blame the government speakers, because they are being fed totally dishonest propaganda from the office of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and his department. Senator Mason said there has been no objection to how people were processed on Nauru. That is ludicrous. There have been extraordinarily severe objections. It is because of those objections that legislation last year which sought to expand the Pacific solution was rejected by the Senate. There is ample evidence that we have sent people back to face persecution and that we have breached these conventions. That is why the Australian Democrats are so concerned that we again have public musings from government ministers. We have the immigration minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs umming and ahing: ‘We might send them to Nauru; we might send them to Indonesia; we’re seeking assurances that they won’t send them back.’ Why are we doing that? Why are we subcontracting something as fundamental as checking people’s claims about persecution—people who are fleeing a civil war? India has 100,000 refugees from Sri Lanka. We get 83 and suddenly we think that our borders are being compromised. It is ludicrous. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I think the next thing on the list is an opposition amendment, but I am happy to wax lyrical rather than have a quorum called.

(Senator Marshall)—I am advised that we have finished with the opposition amendment and that we are now on your amendment (4).
—I indicated before question time that I would not be proceeding with that amendment.
—In that case, Senator, you are correct: we are now moving to opposition amendment (3).
—I will not speak on the opposition’s behalf. Rather than call a quorum, I will recap on a couple of matters whilst we are waiting for the opposition shadow minister to come into the chamber. This debate has again come on rather more quickly than people might have anticipated. I will take the opportunity to indicate that the Democrats will support opposition amendment (3) when it is moved.
The important issue with regard to this legislation that is worth re-emphasising is that we are putting in place an entire new piece of law. We are not just amending the existing Citizenship Act; we are putting in place a brand-new one. It is worth reminding senators that until, I think, 1948 there was actually no such thing as a formal Australian citizen in law. In my speech in the second reading debate, I recalled going through some papers of my father’s not too long ago and discovering a resume he had written in the late 1940s detailing some of his experiences and qualifications to date. He was born in Sydney, his parents were both born in Sydney and yet on that resume he had put his nationality as British. It came as a bit of a shock to me to discover that my father was theoretically British.
It shows how much the notion of what Australian citizenship has evolved and continues to evolve. It is worth noting that the very notion of being a British subject and what is and is not an alien under the Constitution is something that is still being resolved at law. We have had two different High Court cases just in the last few years which have come down on different sides of the fence. They were four-three decisions in both cases but took different positions with respect to the status of people who are not Australian citizens but may have been very long-term residents in this country—whether they are or are not an alien and whether they are a noncitizen non-alien and all sorts of things like that.
That can sound like lots of arcane legal argument—and to some extent it is, except for the people who are directly affected by the case at hand—but it is a reminder of how the notion of citizenship is still evolving. It is also a reminder that there is still no precise head of power under the Constitution regarding citizenship. There is a head of power regarding the treatment of aliens, but that is not necessarily the same thing.
I also wanted to draw attention to the fact—and many of these amendments, including the one that is about to be moved, go to some of these issues—that there are people whose parents may have had citizenship but it lapsed for various reasons, particularly people who had no say in the changing status of their citizenship when they were children. These may be people who, as we know, have lived here for decades and often assumed they were Australian citizens and did not realise until it was drawn to their attention—often in less than pleasant circumstances—that they were not citizens. Many of them had been registered on the electoral roll and all sorts of things because they assumed that that they were Australian citizens. The notion that people who are citizens, who have this bit of paper, are somehow full-blown, 100 per cent Aussies and all the rest are somehow not true Australians is a pretty misleading concept.
I also want to emphasise again the expansion of the ability of people to be Australian citizens whilst also being citizens of another country, that is, being a dual citizen. I had this in a second reading amendment and was disappointed that it was not supported by the government. This is what we have seen both in many of the changes that are contained in this legislation and the whole new act that is about to be adopted and indeed in major amendments that were made a few years ago. Indeed, in some cases, we have people who are citizens of more than two countries—of three countries. Some years back it was actually not legal: if you became an Australian citizen, you automatically forfeited your citizenship of another country. That approach has changed and I think it is a very significant approach. It is an important part of expanding the strength of multiculturalism and expanding the benefits that we as Australians can get from the diverse range of backgrounds we have of people who are part of our community and our country.
It is worth remembering that Australia has one of the highest proportions of overseas born people. I think it is almost one-quarter of all Australians are overseas born. When you add on top of that people who have at least one parent who is overseas born, you are getting an extremely significant proportion of the Australian community. Very large numbers of those people will be dual citizens. Previous attempts I have made to ascertain exactly how many Australians are also citizens of another country have come up against a bit of a blank. Nobody actually knows. But, if we have nearly one-quarter of our community overseas born and a significant number on top of that whose parents are overseas born, there is a fair chance that the number of dual citizens we have is actually greater than the 20 per cent that is often used as an estimate. The more we go down this path—and it is a path that I support us going down—the more we are coming up against a major impediment in our Constitution, which is that anybody who is a dual citizen is precluded from running for the federal parliament. That is something that all parties have said they would support amending. Unfortunately we have not seen it progressed to the stage where they would take action to make it happen.

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—I thank you for the reminder, Senator Brown. Senator Brown put forward a private senator’s bill that came to a vote in this chamber. The Democrats have had legislation in the past as well—we may well even have some before the chamber at the moment as part of an omnibus bill—which sought to generate a referendum to make that change. Even though it has been official party policy of the coalition parties to support that change, when that came to a vote in this chamber they did not support it. They voted against it and therefore the bill did not progress. It was actually passed by a majority of the Senate at the time but, because such bills need to have an absolute majority—it does not take into account people who are absent for pairs or other reasons on the day—it did not get past the hurdle.
This bill is an opportunity to strongly emphasise once again that we are going further and further down this path of disqualifying a growing number of Australians from being able to run for parliament because of that barrier in the Constitution. If all of us recognise and support dual citizenship, as we all do under our parties’ policies, and we are all passing more and more laws expanding the number of people who are dual citizens, then it is about time that we initiated that referendum to amend the Constitution. If all parties support that policy, as I think we all do, then it is all the more reason to initiate a referendum to be conducted at the same time as a federal election so we can make that change. It is not only a matter of equality; it is a matter of Australia missing out on the skills that many of those people would bring to our political system. It is not just missing out on the skills they would bring to parliament; they are not even able to be candidates. They are precluded from even contributing as candidates and being part of the debates and engagement with the populace that happens throughout the electoral and democratic process.
There is one point I would like to make before I allow Senator Ludwig to get on with his amendment. It is of a reverse nature. We are emphasising the importance of citizenship, the rights of citizens and the obligations of citizens. One of the key rights you have when you become a citizen is the right to vote. It is probably one of the key incentives that people would think of when they decide to become an Australian citizen. Yet significant inconsistencies in that area are sticking out more and more. The more than we want to emphasise and promote the importance of our obligations and responsibilities as citizens—and that is meant to be a key reason behind the government’s arguments with the citizenship test they are proposing—the more we need to get consistency in how those rights and obligations are implemented. The simple fact is that there is a group of Australians now who have been quite consciously and deliberately disenfranchised, even though they are Australian citizens—that is, prisoners. All prisoners have now been disenfranchised under the Electoral Act.
Another inconsistency that sticks out, and is looking more and more outdated, is the fact there is a significant group within the community who are not Australian citizens but who can still vote, and that is all people who are British subjects who were eligible to be on the roll prior to 1984. I think that is when the Australia Act was implemented—on Australia Day 1984. There was a savings clause, what is often known as a grandfathering provision, which meant that all British subjects—not just British citizens but British subjects—eligible at that stage to be on the roll would remain on the roll. All of those people, if they were eligible at that time, remain eligible now, 23 years later.
There are many thousands of people in that circumstance. I am not seeking to pick on them, to somehow target them or to cast aspersions on them, but the simple fact is there are many thousands of people who are not Australian citizens who have had the right to vote now for over 20 years. At a time when we are reaffirming the importance of Australian citizenship and encouraging people to take up citizenship, we are keeping in place a measure in the Electoral Act that removes incentive for those people to become citizens. I think it is time to once again draw attention to that. I urge the government to amend the Electoral Act or, at the least, to explain what the rationale is for that savings provision to still be operating 23 years later. It would probably have been quicker to call a quorum, but I have all of those things on the record now. I will allow Senator Ludwig to move his amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—Thank you, Senator Bartlett. It certainly did give you an opportunity to put all of those things on the record. I move:
(3)    Clause 21, page 28 (line 32), after “17”, insert “or 18”.
I will keep it brief. This was a matter to which I referred extensively in my contribution to the second reading debate, when I foreshadowed I would move this amendment. The government is aware of Labor’s concerns. It is a matter which was raised in the House of Representatives as well. The situation facing the Maltese community regarding children whose parents had to renounce their citizenship under section 18 of the act was discussed in detail.
It is recognised that the government has, to some extent, tried to fix the situation for children whose parents lost their citizenship automatically under the now repealed section 17 of the previous act, which effectively prohibited dual citizenship. However, those who took out citizenship of countries that also prohibited dual citizenship had to formally renounce their citizenship under section 18 of the Citizenship Act. The discrepancy has to be an oversight by the government. Labor strongly urges the government to make a minor amendment to the bill to fix the situation for a small section of the Maltese community that is currently severely disadvantaged by these laws. It is a matter that has been argued strenuously by the Maltese community for some time. They have been quite vocal in what you might call their perseverance in trying to persuade the government to adopt the position they have argued.
They have persuaded Labor that there is a need to alter the legislation to remedy the circumstances their children face. Labor supports their position and urges the government to alter the legislation, and that is what this amendment will do. The government has argued that these children do not have a sufficient connection to Australia. I think, and Labor thinks, that is absurd. The connection is called a mum and a dad. I said that in my speech in the second reading debate and I reiterate it here. It is a simple amendment and it deserves the support of this house.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-02-26,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment. The children’s parents have made a conscious decision to renounce their Australian citizenship. At the time of doing so, they could have had no expectation of being able to resume it without migrating to Australia and applying for citizenship in the same way as any other migrant would. As the senator would well know, the Senate report stated:
... that this matter has been fully considered by the Government over a number of years and that renunciation is properly regarded as a more significant and conscious relinquishing of the bonds of allegiance to Australia.
Significantly, the bill also removes the 25-year age limit for the resumption of citizenship for people who have renounced their Australian citizenship. Former citizens who resume their Australian citizenship can also sponsor non-citizen family members, including their children, for migration to Australia. We will not be supporting the amendment

I note that there are what seem to be equivalent Australian Greens amendments, but I will leave that for the Australian Greens. Alternatively they may choose not to move them. I have spoken at some length in this chamber in my speech to the second reading debate about how this government has seemingly—you could only say to score cheap political points—flouted the advice of ASIO in departing from the residency requirements of three years that Labor had agreed to. This bill seeks to change the period to four years of residency and the government still have not answered the primary question: where is the advice that four years is in the best interests of this nation in terms of national security? If they seek to underline it with, ‘Four is better than three,’ then it is no argument at all.
What they need to be able to do is substantiate the argument about why they say precisely four years is the required number. Where is the ASIO advice? Does it in fact exist in the first instance? And is it the best balance between the importance of needing to integrate migrants into our community and needing to ensure that citizenship is not something that is easily achieved or taken up lightly? Why does the government say that four years strikes that balance? Labor urges the government to heed the original advice provided by ASIO by making the residence requirement three years. It is a sensible amendment. I think, and Labor thinks, that it went to four years because of what could only be described as opportunistic political point-scoring by this government on a bill that does not need it.
As I think the Senate committee first said in their explanation of the bill itself, it is a bill that intends to replace the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. It has broad support. Its main proposals include the restructure of citizenship law to make it more coherent, accessible and easy to use. It will also increase access to citizenship by simplifying provisions and changing the laws relating to citizenship by descent and resumption of renounced citizenship. It aims to strengthen the protection of national security by extending residence requirements by 12 months, to three years. Amongst the areas I have mentioned, there are two in which the government has it wrong: resumption of renounced citizenship and the extension of residence requirements by 12 months.
On many of the other provisions the government have it right, and Labor agrees with those positions. What the government are now seeking to do is use what would otherwise be a bill that would be broadly supported to find cheap political points of differentiation. This is but one of them. The government should and can—even as late as today—say: ‘We think we’re wrong. We don’t have advice. We did seek to make cheap political points on it and we were wrong about that. And, for the sake of ensuring that this bill does get through the Senate with bipartisan support, on this issue we agree with Labor’s amendment.’ That would be the sensible path to take. I am not under any illusion. I do not think the government will do that. They should do it, and perhaps deep in their hearts they too know they should do it. I am a realist: they will not do that. But I have moved the amendment. Having said all of that, it is disappointing to see that the government have used these provisions to again try to score cheap political points.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—The Democrats support Labor’s amendment, the effect of which would bring the residence requirement back to three years instead of four years. I place on the record—and this is also for the benefit of you, Temporary Chairman Marshall—that there was a proposed Democrat amendment to oppose clause 22. I now signal that we will not proceed with that. The preferred Democrat view was placed on the record when the government first announced that they were looking to extend the residence requirement from two years to three years. We stated that we were prepared to support that. That is not something completely out of proportion to what has been done in the past or by comparable countries. At that time, I think I said that the rationale given for extending it from two years to three years—that it might somehow assist with security concerns; and there was some debate after the London bombings—was simply ludicrous. Any suggestion that making people reside in Australia for three years instead of two, or four years instead of two, would somehow assist in any security issues regarding terrorism is farcical. Indeed, I would suggest that to some extent it is a bit offensive.
We need to work hard enough as it is to try and ensure that unreasonable prejudices towards migrants are not developed or validated in the community. Any suggestion that somehow there are security concerns with regard to whether or not migrants decide to become citizens just totally distorts where the debate needs to be when we are looking at how we deal with security and terrorism issues. It is a difficult and important debate. I certainly do not suggest that I have all the answers, but I do know that one of the answers is not going down a completely ridiculous and irrelevant dead-end side alley about how long people have to live in a country before they become citizens.
There are some valid debates with regard to integration and those sorts of things. It is useful to have those debates. The more we can have those sorts of debates without having some sort of undercurrent of attempts to look for dog-whistling opportunities and to play on some of the prejudices that exist in the Australian community, as they do in any community around the world, the more constructive the debate would be. Whilst I was prepared to accept that extending the period of residency for citizenship from two years to three years was reasonable enough and acceptable enough, I do not think that extending it for a further year, to four years, is justified. I certainly do not think the case has been made.
As always, the Democrats are prepared to consider the arguments. We are willing to look at the issues, hear people’s views and change our views if the case has been made. No case has been made. It was just straight off the top of the head of the government: ‘Let’s just push this out another year and make it look like we somehow need to make things a bit harder for migrants because they somehow need to be tested a bit further because there’s some problem.’ I do not think any case was made that there was any problem to start with. Frankly, I do not think there was any case made that there was a problem with two years. Having it bounced from not two to three years but two to four years—without any sort of consultation, any sort of flagging or any sort of case being made about what the problem was—was pathetic, frankly.
It actually offends me to some extent because I do believe citizenship is an important issue and something that does not get the attention it deserves in policy debate and public debate. That off-the-cuff, politically motivated shift in a pretty fundamental area regarding citizenship is too dismissive of an important issue. I agree that we need to more strongly promote the importance and value of Australian citizenship. I believe we need to much more strongly affirm not just the responsibilities but the rights attached to Australian citizenship. In that area, I think we are letting down some of our citizens. If you want to encourage people to become citizens, which I think is the public position of all parties in this chamber, why would you double the length of time people have to live here before they can become citizens if you cannot demonstrate that that is necessary to their effective integration? That has not been demonstrated at all.
My preferred position is that the residency requirement be three years; if that is not adopted, my second preferred position would be for it to stay at two years, which was what my foreshadowed amendment was meant to achieve, although I think it probably went a little wider than that—I think we can cover it with the vote on the amendment that provides for three years. If that is not successful we are stuck with the four years.
I want to point to one another issue I have with this extension to four years and ask a question of Minister Scullion regarding this. It is the first time I have asked him a question, I think, in his new ministerial role. If this bill is passed, section 21 of the new act will say that a person is eligible to become a citizen if the minister is satisfied the person fits a whole range of criteria. The bill provides that the person must either satisfy the residence requirement—which is what we are talking about at the moment, be it four years or three—or, as an alternative, has completed relevant defence service, which is under section 23. I can accept the different qualifications there for either a residence requirement or relevant defence service, but the longer the residence requirement—and now we are stretching it to four years; quite a big disparity—the greater the disparity with the required length of defence service.
As I read it, and the minister can correct me if I am wrong, new section 21 provides that the person can either satisfy the residence requirement, which is to be present in Australia for at least four years including at least one year of permanent residence immediately preceding their application, or complete relevant defence service of at least three months in the permanent forces of the Commonwealth or six months service in the Australian Naval Reserve, Army Reserve or Air Force Reserve.
Frankly, I think it would surprise a lot of Australians that we are advertising to get non-Australians to enlist in our defence forces. That is okay—I presume they get screened and go through all the appropriate criteria. It is a bit anomalous that we are saying, on the one hand, that people have to live here for four years before we can be sure they are real Aussies and not terrorists and that we have to be sure they know everything about Australia but, on the other hand, we will have them straightaway in our permanent defence forces of the Commonwealth. And if they serve just three months they are immediately eligible for citizenship. It seems a bit anomalous to me. I am not saying that people should not be able to do that, but it seems like rather a mixed message.
My question to the minister is: firstly, is it currently the case that we accept people who are not Australian citizens and, indeed, not Australian residents to serve in our Defence Force; secondly, is my reading accurate that, if those people who are not Australian residents serve just three months in the permanent forces of the Commonwealth, it in effect can be a fast track to citizenship? I ask the question because the more we lengthen the residency requirement, in this case to four years, the bigger the anomaly. If it was two years residence or a certain period in the Defence Force, it might not stick out so much. But when you push the residence requirement out to four years, this does appear to be quite an anomaly. I would appreciate an indication of whether, currently, people who are not residents are able to immediately enter the permanent forces of the ADF. If that reading is correct, is three months service in those permanent forces sufficient for them to meet the eligibility test for citizenship?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-02-26,"—I thank the senator for the question. I am informed there is no intention at all to change the provisions with regard to serving time in the Defence Force being sufficient to gain citizenship. I am also informed that, regarding the issue of serving in the Defence Force, whether for three months or any other period, substantially the reason that the Australian government puts so much weight on the eligibility test for serving in the Defence Force is that there are a whole range of criteria that must be met to gain entry to the Australian Defence Force. I do not think it is proper in this place or in these particular circumstances to discuss the criteria necessary to enter the Defence Force, but in effect the answer to your question is that the provisions regarding enlistment in the Defence Force leading to the capacity to apply for citizenship still apply and are unchanged by this bill. However, I should make something clear. I used the term ‘enlistment’. I do not want to mislead the Senate. The provision involves having ‘completed’ a period of time in the Defence Force.
I would like to thank the contribution from the Senate, particularly that from Senator Ludwig. I recognise his acceptance that the bill is substantially a good one. I am disappointed that he cannot agree with the bill completely, and the amendments that are put forward reflect that.
The bill as drafted changes the residence requirements from two years of permanent residence to four years of lawful residence, including at least 12 months as a permanent resident. Absences from Australia of up to 12 months during the four-year period are allowed, for no more than three months in the year before making the application. Up to three years of temporary residence could be counted towards the four years that are required. In addition, the requirements would ensure that the applicants will have spent sufficient time in Australia to develop a sense of what it is to be an Australian and to fully understand the commitment they need to make to become an Australian citizen. The requirements also recognise the changes in the migration program over the years which have resulted in an increasing number of people spending significant periods of time in Australia as temporary residents prior to becoming permanent residents.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I will respond briefly to that and save a bit of time by foreshadowing an amendment that I will move. The argument Senator Scullion put—and I appreciate he is representing the minister and is not the minister directly responsible—about needing to allow sufficient time for people to get an understanding of what it is to be an Australian and those sorts of things are nice-sounding words and a nice-sounding concept, but what does it mean in practice? We are making laws that people are required to meet.
The issue goes back in part to the point I was making before which, if I understand the minister’s answer to my previous point, he actually confirmed. People will not need to reside here for four years if they have completed just three months service in the permanent forces of the Commonwealth. Spending three months in the permanent forces of the Commonwealth is a fairly intensive activity. It may be that you are not getting a full understanding of all of those other things, whatever they might be—and they are always things we cannot quite nail down—about what it is to be an Australian. Three months is not necessarily a lot of time to do that, particularly if those three months are spent as a permanent member of the ADF. It is a nice rhetorical flourish, but it does not actually make the case for what is wrong with the current period of two years. Why does it need to be doubled to four years?
I emphasise that the change that is made of enabling part of that to be residency on a temporary visa is a welcome change and reflects the significant shift in the nature of our migration program. I wish there were a much greater acceptance and acknowledgement of that shift in public debate around migration issues. The number of people who came here on permanent residency visas in the last year, for example—that is what people normally think of when thinking of migrants and potential future citizens—is far smaller. I think it is about a third or even a quarter of the number of people who come here on temporary residency but residency nonetheless and long-term residency in many cases. Many of those then transition to permanent visas. The bulk of our annual migration program—of residency visas, anyway—issued each year is people on temporary visas. They have long-term temporary residency and residency rights, usually with work rights, Medicare entitlements and the like, although not always.
It is very different from the way the Prime Minister announced the change of the name of the department to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship—the idea of a progression, with people migrating and then becoming citizens. The world does not work in that nice straight-line way anymore. The fact that we have such a large proportion of people on temporary residency visas demonstrates that. The fact that we now have so many people who are dual citizens demonstrates that. The fact that we have hundreds of thousands of Australians living overseas—I think the diaspora is estimated at around a million—also demonstrates that. It is much more dynamic than the linear approach we used to have. That is another reason why a much more substantial case needs to be made.
This also provides me with the opportunity to raise a core problem with the government’s approach, which is reflected in the amendment I will move shortly, of providing certain refugees with only temporary visas. Some people who have been accepted as refugees and given refugee visas in Australia have been given five-year or three-year temporary visas. When that visa has expired they have been entitled only to another temporary visa. We have people who are recognised as refugees and are living in the community but are not entitled to permanent residency. I believe that the time in Australia of all of those people should be counted as if they were permanent residents, as it is only because of the politics surrounding asylum seekers—some of which we debated earlier today—that those people are in that situation.
That also cuts across the argument the government are putting forward. I will touch on that again in slightly more detail when I speak later, but this is a core part of the legislation and it is worth trying to get on the record—at least trying to draw out of the government on the record—what possible rationale they have for what they are doing and what the potential consequences are. Whilst the recognition of temporary residents in Australia goes some way to encouraging citizenship, for all the talk about encouraging citizenship stretching out the time period to four years works against that. Without a case being put, it is hard to see how we could do anything other than support the ALP amendment.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I move Democrat amendment (5) on sheet 4868:
(5)    Clause 22, page 32 (line 26), at the end of subclause (10), add “and includes a same sex partner”.
This relates to the definition of ‘spouse’. Under the residence requirements of the new act that we have been debating, proposed subsection 22(9) deals with ‘spouse’ and a ministerial discretion. I will read it out for the benefit of the chamber:

Ministerial discretion—spouse, widow or widower of Australian citizen

If the person is the spouse, widow or widower of an Australian citizen at the time the person made the application, the Minister may treat a period as one in which the person was present in Australia as a permanent resident if:
the person was a spouse of that Australian citizen during that period; and
the person was not present in Australia during that period; and
the person was a permanent resident during that period; and
the Minister is satisfied that the person had a close and continuing association with Australia during that period.
For the purposes of that subsection, ‘spouse’ is also defined as ‘de facto spouse’. What that does, as I understand it, is allow the minister to treat the spouse of an Australian citizen who has permanent residency as having been in Australia even though they were not if they are the spouse of an Australian citizen. It is a ministerial discretion that can be applied to spouses, including de facto spouses, of Australian citizens who are permanent residents to enable them to become citizens as well.
We can all detail examples of how that circumstance could happen. I imagine many of us would know examples of that—Australian citizens who are married to people from other countries or who have a de facto partner who is from another country, while the spouse has a permanent residency visa for Australia, quite possibly a spouse visa although not necessarily; it could be any sort of skilled visa, even a refugee protection visa. For various reasons the Australian citizen could be off working somewhere else and their spouse could be with them—quite a common occurrence in the modern world. In those circumstances, if the spouse is interested in becoming an Australian citizen, it is in Australia’s interests for them to be able to do so without waiting out unnecessary extra lengths of time under the residency requirement.
The Democrat amendment is aimed at ensuring that the definition of ‘spouse’ includes not only de facto spouses but also same-sex partners. This is a longstanding campaign of the Democrats to try to reduce discrimination under Australian federal legislation towards people with same sex-partners. For quite some time the Prime Minister and a number of other members of the coalition, both senior and not so senior, have spoken about how they do not support discrimination against people on the basis of the gender of their partner.
A Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry underway at the moment has been detailing all of the different Commonwealth pieces of law where people are discriminated against on the grounds of their sexuality, one of which is the Migration Act and another of which is the Citizenship Act. The commission has held hearings and taken evidence from people around the country who have given real-life personal examples of how this discrimination impacts upon them.
Let me remind the committee that we are putting in place a whole new citizenship act here. Many times in the past, when the Democrats have moved amendments to ensure people with same-sex partnerships are treated the same way as people with opposite-sex partners, we have had the response, ‘Well, you can’t do it bit by bit; you have to do it as one big piece of legislation and do it all at once otherwise you will just get lots of anomalies.’
Last year, when the Democrats brought on for debate once again our one big bit of legislation that would actually do that, the Sexuality and Gender Identity Discrimination Bill, which has been in this chamber since 1995, we had government senators say, ‘We support this totally.’ I remember a particularly eloquent speech from Senator Brandis. Maybe that is why he ended up being in the ministry, because the Prime Minister was so impressed by his eloquent defence of the need to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. He gave an eloquent defence, an eloquent speech—as did a few other Liberal senators—about the importance of this principle. He said that we could not do it all in one big thing like this; what we should do is do it piece by piece.
Now here is the opportunity. And it is not piece by piece; it is not even a tiny little amendment to one little part of the legislation. This is ensuring that we get the Citizenship Act—the brand spanking new, sparkly, squeaky-clean, updated, upmoded, modern Australian Citizenship Act—correct right from the start, right from when it is first in place. We are not just making a small amendment on the side, tacking on a little thing with a bit of sticky tape that will stick out and offend people’s sensibilities because it is not nice and neat enough. This is making sure the new act is spot-on when it comes in.
So I can only assume that the government will not put up the argument that we need to do this all at once, in one big go, and that we cannot possibly do it one act at a time. There is only one way to do it, which is one act at a time. And the human rights commission have been detailing those acts. Whether they have been detailing them or not, it is pretty obvious that that is what we have here: the definition of spouse includes de facto spouse; it does not include same-sex partner.
A particular reason it needs to be done is that we already have anomalies in the immigration act. We have the absurdity of the government themselves making a change to the treatment of spouses under one class of visa. And this was after all those years of saying: ‘No, we couldn’t possibly support an amendment that would generate equality for people with same-sex partners because it would be too messy and you would create anomalies. We need to do it all at once; we need to do it to whole acts, not just in one bit.’ It is after all those years of citing that as a reason to vote against Democrat amendments in this area—even though they supported the principle, totally supported the principle, were proud of the principle! ‘Great principle! Just can’t do it here.’
Yet what we saw from the former minister, Minister Vanstone, was a change to the criteria just for skilled visas. Under skilled migration visas, spouses include same-sex spouses. If you are applying for a skilled visa in Australia and you have got a same-sex partner, we will recognise that relationship. I supported that because at least it was some recognition of that relationship; it was a move forward. Yet we have an absurdity under our migration law. We are desperate to get people here on skilled visas—and I support our sizeable migration program; I support bringing in people on skilled programs; I support the 457 visa program; I am not criticising all that. But we have this bizarre situation where we are so desperate to get people here on skilled visas that the government have reversed their own longstanding, obstinate refusal to support these sorts of changes and made an administrative decision that same-sex partners count as spouses for skilled visas.
It was very important. We had clear evidence—and I recall former senator Brian Greig from the Democrats raising this in question time as an example—of doctors and nurses, people who we were desperately trying to get here, who would not come here because their partner could not come with them on the same visa. Everybody else’s spouse could come with them; same-sex partners could not. That was changed and that was good. It was self-serving, because we needed the skilled people. But then we had the bizarre situation where people could come here and have their partner recognised on a skilled visa, but they could not come here and have their partner recognised on a spouse visa. That anomaly is sitting there today; that continues, in any of those family categories.
People in same-sex relationships normally have to go through the interdependency visa; that is a roundabout way that has been used. That was a Democrat initiative, going back over 10 years now, to at least provide some mechanism, some way, for the government to allow in same-sex partners without admitting to the reactionary part of their constituency that that was what they were doing.
We already have all these anomalies in the Migration Act, so any argument that this cannot be agreed to because it would create an anomaly is just absurd. But we also have that anomaly where people can come here on a visa—not just on an interdependency visa now but also on a skilled visa—and have their same-sex partner recognised as a spouse. Yet, when people have a same-sex partner who is an Australian citizen, we do not recognise that as a spousal relationship. So I say to the government: by not fixing this up, by not agreeing to this amendment, you will actually create an anomaly that you are halfway to fixing—only halfway to fixing—in the migration area.
This has nothing to do with the gay marriage debate. And I would put on the record that the Prime Minister has made clear, as have most people in the coalition—and Mr Entsch from the electorate of Leichhardt in my own state of Queensland has pushed this to some extent in the coalition—that, whilst the government are about removing discrimination against same-sex couples, they are not about legalising same-sex marriage. It is not about adoption; it is nothing to do with that. It is simply making de facto partnerships, de facto spouses, equivalent, whether they are in same-sex relationships or opposite-sex relationships.
It is a very clear amendment. It is very simple. It removes discrimination. It ensures that our supposedly modern, new, updated Citizenship Act actually is that. It was raised in some submissions in the Senate inquiry over a year ago. So we cannot have the excuse that we did not have any warning about this and that nobody raised it, which is also sometimes used as a reason not to support this. Dare I suggest it is time, on this occasion, for equality to finally be implemented clearly and unequivocally in one Commonwealth act right from its very outset. I would urge all senators to recognise that and support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I listened very carefully to Senator Bartlett’s speech on this issue. He has done his homework. I will not speak for those on the other side, but I have used arguments in the past about not agreeing to piecemeal legislation. I have also used the argument that it is outside the terms of the committee’s inquiry. Yes, those are arguments I have put in respect of not only this type of amendment but others of the same order, although not on the same topic. In other words, generally we do not agree with piecemeal amendments and we reserve our position for those areas where amendments put forward fall outside the terms of the committee’s recommendations or the committee’s examination of the bill itself, or where amendments fall outside the bill’s intention—in other words, the object of the bill.
In this instance, Senator Bartlett, you have managed to find an argument that does deserve support. The argument is that this is a new act and redrafting all of those provisions will put it in a logical, sensible position. Therefore, the argument that you raise does find favour with the Labor Party. It is right to argue for it in this instance. It is an argument where you have been able to clearly differentiate between a piecemeal approach and one that creates a coherent whole.
This legislation does require an amendment such as this dealing with same-sex partners. I make the point, perhaps a minor one, that the way you have used the definition section is a little inelegant. For example, if same-sex partners were included in the definition section of the act under a definition of ‘de facto partner’, those same-sex partners would be required to meet a similar standard of proof as heterosexual de facto partners. The only criticism I make is that it could have been better drafted. I understand the intent behind it and I understand the principle you enunciated.
I recognise that it is also time for this government to move on. Senator Bartlett is right: Senator Brandis did provide a very eloquent speech on these issues. I was actually persuaded that he might be changing his view, or the government’s view at least, on this issue. We were subsequently disappointed and I suspect we will be disappointed again. I cannot see the government picking it up. I think they should; I think it is an appropriate amendment to pick up. They should have included it in the original legislation, and I will be interested to hear why the government will not deal with this issue now. I could be surprised, as I suspect Senator Bartlett was surprised—although I hope he was not too surprised—by Labor’s decision to adopt the amendment. It was well argued and it is sensible. The government should agree to it as well, although I recognise that this government is stuck in the past and they will not.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-02-26,"—I thank Senator Bartlett and Senator Ludwig for their contributions. The additional comments by the Democrats did not go unnoticed, Senator Bartlett. I am not sure if you are aware but, whilst it was not a specific recommendation of the committee, these bills have been amended to include the provision of a residence discretion that has been made for persons granted a visa as the interdependent partner of an Australian citizen. I refer specifically to clause 22(11), page 32, line 27 of the bill. These amendments were passed by the House of Representatives on 28 November 2006 and that is why the government will not be supporting the Australian Democrats’ amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I was not surprised that Labor supported our amendment; I thought you would—although I was worried there for a second that you might have knocked it down on the grounds of inelegance! The point the Minister for Community Services makes is true: there is recognition in the bill of a partner in an interdependent relationship. However, the point needs to be made that there have been repeated comments by many coalition MPs, not just Mr Entsch but also Mr Howard and others, that people should not be discriminated against because of the gender of their partner—I am paraphrasing but I am certainly not misrepresenting them—but that is what you are doing when you define ‘spouse’ in a way that recognises de facto opposite-sex relationships but does not recognise de facto same-sex relationships. It puts them on a different footing.
The interdependency component in there is welcome. It is similar to the current arrangements in the Migration Act. There is an interdependency visa. That was created many years ago, as I said, specifically as a result of Democrat pressure and action. It was before I was elected to the Senate, so it is going back quite a while. But we still have a scenario where there are limited numbers under the interdependency category. It is, if you like, a second-hand approach to circumventing the requirement to recognise people’s same-sex relationships—not to in any way recognise them in a marriage like sense but recognise them in the same way that de facto relationships have long been recognised under Commonwealth law. An interdependent relationship is not just a same-sex relationship. Indeed, it is good that those wider interdependent relationships are recognised because it shows the immense diversity of relationships. But to continue to put same-sex relationships in that basket and treat them differently from opposite-sex relationships maintains that discrimination.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm

(Senator Ferguson)—The committee is considering the Australian Citizenship Bill 2006, as amended. The question is that Democrat amendment (5) on sheet 4868 be agreed to.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I move Democrat amendment (6) on sheet 4868:
(6)    Clause 22, page 33 (after line 11), at the end of the clause, add:
       (12)    For the purpose of subsection (1), the Minister must, if the person was the holder of a Temporary Protection Visa during that period, treat that period as one in which the person was present in Australia as a permanent resident.
Note:   Temporary Protection Visas are provided for under the Migration Regulations 1994.

I have reflected on this already to some extent so I will not go on at great length. Basically the intent of this amendment is to address an issue for those people who have been residing in Australia on temporary protection visas. During their period of residency the minister should treat—must treat—that period as if the person were present in Australia as a permanent resident. Senators would know that people on temporary protection visas, by and large, do not leave the country at all whilst they are on the visas. They do not have rights to re-enter the country if they do leave, except by special dispensation, and so the vast majority of them on temporary protection visas spend their entire time living as residents in Australia. There are discretionary components within the legislation which do allow waiver of the residency requirement under special circumstances, and I recognise that there is a discretion there, but I think that it would be better if it were automatic for refugees who have been here on temporary protection visas to have that counted as permanent residency.
I accept that under the changes in this legislation there is only a requirement for 12 months permanent residence rather than two years—the 12 months immediately preceding the day the person made the application—but there have to be four years of residence in total. So people who have been on a temporary protection visa, once they have a permanent visa, would only be required to reside here for a further 12 months. I believe that it would be appropriate for them not to need to wait that extra 12 months if they have already resided here for the four years.
It should also be emphasised, on top of that, that many people that have had that period of extended residency in Australia on TPVs have also had quite a number of years prior to that stuck in detention centres. Quite explicitly in the legislation that does not count as time spent in Australia. To some extent that is logical and I accept that. If you are in Australia as an unlawful noncitizen according to the act, whether or not you are in a detention centre or out in the community—as I would prefer people to be—then it is reasonable for that not to count as time residing in Australia because in the legal sense of the word you are not a resident. But, once people are given a temporary protection visa, an acknowledgement that they are a refugee, then I believe that period should be counted straightaway as the start of permanent residence for the purposes of becoming a citizen.
My understanding is that, on average, people on refugee visas are quicker to take up citizenship than other migrants, which is quite a logical situation. Most refugees have, by definition, experienced a lot of instability in their lives and have had fairly significant uprooting of their existence. They are fairly keen to fully connect with their new country as quickly as possible and remove any further instability from their future. As I am sure all senators would acknowledge, Australia has benefited enormously from the contribution of many refugees, whether they have come through the humanitarian program or via boat arrivals. I will not revisit the debate from earlier today about asylum seekers arriving by boat, but it is widely acknowledged by all sides of politics that we have benefited a lot from the contribution of many people who have arrived by boat and have been accepted as refugees. There is always the occasional bad apple, as there is in the wider migration program and as there is, of course, amongst the Australian-born section of the community. But I am not aware of any evidence that shows there is any greater risk from people who have arrived as asylum seekers or, indeed, that theirs has been a lesser contribution over time.
The intent of this amendment is to try to remove what I believe is an unnecessary barrier to these refugees being able to become citizens as soon as possible after they have fulfilled the four-year residency requirement that will now be in place. By any measure, that is a very long period of time. I believe it is particularly beneficial, not just for the refugees but for Australia, for these refugees to be able to get on with their lives. The sooner that security and stability is present in their lives, the more completely they will be able to fully participate in the Australian community.
As it is somewhat related, I once again ask the minister a question relating to clause 22. As I noted before, under clause 22(1)(b) time spent in Australia as an unlawful noncitizen does not count as being part of the four-year residency requirements. There is an exemption to that under subclause 4A. For the purposes of subclause (1)(b), the minister may waive that requirement if the person was an unlawful noncitizen because of administrative error. I was wondering whether we could get a clearer detailing of what constitutes ‘administrative error’ with regard to somebody being an unlawful noncitizen. Does that relate to perhaps a Cornelia Rau type circumstance, without wanting to be provocative by using that example—she is someone who was deemed mistakenly to be an unlawful noncitizen—or would it also relate to, for example, people who were in detention having been refused a visa on the grounds of mistaken identity that was then overturned on appeal?
Examples like that have occurred and I have spoken about them in this place before. I really want to get to examples of people who have lost time—quite long periods of time in some cases; a number of years—being kept as unlawful noncitizens due to decisions that were later overturned by government rather than anything they did wrong. In those circumstances, it is only fair and just for those people to be able to count their time. Again, in Australia’s interests, it is better not to have those sorts of reasons in the way of potentially valuable citizens being able to become citizens as soon as practicable.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I will not delay the debate on this longer than I need to. The position outlined by Senator Bartlett does draw the support of the opposition. It is the case that the government has failed in this area. The way the TPV regime currently works is unhelpful. Senator Bartlett’s proposition does allow that period to be treated as a period in which the person was present in Australia as a permanent resident. That is a sensible way of progressing the temporary protection visa holders. The ultimate aim is to ensure that the temporary protection visa holders can satisfy the residence requirements to better allow them to integrate into the community as soon as possible. That seems to be the objective; therefore, it does draw our support.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-02-26,"—With regard to the question from Senator Bartlett, this provision was, I understand, actually carried over. For clarity, I will read into the Hansard section 13, part 4(b)(v) of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948:
... if the Minister considers that an applicant who is a permanent resident was, by reason of an administrative error, not a permanent resident during a period during which the person was present in Australia—treat the period as a period during which the applicant was present in Australia as a permanent resident.
That provision, of course, is as it applies to lawfulness. The notion that an unlawful noncitizen was at any time—in fact, I will sit down before I get myself into more strife. I hope that answers your question.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I move amendment (10) on sheet 4868:
(10)  Clause 54, page 66 (after line 20), at the end of the clause, add;
         (2)    The regulations must include policy guidelines providing that the application of the ministerial discretions in section 22 in relation to significant hardship or disadvantage and activities beneficial to Australia are to be applied broadly to include:
              (a)    social and cultural factors; and
              (b)    economic considerations.
I will be brief. This amendment is to a part at the end of the legislation that deals with regulations. It provides a requirement that the regulations must include policy guidelines providing that the application of the ministerial discretions in section 22, which is the section we have just been talking about, in relation to significant hardship or disadvantage and activities beneficial to Australia are to be applied broadly to include social and cultural factors and economic considerations. It is really just to try to provide a bit more flesh around the exercise of ministerial discretion in this area.
I have spoken at great length about, and indeed we have had Senate inquiries into, the exercise of ministerial discretion in the Migration Act and some of the problems with regard to the opaque nature of that. This amendment would go part of the way to ensuring that there was just a little more flesh around how ministerial discretion is exercised. It creates clearer guidance for ministers—and I appreciate that sometimes ministers do not like being constrained by regulated guidance; they like to be able to have total freedom to decide—and it is to the benefit of the minister and government of the day in relation to the uncertainty that surrounds the reasons ministerial discretion is used in a range of areas in the Migration Act, and in the Citizenship Act where it applies. That can be problematic in that it is easy for people to draw unhelpful or very negative conclusions about the way the law operates when there is no real clear reason why discretion is exercised in one case and not in another case.
Obviously, some migrant communities come from countries where it is very clear what sorts of factors might help create a more favourable decision—they are not actions that are encouraged in Australia, such as money changing hands and various other inducements to get a better decision. I am not suggesting that happens here; I am suggesting that to reduce the prospects of people suspecting that that is the reason discretions get exercised in particular ways it can be quite helpful to have clearer and to some extent more enforceable guidelines. That is what this amendment goes to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—Labor supports this amendment for the reasons very effectively outlined by Senator Bartlett. It is one of those areas where—I would refer to it as more than opaque, Senator Bartlett—it is impenetrable sometimes how those ministerial decisions are made, particularly in the exercise of section 417 of the Migration Act. Any amendment such that policy guidelines through regulation might help to make that process more transparent will always garner Labor’s support. Exercising ministerial discretion is one area where that particular Senate committee did find that there was a need for greater transparency, as I recollect it. If I am wrong about that then I am sure I will be corrected, but my recollection is that there is a need for greater certainty and transparency in circumstances when the minister exercises a discretion of that nature. Senator Bartlett has sought to put some transparency in that process. I doubt very much that the government will concede to this amendment but it will be interesting to hear their argument as to why they will not.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—I move Democrat amendment (11) on sheet 4868:
(11)  Page 66 (after line 20), at the end of Part 3, add:
55 Review
         (1)    The Minister must cause an independent review of:
              (a)    the extent to which Australia discharges its obligations to stateless persons; and
              (b)    the extent to which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has conferred with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on Australia’s obligations to stateless persons.
         (2)    The person who undertakes the review under subsection (1) must give the Minister a written report of the review.
         (3)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 12 months after the second anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
This amendment is fairly self-evident. It seeks to cause an independent review to be performed regarding the extent to which Australia discharges its obligations to stateless persons and the extent to which the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has conferred with the UNHCR and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on Australia’s obligations to stateless persons. From my recollection of the genesis of this amendment, I think the drafting instructions on this went in about 10 or 11 months ago when the Senate committee reported. It was really generated from some of the discussions and submissions around statelessness and our obligations to stateless persons, which I accept is a murky area. Indeed that is part of the reason to suggest this review to make clear the extent of exactly how adequately we are discharging our obligations in that area and whether there are ways we can improve that performance.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-02-26,"—Labor supports the Democrat amendment. As Senator Bartlett has correctly pointed out, this is a matter that was recommended by the committee. On that basis, it would be helpful for the Senate to understand the effect on stateless people and to assist the parliament in reviewing the effectiveness of our laws. Therefore, it does gain Labor’s support.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-02-26,"—I understand that this amendment relates to recommendation 11 of the Senate committee’s report, which was partly accepted by the government. This bill has been thoroughly reviewed in the light of the committee recommendations. Submissions have been made to the committee, and the government is completely satisfied that the bill as amended is consistent with Australia’s international obligations regarding statelessness. I understand neither HREOC nor UNHCR have the legislative authority to determine compliance of Australian law with the convention.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—My final comment is that it is true that HREOC and UNHCR do not have that power. But HREOC, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, established by an act of this parliament, clearly has a role to provide advice on how Australia meets or otherwise its obligations under international conventions, including ones that touch on stateless people. It deals with this stuff every day in much greater detail than the parliament and, I would suggest, on a day-to-day basis, almost anybody in the department or government as well. The UNHCR, on an international scale, does the same.
One of the reasons these sorts of reviews are valuable is that we are not forced to rely on bland assertions from government that they meet all our obligations. I have heard that repeatedly from representatives of the minister for immigration in this chamber—or indeed from the minister for immigration herself when that was the case—for a number of years now. They blandly assert that Australia meets our international obligations in every way, even in the face of overwhelming, comprehensive, undoubted, incontestable evidence such that anybody with even the remotest comprehension of the English language would know that we are flagrantly breaching our obligations. Nations have a right to do that but the least we should do is admit it.
The government should not be defensive about this; I am not accusing them of doing it. I am suggesting it is an area to look at. My belief is that the intent of the Senate committee’s recommendation was not in any way to suggest the government were failing in this area—unlike Senate committee recommendations in other areas where they quite clearly believe the government have failed to meet their international obligations on refugees and other matters. The intent was to enable a more thorough examination because it is not really clear whether or not we adequately meet our obligations.
The obligations to stateless people and how you best meet those obligations is not an easy area. None of this is easy, as I said earlier, but this is a particularly difficult area. It is not even always clear as to how stateless people are defined, frankly. Reaching agreement as to whether or not someone is stateless is not always easy. It is an area that could do with further work. For once it is an area where not even I am saying that the government is failing to meet its international obligations. As the minister would know, I am quite often alleging that, as I did earlier on today. The benefit of it is that it would enable that to be done.
It can be done in other ways. It is not the end of the world if it does not happen. I am sure HREOC will continue to provide advice anyway. But it was an opportunity, because the issue arose during the course of the inquiry, to reinforce that by and large the Senate committee across the board found it a positive piece of legislation which could be improved upon and it was an opportunity to do so further. Perhaps in wrapping up all of that and the amendments themselves, it is appropriate to acknowledge that, despite the government’s nonacceptance of this particular amendment flowing from the committee inquiry, which I assume will stay the same despite my last contribution, there has been acceptance of a reasonable number of the recommendations from the committee inquiry. That should be acknowledged.
Question negatived.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I indicate at the outset that Labor supports this bill, which contains measures arising from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2004 federal election and matters related to it. I want to make the point that this bill is the second layer of changes that have been introduced by the government with respect to the recommendations of the report. Whilst Labor is happy to support the particular amendments before the chamber, it must be emphasised that the earlier legislation which was passed through this place with the support of the government senators introduced some very regressive measures which altered Australia’s electoral system. Those measures were clearly introduced by the government to try and seek partisan political advantage.
It is worth remembering some of the key aspects of the changes which this government previously pushed through the chamber. First is the early closure of the electoral roll, which will now close for most new enrollees on the day the writs are issued. This will give existing enrollees only three days to correct their details. If this measure had been put in place for the last election, up to 80,000 Australians might have been unable to enrol to vote. Up to 280,000 people in total could have been affected by having a substantial fault on their enrolment. The electoral changes which were pushed through by the Howard government also introduced far greater identity requirements for enrolment, which have the potential to disenfranchise many Australians.
There are new requirements for provisional voters to prove their identity. Voters on election day who are not listed on the electoral roll are currently able to cast a provisional vote. After election day the bona fides of these ballots are investigated by the AEC and, if they should be admitted to the count, they are. The government intends to force those who cast a provisional vote to provide additional proof of identity. We should know that over 180,000 Australians cast provisional votes at the last election. So, the government with its previous amendments pushed through increased restrictions on people’s ability to vote. Certainly the early closure of the rolls, which was pushed through in this place, will potentially disenfranchise a great many young people. Why is the government so intent on putting in place measures which will make it more difficult for many young Australians to cast a vote?
However, as you will recall, on the last occasion that a related bill was before the chamber, that legislation made it far easier to donate large sums of money to a political party without any public scrutiny whatsoever. For example, there was an increase in the declarable limit for disclosure of political donations to $10,000, and there has an increase in tax deductibility for political donations from $100 to $1,500. In other words, the previous approach taken by the government in the 2006 legislation made it harder to vote but easier to donate.
Having said that, the bill before the chamber deals with a range of other issues which Labor does support. It contains amendments for the expansion of postal vote provisions for ADF and AFP personnel, revised arrangements for the delivery of postal voting material, an increase in the number of AEC officers who are eligible to receive postal vote envelopes, the introduction of trials for electronically assisted voting for the visually impaired, and remote electronic voting for ADF personnel deployed overseas. Additionally, the bill proposes to repeal defamation provisions that carry criminal actions and penalties for defamation against electoral candidates.
The committee’s report recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to specifically permit ADF and AFP personnel serving overseas to become general postal voters. These people will automatically be sent ballot papers for each election without first having to lodge a postal vote application, giving them more time to return their postal vote. The act currently provides that an application should be regarded as not having been made if it reaches the AEC officer after 6 pm on the day prior to polling day—a Friday. This bill repeals that provision and substitutes a new provision to provide that the deadline by which postal vote applications must be received in order to be processed is 6 pm on the Thursday—that is, two days before polling day. As I understand it, the intention behind these amendments is to enhance the prospect of postal voters receiving postal voting material in time for completion on or before polling day.
The bill also inserts a new subsection that provides that, for postal voting applications received after the new deadline, the commission is required to make reasonable efforts to contact those applicants to advise them that their applications have not met the deadline and of the need for them to vote by other means. This gives effect to the government’s response to part of recommendation 9 of the committee’s report. The act currently provides that an elector who casts a postal vote shall post or deliver the completed postal voting envelope on which the postal vote certificate is printed to the appropriate DRO. Where it is unlikely that the completed envelope could reach the appropriate DRO within 13 days after polling day, the act currently allows for the envelope to be returned to other AEC officers.
This bill expands the range of officers who can receive completed postal voting envelopes in order to provide postal voters with greater flexibility and options for returning their voting material in time to be included in the scrutiny. The range of officers who will now be able to receive completed postal voting envelopes will include electoral visitors at hospitals and prisons, mobile polling team leaders, and certain office holders and ongoing employees of the AEC’s capital city offices.
The bill also inserts into the act trials of electronic voting methods. It includes the provision for a trial of electronically assisted voting for sight-impaired Australians and a trial of remote electronic voting for Defence personnel serving outside Australia. I understand that electronic voting for sight-impaired people was trialled in six locations at the Victorian state election. Initial advice from the Victorian Electoral Commission was that the trial certainly provided significant advantages for sight-impaired people. However, Labor also understands that the number of people who participated in the trial was less than had been hoped. I understand that my colleague the shadow special minister of state will be obtaining further advice from the VEC about the trial and that a report will be provided to the Victorian parliament.
The trial of remote electronic voting for Defence personnel will be rolled out on Defence’s secure network and will include approximately 1,500 people. The government has indicated it may consider extending the trial, as recommended by the committee, but as yet has made no commitments. Under this proposed trial method there will be a printed record of the vote a person has cast. Once a person has cast an electronically assisted vote, the vote record will be placed in an envelope upon which a completed declaration has been made. Information on the outside of the envelope will enable preliminary scrutiny of the votes to take place. This will not be capable of identifying the elector, consistent with the process adopted for prepoll. The vote record produced at the prepoll voting office will not be required to be an exact replication of the ballot paper in order to ensure the secrecy of the vote is maintained. However, the vote record will and must be capable of producing a document, whether it is a replication of the ballot paper or otherwise, that accurately reflects the voter’s intention for scrutiny purposes. I indicate that Labor fully supports this initiative and welcomes the opportunities that new technologies provide in assisting people to vote.
Apart from these primary reforms, there are also a number of other minor amendments. These relate to, for example, alternative documentary evidence which may be supplied by people enrolling from overseas, under sections 94A and 95 of the act. Such persons will now be given the option of supplying either their Australian passport number or their driver’s licence number as documentary evidence of their name. Under the bill the commission will also be able to establish a prepoll voting office when, due to exceptional circumstances, it would not be possible to gazette the declaration prior to commencement of the operation of the prepoll voting office. This provision will operate as an exception to the general requirement to gazette prepoll voting offices. This will allow prepoll voting offices to be established in circumstances where the AEC is required to quickly ensure that electors are able to cast votes. It will still be required to publish a copy of the declaration in the gazette as soon as practicable.
As I indicated at the outset, this bill also repeals provisions which make it an offence for a person to make or publish any false and defamatory statement in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate. Such cases of defamation will instead be dealt with in accordance with the civil law of defamation existing in the relevant state or territory jurisdiction. This will bring candidate defamation actions in line with existing legislation and common law. This item gives effect to another recommendation of the committee report.
This legislation does have some important reforms designed to enhance the operation of our system to provide people with a greater opportunity to be able to cast a vote. With electronic assistance voting, allowing Defence Force personnel to register as general postal voters, and providing different provisions in terms of who can receive postal votes after they have been filled in, there are aspects of this legislation which will provide people with a greater capacity to participate in the democratic process. However, as I said at the outset, this bill stands in direct contrast to the last bill in this area that the Howard government brought forward in response to the joint committee’s recommendations. That bill produced a number of changes that made it harder for some sections of Australian society to vote.
One of the main changes, which has been much talked about and to which I referred earlier, in the previous bill was the early closure of the electoral roll. There is no doubt that closing the roll early may produce an administrative nightmare, with people being incorrectly enrolled. There is also no doubt that it is likely to lead to a large number of people being excluded from being able to cast a valid vote. This has the capacity to impinge upon the operation of Australia’s democracy. As I said earlier, if the changes the government forced through with its previous bill had been in place during the last election, up to 80,000 Australians might have been unable to enrol to vote and up to 280,000 Australians could have been affected by a substantial fault in their enrolment.
I want to make some comments about the position that the AEC has taken in relation to the new measures concerning early closure of the rolls. The AEC chose to support these changes, which contrasts with the position that previous electoral commissioners have held over the last decade. In response to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2004 election, the electoral commentator Antony Green stated:
If suddenly the election is called two or three months early, people will not have regularised their enrolment. You will cut young people off, as the numbers show ...
On previous occasions when these sorts of proposals were put forward by this government, they were rejected by the commission. Previous commissioners have indicated that this approach was not a good idea for Australian democracy. Among the concerns expressed by previous commissioners are the concerns that the Labor Party raised in relation to the specific amendments, and many independent experts have voiced similar views. However, the current electoral commissioner has clearly changed his view and has made that clear to the parliament.
Labor remain extremely concerned about the approach the government took in its previous legislation. Figures in the AEC annual report showed that, for the first time in nearly a decade, the total enrolment in the Australian electoral system actually went down. I understand that, at recent Senate estimates, the commission indicated there was some concern about what that meant. Labor are concerned as to how well the commission will be able to administer the electoral roll, given that there is clear evidence of real problems with the current system. The issue remains a great concern and there are still states and territories where roll numbers are declining.
As I indicated earlier, other changes pushed through by the Howard government include much stricter identity requirements for enrolment. The new requirements will make it harder for people to enrol and harder for people to be able to cast a valid vote. We can see that from the requirement for provisional voters to provide identification on election day. This is despite the fact that the government has acknowledged, and ministers have repeatedly acknowledged, that there is not an issue with fraud within the Australian electoral system.
Unlike the previous legislation, the bill before the chamber makes the vote more accessible to a number of Australians. It is unfortunate that it comes on the back of legislation which made the vote less accessible for a number of Australians, particularly those whose enrolment details have changed and young people, who often do not enrol or update their details until an election is called.
This legislation can be described as a small step forward, but it is a small step forward after the massive leap backwards that occurred with the legislation that the government pushed through in 2006. As I said at the outset, Labor are supporting this legislation. We do remain extremely concerned about the way in which the government treated electoral matters in its previous legislation. We have already stated that we believe the government put forward its previous changes with a clear view about how they might benefit it in a partisan sense.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-02-26,"—The Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 is the government’s second legislative response to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2004 federal election and matters related thereto, which came out in September 2005. I have some knowledge of this. The committee was established in 1983 and I have been a member continuously for about 11 years, so I am probably coming close to being the longest continuously serving member of that committee.
This committee really extracted its digit on this inquiry. Previously the committee had considered that a three-year electoral cycle did not necessitate quick reporting, but on this 2004 election report the committee thought there was a need to report quickly to give the government and the Australian Electoral Commission as much time as possible to respond and introduce legislation. It is a signal, really, of a broader problem that we face in the parliament. The committee reported in September 2005; 17 months later we are debating a bill which deals with non-contentious, unanimous recommendations. It does take an awfully long time to get these matters considered and passed by parliament.
However, here we are with this bill before us. This is a far better bill, I might say, than the regressive measures passed last year in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill. That was simply a very bad bill. I noticed that, although Labor opposed that bill—I will use them as an example—the number of donations declared by the Western Australian Labor Party diminished from 40, 50 or 60 in the six months to report under the old system to about five or six under the new system. What has happened is that this government has ended the disclosure and transparency that we enjoyed under the previous system. I emphasise that that bill was opposed by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens.
The provisions of this particular bill were referred for inquiry to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which has provided a unanimous report. The bill seeks to provide a trial of electronically assisted voting for sight-impaired people and a remote electronic voting trial for Australian Defence Force members and Defence civilians serving outside Australia. It allows ADF members and Federal Police personnel outside Australia and eligible overseas voters to apply for registration as postal voters. It provides that the deadline for postal vote applications is to be 6 pm on the Thursday prior to polling day. It amends arrangements for the delivery of postal voting material by the Australian Electoral Commission and expands the range of AEC officers who can receive postal vote envelopes. The bill amends the requirements for the establishment of pre-poll voting centres so that they can be quickly established by the AEC in special circumstances. The bill amends provisions relating to enrolment from outside Australia to allow applicants the option of providing an Australian passport number rather than a current drivers licence number, as under the current proof of identity scheme. The bill repeals the section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act relating to defamation of electoral candidates because defamation is covered in the general law.
That last item is a signal of much that is right with the committee system. A particular individual, Mr W Bowe, made a submission to the committee. He had been subject to litigation under section 350, the defamation section, as a website publisher. He maintained that the legislation was anachronistic in a modern communications environment and recommended it be removed from the Electoral Act. There were others who took an interest in this matter, such as Professor Quiggin, but the fact is that the committee listened to Mr Bowe with great attention. Section 12.44 of the report says:
Senator Andrew Murray also supported the removal of the section, or its amendment to include a clause making it clear that defamatory material had significantly affected the outcome of an election. This might facilitate prosecution of defamatory political comment on the internet through the Court of Disputed Returns, which handles allegations of corruption of the electoral process.
The committee had to consider this: you either remove the defamation section altogether and give it to the general law, and the general law covers criminal actions and penalties for defamation, or you strengthen it. We decided on the former and the government has agreed with us. That is, if you like, a sign of the committee process working well and unanimously for an outcome.
In contrast to what was ironically framed as the electoral integrity bill, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill. We welcome it because it has the effect of actually enfranchising voters and takes the machinery of the electoral process forward. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill passed last year had the reverse effect: it disenfranchised voters. Amongst other things, it targeted those who are least able to defend themselves. It took away the democratic right to vote from all those serving a term of imprisonment. My belief is that, if you want to give judges the power to apply jail as a penalty, you can. But to take away one of the rights of a citizen because they have been incarcerated is a double penalty and it is contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The electoral integrity bill also had the effect of disenfranchising more voters through closing the electoral rolls on the day the election writs are issued, so a 66-year-old working system was done away with. No longer will 18-year-olds and those wishing to register or change their registration details have seven days to do so. Arguably again, the hundreds of thousands possibly affected were thought by the coalition to most likely vote for Labor or minor parties. I do not think it was an integrity issue at all; I think it was a partisan political issue.
However, this new bill establishes a framework for two electronic voting trials at the coming federal election. One will allow for visually impaired people to cast a secret ballot and the second, as I have said, will allow Australian Defence Force personnel and Defence civilians serving overseas to cast an electronic vote. Those trials are a forward step for our democracy. However, the trial will only be available for the visually impaired at 30 locations across the whole of Australia. This does not accord with the standing committee’s recommendation that such centres should be available in each electorate. I accept that this is a trial and, if successful—and I cannot see why it should not be—I hope that the trial will see this process established in all electorates. I trust that it will be resourced sufficiently to achieve that aim, because true equality requires that such a service be made available to other electors in need of such facilities.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission stated in its submission to the inquiry on the bill that it supported the bill but would like to see electronic voting made available to other similarly disabled electors, and quite rightly so. In this respect, HREOC referred to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory. It was pointed out that, apart from the right to vote in genuine periodic elections by secret ballot, the covenant also obliges political parties to adopt measures where required to give effect to these rights without discrimination of any kind. This of course obliges governments as well. Again, I trust that future governments—indeed, I encourage future governments to—will facilitate further the universal right of all our citizens to cast a secret ballot.
The second electronic trial for Australian Defence Force personnel overseas is an excellent move. Those women and men serving overseas, often away from their families, deserve every possible facility to enable them to cast a vote.
The other technical provisions of the bill relate to deadlines of postal voting applications and the manner in which postal voting materials and votes are managed. It is envisaged that these measures will provide greater flexibility and options for the return of postal votes in time for inclusion in the count.
Also provided, in accordance with proof of identity requirements introduced in June of last year, are amendments that will allow those enrolling to vote from outside Australia to provide an Australian passport number rather than a current drivers licence number.
As the bill reflects unanimous recommendations, we obviously support it. It will have acceptance in the community. On that point, I would like now to urge that the Commonwealth government examine further reforms to the Commonwealth Electoral Act arising from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. There are many areas that they can look at, but there is an area I would like to look at arising from my supplementary remarks to the JSCEM report. It is something I have pushed for many years and I think it will have considerable consequences for our democracy. What prompts me to raise the issue in this way is what has been happening in my home state of Western Australia, now known as ‘Burke’s backyard’. Former Labor Premier Brian Burke has been up to his antics again. One would have hoped that both Mr Burke and Western Australia would have learnt something from the consequences of the WA Inc. saga.
It seems that his lucrative lobbying business has been booming and he and others are now under investigation by the WA Corruption and Crime Commission concerning underhand tactics to get up some controversial development deals for his clients. There are allegations of the handing over of undisclosed funds from developers to bribe government officials. For example, the general manager of property developer Australands’s WA division admitted in evidence that, in concert with Mr Burke, an independent interest group was used as a vehicle for advancing partisan commercial interests. Allegedly, such funds were used to finance the re-election campaign of a pro-development mayor. Mr Burke is also alleged to have been instrumental in securing other development deals that also appear to have campaign funds linked to them for some individuals.
Evidence has been tendered that the principles of cabinet government are under threat through ministers being named as sources of confidential cabinet information for Mr Burke and his clients. Former WA Minister for Small Business Norm Marlborough, apparently under evidence, was exposed as giving regular cabinet updates to his longstanding friend Mr Burke. He was quite rightly sacked by Mr Carpenter, the current Premier, for doing so. That does not seem to have mattered, as Mr Burke still claims to have his plants in cabinet. Another two ministers have been nominated but not named in this process.
The reason I raise this in the context of the electoral bill is that these are the sorts of issues that I raised in my supplementary remarks to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the 2004 federal election. They concern issues of political governance. If the government is going to respond to that report, I think it should have a look at what I had to say, because the problem with the media coverage of the Burke issue right now in WA is that they are awfully excited about the scandal and the revelations, and are enjoying no end the scalps that are found in the process. But when it is all over, we have to remember that firing a few ministers will not solve the problem. We also have to remember that the vast majority of Labor members and Labor parliamentarians do not support this activity either, and they need to be given a leg-up in solving these problems and ensuring they do not recur. That can only happen legislatively.
I strongly urge that donations from developers, which are much loved by all levels of government, be banned. They threaten the very integrity of our political system. They are the subject of crime and corruption commissions in every state. I recall former Prime Minister Paul Keating just last year calling for their banning. Sadly, it is the case that our democracy will continue to encourage corruption and undue influence for as long as donations like that are permitted. Of course, it is made worse by the passing last year of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill, whereby secret donations can now be made in multiple tranches provided they are under $10,000. So, roll on donors, your money will buy you access and influence, and there are so many ways you can donate handsomely and anonymously.
If ever the day arises where strings attached to donations are prohibited, as they are in some democracies, it will be a time for us to celebrate an advance in our Australian democracy. The details of my arguments are in my supplementary remarks to the joint standing committee’s report but, essentially, I urge Premier Carpenter to put accountability, integrity and transparency front and centre for the government in Western Australia. I urge him to introduce political governance, which would mean that political parties are at least subject to the public accountability regime that applies to listed corporations and unions. At present they have less transparency than a local sports club.
The following are the minimum standards the media and the public should be demanding from Mr Carpenter. There should be a ban on donations from developers to political parties in local and state government, and of course in federal government. There should be stiff penalties for any donations with strings attached. Professional fundraising should be subject to the same disclosure rules applying to donations. Political parties should disclose who lies behind donations from trusts, foundations or clubs, or return the money. Donations or loans from foreign overseas individuals or overseas entities should be banned. Labor should be given back to the members by applying one vote, one value to the Labor Party to stop union bosses elected by non-Labor members deciding who Labor’s candidates will be. And political parties should produce an annual public report that fully details their financial statements, sources of their income and what it is spent on. A very wide range of individuals and organisations have called for a clampdown or banning of donations from developers. These sorts of donations threaten the integrity of our political system at every level.
My message to the media is that, whilst you and your readers may find the scandal enlightening and the heads that roll may be satisfying, in the end we have to fix the problem. Many, many Labor parliamentarians and many, many Labor members want to see this sort of slur on their party put away and not repeated. The only way to do that is to improve the standards of political governance, and the only way to do that is for Mr Carpenter to act and for the coalition government to act to improve the nature of the accountability mechanisms applying through the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which it has failed to do.
While I welcome this machinery bill, whilst I deplore its predecessor which passed in June 2006, I think the most important issue that we still face is getting political governance in this country up to the same speed as corporate governance and applying the same standards of accountability to our own political parties that we demand from corporations and unions. We would be much better for it.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. While Labor supports this particular bill, it would be remiss of me if I failed to point out the government’s protracted history of trying to disenfranchise many Australians when it comes to the electoral roll and related matters. This statement is not made lightly. I refer to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006 as evidence supporting it—a bill that Labor did not support; another bill that this government used its Senate majority to get through this parliament last year; a bill that introduced some regressive measures which will have a detrimental impact on the Australian electoral system.
However, the bill before us today contains some of the reasonable measures that stem from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on its inquiry into the conduct of the 2004 federal election and related matters. The legislation amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum Act 1984 and follows some reform measures introduced by the government in the controversial electoral and referendum amendment act to which I have already referred.
The bill we have before us contains provisions that will provide for a trial of electronically assisted voting for sight-impaired people; provide for a trial of remote electronic voting for Australian Defence Force members and Defence civilians serving outside Australia; specifically enable members of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police personnel serving outside Australia and persons registered as eligible overseas electors to apply for registration as general postal voters; and provide that the deadline for postal vote applications is 6 pm on the Thursday prior to polling day. The Australian Electoral Commission will not be required to post or deliver postal voting material to those electors whose postal vote applications are received after that. The Australian Electoral Commission will be required to make reasonable efforts to contact applicants whose postal vote applications are received after the deadline to advise them of the need to vote by other means.
The bill will also amend arrangements for the delivery of postal voting materials by the AEC, expand the range of AEC officers who can receive completed postal vote envelopes and amend the requirements for the establishment of pre-poll voting centres to enable them to be quickly established by the Australian Electoral Commission in exceptional circumstances. It will amend provisions relating to enrolment from outside Australia to allow applicants the option of providing an Australian passport number, rather than a current drivers licence number, to satisfy the requirements of the proof of identity scheme established by the electoral integrity act. And it will repeal section 350 of the Electoral Act, which relates to defamation of electoral candidates.
While I will not speak today on all of the provisions, I will take the opportunity to speak about the importance of several provisions which form this legislation. In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the Commonwealth Electoral Act will be amended to specifically permit Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police personnel who are serving overseas to become general postal voters. Serving members deployed outside Australia will automatically be sent ballot papers for an election, without having to submit a postal vote application.
In addition, for the sight impaired, the legislation will provide provisions to trial electronic voting. A similar trial was conducted during the Victorian state election and, by all reports—certainly from the Victorian Electoral Commission—it was an overwhelming success. I point out that its success in the 2006 Victorian election was noted as being due to the accuracy of the system; however, I understand that they were disappointed with the number of people who engaged in the trial. This was attributed to a large proportion of sight-impaired people being elderly, and many being apprehensive about embracing the new technology. I understand from the Victorian Electoral Commission that a report due to be tabled in the Victorian parliament in May of this year will give us a formal assessment of how the trial went. It will be interesting to draw comparisons between the data from the Victorian election and the data from the federal election to be held later this year.
It is, however, unfortunate that the positive steps outlined in this bill are significantly overshadowed by the previous bill that made changes to the Electoral Act—legislation that without question has disenfranchised thousands of potential voters, thousands of Australian citizens. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 was an attack on the democratic process, and the government should stand condemned for it.
The Howard government has a lengthy history of trying to disenfranchise a broad cross-section of the population when it comes to voting. People with limited levels of education, people from a non-English-speaking background, young people and Indigenous Australians have all been the target of this government. That highly contentious piece of legislation will make it harder for people to enrol by making identity checks more complex. It will also make provisional voting far more difficult. This in particular is a controversial move—controversial because at the last federal election approximately 180,000 Australians cast provisional votes. Under the changes, the government is going to force those casting a provisional vote to provide additional proof of identity. They have always had to prove their identity but now they need additional proof. If they cannot do so, their vote will not count—tens of thousands of potential votes that will not count.
In addition, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006 narrowed the time gap for new enrollees wanting to get on the electoral roll. Again, the number of people that this may affect is significant. Eighty thousand people might not have been able to enrol in the last election if these laws had been in place at that time. Those on the roll will be given only three days to correct their details after the writs are issued for the forthcoming election. Indications are that up to 280,000 people could be affected by having a substantial fault in their enrolment.
In October last year, during Senate supplementary estimates, the Australian Electoral Commission admitted that they were very concerned about the fact that the electoral roll had dropped for the first time in a decade. The electoral roll figure at 30 June 2006 was down by 32,000 from the previous year. This was in direct contrast to the previous seven years, where the roll had increased by between 76,000 and 100,000 each year.
These figures are not due to the legislation we saw introduced in June last year. However, they are significant in this debate. If the roll is already in decline and the government has made it even more difficult to get on the roll, it is difficult to see how the numbers will start to go up to levels that accurately reflect eligibility.
Labor is all for ensuring that the electoral roll is accurate and that it is not abused. It has led the way when it comes to reform in this particular area, to make the electoral process fair and accessible. In the 1980s, Labor was responsible for the establishment of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, now known as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—the very committee that recommended the changes that we are now discussing in the bill before us. As my colleague Senator Ray pointed out during the debate last year, it was Labor who brought in disclosure of donations. It was opposed by those opposite because they did not—and they still do not—want the voting public to know who donates to their campaigns. There are many more examples of Labor enhancing the democratic process with electoral reform which I will not go into today. Suffice it to say that Labor stands as the principal party of positive electoral reform.
Voting is a rite of passage for those in a democratic society. The system and the process that oversees this should be nurtured and be given every opportunity to thrive. Labor welcomes the vast majority of the measures in this bill, the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. They are positive reforms that arise from the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
It is unfortunate that these relatively small changes are standing in the huge shadow cast last year by the changes brought in by the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006—changes that will make it harder to cast a vote, harder to enrol to vote and harder to ensure that a vote is actually counted. The Electoral and Referendum Legislation Bill 2006 before us today makes some steps forward but, sadly, they follow a monumental leap backwards.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This bill is the second set of measures put before this chamber which seeks to make changes to the electoral system. The first set of measures introduced were regressive measures that limited the franchise by closing electoral rolls early, making it harder to enrol and raising the financial disclosure limit from $1,500 to $10,000, linked to the CPI. Increasingly, there is the capacity for donations to be made in secret—provisions rammed through parliament for base partisan political gain. This government was intent on and, I believe, accomplished its aim of making it harder to vote and easier to donate.
This bill, however—the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006—introduces provisions which the Labor Party supports. The provisions in the bill arise from the government’s response to the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 2004 federal election.
The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry and report by 20 February 2007. The committee received three submissions: from the Australian Electoral Commission, basically on the way the provisions will be implemented and operate; from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; and from the Department of Defence.
The bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, seeks to do six things. The first is introduce a limited form of electronic voting which will provide for a trial of electronically assisted voting for sight-impaired people and provide for a trial of remote electronic voting for Australian Defence Force members and Defence civilians serving outside Australia. The second is to make changes to the general postal voter registry. Specifically, it will enable members of the ADF and Australian Federal Police personnel serving outside Australia, and persons registered as eligible overseas electors, to apply for registration as general postal voters. The third is to make various changes to postal votes—specifically, to provide that the deadline for postal vote applications is 6 pm on the Thursday prior to polling day, to amend arrangements for the delivery of postal voting material by the AEC and to expand the range of AEC officers who can receive completed postal vote envelopes. The fourth is to change pre-poll arrangements by amending the requirements for the establishment of pre-poll voting centres to enable them to be quickly established by the AEC in exceptional circumstances. The fifth is to make changes to enrolments from outside Australia by amending provisions relating to enrolments from outside Australia to allow applicants the option of providing an Australian passport number rather than a current drivers licence number. The sixth is to repeal section 350 of the Electoral Act which relates to defamation of electoral candidates.
The submissions received were supportive of the provisions of the bill. The committee’s recommendation was that the Senate pass the bill.
I would like to touch on a number of elements of the bill in greater detail. Firstly, I would like to address the issue of electronic voting. In terms of electronic voting, the HREOC submission urged that:
… the Committee support the passage of the Bill; and support an extension of provision for electronic or electronically assisted voting at the earliest opportunity to include other people unable because of disability to complete a paper ballot independently and secretly.
The Committee took the view that:
… electronic assisted voting should be extended to electors requiring this facility to enable them to exercise the right to a secret ballot, provided trialling of this system proves to be successful.
The AEC outlined the operation of the proposed trials as follows:
The trial for sight-impaired people will require the AEC to develop an electronically assisted voting method that will produce a printed record of each vote cast.
… the electronically assisted voting method is expected to be available at up to 30 locations around Australia. These locations will utilise pre-poll voting centres so that sight-impaired electors would have an extended opportunity to avail themselves of the electronically assisted voting method if they so choose. A sight-impaired elector will be able to cast an electronically assisted vote in the lead up to polling day or on polling day itself.
The trial for particular defence personnel serving outside Australia will require the AEC to develop a remote electronic voting method for that purpose. In order to make use of the remote electronic voting method, eligible ADF members and defence civilians would first be required to be registered with the AEC as Remote Electronic Voters. The AEC will be required by the Bill to produce a printed record of each electronic vote received by the AEC.
I look forward with interest to the results of the electronic voting trials. Any reforms that seek to enable voters to exercise their democratic right to vote in secret and to extend the franchise should be supported, and it is hoped that the trials are successful and can be rolled out extensively so that electronically assisted voting may include other people unable to complete a paper ballot in secret because of disability.
The proposals that I have outlined regarding changes to the general postal voting registry allow ADF and AFP personnel overseas to enrol to become general postal voters, which simply means that they will automatically be sent ballot papers without first having to request them—a straightforward and sensible amendment. The various changes made with regard to postal voting seek to change the postal vote deadline from the Friday before election day to the Thursday before election day, allowing the AEC more time to ensure that ballot papers reach electors in time for them to complete the papers on or before polling day. The Australian Electoral Commission will not be required to post or deliver postal voting material to those electors whose postal vote applications are received after that time. However, the AEC will be required to make reasonable efforts to contact applicants whose postal vote applications are received after the deadline to advise them of the need to vote by other means.
The amendments also seek to expand the range of AEC officers who can receive postal votes. The range will include electoral visitors at hospitals and prisons, mobile polling team leaders and office holders, and ongoing employees of the AEC. This expansion will provide voters more options and flexibility for returning postal votes.
These amendments are worth while and very welcome. As I said earlier, the trialling of electronic voting is indeed a very exciting initiative. However, this government took a very different position on the first round of measures introduced through the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006, debated in the Senate in June 2006. These changes were widely condemned by the Labor Party, community leaders and independent experts—and rightly so. Those changes, for the first time in Australian electoral history, wound back the franchise and attempted to hide from the public who is donating to political parties. By raising the financial disclosure threshold, you hide the dollars, and transparency is lost. You lose the essential checks and balances on the activities of political parties. It is a shameful measure that has been introduced to fill the coffers of the Liberal and National parties and hide the origin of the donations from public view.
Following the 2005-06 disclosure declarations by political parties, on 2 February 2007 the Herald Sun reported:
Overall direct political donations of $74 million for 2005-06 were well down on the $160 million that flooded the coffers of the major parties in the 2004-05 election year.
Well down—a difference of $86 million.
The closure of the rolls sooner after the writs is of great concern. It potentially disenfranchises voters and there is little benefit to be derived from making these changes other than, as I have said, for base political advantage. These changes were introduced despite the potential that existed for them to cause considerable damage to our democracy. We should remind ourselves that, whilst the provisions in this bill are supported and welcomed by the Labor Party, they by no means right the unfairness introduced by the provisions in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2006. I support the bill before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I too would like to comment on the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. I note that previous speakers have talked about its positive aspects. There are several very positive steps forward, particularly for those who are sight impaired. Technology is a wonderful thing, particularly when it is put to use to enhance people’s life experience and ability to participate in our democratic processes and to provide opportunities to improve people’s social inclusion. But today I would like to comment on some things we have had conversations with many members of the Canberra community about. These are the changes proposed in this bill with respect to closing the roll, the greater identity checks and the increased difficulty for people to get on the roll.
I think the real issue that needs to be understood here is that the Howard government has got real form on using laws such as the electoral laws for its own partisan benefit, and many of my colleagues have already made the comment that many of these laws are doing exactly that. We did some research here in the ACT, in my electorate, and found that under these new rules over 10,000 potential electors could have lost their right to vote in the electorates of Canberra and Fraser at the last election. That gives a sense of the magnitude of the change that is taking place. That is how many people needed to change their arrangements, or indeed get on the roll, post the issuing of the writs. I note that there is a three-day leeway, but it is still hard to say whether or not that will be enough time for people to update their addresses. I know that there would be a huge amount of work for the Electoral Commission to undertake and I know also that new enrollees would not be able to do that.
The thing about existing voters updating and changing their details and the increased identification checks that will be required just shows that it is about making it more onerous, particularly for young people. I think that the effort in this regard is to put up a higher barrier for people who are perhaps motivated to vote and to get on the electoral roll but not if the fence is put too high. I think that it is an effort to undermine what is an established principle, one that all but a few coalition people agree with: the principle of compulsory voting. We need to value that system; we do not need to make it harder for people to participate in it.
The other point that I would like to make about this approach is that when it comes to political donations the Labor Party believes that it is incredibly important to have the utmost transparency in the way political donations are made. I have often had this debate on the airwaves locally with my ACT Senate colleague, Senator Gary Humphries. A Liberal senator, Senator Humphries often says that he does not think there should be political donations at all to parties, and we have had a debate about that. My response is that we need to have political donations because that is part of how our system works, but we need to have them in the most open and transparent way possible. So I think that it is quite ironic that we are debating legislation that seeks to make it less transparent, yet my Liberal counterpart is arguing for no political donations at all. I think he has quite a bit to reconcile in his taking that position and his party putting forward this kind of legislation.
In moving about the Canberra community, we have paid particular attention to university campuses and to young people, because they are likely to be the most disenfranchised by the closing off of the roll and the issuing of the writs. At the show just last weekend here in Canberra we saw a number of young people come past the Labor Party stall. We had our enrolment forms there and we advised them that they ought to get on the roll if they are turning 18 because they will not have a chance to once they are prompted by the calling of an election. People are quite shocked when I explain the implications of this and what this government is doing. They feel that it is a trick, that they are being robbed of something potentially without due warning and without due opportunity to get themselves on the roll in the way that generations have before them. I guess that it is a salient reminder to people that you really cannot trust the Howard government.
We are supporting this bill because there is a lot that is good in it. But typically there are a few spiky bits the government insists on putting forward that I think will undermine our democratic processes into the future. This bill will serve as an ongoing reminder particularly to young people, I think, that they are right to be sceptical about the motivation of the Howard government on all matters electoral. They are right to assume in many cases that there is a partisan motivation behind its activities in legislating in this area and that this government will do all it can to be just a little bit tricky, a little bit sly, a little bit manipulative when it comes to enhancing its chances to win the next election.
Labor are not going to stand for that. We will show the government up when it is necessary and when there is something going on that is not fair in Australian society. Whilst ever they have the numbers in this place—and in fact the majority in both houses of parliament—all we have are our words, and the government can do what they like in terms of legislation. So Labor will continue to remind people throughout this election year that they do need to get on the electoral roll before the election is called. They do need to check their enrolment details if they have had a change of address. We know that the system of the Electoral Commission in trying to notify people or check to see whether people are on the roll if they do not get their returns is flawed and that people are being struck off the roll. We know that there are fewer people on the roll than there were previously and that there has been a far greater drop in the number of people enrolled than previously. All of these things point to something a little bit wrong with the system, a system that is specially designed for Australians by the Howard government. Labor will keep on being diligent. We will be reminding people of the antics of the manipulative government and we look forward to the next election when, hopefully, people will not be disenfranchised, because they have got the message that they need to get on the electoral roll early.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-02-26,"—It is certainly a pleasure to follow Senator Lundy and that very thoughtful contribution to the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, which we are debating this evening. An interesting aspect of this bill is that provisions in the bill make it easier for people to participate in our democracy. That is quite in contrast to the shenanigans that this government got up to in the bill they put through last year. It has been highlighted by my colleagues that the provisions in this bill do make it much easier for people who are sight-impaired or members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police to participate in our democratic processes. The government is to be commended for that.
As I said earlier, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, it is in stark contrast to what the government—your government—put through late last year in amendments to the electoral laws that we have operated under for some years. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that one of the significant changes that was effected by last year’s bill was that when the election is called you only have that evening to enrol. The other significant change to the previous laws was that you previously had seven days to change your enrolment; under the new laws you only have three. The two significant issues that have come out of those changes are, firstly, if you are a new enrollee you have only until the evening of the day of the election being called to get on the electoral roll; and, secondly, if you are trying to change your enrolment you have only three days whereas previously you had seven.
I do not know what goes through the minds of the members of the government in relation to their concern about these new enrollees. I can only talk from my own experience. I understand that 80,000 people enrol in that week’s grace that they have to enrol. One would think that the government have it in mind that there are all these Labor supporters out there sitting around on some bench or collecting their Centrelink payments or something like that who just somehow or another get motivated in that last week before they have to vote to go and put themselves on the roll so they can vote Labor.
I would say that the people who do not have the opportunity to go and get on the roll are independent contractors, tradesmen and people who work in the cities and commute. They are people who might once have been called Howard’s battlers. They are the people who, in my city of Sydney, live on the fringes of the city. They are people who live in seats that are located almost exclusively in an arc from Wyong right around Sydney to Sutherland. I would suggest that those people have not been voting for us since 1993; yet by your actions in the bill that was passed last year those people will become disenfranchised under this legislation. I would think that the people whom we think might vote for us—maybe the unemployed, people who are not working, people who are housebound and students—have plenty of opportunity to enrol. They can walk down the high street in Penrith any time and get on the electoral roll. It is those people who are working who will not have the opportunity. It may well be that you have outsmarted yourselves and disenfranchised a number of coalition voters. Good luck!
We know that the changes that occurred last year will disenfranchise up to 80,000 people. We know that at least up to one-quarter of a million people change their enrolment. Perhaps the minister, in reply, will clarify this: if people are at one address and they have not re-enrolled at another and they go and vote at the old address, is that improper? Is that illegal? Maybe that could be answered in the minister’s contribution at the end.
I am also very concerned about the need for people to present evidence that they are who they say they are. We have not had that before. In my last contribution in the last session of parliament I mentioned a seminar that I addressed with a director of the Exodus Foundation, Michael Crews. Michael Crews was speaking about the difficulties of the people whom their foundation assists in Ashfield. One thing he mentioned, which was quite astounding to me and I was not aware of it, is that some 100 of their clients—I think that is the term Michael uses for the people who seek their assistance—do not have birth certificates. They do not have birth certificates because they were never registered at birth. The Exodus Foundation is constantly going to Centrelink and other government bodies arguing on behalf of these men and women who have not been registered at birth. They have the difficulty that they are never going have a birth certificate because they do not have one! Where are they in this hodgepodge of changes that have occurred? I am not exactly sure. Hopefully, those men and women have got the assistance they need to be sorted out in that regard. But it is not just those men and women that seek the assistance of organisations like the Exodus Foundation. I am sure there are a number of our Indigenous people who may not have ever been registered at birth because it was not the custom of the tribe or the system in which they were born. So there are difficulties in the legislation.
But what seems to me to be the overriding obsession of the government in the introduction of the bill is the fact that they think the Labor Party are out there massively trying to rort the electoral system. To my knowledge, in the last two decades, there has been only one inquiry that has mentioned electoral rorting—that is, the Shepherdson inquiry in Queensland. I had the opportunity this afternoon to have a look at the outcome of that inquiry and the people and the issues involved. One would think the obsession of the government is, as I suggested, that there is a Labor rorting unit out there somewhere that operates by going from seat to seat with hundreds, no thousands, of men and women who they falsely enrol. You would think that that is what it is about—not only is it about enrolling for the potential to vote in elections, as the Shepherdson inquiry exposed, but it is about being involved in internal Labor Party ballots.
I went through and counted how many people seemed to be involved in this massive rorting operation that was conducted in Queensland. I do not think there were more than 150 people involved, and they were mainly involved in internal Labor Party ballots. I am suggesting that there is not this great army out there that is trying to rort the electoral system. It just cannot be done and, in fact, the result clearly is that if you are going to have an operation like that, you need a lot of people to shut their mouths. Clearly, the Shepherdson inquiry was as a result of people who did not shut their mouths. As a result of that, I think, one woman went to jail, three MPs resigned, and I cannot recall whether the government lost in that period or was in a lot of trouble for a while, but in the end the electoral processes were sustained. The inquiry pointed the finger at the people who needed to be put on the spot, and the transparency was maintained.
I do not think that the reasons behind the changes to enrolment which occurred last year are at all justifiable. In fact, all I think they are going to end up doing is making sure that 80,000 people do not get to vote, and that up to a quarter of a million people are going to vote in seats they do not live in anymore, so they will not be voting for the person who represents them. I think this is a reflection of the obsession by the government with what is quite an honest and honourable electoral system and the electoral officers who conduct our elections for us.
I am not sure where we will end up with these seemingly constant attacks on the system by the federal government. I wonder whether or not, in their cups, when they really think about the sort of system they would like, they would like to go back to the 19th century when we had a property franchise where only males could vote. I am sure that in their cups in the dining rooms, where they all sit around and think about the conspiracies that we are up to, in the end that is really what they would like: to go back to males only and a property franchise.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. The Labor Party, as has been said in this place already, will support the bill because parts of it do allow a few more people to be able to vote and it does ensure, very importantly, that Australian Defence Force personnel serving overseas and sight-impaired people will find it easier to cast their votes. Giving Australian Defence Force personnel the ability to cast their vote electronically is a terrific idea and it is to be welcomed.
As has been noted elsewhere, the provisions in this package do have some deficiencies but, on balance, the whole package, as has been said previously, does take us forward at least a short distance compared to the draconian disenfranchising measures found in the last tranche of changes to this legislation that were considered in this place. The provisions around voting for the visually impaired are to be welcomed. I would note, though, that, sadly, these facilities will be limited to only 30 centres. The legislation does not follow the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the facilities should be in each and every electorate, not just in 30. These measures are there to help people who are disadvantaged and who have particular problems. They are there to assist them to place their vote and, importantly, to get it right, unlike the previous amendments to the act.
Remote communities, including Indigenous communities, need to be assisted, and you do not get more remote than some of the communities I represent in the great state of Western Australia. I am talking about not only remote Indigenous communities but also remote mining communities where workers are often employed on a fly-in fly-out basis. Will their enrolment be up to date? Will they be disenfranchised by the earlier measures taken by the Howard government? The proof will emerge at election time, but already some noted experts on electoral matters have condemned this government for the measures already taken and what they will do to take the franchise away from what they predict will be a very large number of people.
I commend the government for the provisions in relation to Defence personnel and people who are visually impaired, but I wonder why this government is so paranoid about people voting in the first place. Closing the electoral roll for most new enrollees on the day the writs are issued for the election will prevent people from enrolling, and only giving existing voters three days to get their details up to date will knock people off the roll. I would suggest this government is worried that these people will vote Labor, and heaven forbid they vote Labor. Why might they vote Labor if this government gives them the opportunity to vote at all later this year? I can tell honourable senators opposite that there are plenty of reasons and the list gets longer every day. I will start with Iraq. When the Howard government committed troops to the invasion of Iraq, we were all promised that our military commitment would be for a matter of months, not years. I will repeat that for honourable senators opposite: a matter of months not years. How wrong was that?
Recent debate has shown only too clearly how confused the Howard government is in terms of the messages it is now conveying about our commitment to, sadly, that quagmire of five years. While the Prime Minister says that we shall stay until final victory, or words to that effect, the Minister for Defence is saying there can be no victory in Iraq. If it were not so deadly serious for the Iraqi people and coalition troops, it would be funny. Instead, it is an ever-growing tragedy. Rather than making this country safer in terms of the threat presented by international terrorism, the policies pursued by this government and this Prime Minister have done the opposite.
We also have the Vice President of the United States saying that withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq—which, I might add, is Labor’s policy—to better fight the war in terror in our region would not put at risk Australia’s relationship with our most powerful ally. Fancy him saying that—stealing Mr Rudd’s lines. Isn’t that amazing? He has obviously been reading the papers. Well done to Mr Cheney. It is a shame that the Prime Minister has not been reading the same papers. This further undermined the Prime Minister’s argument that redeploying our battle group in Iraq would somehow threaten that important relationship. The Vice President, figuratively speaking, blew the Prime Minister out of the water. It is no wonder this government does not want too many people on the electoral roll if their intention is to vote against our involvement in the war in Iraq.
Another reason this government has for worrying that there might be a lot of disgruntled voters on the rolls is housing affordability. In the capital city of the state I represent in this chamber, young people are finding it even harder to find the money to afford their own home. We have had four interest rate rises from the Pinocchio nose from Bennelong. You know the little Pinocchio from Bennelong—you have seen the ads. Every time there is an interest rate rise, zoonk, out goes the proboscis another inch. Yes, they are finding it very hard. We have had four interest rate rises since the last election, and yet the Reserve Bank of Australia warned only last week that it would not hesitate to adjust interest rates again, election year or not, and that the direction in which interest rates were likely to go at this stage was up—not down; up again. This is because, as my colleague the member for Lilley, Mr Swan, has said, the Howard government has failed to come to grips with inflation. In fact—honourable senators opposite, through you Mr Acting Deputy President, listen to what I am going to say—only last week we had the Treasurer refusing to deny that he had made statements to the effect that it would not be such a bad thing if the economy faltered so that voters become, listen to this, a bit more worried about future.
I would also like to remind honourable senators opposite that on 12 February Glenn Milne, once upon a time one of the government’s more sympathetic journalists, wrote in the Australian:
Peter Costello is telling anyone who will listen, behind the back of his hand, that it might not be such a bad thing if the economy hits a few bumps. In the Treasurer’s eyes such a scenario would put some voter apprehension back into the election mix ...
The Treasurer was twice asked directly if he had made any such statements and twice refused to deny making such statements. It is simply extraordinary that the Treasurer of Australia hopes that the Australian economy falters—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. It might be pertinent that you draw the honourable senator’s attention to the piece of legislation we are actually debating. The public’s voting intentions might be of interest to him, but we are in fact debating the Electoral and Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill.
 (Senator Ferguson)—I get the drift of your point of order. Second reading debates have normally been far-reaching. The senator is not out of order, but I would remind him of the subject matter before the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is about relevance, but I do appreciate your comments. As I was saying before I was interrupted, it is simply extraordinary that the Treasurer of Australia hopes that the Australian economy falters so as to boost the electoral prospects of the coalition and his own leadership campaign against the Prime Minister and the PM-in-waiting, the member for Wentworth. It is only too obvious that the Treasurer is more interested in his own ambitions than in the health of the Australian economy and the wellbeing of Australian families. I would suggest that he has his eye on the Prime Minister’s job and not on the best interests of the Australian economy.
Another reason this government may not want too many of what they consider the wrong sort of people voting at the upcoming election is the burning issue of climate change. The Prime Minister and his government have been dragged kicking and screaming to the realisation that a large majority of the Australian public is deeply concerned with the issue of climate change, and this terrible drought is linked to the issue in their minds, even if the Prime Minister cannot bring himself to link the two.
We on this side, though, are deeply engaged with the issue. On the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition released Labor’s national clean coal initiative to reduce greenhouse and, importantly, to secure jobs in the coal industry. As we know, coal is an important part of our economy and Australia is the world’s largest coal exporter. The initiatives include setting up a national clean coal initiative to place Australia’s coal industry and exports on a sure international footing, and establishing a national clean coal fund, working in partnership with the private sector. Federal Labor will also increase funding for the CSIRO by no less than $25 million over four years. This will strengthen its leadership role in the research and development of clean coal technologies. This is about ensuring that we have a strong and long-term coal industry and working in partnership with state governments and the coal sector.
Labor’s national clean coal initiative is an important element in Labor’s comprehensive approach to dealing with the threats and opportunities of climate change. This approach includes immediately ratifying the Kyoto protocol; cutting Australia’s greenhouse pollution by no less than 60 per cent by 2050; setting up a national emission trading scheme; substantially increasing the mandatory renewable energy target; and convening a national climate change summit in Canberra in late March or early April 2007, which if I remember rightly, I am sure the Prime Minister was invited to attend by Mr Rudd.
Federal Labor will be making further announcements on energy renewables and other energy sources in the coming months. We will also be seeking further input from the business and science communities on this very important initiative. This is what Labor will do, and it is no wonder voters are attracted to such policies and initiatives. It is also no wonder that this government is intent on taking the franchise away from people who might be attracted to Labor policies like these, because where is the Howard government on issues like climate change? Behind the play, that is where they are.
Only today we have observations like this one again from Mr Glenn Milne, writing in the Australian newspaper, at page 8. He says that the Business Council of Australia, under Michael Chaney’s leadership:
... was way out in front of the Government on the climate change issue. Howard is still catching up.
No wonder the government is worried, and no wonder they are worried about people who they consider to be the wrong people having a vote come election time. That is because this is a government that, after 11 long years, is becoming increasingly tired, out of puff and out of touch. This is a government whose senior members, no less, are increasingly concerned about their own futures, rather than the future they can help to provide for the people of Australia.
In summing up, this is a government that, despite the Prime Minister’s power walks, is really running out of steam. It is little wonder that, despite the minor positive measures contained in this bill, this government gives every appearance of doing everything it can to make it as hard as possible for people who it considers will vote against it to vote at all.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-02-26,"—I was going to thank honourable senators for their contributions to the bill—
—You still can.
—and I will, but I will note that it was extremely disappointing that they did not largely address the legislation that we are debating here today.
—I didn’t talk about AWAs. I didn’t get around to that.
—I am sure that you would have had a crack at anything, Senator Sterle. In fact, Senator Sterle is Labor’s junior attack puppy here in the Senate. He had a very broad-ranging discussion which, as I said, very rarely even reflected on the legislation that we are talking about, which makes some very positive contributions to the Electoral Act. Interestingly, considering the debate that we have heard here this evening, the report was unanimously supported by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration following its recent inquiry. That actually makes the contributions that have been made to this debate somewhat more amusing. I do not think it is really worth chasing all of those comments down, but it really was an object in retrospectivity that Labor was playing through the debate.
This bill is the second part of government’s response to recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2004 federal election. I would like to thank the chairman and members of that committee for the comprehensive inquiry and the report. The measures in this bill build upon the electoral reform measures passed by the parliament in June 2006 and will improve the participation in our democratic process. The major provisions in the bill relate to electronic voting trials, improvements to voting arrangements and proof of identity requirements for Australians enrolling from overseas.
The electronic voting trials are significant, as they will be the first conducted for a federal election. The trial for blind or vision-impaired people has been extremely well received. The trial will allow these people to cast an independent secret ballot for the first time at a federal election. This will be done through the use of electronically assisted voting machines. The trial will be conducted in up to 30 prepoll voting centres across Australia. The Electoral Commission is working very closely with organisations such as Vision Australia to ensure that the locations are known to people with this disability so that the participation in the trial can be maximised. If the trial proves to be successful, the government will consider expanding the number of locations at the 2010 election.
The second trial will allow Australian Defence Force personnel serving outside Australia to cast a vote electronically. This trial will overcome the many difficulties associated with voting options for Defence Force personnel overseas and will allow them to vote in safety. It is estimated that approximately 1,500 Defence Force personnel who were overseas for the 2004 election missed out on having their say. This was about one-third of the Defence Force deployed overseas at that time. This trial will give Defence Force personnel serving overseas that important opportunity to have their say. The AEC is working in close cooperation with the Department of Defence on the technical issues associated with the trial. The government welcomes the defence department’s cooperation on this matter. As my colleague the Special Minister of State indicated during debate in the other place, the government will consider extending electronic voting to other personnel serving outside Australia if this trial is successful.
The government welcomes the support for these trials, and I would like to reassure the Senate that neither of these trials are precursors to electronic voting generally. Defence Force personnel who are overseas will also benefit from provisions in the bill for automatic registration as postal voters. This provision will also apply to Australian Federal Police personnel serving overseas and to eligible overseas voters. It will mean that they will be sent postal-voting material automatically once the election has been announced. Most importantly, they will not have to apply for their postal vote and therefore lose more time in waiting to receive the ballot paper. This will reduce any time delays associated with getting the postal vote out to them and the return of that vote.
Other improvements to postal-voting arrangements will enhance the prospects for people to receive postal-voting material in time to be able to return their postal vote for inclusion in the count. The AEC needs time to get the ballot paper back to people so that they can post it and have it postmarked in time to be an eligible vote. The measures will allow the AEC to assess the most practicable and reasonable means of delivering postal material to electors, taking into account postal delivery schedules and considering means other than postal delivery, including via courier.
The government is also concerned that many people who seek to vote as a postal voter miss out on voting because, while they may have lodged an application on time, the processing of that application, including the return posting of ballot papers, may not occur in time for the vote to be included in the count. Often a voter thinks that their vote has arrived in time when it has not.
This bill provides that the AEC will not be required to send postal voting material where applications are received after 6 pm on the Thursday before polling day. However, in this circumstance the AEC will be required to contact those people whose applications are received after this deadline and advise them of alternate voting options. These options will include casting a prepoll vote on the Friday or making arrangements to attend a polling booth on polling day. The AEC will do all that it can to contact these electors. This provision will ensure that these people have the best possible chance of having their vote counted.
The bill also expands on the list of AEC personnel who will be able to accept postal votes, thus providing greater flexibility and broader options for the return of postal votes in time for inclusion in the count. In addition to these legislative measures, the AEC will conduct an extensive advertising campaign to alert people to postal voting issues. As honourable senators will recall, legislation passed in June 2006 introduced proof of identity requirements for enrolment to strengthen the integrity of the electoral process. Regulations giving effect to these requirements are currently before parliament and will commence in April this year. The government has delayed commencement of the new requirements until after the New South Wales election. This follows a request by the New South Wales Premier to avoid confusion about enrolment requirements for state and federal jurisdictions.
This bill also introduces alternate proof of identity documentation that may be provided by Australians enrolling from overseas. These people will be able to provide their Australian passport number as an alternative to their drivers licence number. This is in recognition of the difficulty that they may have in meeting the new proof of identity requirements given their location outside Australia and lack of access to the documentation or the classes of electors required under the new scheme.
Other measures in the bill will allow the AEC to respond quickly to changing or unanticipated circumstances to establish prepoll voting centres without the need for prior gazettal, which could cause a delay in voting. The offence provisions for defamation of candidates will also be repealed. This will allow defamation cases to be dealt with in accordance with the existing defamation laws in the relevant state or territory jurisdiction. In closing, I reiterate to the Senate that the measures in this bill are important and will provide a greater scope for people to participate in the democratic process, and this is definitely a good thing. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-02-26,"—I wish to speak to the second reading of the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This bill increases by $112.6 million the funding appropriated under section 18(4) of the act. The opposition supports in principle any move to address the Australian skills crisis by providing additional funding for vocational education and training, particularly in the traditional and other priority areas. For the reason of principle alone, Labor will be supporting the bill.
However, despite our commitment in principle to this provision, we have very strong reservations about the Australian technical colleges program and its capacity to address the nation’s severe shortage of skilled labour—a crisis brought about in large part by the Howard government’s 10-year neglect of training and vocational education. Accordingly, I move a second reading amendment highlighting some of our concerns:
At the end of the motion add:
“but the Senate considers that the present Government has been complacent and neglectful about the Australian economy by:
I will return to that in a moment.
The fact is that Labor’s concerns have only been exacerbated by the implications of the bill we are currently debating. We have said from the outset of this program that the Australian technical colleges represent a tokenistic stunt pulled by the government—an expensive stunt aimed at demonstrating that it has something to say about skills shortages and is doing something to respond to the desperate needs of industry. In fact, it was a hastily put together stunt pulled during the last federal election campaign. Again and again we see measures being taken by this government which are essentially quick fixes rather than looking at programs that invest in the long-term future of this country and address the long-term needs of this country. The Prime Minister is a past master at pulling these quick, dirty little stunts, and this is an example of such a measure.
While we have seen this poorly thought through election stunt, the program is experiencing a massive cost blow-out. It is experiencing a cost blow-out because essentially the program does not spend taxpayers’ money nearly as prudently or as wisely as one would expect. The Australian technical colleges, as Labor has predicted, are costing more than they should because of appalling planning by this government. This program was not developed in concert with the states and territories: it was introduced despite them; it was introduced in opposition to them. The government did not work closely with the states; it did not seek to advise the states as to what its intentions were; it did not seek to have their advice on the running of technical colleges. In fact, the government provided additional Commonwealth resources. Rather than enhancing the TAFE system that the states already run, it provided a program as a quick and dirty little stunt to try to undermine the TAFE system. The Howard government did not work with the states to add resources to the existing secondary school system that the states already run.
This government barged in and announced that what it was going to do was create a whole new system of upper secondary vocational training discrete from existing systems, essentially duplicating what had been undertaken by the states themselves. And what is the result? The result is clear to all those who know anything about this matter, and it was clear from day one. Too many of these so-called Australian technical colleges have been established incognito on greenfield sites requiring new buildings, new facilities and new equipment—things that might have been shared in a creative, innovative and economical way with existing schools and TAFE colleges.
Far from pointing to the successes of the program, as the minister would like, the cost blow-outs clearly show that the Australian technical colleges concept was seriously flawed from the beginning. The minister has had to come begging to the parliament to save her bacon by appropriating well over another $100 million to cover the unexpected additional costs. The government could not find anyone willing to negotiate the contracts to run these colleges at anything approaching the prices that were initially offered. All around the country the government has had to increase the contract price—it has no choice. Now, of course, the taxpayers have to foot the bill. They have to underwrite the government’s mismanagement.
For instance, take the case of the technical college at Lismore-Ballina. The program was a 2004 election promise. It is now 2007 and that college has yet to get off the ground. There has been no contract signed, as we were told at Senate estimates less than two weeks ago. The New South Wales government has gone ahead to establish its own network of trade schools, on its own initiative, to address the skills crisis. The New South Wales government has opened its own trade school at Ballina based on the local high school. Of course, that is a sensible, cost-effective way of doing it. The state government is building on existing facilities, existing administration and existing resources to create a practical solution to the skills shortage crisis. Now it is offering young Australians at Ballina and in surrounding areas new opportunities to learn a trade. There has not been a fuss about this initiative, just purposeful action. Nothing could contrast further with the actions of the Commonwealth government on this matter.
It would be nice if the Howard government could learn from the example of New South Wales or, indeed, my own state of Victoria, which has introduced similar initiatives. I wonder whether the New South Wales government’s new trade school at Ballina has anything to do with the apparent inability of the Commonwealth to interest anyone in setting up an Australia technical college in exactly the same town. Maybe local industry is not happy with the new trade school that the government is proposing; just maybe the ATC will wastefully and unnecessarily duplicate the existing educational facilities at that centre.
That is not all that I am worried about with regard to this program. Instead of the grandstanding that this government has engaged in while setting up its own colleges unilaterally, if the Howard government had chosen to work with the states in a genuine attempt to solve the skills crisis we might now have a viable, effective program in operation. Australia sorely needs a solution to the skills crisis, but it will not find one with this government. The Australian technical colleges are clearly not part of that solution.
The government wants to tell us that this extra cash proves that the Australian technical colleges program is going ahead in leaps and bounds. What we need, of course, is to look at the enrolments at some of these new colleges to get a taste of the truth. They point not to success but to abject failure by this government. An article by the Illawarra Mercury published early this month reported that a week after the Australian technical college in Wollongong was due to open it had 38 students. The Australian technical college at Gladstone in Queensland had 30 students last year.
—How many?
—Thirty students. Of course, we were told that there were going to be students coming from every quarter. Now we are told that by 2009 there might be 135 at Gladstone. The college at Darwin is not expected to grow beyond a paltry 100 students. When state school enrolments fall that low, state governments will usually close the schools down on the basis that they represent an inefficient use of taxpayers’ money. But, when it indulges in a cheap and nasty political stunt, what does this government do? It puts in another $100 million. The idea of deliberately setting up new training facilities with such poor economies of scale ought to be anathema to this entire parliament. But the financial considerations cannot be allowed to stand in the way of this Howard government’s election stunts.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-02-26,"—Tonight I rise to take note of a report from the Australian National Audit Office, Management of intellectual property in the Australian government sector. This audit report is effectively the second in as many years looking at how the government is managing its own intellectual property. When one looks through the report from beginning to end, it really is quite damning reading. The report demonstrates, as did its predecessor of some 18 months ago, that the government has done very little—effectively nothing—since 2004 to protect billions and billions of dollars worth of intellectual property. What does that mean? Billions of dollars worth of publicly owned computer assets and software are under threat. It makes worse the ‘brain drain’ which this government has been managing to avoid for many years.
By way of background, what is intellectual property? It is logos, trademarks, publications, films, broadcasts, designs, inventions and computer programs. Intellectual property rights include, by way of a fairly broad definition: patents, trademarks, copyright, circuit layout rights, designs, plant breeders’ rights and, of course, confidential information. Intellectual property protects the brains and ideas that drive our country and our economy. Increasingly, as this country matures into a service dominated economy, the basis of intellectual property and its legal protection becomes paramount and is in need of increasing legal protections.
Intellectual property is an intangible asset that has mushroomed out of all proportion. It has grown in the last 10 years from being worth something in the order of half a billion dollars in 1996 to being worth well over $8 billion in the 2005-06 financial year. That figure of $8 billion includes $3.8 billion of computer software assets properly held by the government and $3.9 billion of other intangibles. Intellectual property is becoming critical as governments outsource more and more work to third parties. If a government manages intellectual property right, it has the capacity to boost competitiveness, generate revenue and stimulate economic growth whilst at the same time ensuring proper return to the legal owner of that property—the government.
But the government’s record on intellectual property falls far short of achieving any of those goals. Here are the facts as outlined in the Australian National Audit Office report. The audit found that two-thirds of government agencies had no policy for the management of intellectual property. Hence, the auditor recommended a whole-of-government approach to the ownership, administration of and entitlement to intellectual property. Two years after those recommendations, little has been achieved and that whole-of-government approach still sits in a back drawer.
Such an approach, according to the government, was meant to have been completed by May of last year, but right from the beginning of this process—and even as I speak—confusion remains over whether this responsibility rests with the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, or the finance minister, Senator Minchin. More disturbingly, intellectual property management continues to have a very low profile within the government. There does not appear to be a minister, a department or an agency that is driving to protect the government’s right to over $8 billion of intellectual property that the government has been responsible for creating in the last 10 years. That is despite a government acknowledgement of the importance of intellectual property management.
We have to acknowledge that the government recognises its responsibility in this area. Indeed, in the lead-up to the 2004 election the government released a policy statement on IP management. In Connecting an innovative Australia, the government promised to ensure that ‘all agencies have appropriate intellectual property management strategies’. So the government was aware of the problem and it devised a solution. It was a matter of the government, if re-elected in 2004, moving to cement the negotiations between the two departments—AG’s and Finance—so that there could be either a whole-of-government approach or individual line portfolio responsibility. But in the almost three years since that time we have had no progress at all. It has to be said: this is another broken promise in this area from the government.
Instead, there appears to be confusion as to which department is responsible for developing and implementing this whole-of-government approach to intellectual property management as outlined by the Audit Office in its performance audit. A chain of correspondence between various departments, the Attorney-General and the minister for finance, Senator Minchin, dates back to the original audit in 2004. As of last August, the Attorney-General and Senator Minchin were still writing letters over the minutiae of responsibility for intellectual property management across all government agencies and departments.
This latest audit concludes: ‘Almost three years after agreement to the earlier audit report recommendations, an overarching approach and guidance to agencies on intellectual property management has not been achieved.’ The audit notes gaps in record keeping, making it hard to know what decisions, if any, have been made regarding this overarching approach to intellectual property. There was also insufficient recording of key events, decisions and differences of opinion, ‘making it difficult to track and report on progress against expected milestones’. Also, there has been little attention paid to date to how intellectual property principles will be applied across government.
Overall, it is a damning audit of an essential government action which should be directed to protecting its own property, which is in the order of $8 billion in 2006 figures that the government has either created or outsourced to be created by other agencies or firms. It is not good enough. At stake are billions of dollars worth of assets. As the Audit Office concluded, the government not only is not managing these properly but is not managing them at all. The government needs to pay closer attention to independent audits such as this and heed their recommendations. Hollow election promises are inadequate. The government needs to effectively manage publicly owned property. Innovative Australian software, for instance, needs to be protected with legal backing so that it cannot be misused, misappropriated or pirated.
This report by the Australian National Audit Office is a timely reminder of the government’s ongoing shortcomings and deficiencies in a critical area that does not receive a great deal of public notoriety but, as I have said, has developed an asset backing of something in the order of $500 million back in 1996 to $8 billion to $9 billion in the 2005-06 financial year. In a 10-year period we have gone from half a billion dollars to $8 billion or $9 billion worth. As our economy changes, as wealth is created in a service economy, as wealth is derived by the owners of products that are created, they increasingly need to have their legal rights protected and maintained by the government across all agencies.
One only has to look at the large outsourced contracts that are increasingly being made by departments like defence, veterans’ affairs, families and community services and agencies like Centrelink, to name a few, to know how many assets are being created, how much intellectual property rights are being ignored and how much brainpower is being put into a range of products that the government does not even know it owns. It shows no interest in maintaining a register or establishing a regime across government, across portfolios and across agencies to protect the $9 billion or $10 billion worth of intellectual property that government agencies have created in the last 10 years, and which over the next 10 years will grow to something in the order of $20 billion to $25 billion.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Intellectual Property</title>,Adjournment,32,1
