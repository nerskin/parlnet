Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (09:01):  I seek leave to move a motion of censure against the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.


Leave not granted.




Mr HUNT:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Flinders from moving the following motion forthwith:


That this House censures the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency for:


(1) misleading the Parliament of Australia. In particular by claiming that the Leader of the Opposition recently amended Coalition policy regarding the use of taxpayers' funds for purchase of foreign carbon credits;


(2) misleading the Parliament by asserting that there was such a change when the original policy released on 2 February 2010 has a heading in bold blue font on page 14, ""Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas, "" and when that heading is followed by the express clear and absolute statement:


(a) ""Labor's emissions trading scheme relies on extensive purchase of overseas CO2 emissions abatement to meet the 5 per cent emissions reduction target. This delivers no local environment benefit in Australia. In contrast, the Coalition's approach ensures that all abatement activity supported by the Emissions Reduction Fund to achieve the 5 per cent emissions reduction target will occur in Australia—delivering environmental benefits here rather than overseas.""


(3). misleading the public about the effective carbon price in China. In particular by overstating the effective price in China by 1,000% on multiple occasions including 3 February 2011, 16 February 2011 and 9 March 2011 when the Minister's own department had found a figure 1/10 of that as early as 6 October 2010.


This minister has deliberately misled the parliament and it is part of a pattern of dishonesty and disrespect that the Australian people and parliament—




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I rise to raise a point of order with regard to when a serious allegation is made as to a misleading of parliament. I seek your guidance with regard to the normal practice for raising it at the earliest opportunity. My understanding is that what the member for Flinders is moving here in the parliament relates to statements made by the minister during question time yesterday, during which time the member for Flinders was in the chamber and raised no objections to any of the statements.



Mr Pyne interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  I will take up as much time as I like, Manager of Opposition Business. There is no point of order. The member for Flinders, as I understand it—I do not have his suspension motion before me—has talked about misleading. His first remarks in support of the suspension motion were to talk about deliberate misleading. He will be very careful: this is a suspension motion.




Mr HUNT:
  We need to suspend standing orders to call this minister to account for misleading the parliament. The reason that is the case is that the minister has had before him for 18 months the coalition—

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (09:28):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill makes minor amendments to certain governance and business arrangements for portfolio bodies under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005.


At present, several statutory positions established under that act are referred to by the term 'general manager'—that is, the heads of Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation, Aboriginal Hostels Limited and the Torres Strait Regional Authority.


However, the roles undertaken by occupants of those positions have changed in nature since the positions were created. The term 'general manager' will be changed to 'chief executive officer' as a better reflection of the responsibilities and expectations of these agency heads.


The change will bring these agencies into line with the majority of other Commonwealth statutory authorities and companies, whose agency heads have the title of chief executive officer. This includes, for instance, the Australia Council for the Arts, Screen Australia, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the Australian Sports Commission. The chief executive officer title is a more appropriate term for agencies that have a board of directors—as each of these agencies do—and meets the general expectation that a chief executive officer is more senior than a general manager. We expect that this change will help the boards of these agencies to attract a higher calibre of candidate for agency head positions.


A further minor amendment will remove a redundant reference to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Limited schemes—the Community Support Hostel Grant Scheme and the Student Rent Subsidy Scheme. These schemes have not existed for a number of years, so the reference to them is no longer appropriate.


The provision for handling of information held by Indigenous Business Australia is also being amended. The narrow focus of this provision has, in the past, prevented information from being disclosed to agencies with responsibility for overseeing Commonwealth administrative practices—such as the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner.


It has also prevented information being given to Commonwealth agencies working in joint initiatives with Indigenous Business Australia, and state and territory agencies seeking to work more closely with Indigenous Business Australia to achieve better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities.


The amended provision aims to overcome these difficulties—but only with the continued appropriate protection of sensitive information. The relationship of confidence between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the agencies established for their benefit is an important public interest that we need to preserve.


The new provision is also consistent with established information-handling arrangements, such as in the family assistance law and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, that protect information while still permitting the proper work of the Commonwealth and its agencies.


Lastly, the bill amends the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 in relation to the power to appoint a person to act as the Executive Director of Township Leasing or the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services.


At present, the power to make these acting appointments must be exercised by the minister personally, with no capacity to delegate the power. It will now be possible for the minister to delegate the power under each act to the secretary or a deputy secretary of the department, without the need for the minister to make acting appointments personally. Appointments can then be made when there is a vacancy in the office, including any period when the executive director or coordinator-general is absent from duty or from Australia, or when the executive director or coordinator-general is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of the office. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (09:48):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 118: Treaties tabled on 23 March and 11 May 2011, incorporating a dissenting report and additional comments. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr KELVIN THOMSON:
  I thank the House. Report 118 contains the committee's views on two treaties: the Protocol on Investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement and the Resolution MPEC.189(60) Amendments to the Annex of the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).


Australia's economic relationship with New Zealand is conducted within the framework of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, colloquially known as ANZCERTA. It covers all trans-Tasman trade in goods and services and is the principal instrument for the elimination of trade barriers between the two nations. The protocol on investment will raise the threshold below which New Zealand investors in Australia require investigation by the Foreign Investment Review Board from a 15 per cent or more share of an Australian entity worth at least $231 million to an investment of $1.005 billion. For Australian investors in New Zealand, the threshold below which they will not be subject to investigation has increased from NZ$100 million to NZ$477 million. Both countries have retained the entitlement to review foreign investment originating in the other signatory and sensitive areas, such as urban residential and commercial property investment; media, telecommunications, transport; defence related industries; uranium investments in Australia; and farming, waterfront or sensitive land investment in New Zealand.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says that the protocol on investment is in the national interest because it will remove or reduce investment barriers; bring the treatment of New Zealand investors under Australia's foreign investment regime, in line with that granted to United States investors under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement; and maintain Australia's capacity to screen New Zealand investment proposals that are large or involve sensitive sectors that raise national interest concerns.


While the majority of the committee supported ratification of the protocol on investment, the report contains a dissent in relation to this treaty. The dissenting report from the members for Murray and Mallee is thoughtful, and I hope the government gives it proper consideration in thinking about future foreign investment policy. The truth is that many Australians are concerned about foreign investment, and the evidence to the committee about the Foreign Investment Review Board's handling of foreign investment does not do much to allay those concerns. In 10 years, the FIRB has knocked back just two foreign investment proposals: the Shell bid for Woodside and the Singapore stock exchange bid for the Australian Stock Exchange. The FIRB says that it will reject proposals that are not in the national interest. But, when you ask Treasury whether foreign investment is in the national interest, you are told that it is. If you ask, 'Are there any circumstances in which it might not be in the national interest?' all you get is a shrug of the shoulders. The second treaty considered in this report is the Resolution MEPC 189(60) amendments to MARPOL. This treaty is a multilateral treaty regulating marine pollution. The amendments add a new chapter 9 to MARPOL dealing with the use and transport of heavy fuel oil in Antarctic seas. The new chapter will prohibit the bulk transportation and use as fuel of heavy oils, bitumen and tar and their emulsions unless they are aboard vessels securing the safety of ships or in a search and rescue operation, and ships owned and operated by governments such as naval vessels, auxiliaries and research vessels.


The Australian Antarctic Division administers the Australian Antarctic Territory and is the major Australian presence in the Antarctic. The division strongly supports the measures introduced under the resolution. Nevertheless, implementation of the resolution will have some operational and budgetary implications for its work. Given Australia's leadership in marine environment protection, it is worth noting that the research vessel chartered by the division, the RSV Aurora Australis, already uses light fuel and is therefore compliant with the treaty. Australia's stations in the Antarctic are also compliant.


The division also contracts Russian flagged vessels to provide logistic support for its Australian Arctic program. These vessels are large, specialised, ice-strengthened cargo vessels, which, unfortunately, operate on intermediate fuel oil which will be banned under the treaty. However, the division has advised the committee that the fleet of ice-strengthened cargo vessels is nearing 30 years old, which is the usual end of a ship's life. The division expects to see a changeover in this fleet to modern, compliant vessels in the next five years.


The committee is concerned that a large proportion of vessels operating in Antarctic waters will be exempt from the prohibition on the basis that they are operated by governments. We believe the Australian Maritime Safety Authority should monitor the number of exempt ships carrying heavy oils in the region to see whether the provisions of the exemption need tightening. I commend the report to the House.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (09:54):  by leave—I thank our very able chairman, the member for Wills, for his reference to this dissenting report that I and the member for Forrest have attached to the Protocol on Investment in the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement—ANZCERTA. This treaty was originally tabled on 11 May 2011. We are not, and certainly I am not, against the business of foreign investment in Australia—not at all. What we are concerned about is anything which further diminishes the transparency or scrutiny of any foreign investment proposal, and we are certainly concerned when this is done, as it appears to be, as a cost-cutting measure.


This protocol does not in fact harmonise current anomalies or increase scrutiny of investment proposals by foreign private parties between Australia and New Zealand. As I said, it diminishes scrutiny and increases the disparities which already exist between the investment potentials in Australia and New Zealand for private companies and citizens. While it presumes to be doing more, the new ANZCERTA investment protocol only focuses on significantly increasing the dollar thresholds that trigger screening in either country. The actual business of this protocol is to make sure that New Zealand enjoys the same treatment as our preferred trading partner, the United States of America, when it comes to investment protocols. With this protocol, New Zealand investors would see the threshold for the scrutiny of their proposals raised from 15 per cent of A$231 million for general investment, A$5 million for Australian heritage properties or A$50 million for commercial properties to the one all-encompassing trigger of 15 per cent of A$1.005 billion in assets for any investment by a New Zealand corporation or business. 


Australians, on the other hand, would see the investment-screening threshold raised from 25 per cent of New Zealand's NZ$100 million to 25 per cent of NZ$477 million. The New Zealand Overseas Investment Office would retain its current 'sensitive assets' criteria, so in effect this protocol does not at all give a level playing field to the two countries' investment. The argument for that is that New Zealand has a much smaller economy and investment by Australians in New Zealand is, at this point in time, substantially greater than the reverse.


I have to say, however, that the protocol does not address different percentages of investment triggering scrutiny or the levels of proposed investment triggering screening. Neither does it deal with the different definitions of so called 'sensitive assets' in New Zealand, which include rural land over five hectares and any waterfront property, or Australia's prescribed 'sensitive areas', which include media, telecommunications, transport, defence related industries and uranium but not rural land or waterfront land. Those disparities would continue under this new so-called 'harmonising protocol'. As well, New Zealand citizen investors are given a special visa category which exempts them from Australia's residential property investment conditions. However, the same does not occur for Australian citizen investors in New Zealand. They will continue to be restricted by certain criteria, for example, in regard to water frontage and farmland over five hectares.


The New Zealand OIO also charges a significant application fee of some NZ$12,000. Australia does not charge anything at all. This is another anomaly which has not been considered. New Zealand Treasury has calculated the protocol as proposed would substantially reduce the current costs for investment in business assets by around two-thirds. But it would appear that this will largely come from Australian businesses less frequently triggering the New Zealand OIO application fees, and fewer New Zealand investors triggering the Australian thresholds. Therefore, this saving comes at a cost of less scrutiny and transparency for either country. It cannot be seen as a savings carrying a benefit of increased efficiency or effectiveness or ensuring the national interests of both countries are preserved. Australia accepted the conditions of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement for screening of non-government investment in Australia by US corporations or businesses. This is now the standard to be offered to New Zealand as the equivalent of USA preferred status. However, that Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement hardly had generous conditions for Australia and it was not reciprocated nor harmonised with the United States criteria. The USA, for example, has no formal dollar threshold triggering screening of private investment but instead requires voluntary notification of any proposed investment which may trigger national security sensitivities.


It seems we still have not learned much then about equal or reciprocal bilateral trade arrangements or increasing transparency and accountability. In particular, article 8, the senior management and board of directors section of the new protocol, provides that neither party may restrict the nationality or residence of the senior management or board members of an enterprise of that party who plans to invest. We are concerned that such an arrangement could lead to a diminishing of Australia's national interest if board members or senior management are not resident in either country and do not have Australian or New Zealand nationality but still get to enjoy the preferential investment-screening treatment.


In summary, the only new obligation imposed by this new protocol on investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement is the requirement that Australia substantially increases the thresholds before screening of New Zealand private sector investment proposals occurs. Fees charged are not harmonised and special considerations are not aligned. Given the growing public disquiet about the lack of transparency and accounting for foreign investment in Australia, especially for farming land and manufacturing, now is not the time to simply raise the bar to save costs by triggering less scrutiny, assessment of national interest and accountability. In fact, I believe we need to urgently review our non-government foreign investment triggers for scrutiny and our definition of 'national interest', in particular to include consideration of Australian food production capacity. Because of those points, we cannot support this protocol.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2011-08-17,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:02):  I had only 30 seconds last night. I will continue on the substance of the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 and the range of amendments that are emerging not only from me but also from the coalition and the government, which has some substantial amendments. I am not opposed to establishing a national health performance authority as a concept. I think it is an important contribution to national health and hospital reform that this House and Australia have been chasing now for at the very least three years. To have in concept form a body to monitor the performance of all aspects of that health and hospital system is a sensible and much needed part of the oversight and scrutiny in regard to the health reform agenda on behalf of Australian taxpayers.


However, having said that, we are seeing before our eyes now some changes with regard to what was introduced in this parliament under the guise of the Health Performance Authority and now, with substantial government amendments, some substantial changes to the concept that was introduced, arguably even to the point where we could build a case that it is a separate bill altogether in structure. The amendments are so substantial in the way they change this from what started out as a national performance authority to what is now a gaggle of states authority. The command and control really is residing once again back in the hands of the states and territories. Back in 2008, when we started this journey, really largely the point of the exercise was to find a way for the Commonwealth to directly fund that resource and give the local health district networks or their equivalents around Australia much greater command, control and autonomy on the ground. That was the model when this bill was introduced in the House in the last session. The principle still stood and health and hospital reform generally was looking to still be on track.


I urge every member and anyone listening to this debate to focus not necessarily on the bill itself but on the 29 government amendments to their own legislation that they put before the House several months ago. The concern is in those amendments and how much has been given with regard to state clawback and the use of COAG as a Trojan Horse on behalf of the states once again wanting to get command and control of a system that they considered was under threat through what was, and hopefully still is, a very good and important reform for Australia in tidying up and essentially nationalising our health and hospital system in Australia.


In relation to the amendments before the House, the coalition's second reading amendment will be the first we will deal with. It states the coalition's desire for the House to decline to give the bill a second reading until:


(1)      provisions establishing the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, including its functions and responsibilities, are presented to the House for its consideration …


I can understand the coalition's desire to want all of the health and hospital reform brought in globo and have us deal with it all at once. I hope that is the desire. From my reading of this, I think the link is tenuous at best to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Health and hospital reform in some form is happening in a range of bills and my reading of this second reading amendment is that it is the continuation of the policy of wanting to be slow and difficult on all policy if not in control of the government benches. So I will not be supporting the second reading amendment from the coalition.


With regard to the in-detail stage, I will be putting forward an amendment concerning the reporting requirements of the health reform agenda and the National Health Performance Authority. This was put to the House committee that looked at this issue with regard to how the authority reports: does it report directly to the minister or should it also have some obligations to report to parliament? My perspective—and I am pleased that the House committee also supported these considerations—is that the authority should have responsibility to report as soon as practicable to the parliament so that reporting is not part of a game by the executive to release bad news the day before Christmas or to get up to any other tricks that everyone in this place knows can get played when governments are behaving badly. The authority should have some tight time frames for reporting and some clear and specific obligations for reporting to parliament and therefore to all of the 150 members and indirectly to 150 communities around Australia. I am hopeful of support for the amendment. I think that it is a small but important reflection on the role and status that parliament itself plays in the transparency process that delivers better policy outcomes for all of us.


There will also be a batch of 29 amendments that the government is introducing to their own legislation. It is here that I have most concern, and I will speak again in the in-detail stage. This is really where the dumbing down of this legislation is taking place, in my view. As I said at the start, whilst we are regarding these amendments as being an inch better than where we were before, we are still a mile short of where we could or should have been with health reform and the agenda that has been going on for the last three years. That is where the disappointment lies, in the lost opportunity of reform and allowing a performance authority, unfettered, with independence, to truly assess data from all states and territories of all hospitals regardless of who the direct authority is, so that we can get some direct benchmarking and some clear direction on who is or is not performing in health and hospital services today. In my view, the amendments that the government is introducing are tying the hands of the performance authority and really making it subservient to the states' authority. 


That has been a big part of the problem to date that I thought the reform agenda was trying to resolve, and in the whole negotiation of trying to get all the states and territories on board there has actually been a compromise too far. I understand that negotiation and compromise have their place but I do not think that the balance has been struck. I think that compromise with the states has really given command and control back to the state and territory authorities to potentially continue to behave in an inefficient and less than value-for-money way than we desire.


I think I heard another speaker talk about the performance authority as a consequence being a 'toothless tiger'. I hope that is not the case and that is why I will continue to support the substance of the bill, because we have inched forward slightly. But I do think that it is a neutered tiger. I think that through this process it has lost a lot of its authority to truly assess the performance of health and hospital services across the board in Australia on behalf of Australian people with data that is given to the parliament and to the people without fear or favour, without any washing by any states or territories, without any tricks or political games with talk of various turnarounds of work schedules or how early the documents have to be given to state and territory health ministers so that they can get their guns loaded in response and without the use of COAG as the body to really hide a Trojan Horse for this re-emergence of state and territory command and control. I am very uncomfortable with those government amendments and will not be supporting those when it comes down to the in-detail stage.


I hope—and I flag and I warn—that this whole exercise is different from the recently signed health and hospital reform agreement documents and that this is not symptomatic of what is to come through legislation. I hope there is not going to be a range of legislation that sees the states claw back control three years after the beginning of a very good and very important reform agenda.


In 2008, in the previous parliament when the government was a majority government, I was still a very strong advocate for the importance of this reform. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, sat in the tea room of a local hospital, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, and talked at length with the medical staff at the hospital and listened closely to discussion on the importance of the principles of the two Es—efficiency and equity. That is all I and communities such as mine have sought through this process, namely, efficiency being rewarded in the system and equity. Those services performing over and above should be rewarded. Currently in the funding models they are not, so that inefficiency, in many ways, gets rewarded. The resource distribution model controlled by the states does not deliver equity, particularly to rural and remote communities and to high-growth areas. Both are traditionally behind equity in the delivery of resources and funding.


The National Rural Health Alliance put a figure of $1 billion a year based on a failed model of the states resource distribution formulas not making it to where, on the state's own funding formulas, it should. It is a disgrace. It is one of the great failures of Australian public policy at the moment and it is the fundamental reason that reform is so important and that we need to be eyeballing the states rather than being subservient to them.


What I am seeing in these amendments that have come through whilst this bill is before the House is in my view too much compromise with those that are too much to blame for the problem—the very reason that we are reforming. So I would hope this is not the first of many. I hope this is a one-off where, for a whole range of reasons that I am probably not aware of, the states got a great big win through the range of amendments that have come in and Australian taxpayers as a consequence in my view got a great big loss.


I would hope that in upcoming legislation attached to the health and hospital reform agenda we do see the Commonwealth actually stepping up and sticking true to what the reform agenda was in 2008—that is, to start to have a Commonwealth funding authority working directly with local command and control. It is a sensible concept; let's deliver it.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (10:16):  I would like to thank the very many members who have spoken on this bill from both sides of the House. It would be fair to say from listening to the contributions that people feel very strongly about making sure that our hospitals can deliver for local communities. The member for Lyne, the final speaker on the bill, is a very passionate advocate for making sure that his local community is well looked after. I can indicate to the member for Lyne that the government will be supporting his amendment when the opportunity comes for that. However, I do need to indicate to him and to the House that we fundamentally disagree with his assessment of what the amendments mean. I will be addressing that in more detail when I move those amendments.


Let me go to the summing-up and deal with those issues first and then for the convenience of the House I might mention that we intend to move the amendments together as a group. The National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 establishes a key element of the Australian government's health reform agenda. (Quorum formed) I am sure that members are delighted to be here to know that the National Health Performance Authority will act as a watchdog over the performance of both public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. It will regularly report comparative information on the performance of these bodies and give the public information in respect of consistently poor performance. Performance monitoring will support the improvement in healthcare delivery, safety and quality by all of these services. Poor performance will be identified to allow for remediation and superior performance will be identified to allow for the dissemination of best practice approaches.


The establishment of the authority is a key part of the health reform agreement signed by all states and territories this month. We then introduced the legislation into this House in order to meet the time frames of the February COAG meeting but also were open to consider amendments which might be suggested from the states, the committee inquiry in this place or the Senate committee inquiry. State and territory health ministers agreed to the detail of the legislation and how it will interact with their health systems at a meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on 7 June. Amendments to reflect the detail of this agreement were distributed by the government in the last session of parliament.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Would those members who are still standing out of their place and having little discussions either do that outside or resume their place in the chamber.




Ms ROXON:
  I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. These also reflect amendments suggested by the Senate committee inquiry. The amendments will bring about a firm partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in their endeavour to deliver better healthcare services to all Australians. The amendments to the bill will enshrine the independence of the authority giving it the ability to appoint its own chief executive officer as well as the power to remove that person in the case of poor performance or misconduct. Amendments will also foster greater cooperation with the states through consultation on the authority's strategic plan, consultation about reports of poor performance and the designation of local hospital networks. This shows that the government is committed to work with all jurisdictions on health reform and deliver an outcome that will put more information in the hands of Australian patients. I thank those members who have made constructive contributions to this debate. However, unfortunately, a number of members of the opposition have used their time to simply complain and criticise rather than to outline any plans they would use to deliver improvements to the health system. They have been consistently silent on their vision, except for a policy to wreak havoc on and cut health services.


It is a fact that this bill delivers on reforms that the Leader of the Opposition once talked about but never had the capacity to deliver. On 9 May 2008 he said the Howard government:


… would have empowered the public by requiring the states to publish detailed information about the specific performance of hospitals.


… … …




In return for continued funding increases, each state would have been required to provide detailed quarterly reports on the precise number and type of services delivered at each public hospital and to provide detailed quarterly reports on adverse events at each hospital.



So, while the opposition has an 'oppose everything' strategy, by not supporting this bill they will be opposing something that their leader himself once called for—although did not achieve in 11½ years.


We are now seeing the opposition, having no ideas of its own, continuing to play the easy game of trying to frustrate the government's significant reforms. This was highlighted earlier this year when the shadow minister took a similar approach in regard to the bill to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, a body originally established, temporarily, by the Leader of the Opposition. Now we have had a bill before the House for some months, scrutinised and endorsed by committees in both the House and the Senate, and the best the opposition can come up with is saying that we should sit on it and not establish this important watchdog agency.


The shadow minister clearly knows that this agency is a key part of the health reform agenda and that this legislation has been endorsed by all the states and territories, including three Liberal states. He also clearly knows that this agency will have a watchdog role in scrutinising the performance of health services, whereas the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have a completely different role, an important technical and financial role, in determining the official price for hospital services. Rather than trying to wreck every bill, it might be worth the opposition's time to develop at least one health policy of its own.


Our government is determined to pursue the tough reforms, particularly when they involve more transparency for the Australian public. Standing on the shoulders of My School, My Hospitals and the work of the National Health Performance Authority, this agency will deliver for Australians unprecedented levels of nationally comparable information. It will also be a watchdog to detect poor performance in our public and private hospitals and primary care sector. I thank members for their contributions, my officials for their hard work and the states for their cooperation with these reforms. Question put:


That the amendment be agreed to.


The House divided. [10:30]

(1) The Minister may, before the end of the 6-month period beginning at the commencement of this item, appoint a person to act as the Performance Authority CEO during a vacancy in the office of the Performance Authority CEO, so long as no appointment has previously been made to the office.


(2) An appointment under subitem (1) is to be made by written instrument.


(3) Anything done by or in relation to a person purporting to act under an appointment under subitem (1) is not invalid merely because:


   (a)   the occasion for the appointment had not arisen; or


   (b)   there was a defect or irregularity in connection with the appointment; or


   (c)   the appointment had ceased to have effect; or


   (d)   the occasion to act had not arisen or had ceased.


Note:   For more about acting appointments, see sections 20 and 33A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.


(4) If a person is acting as the Performance Authority CEO in accordance with an appointment under subitem (1), the Performance Authority must not appoint anyone, under subsection 94(1) of the National Health Reform Act 2011, to act as the Performance Authority CEO.


(5) If, immediately before the end of the 6-month period beginning at the commencement of this item, a person is acting as the Performance Authority CEO in accordance with an appointment under subitem (1), the appointment is terminated at the end of that 6-month period.


(6) Subitem (5) does not prevent the person from being appointed by the Performance Authority, under subsection 94(1) of the National Health Reform Act 2011, to act as the Performance Authority CEO after the end of that 6-month period.


As mentioned in my summing-up speech, these amendments take into account the resolution of a meeting of health ministers that was held on 7 June which supported in principle this legislation with these amendments. It is very important to note that these amendments give the National Health Performance Authority the power to appoint and dismiss its own CEO; set mechanisms for notification of poor performance to states and territories, local hospital networks and hospitals; deal with the definition of public hospitals and local hospital networks; consult the states on the strategic plan; allow for disclosure of information to state ministers; and deal with the act's functions.


It is not right, as the member for Lyne and on occasions the opposition have put it, that these changes give the states power to do what they want in hospitals. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill, with these amendments, will introduce the most rigorous performance measures that have ever existed in Australia's history for our hospital system. That is of course why the states fought hard to make sure that the detail was practical. As systems managers of our hospital system, they would be aware of and responsible for the fixing of problems within our hospital system—something I would think all members would be keen to support. 


These amendments have, by the nature of the process for getting agreement through a COAG arrangement, been subject to extensive consultation with my state and territory colleagues. They also address issues that were raised through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing. These amendments will ensure that the act has the support and cooperation of state governments so that the authority can properly undertake its role as a watchdog of public hospital, local hospital network, private hospital and Medicare Locals performance. 


By addressing these amendments we will achieve what has long been wished for in the Australian health system: independent, hospital-by-hospital reporting of performance. I cannot think of anything that is a better indicator of how we will improve performance year after year after year than making sure that we have an independent system which assesses the performance of each hospital and allows us to make sure that those that are underperforming improve and those that are doing well can be copied around the country. I am very proud of these amendments and the bill as a whole. I think it is a historic part of our agreement, and I think the view that the states and territories might occasionally like to have put in the media that they had a big win on this just is not supported by the evidence of what is in this bill and these amendments. I commend these amendments to the House.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (10:42):  Since I last contributed to this debate on the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill, significant developments have taken place. The most significant development is that the states have completely and utterly won out in this debate against the Commonwealth. I want the House to understand—and I am going to ask the Minister for Health and Ageing some questions in a moment but I think the Australian public has seen it for what it is— that what has taken place here is that the Prime Minister was desperate to claim to the public that she had had a win. This Prime Minister was desperate over the break to try and flick the switch away from the carbon tax and she was wanting to say to the Australian people that on health reform the Commonwealth was able to strike a deal.


Let us look at the circumstances under which the Commonwealth has been able to strike this deal, and some of it has been discussed in the contribution of the member for Lyne. Essentially, the government has agreed to continue business as usual in Australia's 750 public hospitals in return for the agreement of the states—in particular, the states that held out, namely, Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, Victoria. It has meant a huge bucket of money. The states have got a huge amount of money and there are 29 amendments to this legislation to try and accommodate the capitulation of the Commonwealth to the states. So the Commonwealth again has got itself into a financial bind where this incompetent federal government has said to the state premiers, 'To get a signature on the paper we will do whatever it takes.' 


Could you imagine negotiating any sort of business contract in the real world on this basis? Go to BHP and say, 'We are desperate to do a deal with you and, whatever condition you put in the contract, know that we will sign it.' That is basically what has happened here. This government is desperate and on its knees, and it cannot manage money. In trying to give the public the perception that some sort of grand health deal has been done, the Commonwealth has sold out not only this government but also future governments. Future legislators in this place will be bound to this incompetent and lazy deal. It is not good for parliament, it is not good for the Australian people and, most importantly and it is not good for the doctors and nurses that work in public hospitals or, indeed, the patients who access the services. I think it is right that this minister is condemned yet again for the latest failing in the so-called health reform debate.


I might say as part of this contribution that I welcomed some of the words from the member for Lyne, who I think has a genuine interest in the area of health reform. The sincerity stops, I am afraid to say, where the member for Lyne—in spite of having made all of those statements before: that this is bad legislation; that basically the Rudd vision that he was tied up to, quite willingly, has now been abandoned; that the states have won out; and that we are going to have business as usual at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer—is still going to support this legislation. I think it is disappointing because, as I said, I think he does have a genuine belief in wanting to reform our health system—as we all do.


But we are not going to get that if we end up with the government's own legislation being amended 29 times before the bill has even passed the parliament. Just to put that into context: this is a government that has had to amend its own bill in 29 different areas. Basically, it completely undermines the intent of the original bill. The intent of the original bill was to vest certain powers in the Commonwealth so that we could drive efficiency, productivity and changes in the hospitals, which are owned and managed by the state governments. The member for Lyne has said, 'I'm going to oppose these amendments because I think they weaken the original bill'. He is not going to oppose them, knowing that the other Independents will support his position so that ultimately the amendments would go down. The member for Lyne has decided ultimately to support the bill, which I think undermines credibility in this debate. I think that it has to be put on the record, because I suspect that the member for Lyne would not oppose these amendments if the member for Lyne knew that he could possibly defeat them.


In this debate people should really put their cards on the table, because this is bad legislation. The member for Lyne, who, as I said, does have a genuine interest in health reform, acknowledges that this is just the latest example of a failure to deliver on health reform in this country. I would like to ask the minister: can this minister point to anywhere in this legislation where the Commonwealth has the final say in relation to any aspect of the bill before the House?

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:47):  I will talk specifically about the amendments, but I cannot let the somewhat obsessed commentary on my sincerity go without a response.


I am here participating in this debate with sincerity for the right outcomes, as I hope all members of this chamber are.




Mr Dutton:
  Well, vote against the bill!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  If you listened closely to what I said: I said that with regard to the substance of the bill I think it is an inch further than where we were before, but it is a mile short of where we could be. In language that is as simple as I can possibly make it, it is a step forward but it is a lost opportunity for where we could be. If you think that fails a sincerity test then I think that is a disappointment that reflects poorly on you, sir, the member for Dickson, in your running commentary in a partisan way.




Mr Dutton:
  Why don't you hold out and get a better deal?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! The member for Dickson was heard in silence. He will extend the same courtesy.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  And in response to the interjection as to why I am running a commentary on the member for Dickson, it is in response to his running commentary on me. I would not have commented otherwise.


With regard to the amendments before the House: I think they are a watering down of where we could be. In fact, I like the substance of the legislation and the bill that was originally put before the House. That is the bill I want to support, not reject, as the member for Dickson seems confused about. I want to support a National Health Performance Authority that is unfettered in its business in the way it works through the various hospital and health providers and reports accordingly for good or for bad.


I understand administrative principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, particularly in relation to individuals who work within the public sector—in fact, for all Australian citizens. I think that principle does not stand as much for state bodies that may feel aggrieved if there is a poor performance report around a particular hospital. These amendments seem all about what I consider to be the weak argument of procedural unfairness that has been run by the states in an effort to try to get some buy-in with regard to command and control back within the health and hospital reform agenda.


I will quote some examples. Amendment (4) to section 62:


(4) If the report indicates poor performance by:


   (a) a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or


   (b) a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory;


Then there is this process where a copy of the draft of the report has to be given to the state or health minister; there has to be an invitation to the state and to the health minister to give the performance authority written comments about the draft report within 30 days; and there has to be regard to any of these comments.


If we are serious about an unfettered performance authority and genuine independence, and with reliable data—and I accept COAG reform, and McClintock and crew have been talking about poor data within many systems and the timeliness of that data—do not buy the argument that there is procedural unfairness, that the states seem to be treated unfairly if under the performance authority rules of engagement a particular hospital is found with poor performance. Based on the unfettered powers that they may have, I do not accept procedural unfairness to the state. Yes, I think we have to protect individuals—hospital managers and any of the health workforce—but as far as the states are concerned, I think they should cop it and they should do what they can to improve whatever the performance authority publicly releases either to the parliament or to any other body.




Mr Dutton:
  Well, move that amendment!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I am going against these amendments, member for Dickson. I cannot understand your confusion with regard to how explicit I have been. I support the original legislation before the parliament. I do not support these.




Mr Dutton:
  Move an amendment to strengthen it up!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I do not support these. I do not want to amend them; I do not support them. I do not understand your confusion or your interjections, sir. You will get the right to speak again, and hopefully you can explain yourself.


I also have a problem with the states having input into the work plan of the performance authority. This should be the equivalent of an integrity body that has its own work program, not one that has the states or the Commonwealth directly inputting into that work program.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (10:52):  I am happy to take all of the comments. This is consideration in detail. I am happy to take any objections, questions and queries that people have and deal with them all at once. I do not think that it will serve the House that well for us to prolong this if there are not new issues to discuss.


I think we need to bring some of the detailed information back to the focus of the House, and I can pick up the points that the member for Lyne is making and some that the shadow minister is making. I think people are confusing things and alleging things about the original bill that was put forward. At the time that it was put forward we clearly stated that there were still to be negotiations with the states and territories and that amendments would be moved; we said that on day one. We also acknowledged that there was a lot of interest and that there would be inquiries in both the House and the Senate, and we understood that that might lead to some changes. That is the sort of open policymaking that people ask for from governments. Yes, you could do it differently—you could have an exposure draft; you could do some negotiations first—but ultimately the parliament enables this process, and we have been pretty up-front about it. So I do not think there is anything peculiar in the way that the member for Dickson seems to be suggesting—that, because there are a lot of amendments, that is somehow a bad reflection on the process. I think it actually shows that the process, as we indicated from the beginning, has worked quite well.


But where the confusion seems to come in is that these amendments are being seen as a removal of Commonwealth power when actually what this legislation is establishing is an independent body. It is not a body that is going to be controlled by the Commonwealth. It is not a body where we are asking for final control. It is a body where we are saying that we should remove from the political agenda an assessment of performance hospital by hospital. A vast number of those 29 amendments make clear that it will be more independent from the Commonwealth than the original draft. It is not moving from the Commonwealth to the states but moving from the Commonwealth—for example, the minister having the ability to employ and dismiss the CEO—to giving the board the power to do that. I think that that actually increases the assertion that we have made from the beginning that this is an independent body. It makes it even clearer that we are serious about it being an independent role.


The example that the member for Lyne raised, which is a significant one, goes to some practical objections that the states and territories had about when they are the ones that are required to help improve a hospital facility if it is found to be lacking in performance, which is the very thing that the member raised at the end. What I want them to do if there is a performance problem is get on with fixing it. They asked that they have the opportunity, in a very short time, first to check that the data is correct—and unfortunately in health this has been a problem that has dogged the system, so I think it is not an unreasonable request from people who want to make sure data is correct—and second to be able to get on straightaway with fixing a problem while this process of reporting continues. From my perspective, for the patient that is a good thing. It means that the states are asking for that information to be given to them early so that they can respond and fix performance problems early and so that for patients we have things picked up more quickly.


I can understand that people might have some scepticism. There has been a fair bit of history in a lot of parts of the country where there is not always confidence that the states have done what they ought to in particular areas. What the Commonwealth is interested in doing with our reforms—and this legislation is a big part of it—is making much clearer the lines of responsibility of who does what, who fixes what, how we know when something needs to be fixed and how we make sure the performance is publicly available to people. And we will be. I know as the health minister that every member in this House, if their hospital is found not to be performing properly by this Health Performance Authority, will be in here asking me about what else can be done to fix it. That is how this sort of reporting drives improvements in the system.


So I do not accept the criticisms that are made. I do understand that a number of them are made totally in good faith, but this is a huge leap. It is not an inch further from where we were; it is a huge leap from where we were. I am sure that, over coming years and in the future, people will watch how the performance authority works and may well seek to improve it even further in the future.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2011-08-17,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:57):  I will be brief and will just clarify any perception of confusion. I accept the minister's argument that this is the movement from the Commonwealth to an independent authority and not necessarily an ongoing running battle between the Commonwealth and the states, but I would also put on the record, Minister, that I know independence and this is not independence. That is the concern specifically about the amendments. I refer you to the policy principles of COAG at proposed section 66A, where it is COAG itself that is giving written policy principles to the performance authority about the performance of the performance authority's functions. COAG, if I read it correctly, will be a gathering of health ministers, state and federal, and therefore it remains a part of the political process. Likewise, with the similar issues around amendment (26) in regard to who decides the work plan of the performance authority, it is by agreement, as I understand it and read it, between the state and federal health ministers. That is arguably much more a political decision than an independent one.


So I fully back the concept of an independent performance authority with unfettered powers alongside an audit office, an ombudsman and inspectors-general of defence or taxation. If we are serious about establishing an independent body, it needs to be unfettered and to be genuinely removed from the political process. These 29 amendments are the political process using its claws, and particularly the states, to work against what is a very good concept as part of the health reform agenda. So no confusion, just disappointment. Maybe it is a reality of negotiations in a federated system that once again the Commonwealth takes a bullet as a consequence of having to negotiate with states. But I, as the local member representing my people in the federal parliament, in what I consider the 'common wealth' parliament, should not accept this incursion from the states once again. In 2008, it was finding ways to get around state command and control which was one of the fundamental reasons we were doing what we were doing.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:00):  I welcome some of the comments in the Minister for Health and Ageing's previous contribution, but I think they go further to underscore the fact that this is a terrible deal for the Commonwealth. As we mentioned before, when Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election the promise was that hospitals would be federally funded but locally run. As a principle, that is admirable. As the member for Lyne has commented on a number of occasions, that would have been a better and more desirable outcome. But the more we look in detail at these amendments the more we see the way in which the Commonwealth has capitulated.


Far from being a federal takeover or a greater concentration of funding power to try to drive changes, this has been a takeover in reverse. The states have effectively usurped the Commonwealth's power in relation to this bill and, I suspect, many others that we will see before the parliament. I asked the minister a very specific question about in what area the Commonwealth might have a final say. The minister tried to fob that off by saying that this was an independent authority, but if you look at the government's original intent in relation to this authority certain appointments were made by the minister, by the Commonwealth, and certain obligations were imposed on the authority by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's intent was very clearly to try to drive this performance authority so that we could see better outcomes in our public hospitals.


It is abundantly clear—and it should be clear to all Australians—that this is yet another demonstration of a bad government in action. This is a government that has locked this nation's healthcare future in mediocrity. This is a situation that is of the Prime Minister's own making. In a way I feel for the current health minister because not only was she gazumped by Prime Minister Rudd but also she has been completely sidelined by this Prime Minister. It is humiliating for a minister, particularly for a cabinet minister, when that cabinet minister is put to the side because he or she has no capacity to deliver the outcome that the Prime Minister desires. I think that is part of what has happened here. The minister cannot come before this House with a serious and sincere look on her face and say that this is what she intended out of this process. 


There is no final say for the Commonwealth, as there was in the original draft of the legislation, because the states have their fingerprints all over this bill. We can have a debate about federalism and the role of the states in the health system. That debate will no doubt take place in coming years, as it has in previous years. But people should be under no illusion that this does anything to end the blame game, to fix public hospitals, to improve standards. You only have to look at the detail. There is no financial penalty. I asked the minister what happens in a situation of proven incompetence or demonstrated poor clinical outcomes in a public hospital continuing under this process. What power does the Commonwealth have, without having to consult the states or territories, to deliver some sort of financial penalty on the states? What sorts of powers does that extend to?


I know that sometimes, particularly given 29 amendments have been moved, some of the detail gets brushed over. But there is a benefit in putting on the record what some of these amendments entail. I only have a short time, but I intend to detail a couple which serve to underscore our argument that this is a bad deal. Amendment (2) goes to amend section 5. It provides a definition of public hospitals, which is fine, and adds these words:


If a facility is situated in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory—


it is hard to imagine where a facility could otherwise be situated; so a public hospital anywhere in the country—


the Minister must not specify the facility in such an instrument without the written agreement of the State/Territory Health Minister of the State or Territory, as the case may be.


Ask yourself why the Commonwealth did not see fit to put those words into the original legislation, but does now. As I said, it goes to this federal government having completely given up on any reform. They were desperate to do a deal that they have surrendered everything that was going to provide capacity to improve our public hospitals which is what the Australian public demand. I have some other amendments which I will go to shortly, but I ask the minister to address directly those issues so that I can have a response to that particular question. (Time expired)

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:05):  The Minister for Health and Ageing is having difficulty. My question went in particular to what financial penalty the Commonwealth could impose without consultation with the states and territories if there has been proven clinical failure, demonstrated incompetence or a failure of management at a particular hospital. If we saw, for argument's sake, the premature birth of a baby in a public hospital toilet outside an emergency waiting room, what could the minister do under this legislation that she cannot do now? They are important questions and they go specifically to the amendments. 


It is not for the minister to try to usurp the process of this parliament. The minister has to provide detailed responses. That is what the minister is obliged to do. Minister, what could you do if that happened in a public hospital today that you could not do under the previous arrangements without the aid of this legislation? I have further contributions to make.




Ms Plibersek:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your advice on whether this is a Q and A session or Senate estimates, or whether we are now dealing with the amendments to the legislation.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:07):  I am comfortable with providing comment on amendments if members want to raise questions on it. I am not going to allow this parliament to descend into a rambling Q and A from a shadow minister who has not asked me a question in question time for two years and is asking a question about something which is actually not the remit of this bill. He wants to know if there are financial penalties. This bill does not deal with financial arrangements between the states and territories.


This bill and the amendments deal with the reporting of poor performance. He might want to ask, if there is that poor performance, what other sorts of financial impacts are there? But he cannot turn this debate into a general Q and A session when he cannot get through his own tactics people a question in question time and has not bothered to ask me a question about health or health reform for two years in question time. He cannot now come in here and try to use this for a rambling discussion about a whole range of other things.


What we have before us is a detailed bill which is a fundamental change to the way that performance is going to be reported about our hospitals. It is going to provide much more information to the public and it is going to have a much more rigorous assessment process so that states and territories are not able to have poor data or, in an even worse scenario, have it somehow presented in a way which is fraudulent, as unfortunately we have seen with a couple of reported cases in various hospitals across the country. No state or territory wants that to happen either, so this is now a process, and, with the amendments, is an agreed procedure between the states and the territories.


I am very comfortable that it gives the new independent authority far-reaching power to do things that have never been done in our federation before. I accept that there are people in this House, and the member for Lyne is clearly one of them, who think that they are good steps but would like it to go even further. I accept that there are people who have that view, and I would imagine that there are people in that category who—once this bill is passed, if it is passed, and once the authority is set up—will be campaigners who will see what it delivers and will want to argue for further change into the future.


But that is different to coming in here, as the federal opposition is doing, and having a general spray about every issue that they are frustrated about not being able to raise elsewhere and expecting me to enter into a debate with them about it. There are other forums of this House. Bring on a matter of public importance. Do some work yourself and move an amendment, rather than interjecting that the member for Lyne should move one if he feels strongly about this. Where are yours on that, if you think this is such an important issue? Let us actually use the parliament for what is intended. We are clearly going to have to agree to disagree. We get an opportunity to vote on these amendments.


I understood, when I came into the House and asked the shadow minister if he was voting for these amendments, that he said yes. Now he has a whiff that the member for Lyne is not, so the opposition have changed their minds and now are not voting for the amendments. This is the sort of policymaking that the federal opposition are into. They are not actually reading the bill. They are not making a decision about whether this is good or bad policy. They are looking at the politics. They think that if they have got one Independent they will be able to knock off this bill and that might be an embarrassment to the government, so they will jump on it.


None of this is to do with any desire that the shadow minister has for hospitals to improve their services across the country. I am very confident that this bill, if enacted, will deliver fundamental change to the way we report hospital performance across the country. It is on that basis that I commend the bill to the House, and I think that if the shadow minister does not have anything to say that is relevant to this debate then we should put the question that these amendments be agreed to.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:11):  Just to clarify a couple of facts in this debate, I have been asking questions on health in this place. I have asked them of the Prime Minister over the course of the last two years because we cannot get a straight answer out of this health minister. We moved an amendment in relation to this bill only a few minutes ago. I am not sure if the minister recalls that debate and, in fact, that vote. If it rings a bell, Minister, we did move an amendment, which the government, of course, did not support.


I want the minister to provide in detail some response, as is required in this debate by any standard. The minister put before that essentially I wanted answers but then provided no answer. This is a performance authority, yes, but if there is not performance, what is the penalty? Is there a financial penalty that is imposed? Is money withheld? Can you demand from a state health minister particular outcomes at particular hospitals?


What happens, Minister, if we see a tragic situation occur in a public hospital in a month's time after this legislation receives royal assent? How does that differ from your response today? What is the purpose of this legislation if you cannot direct change in our public hospitals? What is the purpose, if you have surrendered every aspect of responsibility that the Commonwealth wanted from this piece of legislation and you have provided that to the state and territory ministers? What has all of this debate been about over the course of the last three or four years, where the Labor Party have said that they want to fix public hospitals? That is a promise that has long been abandoned.


Can the minister answer the question? If performance does not improve—in fact, if it deteriorates—in a public hospital somewhere in the country, what can she do as a result of this legislation? These are basic questions that the minister continues to refuse to answer. If people can look to this government and see any sincerity in what it is they are proposing by this legislation then I think the minister needs to get to her feet now and answer these reasonable questions so that we can at least have some faith that we are moving forwards and not backwards.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:14):  I think we are going to be in for a very long and unedifying toing and froing, because I am answering the shadow minister's question by explaining to him that this piece of legislation does not deal with financial penalties to the states. It did not when we introduced it into the House and it does not with the amendments that are moved today. This is a fundamental misunderstanding by the shadow minister of the purpose of performance reporting. The purpose of performance reporting is not solely to be able to deal with one isolated, tragic incident that might occur in a particular hospital. We all know that the reality of people being unwell and presenting at hospitals can have tragic consequences. This is about moving beyond one isolated, tragic circumstance and looking at how we actually lift the standard across the board, across hospital services and across each and every hospital in the country. This sets up a system that enables us to provide information that is collected at arm's length and rigorously checked and therefore can be held up to the states, as systems managers order the local hospital networks to say: 'This is your performance. Look how it compares to everybody else's. You need to lift your game, and we will give you resources to do this and we'll do a whole range of other things.'


The shadow minister for health cannot come in here and ignore every other part of the health reform bill and use this as an opportunity to have a general spray at the government. I know he does not agree with a whole range of things. Frankly, I am a little bit surprised to hear him say that he is now a big advocate of the reforms that were proposed by Prime Minister Rudd, because I seem to remember him and his leader in here ranting and raving, opposing them. Now that an agreement has been struck with every state and territory leader—which is different from but maintains the fundamentals that were put forward by Prime Minister Rudd—they are now actually advocates for that.


Those opposite have no idea what sort of health policy they would adopt if they were in government. They did not take any policy to the last election and they are not formulating any that they are making clear here. Whilst I am happy to answer genuine questions about matters that relate to this bill and the amendments, it is not an opportunity to raise each and every other issue. I cannot be clearer in answering the question: this bill and these amendments do not go to any financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:16):  If we could see something new in this debate that provided us with some promise, some hope—even a slight glimmer—we would be happy, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson. I think what the Minister for Health and Ageing has just done is bell the cat on what a failure this bill is. If members of the Australian public read this bill, the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011, they would look at the words 'National Health Performance Authority' and presumably, like me, think it was about the performance of our public hospitals and an authority that would improve that performance. But what the minister has basically just said is that what they are doing—again, in true Labor style—is creating yet another health bureaucracy. This was the great failing of the state Labor premiers: every time they received more money in Health, they did not put it into doctors, nurses or beds; they put it into new bureaucracies. The fact is that this is what is happening at a federal level.


This is a new bureaucracy, a toothless tiger. It is going to gather statistics and look at poor performance and, in the end, do nothing about it. That is, I think, the best way to sum up this government's approach not just to health but to the whole running of government. This government has lurched from one policy disaster to the next, and now that dangerous disease has infected the health portfolio. This is a government that promised to increase performance, but at every turn—and we see the evidence in black and white in these 29 amendments—we see that they are not going to do anything more than give additional and overriding powers to the state premiers.


I want to take the House to government amendment (7), which abolishes or strikes out the previous section, which had additional provisions about reports. Basically, there is a whole section that has been rewritten. Subsection (6) of the amendment reads:


If the report indicates poor performance by:


(a)   a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or


(b)   a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory;


then, at least 15 days before completing the preparation of the report, the Performance Authority must give a copy of the final draft of the report to the manager of the network or hospital.


But listen to this:


The manager of the network or hospital is not entitled to give the Performance Authority any comments about the final draft.


The government have gone completely insane with their proposed 29 amendments. This amendment takes away any meaningful capacity, once they have identified a poor performance, to do anything about it. That is why even the No. 1 ticket holder for this government, our friend the member for Lyne, says that this is a watering-down, this is bad policy and these amendments make bad policy worse. I think this is an opportunity for the member for Lyne and others to vote against these bad amendments. We will be voting against this bill because we believe that these amendments make a bad bill worse.



Ms Roxon interjecting—




Mr DUTTON:
  That is the problem that this minister has. She has absolutely no capacity to deliver what is said publicly. There are other amendments which are worthy of noting, but in many parts they basically go towards withdrawing the minister's own capacity. I take the House to amendment (11), which alters section 93 of the bill. Subsection (1) says:


The Performance Authority CEO is to be appointed by the Minister.


That is in the bill in its original form. In the amendment, 'minister' has been struck out, with the performance authority CEO now to be appointed by the performance authority. Subsection (3) says:


Before appointing a person as the Performance Authority CEO, the Minister must consult the Performance Authority.


The minister, who has carriage of policy in this area, under the original bill had the power to make the appointment and was required to consult the performance authority on that. Otherwise, the minister was not overwhelmed with considerations; she just had to consult them. But government amendment (12) strikes out the words 'the minister must consult the performance authority' and inserts in its place the words:




Performance Authority must consult the Minister.





The minister does not have final say. The minister can provide some sort of feedback or response, like she is some sort of subservient public servant providing advice to a minister. The relationship has been flipped and it completely undermines this process.

Dr Southcott:
  I am on my feet.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes, but I have put the question. I think the ayes have it. Is a division required?




Mr Baldwin:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I will seek to dissent from your ruling. Clearly, the member was on his feet seeking the call.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member was not on his feet seeking the call so I put the question.




Mr Baldwin:
  Then I will seek to dissent from your ruling.




Mr Dutton:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, if it would help the course of the debate, I think in the circumstances it is reasonable to hear from the shadow parliamentary secretary for health in a succinct way and this is the process. That would preclude other courses.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I understand the spirit in which that is offered. The fact is that the member for Boothby was sitting down. I therefore called for the division. For a member to rise after a division having been called, they are not entitled to get the call and to speak.




Dr Southcott:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, we have not gone into a division. We are in the consideration in detail stage. We are still discussing the bill and the minister had had no chance to respond to the issues raised by the shadow minister.




Ms Roxon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order, if I might contribute here, it would be a very unusual process and it is no doubt provoked by the toing and froing. I do not think it is in the House's interest for there to be a dissent from a Speaker's ruling. I am comfortable—



Mr Dutton interjecting—




Ms Roxon:
  If you would actually listen to what I am about to say, it might be helpful. For once, it will take two seconds for you to sit quietly while I say it was probably in the House's interest to be able to hear any other speakers, but I do think it is timely to bring this debate to a close. The shadow minister has spoken probably 10 times and not raised anything new. The member for Boothby has not spoken. It is an awkward position because the Deputy Speaker rightly put the question when no-one was on their feet. But I am certainly comfortable, if it assists the House and the chair, for members to be able to make contributions. We are not seeking to stop that but, ultimately, the contributions should be about this debate and then we should bring the debate to a conclusion and allow the vote to be taken.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If the member for Paterson wishes to withdraw his dissent, I will allow further discussion on the question that the amendments be agreed to.




Mr Baldwin:
  I withdraw, given your statement, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I call the member for Boothby.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (11:25):  In speaking to the government amendments, I am interested in amendment (7) and the scope of the report. Specifically, what this amendment talks about is the reports prepared by the National Health Performance Authority which will indicate poor performance by any of the following entities or facilities, and it goes on. Specifically under this section it talks about 'any other body or organisation that provides healthcare services'. My question to the minister is: does this encompass primary healthcare services which are delivered by the state governments? Does this cover the ambulance services which are covered by state and territory legislation? Does it cover, for example, the child and adolescent mental health services which are covered at the state level? Does it cover any other primary care services which have been areas of responsibility for states? Most importantly of all, does it cover general practice?


The RACGP have been particularly interested in this issue. I am seeking clarification on this because the clarification is not there in the bill. It says in this proposed amendment by the government, which is amendment (7), to clause 62(1)(e), 'any other body or organisation that provides health care services'. I am asking the minister: does it cover any of the organisations which I have mentioned? What is the scope of the reports prepared by the performance authority? Do they cover general practice? Do they cover those primary healthcare services which are currently delivered by state governments and which are enshrined in state and territory legislations?


My other question on this is: does the minister require the permission of the state or territory minister for health in those areas which are state primary healthcare services, state-run community healthcare services, state-run community mental health care services and state-run ambulance services and are they covered by the scope of these reports?

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:28):  I am happy to answer a question on an issue for debate which is actually on the topic of this legislation and amendments. As is set out clearly in the detail of these amendments, the bodies that the Health Performance Authority will report on are public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. As the member for Boothby would know, Medicare Locals do have a remit which goes broadly across a particular community and will include the level of services, for example, provided by GPs in the community. It is not a reporting function about individual GPs, if that is the question that you are asking.


On the question of the scope to report on other state funded services, for example ambulance services that have never been included as part of the health system although they are obviously a vital part of how the health system works, they are not captured by this reporting. There is a provision, as the member for Lyne mentioned, that COAG can agree to extend the remit of the Health Performance Authority, so it might in its negotiations decide that X, Y and Z in the future should also be reported upon, and that would be something that the performance authority then would be able to do. It has been created by an agreement of COAG. This legislation gives force to that agreement struck by COAG. Its reach and remit does not extend beyond that agreement unless there is a future agreement that extends it.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (11:30):  I am seeking further clarification on the same amendment—amendment (7). Proposed section 62(1) talks about the scope of the reports prepared by the performance authority and specifically about the entities or facilities which it can report on and it says in paragraph (e):


any other body or organisation that provides health care services.


As we stand here today with the current COAG agreements, are there any bodies or organisations that are covered by this paragraph? Is this just a catch-all paragraph that will allow any future decisions of COAG to include things? Does it include, for example, local government authorities that are offering immunisation services? Does it cover, for example, the Royal District Nursing Service? Does it cover things like home visits by nurses as well? I am seeking clarification from the minister as to the scope of proposed paragraph (e), which states:


any other body or organisation that provides health care services.


On reading it, it could be extremely broad. From what the minister has said, it is not envisaged that a number of the areas I have mentioned—such as the state primary healthcare services and general practice—are included by this paragraph. So what is included by this paragraph?

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:31):  Again my question relates to the scope of amendment (7) and proposed section 62(1)(a) that covers the local hospital network. Mindful that data is already collected by the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and by the COAG Reform Council around performance measures in hospitals—and obviously the AIHW performs an important role—I want to know what is in this legislation to avoid duplication of data collection, collecting data that has different baselines and benchmarks collected from different periods and collecting data that is unable to be compared accurately. What are the arrangements between the four bodies I mentioned to ensure that that reporting is harmonised so we can make sense of different reports, minimise the overlap and ensure there are not data omissions? Finally, which of these NHPA rated responsibilities for data collection could not have been done already by those existing three bodies?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (11:33):  I will deal with both of those contributions. I refer the member for Boothby to amendment (5), which requires COAG agreement to extend the scope. Amendment (7) deals with the way reporting works but not the scope of what else can be reported. I think that should satisfy his request for clarification.


The member for Bowman raised a very legitimate question about the range of data that is already collected and also concerns about timely data and comparable data. One of the big changes that have been agreed to by the states and territories as part of this negotiation and the introduction of the performance authority is the streamlining of reporting so it is more timely, comparable across jurisdictions and able to be provided hospital by hospital. The Health Performance Authority will work with those existing datasets and in some areas create new datasets to be able to do its job properly. So a range of things that were not available before will be available when the Health Performance Authority is able to do its work properly. We will have truly comparable and timely data about each hospital across jurisdictions.


Health ministers have already agreed to do some work on how we can streamline all of the different existing datasets. We do not have any interest in reporting for reporting sake. We want the reporting to be better in having more indicators and being more comparable across the country. Whilst everyone said we should look at what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects and we should look at what is already provided for reporting in each of the states, we also are moving forward on agreed national reporting measures, for example, on infection rates. In October this year for the first time hospital-by-hospital infection rates will be published on the My Hospitals website. None of that could have happened if we did not have agreement on how we are going to progress with all of this performance reporting.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (11:35):  My question relates to the My Hospitals website. The My Hospitals website has information about the sorts of patients that are seen in emergency departments, waiting times and waiting lists in various subspecialties within each hospital. In terms of the scope of the reports that are to be prepared by the performance authority, what consideration has been given to looking at things which relate to quality and safety in the local hospital networks, the public hospitals and the private hospitals? The minister mentioned in her previous answer looking at the infection rates for the first time. It sounds like a good idea to have an idea of the infection rates in an individual hospital. What measures are proposed by the performance authority to look at quality and safety: mortality rates within a certain period in a hospital, mortality rates after discharge, complication rates from surgery and any complications that occur during the admissions?

I might remind the House that the shadow minister was briefed on these amendments and, as I say, less than an hour ago told us that he supported them. I am not questioning that other members have legitimate concerns. I am happy for them to be provided with a briefing. But the truth is that the opposition have indicated they oppose these amendments now, although an hour ago they did not. I do not think that it will serve this parliament much more to continue this ongoing Q&A about a whole range of different issues.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:38):  I thank the minister for answering the first of my two questions. She emphasised that there is an effort through amendment (7) to harmonise the data collection and reporting. The second part of my question is: what parts of the work that has been assigned to the authority could not have been done by the existing structures already in place? I go back to the question: can she explicitly explain? This is the basis for the entire legislation and also of course it begs the question: if we need to set up a fifth authority to monitor the other four are we going to be back here again setting up a sixth one to monitor the previous five? What is it with the COAG Reform Council, the AIHW and the Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care that makes them unable to do the very things that have been described in this legislation that are being assigned to the authority? That comes under the scope of the work in amendment (7).

I stand by all of those comments and I refer the shadow minister to those if he is genuinely interested in it. The government has no more comments to make on these amendments.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (11:39):  This goes to amendment (7), which talks about the reports prepared by the performance authority, and specifically 'if the report indicates poor performance by any of the following entities or facilities'. While it might be very clear what would constitute poor performance for local hospital networks, public hospitals and private hospitals, I am seeking clarification from the minister as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation which would be caught in the scope of amendment (7). It seems that while primary healthcare organisations—or, as they have been called, Medicare Locals—have some role in the area of service delivery, in that they are going to be taking responsibility for after-hours care, they will not principally be in the front line of service delivery. The department has assured us that the primary healthcare organisations will not be fund-holding organisations, as we see in similar organisations in the United Kingdom or in New Zealand.


So, given that the scope of the primary healthcare organisations is still a little ill-defined, I am seeking clarification as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary health organisation. Would it be that they are not offering enough continuous professional development? Would it be that they are not holding enough seminars? Would it be that they are not liaising well enough with allied health or practice nurses? I am just seeking clarification from the minister as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation as is envisaged in amendment (7).

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:41):  It is with a great deal of regret, I think, that the minister now refuses even to respond. This is a very important parliamentary process.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Dickson, and everybody, should realise that consideration in detail is not question time. 




Dr Southcott:
  It is consideration in detail.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is consideration in detail. There is actually no requirement under the standing orders for the minister to respond. The chair has given a great deal of latitude in this regard.




Mr DUTTON:
  I do think that it is a very important parliamentary process to be able to consider in detail amendments moved by the government. These are important questions because they go to the very soul of how our health system will operate into the next generation. This is a government that proclaimed that they wanted to fix public hospitals. They have created all these new bureaucracies. They have now capitulated and weakened even the original process that they put forward. They now have 29 amendments on the books. Yet, remarkably, the government will not go to the detail of the amendments, either because they do not know the detail or because they are embarrassed by the detail.


To go to your point, Madam Deputy Speaker, nobody pretends that this is about question time; but what does consideration in detail mean if the coalition cannot ask questions about the detail of the amendments? These are not flippant, tidying-up, clerical error type amendments that you sometimes see in this place. These are substantive amendments, 29 in total, and they completely water down, completely dilute, the original intent of the legislation. In some places whole sections have been struck out and new words have been submitted, and it is quite appropriate for us to ask detailed questions about why that has taken place. But, as importantly, it is incumbent upon the minister to answer in detail those considerations. To sit there silently and not contribute to the debate I think is a poor reflection on the minister and also shows the minister's contempt for you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the chair in this place, and for the parliamentary process. We have reasonable questions that we want to continue to ask. We are frustrated by the process—there is no question about that—because right from the start the questions that were put have not properly been answered. We asked the minister reasonable questions from the commencement of this consideration in detail. The minister has plucked out a couple of questions and answered those, but the detail has not been forthcoming from the government. As I say, people need to ask the question: why wouldn't reasonable questions be answered by this minister? If this minister had an involvement in the construct of these amendments, why wouldn't this minister be prepared to step up and defend the amendments? If the coalition has questions to ask about why significant changes have been made—necessarily it seems at the hands of the premiers in order to do a deal by a desperate Prime Minister—why wouldn't the health minister in accord with the standing procedures in this place answer those reasonable questions?


This is not a process where a minister can come in, with due respect to the minister, and somehow answer the questions that suit the minister's own knowledge but completely ignore those questions for which she has no substantive response. I think it is for the minister to answer the questions that have been put but not yet answered. It is incumbent upon the minister so that there is faith in this process for the doctors and nurses who are waiting to see whether or not this will substantially change their workplace and whether or not this is going to be the reform that people thought they voted for in 2007 and 2010. The minister's accountability is at question here. I think it is absolutely absurd if the minister continues to refuse to partake in this debate because we will continue to contribute and put questions until this minister answers the reasonable questions that have been put. If this process has to continue on until question time, it will.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (11:46):  The more I read these amendments, the more questions they pose. In terms of amendment (7) I do have some questions about the reports which will be prepared by the performance authority. The amendments go into quite a lot of detail about what must be done if the report indicates poor performance, the consultation that must be done with the state and territory health ministers and that they must be given an opportunity to respond.


In reading the legislation and reading the amendments it is not clear what happens to the reports after they have been prepared. My question to the minister is: is there any requirement for these reports to be made public within a certain period of time? This is especially important in the area of quality and safety—there have been disasters in Australia, for example in the Bundaberg Hospital, and we do not want to see a repeat of what happened at Bundaberg Hospital. We need to know, if reports show poor performance in the local hospital network or in a public hospital, that these reports will ultimately be made public. Amendment (7) talks a lot about the consultation and the periods of consultation that are required but my question here is: what is the requirement on making these reports public? Is there a specific time line here? We would like to know when we will be able to see them and when these reports will be made public. I go back to my previous questions that still have not been answered on the area of primary healthcare organisations.

Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  They have not been answered, dopey.

(

Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  I withdraw. I thank the minister for her answers to my earlier questions, but I still have an unanswered question about what constitutes poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation. Would this be in the area of the delivery of after-hours services? Would it be if they are not sufficiently making networks with allied health practitioners or practice nurses—what would really constitute that? I also am particularly interested in quality and safety. I would like to know what quality and safety information will be prepared and made available to the public in these reports that are being prepared by the performance authority.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:50):  I raise from a tactical point of view what is becoming increasingly clear to everyone in this chamber. I raise it in defence of parliamentary processes and I raise it as, most people would know, a strong advocate of MPs' rights—that is, that the arch enemy of parliamentary processes and an MP's rights is the filibuster. What we are increasingly seeing before us is a tactic to filibuster. I do not know why. That is up to the coalition to defend, but the indication from the member for Dickson that he wants to push this through to question time  and the indication from the member for Boothby that he is only just reading these amendments clearly demonstrate that this is a tactic over and above a true and genuine parliamentary process of inquiry into amendments before the House.


I do not think I have ever supported the gag, I would have to go back and check my record, but I am not far away from actually moving it. I would hope that we have genuine questions being asked, we have genuine responses and we wrap up what has been at least a 50-minute conversation with very little contribution now to genuine consideration of these amendments.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (11:51):  I want to address briefly those remarks and again I am sure they are held sincerely. There is no filibustering going on. The fact is that we have asked questions, Member for Lyne, and we have not received adequate responses. The member for Lyne may well be satisfied with what the government has put up. He has expressed some concerns and he is going to take a certain course of action. I respect that. It is his right to do that as a member of this parliament. We have not sought to cut short his contribution, and nor would we.


But we have serious misgivings about this bill. Many of the reasons that you stated in your earlier contribution, Member for Lyne, cause us even more grief because we think that this government, by moving its 29 amendments, is without precedent in this public debate about health. They are substantive amendments, as I say—they are not 'tidy up' amendments—and they deserve an adequate and fulsome response from the minister. So, yes, we are frustrated, as I said before. There is no question about that.


The Bills Digest talks about these points. It says:


It is unlikely that the Authority, as a single entity, will be able to achieve these objectives …


Does that not cause the House concern? It goes on to say:


This Bill does not provide any details on how the three national governance agencies will work together to deliver improvements in the Australian health system.


That is exactly the point that we are trying to make. These are reasonable questions asked by the people from the library who prepare the Bills Digest. They are not members of the coalition, they are not Independents, they are not people who support or oppose the government—




Mr Baldwin:
  They're truly independent.




Mr DUTTON:
  These are truly independent people asking these questions. So why would it be unreasonable for us to ask these questions? More importantly, why would it be unreasonable for the minister to answer the questions? The Bills Digest goes on to say:


It is not yet clear how the ‘upstream’ National Health Performance Authority proposed in this Bill will connect with ‘downstream’ factors …


That goes directly to questions being asked by both of the shadow parliamentary secretaries for health on this issue, so those questions are completely reasonable. The Bills Digest goes on to say:




This Bill … does not give the Authority any enforcement powers …



That is exactly the point we were trying to make before. What penalties are in place? If the government, having collected all this data, having created this new bureaucracy, having spent all of this money, are not happy with the way in which the data is trending, what can they do? This is a basic question and it has been raised not just by us but by the Parliamentary Library, the member for Lyne and others. The Bills Digest goes on:


It is unclear how many primary health care providers will be monitored directly by the National Health Performance Authority.


That, again, goes to questions that were reasonably asked before. I do not think that a guillotining in this situation should even be canvassed, frankly, until these questions have been properly answered. For the minister to stay in her seat and refuse to contribute answers to reasonable questions is unacceptable.


In conclusion, the Digest makes a number of other points, and I think it goes to the concerns, as I have said before, of many stakeholders—not just those of the coalition and the member for Lyne. Those stakeholders have a real interest, as do many of us, in making sure that these reforms are tangible, are meaningful and achieve the aspirations that many of us in this place, including the member for Lyne, have spoken about both privately and publicly. That is why I think it is completely reasonable for us to put these questions and, most importantly, for the minister to respond. It is incumbent upon the minister to at least make some contribution to try and answer what are reasonable questions.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (11:56):  I want to make an observation. I have been in this parliament off and on for 24 years. I have seen different tactics used in this place to try and thwart debate. I have seen filibustering and attempts to change the dynamic. But it is a bit of an affront, given the history of this legislation and the detailed briefings the shadow minister has received around this legislation, to have him and his colleagues doing this. They are genuinely nice people by and large. We get on okay; we can all be mates. But I think it is worth while for them to ask themselves why they are doing this at this point. What is your attitude to the legislation—do you support the health reform process or not? If you do not, if you plan to vote against the legislation in any event, given that the amendments will have already been voted on, why are we participating in this farce? I think it raises serious questions about the judgments which are being made. 


I have been in my office engaging in meetings since the last division and I have had on in the background the parliamentary debates. With great respect to the shadow minister, I have not seen the minister demure; I have seen her fully engaged in the discussion. She has chosen, rightfully, to hear you out and to provide the capacity in other places—because this will be dealt with in the Senate as well—to deal with this. If your concerns are genuine you could have raised them in direct dialogue, through the process of briefing. You have not done that, and today we see you, after this legislation has been in place for a number of months, reading from the Bills Digest. It makes one wonder what your game is. I say to the shadow minister—with great respect, Madam Deputy Speaker—that, if he is genuine about a discussion around these issues, this is not the tactic to adopt. We expect that, when these amendments are voted on, they will be opposed by the opposition. So what is this process all about? I suspect that the shadow minister, if he were in our shoes, would be asking the very same question. I say to the shadow minister—and I heard the member for Lyne, whose views I respect—that this is culminating in a filibuster. I say to the shadow minister that it is in our best interests that this debate be concluded. Vote against the amendments if that is your desire. They will be dealt with somewhere else and we will have a further discussion. This is not the end of the debate, as you know. If you were concerned about the content of the Bills Digest, why was it not raised previously? You have had plenty of opportunity to do so. I support the views being expressed by the member for Lyne. It is about time you took a mature approach to this discussion and conceded that we should finish this part of it and get on to the next stage.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (12:01):  I, for one, am happy to be judged on the quality of the questions asked and by our scrutiny of the conduct of the minister, who is refusing to answer these questions. Already, one out of two questions has not been answered, so I focus again on amendment (7), which involves proposed subsections 62(5), (6), (7) and (8). My great concern with 62(5) is that, apart from the obligation upon the performance authority minister to give a copy, invite comments and have regard, after that this legislation and this particular amendment are silent on what occurs next.


In 62(6), I am concerned about the reference to the manager of the network, who, having received a report 15 days prior to its completion indicating that there is poor performance, is not entitled to give any comments on that final draft. I think it is a fair question and the public is entitled to expect an answer as to why it is in the public interest for that not to occur.


We would like a clear understanding of 62(7) and (8), given that over this four-year process these were only released weeks ago. Before completing a report, the performance authority is at liberty to consult with any persons or bodies it considers appropriate, yet, if that report does indicate poor performance, Minister, the performance authority must not consult and is not otherwise obliged to observe any requirements of procedural fairness.


Minister, my third question to you is this: regarding 62(7) and (8), why, in the preparation of a report, is it appropriate for the performance authority to consult with any person or body it wishes but if that report, particularly focused on a local hospital network or a territory hospital, indicates poor performance the performance authority must not consult, having, prior to that report being prepared, been at liberty to consult? I think it is a very important distinction that needs to be clarified in this consideration in detail stage.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:13):  by leave—I move together amendments (1) to (3), as circulated in my name:


(1) Schedule 1, item 130, page 46 (line 23), omit ""report"", substitute ""reports"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 130, page 46 (line 24), before ""The Performance Authority"", insert ""(1)"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 130, page 46 (after line 29), at the end of section 111, add:


   (2) The Performance Authority must, as soon as practicable after 30 September next following the end of each financial year, prepare and give to the Minister, for presentation to the Parliament, a report consisting of a compilation of the reports prepared by the Performance Authority under paragraph 60(1)(a) during that year


   (3) The Minister must present the report described in subsection (2) to the Parliament as soon as is practicable. 


Note:   See also section 34C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which contains extra rules about annual reports.


Very briefly, as explained previously, this is about getting reporting requirements to the parliament as well as to the minister and to the various state ministers and to COAG so that there is some public accountability attached to the annual reports of the performance authority. I understand it has the support of both sides. I hope that remains the case, and that therefore everyone can get to lunch as quickly as possible.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:02):  I had only 30 seconds last night. I will continue on the substance of the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 and the range of amendments that are emerging not only from me but also from the coalition and the government, which has some substantial amendments. I am not opposed to establishing a national health performance authority as a concept. I think it is an important contribution to national health and hospital reform that this House and Australia have been chasing now for at the very least three years. To have in concept form a body to monitor the performance of all aspects of that health and hospital system is a sensible and much needed part of the oversight and scrutiny in regard to the health reform agenda on behalf of Australian taxpayers.


However, having said that, we are seeing before our eyes now some changes with regard to what was introduced in this parliament under the guise of the Health Performance Authority and now, with substantial government amendments, some substantial changes to the concept that was introduced, arguably even to the point where we could build a case that it is a separate bill altogether in structure. The amendments are so substantial in the way they change this from what started out as a national performance authority to what is now a gaggle of states authority. The command and control really is residing once again back in the hands of the states and territories. Back in 2008, when we started this journey, really largely the point of the exercise was to find a way for the Commonwealth to directly fund that resource and give the local health district networks or their equivalents around Australia much greater command, control and autonomy on the ground. That was the model when this bill was introduced in the House in the last session. The principle still stood and health and hospital reform generally was looking to still be on track.


I urge every member and anyone listening to this debate to focus not necessarily on the bill itself but on the 29 government amendments to their own legislation that they put before the House several months ago. The concern is in those amendments and how much has been given with regard to state clawback and the use of COAG as a Trojan Horse on behalf of the states once again wanting to get command and control of a system that they considered was under threat through what was, and hopefully still is, a very good and important reform for Australia in tidying up and essentially nationalising our health and hospital system in Australia.


In relation to the amendments before the House, the coalition's second reading amendment will be the first we will deal with. It states the coalition's desire for the House to decline to give the bill a second reading until:


(1)      provisions establishing the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, including its functions and responsibilities, are presented to the House for its consideration …


I can understand the coalition's desire to want all of the health and hospital reform brought in globo and have us deal with it all at once. I hope that is the desire. From my reading of this, I think the link is tenuous at best to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Health and hospital reform in some form is happening in a range of bills and my reading of this second reading amendment is that it is the continuation of the policy of wanting to be slow and difficult on all policy if not in control of the government benches. So I will not be supporting the second reading amendment from the coalition.


With regard to the in-detail stage, I will be putting forward an amendment concerning the reporting requirements of the health reform agenda and the National Health Performance Authority. This was put to the House committee that looked at this issue with regard to how the authority reports: does it report directly to the minister or should it also have some obligations to report to parliament? My perspective—and I am pleased that the House committee also supported these considerations—is that the authority should have responsibility to report as soon as practicable to the parliament so that reporting is not part of a game by the executive to release bad news the day before Christmas or to get up to any other tricks that everyone in this place knows can get played when governments are behaving badly. The authority should have some tight time frames for reporting and some clear and specific obligations for reporting to parliament and therefore to all of the 150 members and indirectly to 150 communities around Australia. I am hopeful of support for the amendment. I think that it is a small but important reflection on the role and status that parliament itself plays in the transparency process that delivers better policy outcomes for all of us.


There will also be a batch of 29 amendments that the government is introducing to their own legislation. It is here that I have most concern, and I will speak again in the in-detail stage. This is really where the dumbing down of this legislation is taking place, in my view. As I said at the start, whilst we are regarding these amendments as being an inch better than where we were before, we are still a mile short of where we could or should have been with health reform and the agenda that has been going on for the last three years. That is where the disappointment lies, in the lost opportunity of reform and allowing a performance authority, unfettered, with independence, to truly assess data from all states and territories of all hospitals regardless of who the direct authority is, so that we can get some direct benchmarking and some clear direction on who is or is not performing in health and hospital services today. In my view, the amendments that the government is introducing are tying the hands of the performance authority and really making it subservient to the states' authority. 


That has been a big part of the problem to date that I thought the reform agenda was trying to resolve, and in the whole negotiation of trying to get all the states and territories on board there has actually been a compromise too far. I understand that negotiation and compromise have their place but I do not think that the balance has been struck. I think that compromise with the states has really given command and control back to the state and territory authorities to potentially continue to behave in an inefficient and less than value-for-money way than we desire.


I think I heard another speaker talk about the performance authority as a consequence being a 'toothless tiger'. I hope that is not the case and that is why I will continue to support the substance of the bill, because we have inched forward slightly. But I do think that it is a neutered tiger. I think that through this process it has lost a lot of its authority to truly assess the performance of health and hospital services across the board in Australia on behalf of Australian people with data that is given to the parliament and to the people without fear or favour, without any washing by any states or territories, without any tricks or political games with talk of various turnarounds of work schedules or how early the documents have to be given to state and territory health ministers so that they can get their guns loaded in response and without the use of COAG as the body to really hide a Trojan Horse for this re-emergence of state and territory command and control. I am very uncomfortable with those government amendments and will not be supporting those when it comes down to the in-detail stage.


I hope—and I flag and I warn—that this whole exercise is different from the recently signed health and hospital reform agreement documents and that this is not symptomatic of what is to come through legislation. I hope there is not going to be a range of legislation that sees the states claw back control three years after the beginning of a very good and very important reform agenda.


In 2008, in the previous parliament when the government was a majority government, I was still a very strong advocate for the importance of this reform. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, sat in the tea room of a local hospital, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, and talked at length with the medical staff at the hospital and listened closely to discussion on the importance of the principles of the two Es—efficiency and equity. That is all I and communities such as mine have sought through this process, namely, efficiency being rewarded in the system and equity. Those services performing over and above should be rewarded. Currently in the funding models they are not, so that inefficiency, in many ways, gets rewarded. The resource distribution model controlled by the states does not deliver equity, particularly to rural and remote communities and to high-growth areas. Both are traditionally behind equity in the delivery of resources and funding.


The National Rural Health Alliance put a figure of $1 billion a year based on a failed model of the states resource distribution formulas not making it to where, on the state's own funding formulas, it should. It is a disgrace. It is one of the great failures of Australian public policy at the moment and it is the fundamental reason that reform is so important and that we need to be eyeballing the states rather than being subservient to them.


What I am seeing in these amendments that have come through whilst this bill is before the House is in my view too much compromise with those that are too much to blame for the problem—the very reason that we are reforming. So I would hope this is not the first of many. I hope this is a one-off where, for a whole range of reasons that I am probably not aware of, the states got a great big win through the range of amendments that have come in and Australian taxpayers as a consequence in my view got a great big loss.


I would hope that in upcoming legislation attached to the health and hospital reform agenda we do see the Commonwealth actually stepping up and sticking true to what the reform agenda was in 2008—that is, to start to have a Commonwealth funding authority working directly with local command and control. It is a sensible concept; let's deliver it.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) (10:16):  I would like to thank the very many members who have spoken on this bill from both sides of the House. It would be fair to say from listening to the contributions that people feel very strongly about making sure that our hospitals can deliver for local communities. The member for Lyne, the final speaker on the bill, is a very passionate advocate for making sure that his local community is well looked after. I can indicate to the member for Lyne that the government will be supporting his amendment when the opportunity comes for that. However, I do need to indicate to him and to the House that we fundamentally disagree with his assessment of what the amendments mean. I will be addressing that in more detail when I move those amendments.


Let me go to the summing-up and deal with those issues first and then for the convenience of the House I might mention that we intend to move the amendments together as a group. The National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 establishes a key element of the Australian government's health reform agenda. (Quorum formed) I am sure that members are delighted to be here to know that the National Health Performance Authority will act as a watchdog over the performance of both public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. It will regularly report comparative information on the performance of these bodies and give the public information in respect of consistently poor performance. Performance monitoring will support the improvement in healthcare delivery, safety and quality by all of these services. Poor performance will be identified to allow for remediation and superior performance will be identified to allow for the dissemination of best practice approaches.


The establishment of the authority is a key part of the health reform agreement signed by all states and territories this month. We then introduced the legislation into this House in order to meet the time frames of the February COAG meeting but also were open to consider amendments which might be suggested from the states, the committee inquiry in this place or the Senate committee inquiry. State and territory health ministers agreed to the detail of the legislation and how it will interact with their health systems at a meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on 7 June. Amendments to reflect the detail of this agreement were distributed by the government in the last session of parliament.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Would those members who are still standing out of their place and having little discussions either do that outside or resume their place in the chamber.




Ms ROXON:
  I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. These also reflect amendments suggested by the Senate committee inquiry. The amendments will bring about a firm partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in their endeavour to deliver better healthcare services to all Australians. The amendments to the bill will enshrine the independence of the authority giving it the ability to appoint its own chief executive officer as well as the power to remove that person in the case of poor performance or misconduct. Amendments will also foster greater cooperation with the states through consultation on the authority's strategic plan, consultation about reports of poor performance and the designation of local hospital networks. This shows that the government is committed to work with all jurisdictions on health reform and deliver an outcome that will put more information in the hands of Australian patients. I thank those members who have made constructive contributions to this debate. However, unfortunately, a number of members of the opposition have used their time to simply complain and criticise rather than to outline any plans they would use to deliver improvements to the health system. They have been consistently silent on their vision, except for a policy to wreak havoc on and cut health services.


It is a fact that this bill delivers on reforms that the Leader of the Opposition once talked about but never had the capacity to deliver. On 9 May 2008 he said the Howard government:


… would have empowered the public by requiring the states to publish detailed information about the specific performance of hospitals.


… … …




In return for continued funding increases, each state would have been required to provide detailed quarterly reports on the precise number and type of services delivered at each public hospital and to provide detailed quarterly reports on adverse events at each hospital.



So, while the opposition has an 'oppose everything' strategy, by not supporting this bill they will be opposing something that their leader himself once called for—although did not achieve in 11½ years.


We are now seeing the opposition, having no ideas of its own, continuing to play the easy game of trying to frustrate the government's significant reforms. This was highlighted earlier this year when the shadow minister took a similar approach in regard to the bill to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, a body originally established, temporarily, by the Leader of the Opposition. Now we have had a bill before the House for some months, scrutinised and endorsed by committees in both the House and the Senate, and the best the opposition can come up with is saying that we should sit on it and not establish this important watchdog agency.


The shadow minister clearly knows that this agency is a key part of the health reform agenda and that this legislation has been endorsed by all the states and territories, including three Liberal states. He also clearly knows that this agency will have a watchdog role in scrutinising the performance of health services, whereas the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have a completely different role, an important technical and financial role, in determining the official price for hospital services. Rather than trying to wreck every bill, it might be worth the opposition's time to develop at least one health policy of its own.


Our government is determined to pursue the tough reforms, particularly when they involve more transparency for the Australian public. Standing on the shoulders of My School, My Hospitals and the work of the National Health Performance Authority, this agency will deliver for Australians unprecedented levels of nationally comparable information. It will also be a watchdog to detect poor performance in our public and private hospitals and primary care sector. I thank members for their contributions, my officials for their hard work and the states for their cooperation with these reforms. Question put:

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (13:45):  Over the past couple of weeks I have had the opportunity to meet with many community groups within the McPherson electorate. I would like to take this opportunity today to speak about and congratulate the work of one of those groups. I had the pleasure to meet with ladies from the Probus Club of Elanora at their August meeting held at the Currumbin RSL. I was warmly greeted by Margaret Eley, who is responsible for coordinating guest speakers for the club, and by their President, Josie Taylor. I have to say that my attention was immediately caught by a beautiful quilt that will be raffled in the near future. It did of course lead to a discussion about the fun and friendship offered and gained by being part of quilting groups and groups of that nature.


The Elanora Probus Club makes a great contribution to the community within my electorate. This not-for-profit organisation serves the local retiree community by providing opportunities to increase wellbeing, both mentally and physically. For local retirees, the Elanora Probus Club offers a social environment where new friendships can be formed within a fun and engaging environment. Members are introduced to retirees from their local community, allowing many new friendships to form. The club also provides the opportunity to meet experts from a range of different fields, including travel, research, history, ancestry and much more. I congratulate and commend the ladies from the Elanora Probus Club on their work. I certainly enjoyed meeting with them. (Time expired)

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (15:20):  The government is spending $25 million of taxpayers' money on advertising its carbon tax, but it is not giving the facts, the details and the impacts and it is not telling the truth about what will happen to Australians, Australian businesses and the Australian economy under this carbon tax, nor is it telling the truth about the alternatives. Let me begin where the Prime Minister left off just a few moments ago. The member for Aston asked about the impact of the carbon tax on Mystique printing. Mystique printing is a carbon neutral business but it will still have electricity bills to pay. Mystique printing is not going to be magically exempt from electricity bills. Mystique printing, like hairdressers, pizza shops, small manufacturing shops around the country and firms of any shape, sort, type or nature that consume electricity or gas, will have higher bills to pay. The Prime Minister would not stand before this House, in the same way that her advertising campaign will not disclose the full facts and the truth to the people of Australia, and give the simple plain truth that Mystique printing will have higher electricity bills—on the government's estimate, 10 per cent alone in the first year. And that is simply on their electricity bills. It is nine per cent alone in the first year on their gas bills and, most significantly, as the New South Wales Treasury modelling has shown, a 15 per cent increase in electricity, debunking the figures provided by the government. That is in the first year, because each year and every year thereafter the cost for firms such as Mystique printing will increase. Each year and every year thereafter the costs for Australian families will increase, but the full scope, scale and nature of the impacts of this tax have not been released, have not been disclosed and have not been given to the Australian people by the government.


Let us start with something very simple. This is the government's modelling. At the top of page 18 of the government's summary modelling document, there is a simple proposition. It says:


Macroeconomic modelling with an initial domestic carbon price of $20 in 2012-13.


Five and a half weeks after the carbon tax was released, this government has yet to release modelling which reflects even the correct carbon price. When your modelling cannot reflect the correct carbon price of $23, which is 15 per cent higher, 5½ weeks after it has been released then you know that something is not right with the government of the day. This government has directly, deliberately and consistently failed to disclose the full detail, the full impact on Australian houses and Australian homes of their system and it has been utterly untruthful in analysing the alternative model available to the Australian people and utterly untruthful in presenting the world as it is today.


So let me begin, when we look at the government's failure to adequately explain its carbon tax, with the cost to families. Nowhere have I seen in any of the numerous television advertisements at taxpayers' expense, in any of the numerous mainstream newspaper advertisements at taxpayers' expense, in any of the local newspaper advertisements at taxpayers' expense or in any of the internet advertisements at taxpayers' expense the simple fact that the average Australian household will pay $515 per year more for their cost of living as a consequence of the carbon tax. There is no recognition that the New South Wales Treasury says it will have a 15 per cent impact on their electricity prices for households—for mums, for dads, for pensioners, for seniors—in the first year of the carbon tax, before increasing each year every year thereafter. 


That is the nature and purpose and intent of this tax: to drive down demand by driving up the cost of living in the hope that a sufficiently punitive price will cause people to shiver through winter and swelter through summer. That is the nature and goal of this particular mechanism. That is what it is designed to do. It is designed to hurt those who are least able to afford it so that they will consume less electricity. That is the structure and the intent.


On numerous occasions the Prime Minister has talked about people consuming the lower cost product. Unfortunately the lower cost, lower carbon product does not exist. The lower the carbon, the higher the cost. What we see is this government intentionally driving up electricity prices. The fundamental problem with what this government is doing is that electricity is an essential service and if you drive up electricity you drive down the quality of life for Australian families. 


But you do not drive down the consumption significantly because people substitute not out of electricity consumption but out of the ordinary day-to-day things. Electricity goes up but consumption barely changes. On every analysis it is a largely inelastic good and so, in real human terms, families suffer. As we see in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, higher electricity prices have not made a material difference to electricity consumption but they have made a dramatic difference to the cost of living for ordinary Australian families.


It goes on from that, though. These things are not set out in the government's carbon tax advertising. The fact is that we are likely to see, as the member for Bennelong has found, that in the city of Ryde $1.8 million of electricity bills for lighting will go up immediately by $270,000, according to the New South Wales Treasury. That $270,000 will either come off services to local ratepayers in the city of Ryde or it will go onto the cost of council rates. There is nothing about that in the government's carbon tax advertising.


Nor is the fact that there will be over $100 million of additional landfill costs to be passed through council rates as a consequence of this tax. There are better ways of doing this that do not involve a massive increase, a $27 billion tax over three years, a $36 billion tax over four years. That is the size and scope and scale of this carbon tax and these are the figures that are missing from the government's carbon tax advertising.


Nor is there reference to the fact that for dairy farmers, on some estimates provided by the industry, the average cost will be $7,000 per year more. Some of that will be passed through to consumers, but in many cases where the vast bulk of production is sent to export markets it is the dairy farmer that will face those costs. The dairy farmer on a struggling farm will meet that cost himself or herself, with the cost going straight back to the family budget and the impact on their viability.


Nor do we see the extraordinary fact that this carbon tax produces approximately 25 per cent of all of the savings that the government claims will be made in terms of emissions. This is the great lie at the heart of the policy and the advertising. Approximately 100 million tonnes—according to the summary indicators document, 101 million tonnes—will be sourced from overseas. According to the deeper modelling document, 94 million tonnes will be sourced from overseas. Let's call it a rounded figure of 100 million tonnes that will be sourced from overseas and that is using abatement purchasing. That is using the very model which this government has attacked, derided, denounced and ridiculed. At the end of the day they have been forced into an abatement purchasing model.


The second thing, though, is that 20 million of their 160 million tonnes comes from an incentive scheme to clean up the power stations. The difference is that we would clean them up and they would close them down. This is the heart of direct action which they have ridiculed, mocked, derided and yet adopted when it comes to the moment. That leaves the carbon tax itself being responsible for about 40 million tonnes of emissions reduction versus business as usual by 2020. What does that mean? It means that the effective cost of carbon for domestic abatement using their tax is well over $160 per tonne. It means that their system, which relies on driving up the price of electricity, is fundamentally economically unsound because it has relied upon either driving down demand by driving up price—but the history of Australian economics in the last 30 years, as Colin Barnett says, is that electricity is an essential service—or changing supply by forcing the closure of coal fired power stations where, unfortunately, their own work shows that a dramatically higher price still would be needed. In other words, their system on their own analysis does not work. Seventy-five per cent of their reduction comes from some form of direct action and 25 per cent of their reduction actually comes from the carbon tax. The carbon tax is entirely superfluous to reducing emissions.


These figures are not included in any of the advertising, which is why it is so execrable. More significantly, when you look at the modelling you see that the $20 per tonne carbon price 5½ weeks later still has not been updated. How can it be, Minister Combet, that you have the wrong carbon price in your modelling? How can it be that the government of Australia has the wrong carbon price in its modelling? It is unacceptable, indefensible and incompetent. Nor has the modelling been reflected to update the fact that its assumption of 100 per cent purchase from overseas sources has been overturned by a political decision to leave it at 50 per cent purchasing from overseas sources. Nor does the modelling indicate the fact that the brown coal buyout is entirely unfunded. They already have a $4.3 billion black hole but, other than some vague reference to the contingency reserves beyond the forward estimates, there is no provisioning for the $2 billion plus that is likely to be the cost of the brown coal buyout. While we have a $10 billion program where we are completely upfront, they have a program which over nine years is likely to be well over $80 billion. What we see is a $4.3 billion black hole to start, another $2 billion that is missing and none of these figures are set out in the carbon tax advertising.


Then this brings me to the extraordinary element which the Leader of the Opposition made reference to today, $3½ billion each year every year from 2020 onwards—it will start at a lower figure before then but it will climb—will be spent on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. That is Australian money going straight offshore each year with a huge impact on our national viability. According to page 72 of the government's own modelling, that figure by 2050 will be 434 million tonnes of certificates at a price in 2010 dollars of $131 at a total cost to the economy of $57 billion or approaching 1½ per cent of GDP, and that is on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders.


The Australian Crime Commission has found that there has been widespread fraud in Europe in relation to these credits. This is not in relation to some emerging economy. In Europe there has been massive fraud using this approach and that is what this government is proposing—1½ per cent of GDP on foreign carbon credits alone, $3½ billion by 2020 on foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders alone. We set out in our policy on day one—which the minister has failed to acknowledge, but I see on page 14 of the direct action policy in big blue headlines the words, 'Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas'—that every dollar of our policy would be spent in Australia.


Obviously, the minister made a false statement to parliament yesterday. He would not defend himself today. We set up from day one that every dollar would be spent in Australia. If the minister is unable to read the document, there it is in big blue letters, 'Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas', every dollar to be spent in Australia. The minister might do the honourable thing and apologise to the House for his express, clear and absolute misstatement yesterday because there is no defending that. He knows it, we know it, the Australian press gallery know it and the Australian people will increasingly know that we have seen deception on a grand scale. But at the bottom line at the end of the day what this government has done is that it has systemically misled the Australian people about the costs to households of the carbon tax, the costs to businesses such as Mystique printing, and the cost to the economy of $3½ billion a year straight to foreign carbon traders.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (15:35):  I appreciate the opportunity to explain the government's policy, but at the outset can I completely repudiate the assertion that was just made by the shadow minister that I had made a false statement to the House. That is completely incorrect and I repudiate it entirely. It was completely unsubstantiated.


On 10 July the government announced a Clean Energy Future package. What we announced was accompanied by a very detailed set of materials outlining a host of the policy issues in detail including Treasury modelling and a number of other materials. At its core were a number of elements. One of them was a carbon pricing mechanism. The carbon price mechanism is an emissions trading scheme that commences with a three-year fixed price period, commencing from 1 July 2012, and from 1 July 2015 it is an internationally linked, fully flexible, emissions trading scheme—that is, it links with international carbon markets. I will return to that issue in time to address some of the comments made by the shadow minister.


There were other important elements of the announcement by the government on 10 July. Within that announcement was very strong support for renewable energy and a number of measures to improve energy efficiency in households and in businesses. A very significant element of the package relates to the land sector, carbon farming and the storage of carbon in the landscape. It is a very comprehensive policy package and I do not think anyone could seriously assert that a considerable amount of detail was not provided to the community. I make that point to repudiate the general statement that the shadow minister was endeavouring to make. The policy material is principally contained in the document Securing a clean energy future. Behind it sits a very comprehensive and credible set of Treasury modelling based upon the scenarios that would appropriately underpin a major policy initiative of this nature, representing, as it does, significant economic and environmental reform. All of that material is available to the community and has been published.


It is worth recalling for the moment that this is an emissions trading scheme and it has some features in common with the policy that Labor endeavoured to prosecute in the previous term of parliament. That previous proposal was at one point in time the subject of agreement with the coalition. It included important features such as the international linking of the emissions trading scheme with the international carbon markets. It is embarrassing, in fact, to hear the shadow minister repudiate so much that he stood for in the past from a policy standpoint, having completed a thesis on market mechanisms, including, I think, a set of policy propositions that he has completely walked away from. It is a pretty pathetic thing to see.


The entire policy position that the government announced is underpinned by the climate science. Of course, this is another matter of contention across both sides of politics. The shadow minister professes to accept and respect the climate science, but his party is led by someone who has had 100 different positions on the science and who sends the signal to those in the community who do not respect the science that he is with them. It is the same way that he walks both sides of the street on many different issues. In a formal forum he will say he accepts and respects the science, but when it is appropriate—particularly when he is on radio in Sydney with Alan Jones, his close colleague—he will send a very clear signal that he has no respect for the science, no respect for scientists and indeed no respect for economists, who support dealing with carbon pollution by a market mechanism.


It is always important to come back to the foundation of the science because the opposition has no credible policy to address what scientists are telling us. We always have to bear in mind that the empirical evidence is clear. Last year, 2010, was the warmest year on record, equal with some others. It was the 34th consecutive year with temperatures higher than the 20th century average. The warmest decade on record was 2001 to 2010, and each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the last. This country, and many others, has a lot to lose from climate change and the warming that we are experiencing. The science is telling us that carbon pollution is contributing to the change that we are experiencing.


It is an international problem. The atmosphere is global; it is not confined to any national boundaries. Australia needs to participate in discussions with other countries about how we will address this problem, because, in particular, Australia is one of the top 20 polluters internationally and the highest polluter per person of all of the developed economies. No responsible government receiving this scientific advice and recognising these statistics has any alternative but to address this issue, in partnership with the international community, by reducing its levels of carbon pollution and driving investment in clean energy sources in its own economy in order to play a responsible part internationally in dealing with this issue.


It is incumbent on any government receiving this advice to act upon it. The government must take these steps to cut pollution, to contribute to international efforts to address climate change and to drive change in our own economy, but to do so at least cost to our economy, at least cost to businesses and at least cost to households. This is precisely what has driven the development of the policy that the government announced on 10 July. A carbon price mechanism, in partnership with the other elements that I described earlier, will drive cuts in pollution in our economy at least cost to the economy, to businesses and to households.


It is a simple proposition, to provide the incentive to cut pollution to the largest emitters of pollution in our economy. Those polluters can reduce their liability under the carbon price mechanism by reducing their pollution. They can do so in particular by improving energy efficiency and investing in lower emissions technologies. It will be particularly important in the years to come to improve the performance of our electricity generating sector with respect to the pollution that is attendant upon electricity generation. The advantage of a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme is that the government can set emissions reduction targets. In fact, there is supposed to be bipartisan support for a set of emissions reduction targets in this parliament, in this House. The unconditional bipartisan emissions reduction targets that both sides have indicated their acceptance of is a five per cent reduction in pollution by 2020 from year 2000 levels. The carbon pollution mechanism that the government announced on 10 July will deliver at least that outcome, and that represents a reduction by the year 2020 of 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution. That is a very important commitment.


The government has also indicated its intention to establish the Climate Change Authority. It will be chaired by former Reserve Bank Governor and Treasury secretary Mr Bernie Fraser. The Climate Change Authority will have the responsibility of providing advice and recommendations to government on the pollution caps that will operate under the emissions trading scheme so that from 2015, when we commence emissions trading with international linking, pollution caps will be set by regulation by government. The emissions trading scheme will achieve at least the 160 million tonnes of pollution reduction by 2020, but the Climate Change Authority may recommend further emissions reduction targets by that time. Government has the discretion, of course, to act on those recommendations.


The other thing that is important in the development of an approach to tackle climate change and is represented in the policy that the government has announced is, as I mentioned, that we address change within the electricity-generating sector. One of the elements of that that is contained in the policy is the commitment by the government to seek to negotiate the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions, older, pollution-generating capacity in our system. The shadow minister falsely indicates that there has been no provision made for that negotiation in the material that was released; in fact, there is provision. A contingency has been made in the contingency reserve in the budget for that negotiation for the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions capacity. I do not think any responsible government is about to indicate what that quantum that has been provisioned may be. There will be a negotiation should some participants in the energy market wish to discuss that issue with the government, but we are not about to indicate to those players what the government may have provisioned. However, a provision has been made.


A number of other important elements of the policy have also been included. The government has indicated a commitment to establish a clean energy finance corporation and make an equity investment of $10 billion. That corporation could provide loans, loan guarantees or make equity investments in an effort to assist participants in the private sector and bring some technologies to the market.




Mrs Mirabella:
  Not a front for your mates?




Mr COMBET:
  The member for Indi suggests it may have some inappropriate use. It will not. It will be a finance corporation with an independent board. It will have an investment mandate and it will be established in a manner that will ensure that it operates in an appropriate fashion to assist and commercialise low-emissions technologies and renewable technology—notwithstanding all the slur, slander and rubbish that comes from the other side.


Importantly, having established all of these mechanisms to cut pollution and drive investment in our economy, naturally the government has also placed a lot of attention on assistance to households and businesses, in particular to households to deal with any price consequences of the establishment of a carbon price in the economy. The Treasury modelling on this is clear. There is projected to be a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI as a consequence of introducing the carbon price mechanism. The average potential price impact on households averaged across the economy is around $9.90 according to the Treasury modelling. The government, of course, will institute tax cuts, increases in the pension, increases in family tax benefits and a host of other Commonwealth payments to offset for many households that price impact, modest as it may be. In fact, the average level of assistance provided to households across the economy is $10.10.


The tax cuts will be delivered by a very important tax reform. The proposition contained in the policy material that the government will implement provides for an increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 from 1 July next year and, from 1 July 2015, an increase in the tax-free threshold to $19,400. This will mean that more than one million people will not have to submit an income tax return. It will deliver tax cuts to many households. Coupled with that, pensions and other Commonwealth payments will rise by 1.7 per cent, meaning that, contrary to the assertions falsely made by the shadow minister, nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance to meet the modest price impacts. Six million households will receive assistance to meet their expected average price impact. Four million households will receive assistance of 120 per cent of their expected price impact. Single pensioners will be better off. Coupled pensioners will be better off. Many others in that category of four million households will be better off.


On top of this, the government is providing significant assistance to industry to support jobs, in particular in relation to industries that are in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed part of the economy. There is also assistance for small business. There are other measures contained in the policy announcement that are very important that interested members of the community have access to.


Up against all of this is a farce of a policy from the coalition. It does not stack up. When the policy was first enunciated by the shadow minister in February 2010, it asserted that about 70 per cent of the emissions reductions it proposed could to achieve an emissions reduction target of a five per cent cut in year-2000 levels of emissions in our economy by 2020 could be achieved from soil carbons. The science is not there, and it does not comply with the international rules. It simply cannot work. (Time expired)

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (15:51):  The minister, the member for Charlton, gave us one of his least convincing performances. He has this tactic: if you want to have everyone switch off, if the potato is too hot to handle, speak in the most boring monotone voice to bore people into submission. We have a government that is not and should not be surprised that they are not believed. It all goes back to an issue of trust. She stole an election result on the explicit promise, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', knowing full well that she did not intend to fulfil that promise. They go to an election campaign saying that they will not introduce a carbon tax. They belittle and ridicule the Leader of the Opposition—who said that there would be a carbon tax. Then they win government and give in to the Greens, not in order to save the planet but to save Ms Gillard's job. She is called the great negotiator. What a fool! She should have known there was no way in hell that the Greens would have supported the Liberals over the Labor Party. There was no way they were going to support Tony Abbott. She gave the Greens the carbon tax. She decided, using her great negotiating skills, that the Greens would run away to the Liberal Party. What a fool! What an idiot! What a liar, as she is called by so many people in the community.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The member for Indi will resume her seat. I require the member for Indi to withdraw the term 'liar' and other derogatory terms referring to the Prime Minister, and while I am at it I would ask the member for Indi to refer to other members in accordance with standing order 64, not by their name. I call the honourable member for Indi.




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, and fully respect the standing orders that prevent me as a member in this House from repeating the comments made out there in the community from one end of the country to the other, particularly from many former Labor voters. But when a Prime Minister goes to an election making such an explicit comment, then reneges on it and decides to sell out to Bob Brown and decides to speak to Bob Brown before her own backbenchers, is it any surprise that people do not believe the scant explanation and promises given on the carbon tax and the so-called compensation package? People do not believe that the CPI will increase by only 0.7 per cent—and why should they? None of the government's budget estimates or mid-year updates have been accurate in any way whatsoever. Why would the situation change now?


We have seen costs go up and up and up. The carbon tax will go up but compensation will not go up. The minister talks about modest price increases, but people are already hurting. They know that they cannot trust the government's modelling; it has not been fully explained and there are many factors that have not been included. For example, where is the modelling to show the number of SMEs that will close? We know that the SME sector is very important in Australia. We know that it has the least capacity to absorb increased costs of production. We all know that, when small businesses close and larger businesses increase their market power, prices also go up. That has not been factored into the government's projections either.


The government says there will be all this compensation, but what is the reality? Everyone knows that a carbon tax is intended to hurt every time you use electricity and every time you use energy. Even on the government's own figures, even if we were trusting and naive enough to believe the figures that it has provided, we see that a couple earning $60,000 each with two children would be worse off. A couple earning $60,000 with no children would be worse off. A single person earning $60,000 would be worse off. This is intended to punish consumers because that is what the Greens want. The Greens want to punish consumers. They think we probably live too affluent a lifestyle, we use too much and we consume too much; so let us just punish people—punish people into submission! If you look at average wages in professions such as teachers, ambulance drivers, accountants, crane operators, manufacturers, park rangers and physiotherapists, all of these people will be worse off.


We hear about compensation to industry, but if you do not damage industry you do not need to pretend to compensate it. As Graham Kraehe from BlueScope said, any compensation would be like a bandaid over a bullet wound.




Mr Bradbury:
  When did he say that?




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  He said that at the National Press Club. You should have been there, my friend. You should go to your electorate of Lindsay and speak to those people who are saying to us: 'Our member is letting us down. Our member does not understand how hard we are doing it. Our member does not understand how difficult it is to make ends meet. And now, instead of listening to mainstream Australia and Lindsay, our member supports the Prime Minister in sucking up to Bob Brown so she can keep her job.' You are a disgrace and you should hang your head in shame.


When we look at the steel industry, a very important industry, and those important workers across the country, particularly in Port Kembla, we hear the government proudly say that it is providing additional assistance to the industry. It is supposed to be $300 million in assistance, but guess what? For our two main steel companies, BlueScope and OneSteel, the total value lost on the first day that the carbon tax was announced was almost the equivalent of the package. On the second day the value that these companies lost was over $100 million. So your so-called compensation is inadequate to even make up for the loss in corporate value of our two main steelmakers. So much for compensation!


This government is all about churn: punish people, bring in a program, tax it, borrow it, hand it around, move it around—a bit of trickery and a bit of deception. No wonder there is no trust in what is said. This government has not explained to the Australian people that Australian industry and Australian manufacturers are some of the most efficient in the world. Our steel producers are the most efficient in the world. They create fewer emissions and have a more efficient production process than exists in China. The government has not explained that to the Australian people. It has not said to the steelworkers: 'You do a great job. You are part of an efficient and effective industry.' 'No', it has said: 'You are big, bad polluters. You naughty people! You make steel—the steel we need for our cars, the steel we need for our houses—you big, bad, naughty people! We would prefer to make the steel you make more expensive, to drive manufacturing offshore to countries that will create more emissions to make the same things we used to make'. So we are closing down industry and closing down jobs to—guess what?—increase worldwide emissions because our manufacturing will go to places like China, where they create more emissions making the same stuff that we used to make.


You have not explained any of those facts, not to your constituents and not to the Australian people. You have not actually stood up and been proud of Australian manufacturing. In industries like cement, chemicals and plastics; in the steel industry, in the car industry and the car components industry; in food and grocery processing; and in aluminium and glass making, a carbon tax is going to punish these industries and give a leg-up to imports with which they compete.


So we will be sending our manufacturing offshore to increase emissions. Many Australian businesses already operate on wafer-thin margins. Does the government listen? No. When the Prime Minister was asked, 'What do you say to manufacturing?', she giggled, 'Ha, ha, ha. They will do what they've always done. They'll innovate; they'll get on with it'. Well, Prime Minister, manufacturing businesses are facing a pretty tough time and your carbon tax will send many of them to the wall and will send many of them offshore.


What will it do to households? It will hurt them even more because of the lie you spread during the last election and the lies you continue to spread now.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! I ask the member for Indi to withdraw the word 'lie'.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:02):  It is a pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance raised by the member for Flinders, because it is a significant achievement for the opposition. In introducing this matter they have had to use the words 'matter of public importance' in the context of the climate change debate.


After listening to months and months of the 'no, no, no, no' campaign waged by the opposition—which is all we have heard from the member for Flinders, all we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and all we have heard from those opposite—I can tell members of the House that this grudging acceptance that this is a matter of public importance is about as close as we are going to get to recognition from the opposition of the importance of this environmental threat to Australia and the whole.


I am more than happy to talk about the government's climate change policy, about how we are getting on with the job of legislating a carbon price for Australia and how we are getting on with the job of legislating to tackle climate change by putting a price tag on every tonne of pollution that is produced by around 500 large polluters. That carbon price will commence on 1 July 2012. I am very pleased to talk to the House about how every member of the Labor caucus since we announced the scheme on 10 July has been out there discussing the carbon price package; out there discussing the clean energy future plan that we have for Australia with communities and with businesses around the country, and about our plans to continue that discussion with the Australian people as we move to deliver this major economic and environmental reform.


Of course, I will wait, because I do not think that we have yet had all of the speakers from the opposition. I must be patient; we have not heard from all of them. I will wait to hear the lament that they seem to share because they are concerned about the way that the carbon price plan for Australia has been explained by raising this matter; their lament at the impediments that have been put in the way of the government—by the opposition—in adequately explaining the carbon price.


I hope that we will hear from some members of the opposition who are yet to speak about some of the misinformation that has made its way into the public debate. I fear we are going to be disappointed, because we have seen two further examples this afternoon—in the speech by the member for Flinders and in the speech by the member for Indi—of the repetition of misinformation; further repetition of false claims about the effect of the carbon price on Australian manufacturing and about the effect of the carbon price on Australian industry.


What we should be hearing from those in the opposition, if they were genuinely concerned about properly debating this question with the Australian people, is a complaint about the way the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a four- or five-month-long bricklaying, petrol-pumping, fish-slicing fear campaign that has done so much to crowd out genuine debate on this issue. They might pause to reflect on the full spectrum of the misinformation that the opposition has been spreading about the carbon price plan, which has now included singing and dancing in the Senate, Shakespearean recitals, made up figures, made up facts, the wall of Weet-Bix, denial of climate change—apparently followed by a reluctant acceptance of climate change—some cameos with Pauline Hanson and also, really, just an exploration of the red-cordial-induced limits of silliness. I know there are a few speakers from the opposition yet to speak. Perhaps we will hear from them and I must wait. In contrast to what can only be described as the completely unprincipled and disgraceful campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, assisted by the member for Indi in particular, where the opposition has sought to misrepresent the government's position across the country and instil in Australians fears about their job security and cost-of-living pressures that are completely unjustified, the government will continue to explain the carbon price package, the clean energy future plan, to the Australian people, and I am looking forward to continuing to do this in the months to come. In the past few weeks I have visited communities in Victoria, in Queensland, in the ACT and in New South Wales, and I have spoken to businesses, to community leaders, to people at retirement villages and to people at bowls clubs about how Australia is going to be implementing this carbon price and about the financial benefits to our country of implementing this carbon price. I have met with people in communities who want to know the details of the assistance that is going to be coming their way under the clean energy future plan, about the assistance that is going to go to nine out of 10 households, about the tax cuts that are going to go to everyone in this country who is earning under $80,000 a year and about the extra benefits that are going to be flowing to everyone in receipt of a pension or a government benefit.


This is in contrast to the kind of fantasy land inhabited by the member for Indi, who this afternoon was again repeating—but in a particularly egregious fashion—elements of the opposition's scare campaign about the steel industry. She made a remarkable misattribution of the time at which Graham Kraehe spoke; I have had it checked while I have been waiting to speak, and in fact he spoke on 22 March this year, so it was some months before the carbon price package was announced. Graham Kraehe is, of course, the chair of BlueScope. I think it is more important to look at what the two steel companies of our country, OneSteel and BlueScope, said about the carbon price plan after it was announced. We have Geoff Plummer, the managing director and CEO of OneSteel, saying in his release to the Australian Stock Exchange—a formal document—on 10 July 2011:


We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the—


Steel Transformation Plan—


is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach.


I then go to the BlueScope response, contrary to what was suggested by the member for Indi. This is Paul O'Malley, managing director and CEO of BlueScope Steel, speaking on 11 July 2011, the day after we released the clean energy future plan:


This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem.


BlueScope said:


… the Government’s proposed new Steel Transformation Plan (STP) recognised the Company’s long-standing call for a sectoral approach to a carbon tax in Australia.


Mr O'Malley said:


The STP will provide funds to minimise the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian steel industry for the first four years … And it signals the Government’s intention to limit the potential pass-through of Scope 3 coal emissions costs onto steelmakers … In summary, the STP materially reduces the overall cost of the carbon tax on BlueScope. … The Government has listened to our arguments and our deep concerns about the carbon tax


In the STP it has produced a package—


and so on. Those, of course, are not the words that the member for Indi wants to hear, and that is why she did not quote from actual commentary made by Australia's two steel companies after the announcement of our clean energy future plan.


We have the situation that the opposition's scare campaign is falling apart day by day. As more and more Australians learn the details of the government's clean energy future plan, there will be less and less concern. Because there is less and less concern as Australians learn of the details of the assistance going to nine in 10 Australian households, we are seeing more and more shrillness and nonsense spoken by those opposite and more and more misleading statements—anything rather than actually quoting from what the steel companies are telling Australians, anything rather than actually quoting from our plan and anything rather than explaining to the Australian people that there is in fact assistance coming to nine in 10 households.


By the end of next year—I know that is a long time off for the short-term people on the benches opposite to even contemplate—a few months after the introduction of the carbon price on 1 July 2012, which I know is a long time for those opposite to think about, Australians are going to be saying: 'What on earth were the opposition banging on about? What on earth was the Leader of the Opposition banging on about? What on earth was the member for Indi banging on about as she went around Australia trying to drum up fear by spreading misinformation and misrepresenting the effect of the carbon price?' As for the inaction policy of the coalition, it is not capable of meeting the target which the Liberal Party claim to share. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2011-08-17,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:12):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, but before I go to the substance of my contribution I would just like to challenge a few words from the member for Isaacs. He commented on the fact that the Prime Minister said from on high: 'Go out and sell the carbon tax. Go out and make your voices heard. Go out and tell the Australian people why higher power prices are going to be so good for them.' And do you know what the response was, Mr Deputy Speaker? The response was silence, because I have to say I did not hear too many marginal seat members out there selling the benefits of higher electricity prices and job losses. I did not see too many marginal seat members saying too much at all about the carbon tax. In fact, they were running and hiding. I have to say that, if you wanted to see the definition of someone looking sick, it was a Labor marginal seat holder when the Prime Minister came to visit to sell the carbon tax, because it is a toxic tax that nobody wants and you are deluding yourselves to think any differently. This day, one day after the first anniversary of that notorious statement that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, the Prime Minister needs to explain why she is so intent on doing so much damage to the Australian economy, on destroying jobs, on driving up the cost of living and on cruelling small business and large business. We have a situation where the world is facing very challenging and very uncertain times. Just yesterday the Treasurer said there had been:


… big swings in global share markets, a downgrade to the US government's triple-A rating … and a rapid rise in borrowing costs facing Spain and Italy.


He continued:


In uncertain times like these, it is more important than ever that we have a mature debate about our economy and where it is heading … 


Yet at the same time his government is imposing a carbon tax which will increase the cost of doing business, that will cost jobs, that will slow growth and that will damage our economy. This is no time for this negligent Prime Minister to be introducing a carbon tax that is going to do so much damage to Australia.


Overnight, Germany announced that their GDP slowed to almost a standstill in the second quarter of 2011, increasing only 0.1 per cent, down from 1.2 per cent in the previous quarter. Markets took a dive again overnight over fears that France is struggling to deal with its debt crisis, which totals 85 per cent of French GDP, some €1.65 trillion. Countries like Greece and Spain are struggling with trillions of dollars of debt brought on by governments spending more than they can afford. There is a crisis of confidence in the world economy. The US government owes US$14.6 trillion. Australia must ensure that our economy remains as stable as possible and not do anything to threaten our growth.


Instead, what is this government doing? This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to reduce our international competitiveness. This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to make it harder for businesses to generate growth, generate jobs and continue to allow Australia to prosper. In the labour market, Qantas has announced 1,000 job losses—that is before a carbon tax is going to hit; OneSteel has announced 400 job losses; Channel 10 has announced 150 job losses; and Westpac has announced job losses. What is the government's policy response? You are going to impose another great big new tax. Is that good policy? You guys are dreaming if you think that is going to help our economy prosper. If you think that is going to aid this country to grow you are in dreamland. At a time of global uncertainty the government is reducing the ability of Australian businesses to compete, and there is no question that that is going to result in job losses. 


Australia is dependent on exports to maintain our economic growth. The Treasurer said after the budget in May:


With the right policies and decisions, we can convert an unprecedented mining investment boom into an opportunity boom for more of our people.


The carbon tax is the wrong policy at the wrong time to capitalise on Australia's competitive advantages. We are dependent on China for much of our exports. In 2010, Australia's exports to China totalled $58 billion or around five per cent of our GDP. If demand in China for Australian resources were to collapse, it would greatly impact our economic growth. But our threats are not limited to a potential slowing of growth in China. Australia exports $18 billion to the European Union each year and a further $9 billion to the United States. Both the EU and the US are certainly encountering huge economic challenges, and this tax is not going to do anything to assist Australia in combating the potential impacts of those challenges.


The fallout from the problems overseas could have major impacts on our exports and major impacts on Australian companies. We already have this government planning to impose a mineral resource rent tax on our mining exports. This Prime Minister really does have to come into this House and explain why she is doing that. The Prime Minister promised she was going to wear out her shoe leather to tell the story, but I can report to this House that her shoes are in perfect condition. After only a week she gave up on the information campaign, she gave up on peddling the falsehoods, she gave up on trying to spin the lie that has been put about—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The member for Cowper would be aware that that terminology is completely inappropriate and disorderly. I call on him to withdraw that statement unreservedly.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. We saw the Prime Minister abandon her sell job. She abandoned the job of trying to convince the Australian people that this toxic tax was good for them. She abandoned any notion that that was going to be good for them. In fact, she has done everything she can to change the subject. We heard the Prime Minister talking about the VFT, the very worthwhile notion of the disability insurance scheme and hospital reform—anything but the toxic carbon tax. Anything that she could get in the news cycle apart from the carbon tax was mentioned by this Prime Minister.


The government talks about the fact that many of our industries will be protected by a range of subsidies. What international investor and what Australian investor would want to invest in an industry that will be dependent on government subsidy for the rest of its life? What a ridiculous situation to put our very fine industries in, a position where for the foreseeable future they are dependent on government largesse—largesse that can be taken away with the stroke of a pen. She would be making our very important industries dependent on government subsidies to survive. It is an absolutely ridiculous situation. It is an absolutely ridiculous policy. The Prime Minister also needs to explain the untruths that she is peddling about the rest of the world allegedly running lemming-like to throw themselves over a cliff, just like she is trying to do to the Australian economy. She is trying to claim that the US is making great strides in relation to an emissions trading scheme. The reality is that is false; that is untrue. We saw the 10 western American states abandon their plans for an ETS. We saw the eastern state of New Jersey withdraw from a carbon trading scheme. We saw the closure of the carbon exchange in Chicago.


I see the Labor members shaking their heads. Their constituents are shaking their heads that their local members would be imposing such a tax on them. We see the US retreating from a carbon regime. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, said that the scheme:


… does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens and tax our businesses with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment.


I think he has captured the situation in Australia perfectly.


We have a government that has attempted to mislead the Australian people. We have a Prime Minister who refuses to say why she is imposing this tax. We have a Prime Minister who promised to wear out her shoe leather, but she did nothing of the sort. After a few days out in the field she saw the response the Australian people were giving and she ran for cover—and she has got a lot more running to do before the next election.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (16:22):  Where to start after listening to that! The member for Cowper talked about damage to the economy. I think that he should think long and hard about the way he is talking down the economy in this country, when it is the envy of the developed nations and the G20 countries. If you want to worry about business confidence, start looking at the comments being made by the Liberal Party and its leader.


But let us look at the MPI. That is what we are supposed to be responding to today. It talks about failure to adequately explain, but I think this is a bit of an embarrassment for the other side. They did not really want to word it in the way that they really meant it, so they are saying that we, the government, are not out there adequately explaining it; but it is the Liberal Party not understanding it. It is not a surprise that the Liberal Party does not understand the Labor Party's clean energy future plans, because they do not even know when they get up each day whether they are actually believing in climate change or not. It all depends on what Tony Abbott said on radio that morning.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Your constituents don't believe in you!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The member for Cowper has had his opportunity.




Mrs D'ATH:
  I have to acknowledge a well-known and very talented actor, Noni Hazlehurst, who was recently on Q&A. She made the comment that she has worked with a lot of children and has dealt with the terrible twos, where two-year-olds just say, 'No, no, no' to everything. I think what has been proven today is that you do not have to be two years old to chuck a tantrum. The member for Indi was very good at chucking a tantrum today, so I think Noni's comment on Q&A the other week was certainly appropriate in relation to the way that the opposition is dealing with policy in this country; it is about opposing everything.


The reality for the Leader of the Opposition, if you want to talk about explanations, is that the people in my electorate are eager to learn more about the clean energy future plan, and we should not treat these people as fools. They do understand. When you go out, when you talk to them and when you provide them with information, they understand why it is important we act, why it is important that we put in place an interim fixed carbon price for three years and why it is important in 2015 that we move to a market based mechanism for a carbon price. They understand this. They understand also that that will come with some cost. They also understand that it is the federal Labor government that is stepping up and providing assistance to households and also supporting industry and jobs and investing in clean energy and renewables.


What the people in my electorate do not understand and are wanting an explanation for is where the opposition think they are going to get the money to support their climate change policy—for what it is worth—to meet what they claim are the same targets that have been set by this government. Today in question time the Prime Minister said that both parties are committed to the same targets. The Leader of the Opposition sat there and shook his head. He shook his head, saying, 'No, no, no; we haven't got the same targets.' So each day we do not know whether they are committed or not to dealing with climate change.


To give the Australian people some insight as to the opposition's commitment to dealing with climate change, we only need to go back to the recent comments by the shadow Treasurer when being interviewed on Lateline by Tony Jones. He was asked: 'You say that if you get into government you are going to scrap 12,000 Public Service jobs. Where would you cut these 12,000 Public Service jobs from?' What about the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency? The shadow Treasurer said that he does not believe any of their modelling. When asked the question, 'Would you consider disbanding the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency?' there were no ifs and no buts—the shadow Treasurer said yes.


It is not just all the jobs that would go—and they are worried about the economy and they are talking about actually taking away jobs—but it is the fact that they say they have a climate change policy at the same time as the shadow Treasurer is saying, 'Oh, if we get into government, there goes the whole department. We don't need a department to look into climate change, clean energy or renewables.'


These are the explanations that need to go out to the Australian people. This is what the Australian people want to hear. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to go out there and run a scare campaign—we heard it from the member for Indi today; we heard it from the member for Cowper—talking about closing industries, loss of jobs, cost-of-living increases and damage to the economy, where is their alternative policy? How is it being costed? Where are all these trees covering the size of Tasmania and Victoria combined going to be planted? We heard the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency talking about that in question time today.


The opposition talk about alleged increases in the cost of living. Modelling by Treasury has estimated a 0.7 per cent increase on the CPI for our country to take the historic step of addressing climate change and implementing a carbon price. What you do not hear from the other side when they criticise the modelling done by the same department and the same people who did the modelling for the GST is that when the GST was introduced it actually created an increase of more than three per cent on the CPI. But we do not hear them going out and telling everyone that. They would not want to go out and actually compare the Howard government's policies and actions to what this government has done since it came in during 2007, because if they did that they would be embarrassed and shown for what they are: a party that just believes in opposing for the sake of opposing and who want to engage in popular politics—and they do not care what that means. If it means saying one thing one day and something else the other, that is what they will do. The Prime Minister, the cabinet—every member of this government—has been out explaining to people across Australia what this clean energy future plan is all about. 


The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to do that, going out talking about Labor's policy, talking about their policy a little bit. He is starting to have a bit of a problem there.



Mr Hartsuyker interjecting—




Mrs D'ATH:
  The Leader of the Opposition just hit a little bit of a snag, maybe, Member for Cowper! Just a little bit of a problem there—he couldn't get into a butcher's. He lined up all of the media to do another stunt. We have done the Weet-Bix and everything else. The Leader of the Opposition tried to set up his little media stunt with a local butcher, but it all came apart because the butcher didn't want a bar of it. 


The reality is, despite all the huff and puff from those on the other side—a lot of allegations thrown around—there is very little statistics, very little fact. Why? Because they would rather go out into businesses and run scare campaigns. They would rather go out there, get attention and say that whole industries are going to shut and jobs are going to disappear. But in fact we know that that is not true. Members of the opposition again stood there today making all these allegations—talking about steel, talking about manufacturing, talking about mining but definitely not quoting anyone. Of course they would not want to quote David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, who on 31 July 2011 wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia saying:


I was delighted to hear of the ambitious package of climate change policy measures you announced on July 10 and wanted to congratulate you on taking this bold step.


You would not want to quote Cameron Clyne, the NAB CEO, saying:


“If you’re asking for an economic assessment of the two, the carbon price followed by an ETS is economically superior to the direct action policy,” he said.


“It will drive certainty, it will drive investment, so as a straight comparison between the two, that’s the choice.”


We had comments from the bank chief economist supporting that. We have OneSteel CEO saying:


We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the STP is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach.


BlueScope managing director and CEO on 10 July said:


This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem.


None of those quotes were made today by the member for Indi, the member for Flinders or the member for Cowper when they stood here and claimed that jobs would be lost in steel manufacturing, that industries would close down, that there would be cost of living increases. These are all things that the opposition do not want to talk about. (Time expired)

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (16:33):  by leave—Last week I visited Rod and Janette Mattingley, and their 25 year old son, Thomas, who live in my electorate of Jagajaga in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Thomas has been severely disabled since birth. He has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and scoliosis. Rod and Janette have provided almost constant care for him since birth. Rod and Janette kindly opened their home to me and talked me through their days with Thomas and their experiences of the disability service system.


The Productivity Commission's final report into the long-term care and support of Australians with disability, which the Prime Minister released last Wednesday, judged the disability service system to be unfair, underfunded and fragmented. It is a judgment that sums up the daily frustrations and inconsistencies that the Mattingleys—and thousands like them—face each day. The system of disability services in Australia today is letting people down. This government asked the Productivity Commission to examine reform of disability support services because we believe that the system we have today is not delivering the kind of care and support Australians expect for people with disability. 


The Productivity Commission has recommended a national disability insurance scheme that would entitle all Australians to support in the event of significant disability. The scheme would provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people with significant disabilities. It would be accompanied by a national injury insurance scheme to provide no fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury.


The Australian government shares the vision of the Productivity Commission for a system that provides people with disability with the care and support they need over the course of their lifetime. We understand that the system needs more funding, and people with disability need more services and support. We also understand that the system needs a complete transformation to deliver the kind of care and support the community expects for people with disability. We are acting on both fronts, right away. We are already doubling Commonwealth funding to the states and territories, who deliver disability support services. We have more than tripled the rate of indexation from 1.8 per cent under the previous government to 6.3 per cent today so that our investment in services grows faster. We are investing in people with disabilities and those who care for them, by delivering record pension increases to people on the disability support pension and the carer payment. We have increased the maximum rate by around $128 a fortnight for single pensioners and $116 a fortnight for couples since September 2009. To improve access to services for people with disability and to drive reform, including in access to mainstream services like health and education, we have launched a National Disability Strategy, and to support carers and to shine a light on their work, we have recently released a National Carer Strategy.


We are making headway in overhauling key aspects of the disability support pension to better support people with disability into work wherever possible, because we know that many people with disability do want to do more. We are investing $3 billion over the next four years in uncapping access to Disability Employment Services, so people with disability know they can get help to give work a go. Under the previous government, people with disability could wait up to a year for help to get back into work.


We are helping parents of children with disabilities to access early intervention services through the Better Start for Children with Disability program. Under this program, around 9,000 children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, and sight or hearing impairments will be eligible for up to $12,000 of services under the program over four years. Since 1 July this year, when the Better Start program began, 725 Australian families have registered for funding for early intervention services for their children. Since 2008, more than 12,000 children with autism spectrum disorders have accessed early intervention services through the Helping Children with Autism package.


To meet the need for community based supported accommodation places for Australians with disability, we have established a new $60 million fund to build up to 150 innovative supported accommodation places. This builds on the $100 million capital injection we delivered in 2008 to build more than 300 places for people with disability. These are important investments, and they are being delivered to people with disabilities, their families and carers right now. But we know we need to do more. That is why this government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake this major inquiry. We know the disability service system will not be repaired by increases in funding or more services alone. Both are necessary, but not sufficient. People with disability, their families and carers have argued that the system needs a complete overhaul. The Productivity Commission has agreed. And so do we, the Australian government.


The disability service system needs a complete overhaul so that it, first and foremost, meets the needs of the individual. It needs to take an insurance approach that meets the care and support needs of a person with disability over their lifetime—and not the crisis-driven approach of the past. The Productivity Commission has set out a clear vision for change. The commission recommend work start right away, with the launch of a scheme in selected sites around the country in mid-2014 and they also recommend the progressive rollout of a national disability insurance scheme to full operation by 2018-19.


The report from the Productivity Commission demonstrates that we do have a lot of work ahead of us. Under the recently signed National Health Reform Agreement, the states and territories have primary responsibility for the funding and delivery of disability support services. Reform of the disability service system must therefore be done with the states and territories. This Friday, the Prime Minister will ask the Council of Australian Governments to establish a select council of ministers from the Commonwealth, states and territories to drive disability reform. We are starting work right away, to lay the foundations for reform and get disability services, as we like to call it, NDIS-ready—ready for a national disability insurance scheme. This means working with the states and territories to develop common assessment tools, so that people's eligibility for support can be assessed fairly and consistently, based on their level of need. It means putting in place service and quality standards, so that people with disability can expect high quality support irrespective of what disability they have or how they acquired it. It means building workforce capacity so we have more trained staff to support people with disabilities. And it will also include developing rigorous timelines, milestones and benchmarks to support the delivery of these and other essential foundation reforms, and to hold governments accountable for progress. 


Much of this work has commenced through the National Disability Agreement. But this work must now be accelerated and extended because these, and other matters, are essential foundations for a national disability insurance scheme. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, we have announced an immediate $10 million to support this technical work. This is in addition to our increased funding for the states and territories to deliver disability services through the National Disability Agreement. We have also announced an advisory group to work with the new select council on the design and oversight of activities to build the foundations for reform. This work will be led by Dr Jeff Harmer AO, supported by Mr Bruce Bonyhady AM and Dr Rhonda Galbally AO. Others will be added once further consultations have taken place.


And in response to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for the states and territories to harmonise their approach to catastrophic injury, the government will convene a working group led by the Assistant Treasurer to work with state and territory governments, lawyers and other stakeholders to progress this element of reform. Work is already underway. And it will continue as we lay those foundations which are essential for reform, and are necessary precursors to the launch of a national disability insurance scheme. Future reform of disability services will require investment from all levels of government and it will require our shared commitment to fundamental reform, a complete overhaul, so that it delivers the kind of care and support we expect for people with disability. The Australian government is committed to this reform. We believe that people like Thomas Mattingley deserve quality care and support and that people like his parents, Rod and Janette Mattingley, should be supported and have certainty in Thomas's continuing care.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Menzies to speak for 11½ minutes.


Leave granted.




Ms MACKLIN:

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,10,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:45):  Approximately 20 per cent of the Australian population have a disability—that is, some four million people have a disability—and there are some 2.6 million carers. The coalition believe that continuing support for these Australians is important. It is in this context that we have already indicated our in-principle support for the establishment of a national disability insurance scheme. The reality is that the current system is broken. It is inconsistent and lacks coordination. Support is determined not by need but by how a disability was acquired. Indeed, the Productivity Commission has found that the current system is 'underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficient' and 'gives people with disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports'. Currently support depends on a number of factors: what state you live in, whether the disability is congenital or was acquired, and, if acquired, whether it was acquired in the workplace, a motor vehicle accident or some other context. 


There is a level of care which families and informal carers want to provide and should provide for their loved ones with a disability, but there is also a level of care which it is unreasonable to expect to be undertaken without some support, and in some cases some very considerable support, from the wider community. Importantly, any response to disabilities must be a combined federal, state and territory response. At present, total government expenditure is around $7 billion per annum. The Commonwealth contributes about $2.3 billion and the states and territories contribute around $4.7 billion. 


The reality is that the status quo is no longer an option. Australians with disability and their families deserve a better deal. Good economic management of course is key to providing a better deal, to providing real reform and real support. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are no longer good enough. Every Australian should feel disappointed by what is initially a weak response on the part of the government to the Productivity Commission's report. This Labor-Green alliance has a history of overpromising and underdelivering. This government has a history of making announcements that are empty and tokenistic, announcements that are never actually acted upon. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are simply no longer good enough. The government should provide a clear timetable for change and a clear and definite funding envelope. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot be keen to push the envelope on their great big new tax on everything but not push the envelope to repair a system that impacts on some of the most vulnerable members of our society.


The coalition remain concerned, with good cause, about the government's ability to deliver the complex reform needed in this critical area, so we will monitor its implementation closely because we have seen time and time again the disasters that the Labor-Green alliance has presided over. Anyone who has seen the detail of the government's announcement, seen the paltry $10 million commitment, knows that Labor could have done better. Imagine how much more they could have done without the waste and mismanagement—with no pink batts, no school hall rip-offs, no program failures and no NBN. Australians might not know that the Productivity Commission's final report found that the current unmet need for support for Australians with disability is some $6.5 billion. That is roughly equivalent to the Gillard government's current annual debt interest repayments.


Australians with disability, their carers and their families are not focused on funding options. They just want the system fixed. The government has raised the hopes of these families, so it is now up to the government to outline how it will deliver. That is why it is so disappointing that the government's response has not identified at this stage any funding envelope.


The government are, I fear, incapable of reforming anything. Their strength lies in waste, mismanagement, bungling programs and doing nothing. I suppose there is some hope that they at least have put $10 million up.




Ms Macklin:
  I'll send this around to people with disabilities. They'll be thrilled to get this.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Minister, you were heard in silence.




Mr ANDREWS:
  I will respond to the interjection. People with disabilities have said to me over the last week that they are concerned that this government, given its history of mismanagement and incompetence, is not in a position to be able to deliver. If it were, then we might have seen more. 


You cannot talk about reform without also talking about the disability support pension. About 800,000 people are on the DSP, at a cost of $10 billion to $13 billion per year. This represents about five per cent of all Australians of working age. The Prime Minister says she wants to tackle the issue; however, again you see Labor with a poor record on welfare reform. In the early years of the last decade attempts by the Howard government to reform welfare were stymied by the Labor Party. It was not until the coalition gained a majority in the Senate in 2004 that welfare reform actually occurred, in the face of Labor resistance.


Australians wish to be secure in the knowledge that a safety net and social support system will always be available to them if it is genuinely needed. However, at a time of strong jobs growth and emerging labour and skill shortages during the late 1990s and early 2000s the number of working age people in receipt of income support grew to over 20 per cent of all working age Australians, or more than 2.7 million people. Only a small percentage of this number had participation requirements tied to their income support. Seven hundred thousand were on disability support pension and 618,000 received at that stage the parenting payment. Both of these payments were more generous than Newstart allowance, which is received by the unemployed. There were more people receiving the DSP than there were on unemployment benefits. 


This highlighted that people with disabilities in particular had a very low rate of participation in the workforce. Less than 10 per cent of people receiving DSP undertook any work, including many people who had significant work capacity. Approximately one-quarter of all DSP recipients in Australia suffer from psychological and psychiatric conditions. Such conditions are often episodic, and due regard has to be given to how we could more appropriately deal with the situations that many of these people find themselves in when they have an episode which leaves them unfit for work. 


There are substantial barriers which prevent people with disabilities from participating both in the workforce and in everyday life. They include physical barriers, such as access to transport, and mental and psychological challenges. Whatever shape or form they come in, these barriers have been unfortunately reinforced by negative community attitudes and a low expectation of people with disabilities, and this has contributed to many people with disabilities feeling a sense of disempowerment. Governments, business and the disabled themselves must work together and set about removing these barriers and negative stereotypes. People with disabilities acknowledge that they want to be more economically active. The disability support pension should not be a dead-end payment, as unfortunately so many see it today.


The principal object of reform, therefore, should be to encourage and assist more and more people to contribute and participate positively. The Henry report, for example, laid out one approach to welfare reform. If the government deals only with funding a scheme and does not tackle the more important issue of getting people back into the workforce where that is appropriate and able to be achieved, then it will not resolve the problem. The Prime Minister talks about addressing the issue, just like she said in 2009 that getting people into work was her priority. It remains to be seen whether this is just another empty promise from the Labor government.


The coalition remain committed to supporting Australians with disability. We can only hope this government can actually deliver some of what it has promised.

That this House concurs with the resolution relating to the reduction of energy use in Parliament House.


The 10 Per Cent campaign is a challenge to individuals and businesses to reduce their energy consumption, electricity and fuel by 10 per cent, and it is a great practical campaign being run by Do Something and by Choice. The motion before us passed the Senate on the voices and has been sent to the House for concurrence. 


Parliament House easily has the capacity to meet this challenge and the Department of Parliamentary Services has the capacity to facilitate these reduction targets. Other organisations that have signed up to the 10 Per Cent challenge include Bunnings, Visy, Unilever, Toyota, Sensis, the University of Canberra and, notably, News Limited. I for one would hate to see a situation where this Parliament House was trailing News Limited when it came to energy innovation initiatives. 


One of the practical consequences will be to provide some real leadership from this parliament to Australians about the benefits of cutting their electricity bills through energy efficiency. It is clear that one of the greatest steps we can take to reduce energy use is also the one that is going to reduce people's power bills. That is true in the home. It is estimated that somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent savings can be made on energy bills simply through energy efficiency measures. And that is true here. By reducing our reliance on energy here in Parliament House we will of course be saving a significant amount of taxpayer dollars. It is also an example of practical leadership, one that I would hope all sides of parliament and all members of this House would support. I commend the motion to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:59):  I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. This bill makes three changes to Australian tax laws further modernising our taxation system and ensuring that our taxation system takes account of the most disadvantaged in our society. I strongly support the first initiative in this bill which is aimed at promoting early intervention for children with disabilities. Under the system known as the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has just outlined and that was announced as part of the government's election commitments on 29 July 2010, I am proud to be a member of a government that has fulfilled a commitment to improve the long-term outcomes for children with disabilities. I have long believed that we must not consider children with a disability as necessarily placing a significant burden on the state. Indeed, as a teacher and now as a parliamentarian I have long observed the incredibly positive contribution that people with disabilities play in our community at all ages and stages of their lives. It is always important to reaffirm the vast variety of disabilities of differing degrees that people are affected by and to identify within that incredible talents and abilities as well.


Early intervention initiatives have proven immensely successful in improving the lives of children with a variety of disabilities. Indeed, intervention at the early childhood stage of development is now considered to be much more effective than later treatment. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative funds early intervention for children with certain developmental disabilities which the minister recently outlined. This amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ensures that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. I find this reform very encouraging because it will ensure that financial assistance is available and secure. Funding under this initiative is available to families after evidence is provided of confirmed written diagnosis of disability. Whilst this eligibility regime is a necessity, as a community I say again we must always remember that people, including particularly children with disabilities, are never to be defined by those disabilities. While definitions of disability are a necessity in relation to the administration of these tax and social security benefits, we have to be mindful of the inherent limitation of labels, to see the abilities of all, and to celebrate the gifts that kids with disabilities bring to their families, to their school communities and to their broader communities.


The provision I mentioned here provides a further one-off payment of $2,000 to parents and carers who are living in rural and regional communities in Australia who require assistance to get their young child with a disability to the type of care and support that they deserve and they need. This element is a vital component to the scheme because parents and carers living in remote and regional areas experience far greater difficulty in accessing services than we would like to be the case. I believe that the additional $2,000 will help remedy this by enabling additional expenses such as travel for doctors appointments and transport to be able to be covered. This social program represents a very smart investment by government.


By investing in early intervention we not only improve real life outcomes, we also save on health costs. By intervening early we are increasing the likelihood that individual children with disabilities will lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives. By establishing support services early in life, it is likely that children with disabilities will grow up much more engaged with and active in their communities. I am proud to support a government committed to improving the life circumstances for people with disabilities. It is a core Labor value to support the most disadvantaged in society. Our record shows that our policy decisions are not just geared to ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number but always retain within our legislative program compassion, empathy and a belief in supporting those who might be less advantaged. I believe that this legislation is complemented by our plan to introduce a national disability insurance scheme, a once in a generation reform that will directly improve and transform the lives of people with disabilities and those of their families. 


Another important reform contained in this bill is the amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 in particular in relation to transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This bill will provide an exemption from the fringe benefits tax for transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This amendment operates in the circumstances where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under what is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement. Our taxation system should not act as a disincentive for people to work under a fly-in fly-out arrangement.


Also as stated by the minister in his second reading speech, this measure ensures that any possible double taxation is eliminated. Taxing transport provided under these arrangements may also result in economic double taxation, with an Australian employer paying FBT on transport provided to an employee employed under a fly-in fly-out situation. Our taxation system needs to take into account the fact that Australians work and engage in a global economy, and working overseas is necessarily a component of this. The amendments improve the fairness and integrity of Australia's tax system by better targeting the tax exemption for income earned by Australians overseas. As a result, most Australian residents earning employment income are now treated more consistently.


The third important change that this legislation brings is one to our recognition of charitable donations and adds a new fund to the list of deductible gift recipients. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. It will allow those who wish to donate more than $2 to deduct the amount from their tax for that year. The Charities Aid Foundation, a body representing charities in the United Kingdom, has recognised Australia as the most giving nation in their annual World Giving Index.


The giving index aggregates three key factors: money given to charities by a nation's citizens, time spent volunteering, and how willing a nation's citizens are to help strangers. Australia and New Zealand were shown to be the most giving nations. It is a testament to the Australian character that we are so willing to give. We are willing to give our time to friends and family, to give support to strangers, and to give money to help our fellow Australians and our friends across the Tasman.


This schedule adds an organisation to the act, namely, the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust, and also the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. The New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust was established to help the families and communities affected by the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011. Listing the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust will allow Australians to donate to the appeal and claim a tax deduction for the donation.


These changes reward Australians who give to our closest neighbours and friends. New Zealand suffered greatly through the earthquakes earlier this year, and since then has suffered many tremors and frightening shocks. Nearly 200 New Zealanders lost their lives, and the resulting damage bill is in the tens of billions. The natural response from Australians is to act. Immediately, the Prime Minister pledged Australian assistance to New Zealand and gave $5 million to the Red Cross. This was accompanied by direct assistance from the people of Australia. As the Prime Minister said in her address to the parliament of New Zealand earlier this year:


That is why I say Australia has many alliances and friendships around the world. Economic and defence partnerships of every kind. But New Zealand alone is family.


This schedule does not only deal with aid to New Zealand, however; it also makes some procedural changes related to the amalgamation of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, the NBOCC, and Cancer Australia on 15 June 2010.


The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and Cancer Australia merged to create a one-stop shop to provide improved leadership to and outcomes for Australians living with cancer and their families. The new Cancer Australia will combine the experience and successes of both organisations to further strengthen the Australian government's strategic focus on cancer and create a solid platform for the coordination of cancer initiatives at a national level. Breast cancer and ovarian cancer will remain a priority for Cancer Australia as it delivers the government's broader cancer programs and research priorities. Following the listing of the Cancer Australia Gift Fund, donations made to this new organisation will be used to improve breast cancer outcomes for women, reduce mortalities from breast cancer and improve the wellbeing of women diagnosed with the disease.


This is an important bill that will ensure greater equality in our taxation system. It will support early identification and intervention for children with disabilities who live in families in remote and rural areas. They will get the assistance they need. The bill will support Australian workers that are employed in fly-in fly-out industries by ensuring they will not be taxed twice. It will also support charitable donations to new and vital organisations to ensure that Australians can contribute to, and great outcomes can be achieved for, the health of the nation. I commend the minister for his work and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (17:10): I would like to thank all those members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011, including the member for Robertson.


Schedule 1 to this bill ensures that the outer regional and remote payments to support families with children with disabilities will be exempt from income tax. This is an important amendment to ensure families with children with disabilities will not have to pay tax on the outer regional and remote payments they receive.


Schedule 2 extends the fringe benefits tax exemption for Australian residents working in remote locations on a fly-in fly-out basis to Australian residents working on a fly-in fly-out basis in similar remote locations overseas. Extending the exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas in fly-in fly-out arrangements will be taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas. This measure will apply to fringe benefits provided after 1 July 2009, when Australian residents working in remote areas overseas became potentially assessable on their foreign employment income.


Schedule 3 amends the deductible gift recipient, DGR, provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act, namely: the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities. It also recognises the name change of WorldSkills Australia Inc. to WorldSkills Australia.


This bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:59):  I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. This bill makes three changes to Australian tax laws further modernising our taxation system and ensuring that our taxation system takes account of the most disadvantaged in our society. I strongly support the first initiative in this bill which is aimed at promoting early intervention for children with disabilities. Under the system known as the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has just outlined and that was announced as part of the government's election commitments on 29 July 2010, I am proud to be a member of a government that has fulfilled a commitment to improve the long-term outcomes for children with disabilities. I have long believed that we must not consider children with a disability as necessarily placing a significant burden on the state. Indeed, as a teacher and now as a parliamentarian I have long observed the incredibly positive contribution that people with disabilities play in our community at all ages and stages of their lives. It is always important to reaffirm the vast variety of disabilities of differing degrees that people are affected by and to identify within that incredible talents and abilities as well.


Early intervention initiatives have proven immensely successful in improving the lives of children with a variety of disabilities. Indeed, intervention at the early childhood stage of development is now considered to be much more effective than later treatment. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative funds early intervention for children with certain developmental disabilities which the minister recently outlined. This amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ensures that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. I find this reform very encouraging because it will ensure that financial assistance is available and secure. Funding under this initiative is available to families after evidence is provided of confirmed written diagnosis of disability. Whilst this eligibility regime is a necessity, as a community I say again we must always remember that people, including particularly children with disabilities, are never to be defined by those disabilities. While definitions of disability are a necessity in relation to the administration of these tax and social security benefits, we have to be mindful of the inherent limitation of labels, to see the abilities of all, and to celebrate the gifts that kids with disabilities bring to their families, to their school communities and to their broader communities.


The provision I mentioned here provides a further one-off payment of $2,000 to parents and carers who are living in rural and regional communities in Australia who require assistance to get their young child with a disability to the type of care and support that they deserve and they need. This element is a vital component to the scheme because parents and carers living in remote and regional areas experience far greater difficulty in accessing services than we would like to be the case. I believe that the additional $2,000 will help remedy this by enabling additional expenses such as travel for doctors appointments and transport to be able to be covered. This social program represents a very smart investment by government.


By investing in early intervention we not only improve real life outcomes, we also save on health costs. By intervening early we are increasing the likelihood that individual children with disabilities will lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives. By establishing support services early in life, it is likely that children with disabilities will grow up much more engaged with and active in their communities.

(1) notes that: 


(a) on 9 July 2011 two new nations emerged, the nations of South and North Sudan, which follows an overwhelming vote for independence by voters in South Sudan's referendum for independence on 9 January 2011; 


(b) the future of these nations are interdependent and their stability has regional border security implications for North and East Africa; 


(c) the emerging picture confronting both new nations is dire and with significant political, humanitarian and developmental challenges; 


(d) the overall security situation in Sudan is deteriorating at an alarming rate, having severe humanitarian consequences with millions of civilians in both North and South Sudan in need of protection and critical humanitarian assistance; 


(e) Sudan, after Zimbabwe, is the second largest recipient of Australia's humanitarian and development assistance in Africa—since 2004, the Australian Government has provided $136 million to Sudan; 


(f) the North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 that ended over two decades of civil war is at risk, due to recent violence, with outstanding issues such as border demarcation, oil revenue sharing, currency and citizenship status, unresolved; 


(g) Sudan has the highest level overall of people remaining internally displaced according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the highest number of people newly displaced by conflict; and 


(h) the plight of internally displaced people and Sudanese refugees will therefore continue to be a shared legacy of decades of conflict; 


(2) condemns the most recent violence that has seen conflict spread across North and South Sudan and has recently escalated in the contested border region of Abyei and in two of the 'three protocol areas'—South Kordofan and the Nuba Mountains—causing mass displacement; 


(3) recognises that the inter-ethnic conflict also affects South Sudan, and people in South Sudan's Western Equatoria region are still victims of attacks by the Lords Resistance Army along the border areas of Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic; 


(4) expresses deep concern at the: 


(a) protracted nature of the conflict and displacement in Darfur, now in its eighth year; 


(b) United Nations estimate that 300 000 people have been killed as a result of violence, malnutrition and starvation, and 4 million people are in desperate need of aid, representing nearly two thirds of the entire estimated Darfur population of 6.5 million; and

(5) notes that: 


(a) humanitarian relief efforts to provide assistance to vulnerable populations are being hampered by limited humanitarian access in some of the most affected conflict areas including in South Kordofan and Darfur; and 


(b) insecurity and inaccessibility remain amongst the biggest challenges facing the delivery of assistance by humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations; 


(6) urges the Government of South Sudan and the Government of Sudan to reaffirm their commitment to peace, conflict prevention, the inclusion of the peripheral regions and ethnic minorities in political representation and decision making, and the recognition of cultural and ethnic diversity through durable political solutions; and 


(7) encourages the Australian Government to provide ongoing and predictable diplomatic and funding resources to address humanitarian and development needs in North and South Sudan. (Notice given 21 June 2011.)

That this House:

(2) notes that polio remains endemic in four countries—Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan—three of which are Commonwealth nations; 


(3) recognises that in 2010, there were only 1290 cases of polio worldwide, down from 350 000 cases in 1988, indicating the unprecedented opportunity the world has to eradicate polio once and for all; 


(4) notes that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative currently faces a funding shortfall of US$665 million for the full implementation of its 2010-12 Polio Eradication Strategic Plan; and

7 MR TUDGE: To move:


That this House: 


(1) affirms its strong support for all forms of early childhood learning and recognises the importance of pre-school on the development of children and as a foundation for their future education; 


(2) notes that the Gillard Government has mandated that 'four-year-old kindergartens' provide at least 15 hours per week of instruction by a university-trained teacher by 2013 under its 'Universal Access' policy; 


(3) notes that the Gillard Government has not considered the consequences of its 'Universal Access' policy on Victorian kindergartens where 'three-year-old kindergarten' is more commonly offered than by other jurisdictions; 


(4) notes that the consequence of 'Universal Access' on Victoria's kindergartens is that many will no longer be able to offer 'three-year-old kindergarten' programs because facilities are often shared between three and 'four-year-old kindergarten' programs; 


(5) acknowledges that this policy will effectively remove the choice for many Victorian parents of sending their three-year-old children to kindergarten; 


(6) notes that some rural kindergartens could face the risk of closure because there is a shortage of qualified teachers in rural areas, and due to the increase in mandated hours, many rural kindergartens will no longer be able to share teachers; 


(7) notes that warnings of this imminent crisis for Victoria's kindergartens have been given directly to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth by the Municipal Association of Victoria, parent groups, kindergarten operators and parliamentarians; and 


(8) calls on the Government to: 


(a) provide flexibility for kindergarten operators to deliver kindergarten services according to the needs of their own communities and in line with local infrastructure and staffing capacity; or 


(b) at the very least, provide flexibility on the start date for the implementation of 'Universal Access'. (Notice given 5 July 2011.)

8 MR CHAMPION: To move:


That this House: 


(1) notes:

(b) an independent evaluation of compulsory and voluntary income management in Western Australia showed that participants believed it had made a positive impact on their lives; 


(c) that a non discriminatory income management system linked to the child protection system and school attendance has been rolled out in the Northern Territory to help children who are being neglected or are at risk of neglect; 


(d) that more than 1700 people have moved off income management across the Northern Territory because they have found jobs and apprenticeships or improved their parenting skills; and 


(e) that income management produces positive life impacts for individuals acquiring new skills through training and getting jobs; and 


(2) calls for this initiative to be trialled in other communities to help those families and individuals receiving welfare payments who are: 


(a) identified as high risk by Centrelink social workers; 


(b) recommended by child protection workers; and

1 MS PARKE: To move:


That this House:

(b) the future of these nations are interdependent and their stability has regional border security implications for North and East Africa; 


(c) the emerging picture confronting both new nations is dire and with significant political, humanitarian and developmental challenges; 


(d) the overall security situation in Sudan is deteriorating at an alarming rate, having severe humanitarian consequences with millions of civilians in both North and South Sudan in need of protection and critical humanitarian assistance; 


(e) Sudan, after Zimbabwe, is the second largest recipient of Australia's humanitarian and development assistance in Africa—since 2004, the Australian Government has provided $136 million to Sudan; 


(f) the North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 that ended over two decades of civil war is at risk, due to recent violence, with outstanding issues such as border demarcation, oil revenue sharing, currency and citizenship status, unresolved; 


(g) Sudan has the highest level overall of people remaining internally displaced according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the highest number of people newly displaced by conflict; and 


(h) the plight of internally displaced people and Sudanese refugees will therefore continue to be a shared legacy of decades of conflict; 


(2) condemns the most recent violence that has seen conflict spread across North and South Sudan and has recently escalated in the contested border region of Abyei and in two of the 'three protocol areas'—South Kordofan and the Nuba Mountains—causing mass displacement;

(4) expresses deep concern at the: 


(a) protracted nature of the conflict and displacement in Darfur, now in its eighth year;

(c) estimated 2.5 million people that live in refugee camps in Darfur and neighbouring Chad, while others struggle to survive in remote villages; 


(5) notes that: 


(a) humanitarian relief efforts to provide assistance to vulnerable populations are being hampered by limited humanitarian access in some of the most affected conflict areas including in South Kordofan and Darfur; and 


(b) insecurity and inaccessibility remain amongst the biggest challenges facing the delivery of assistance by humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations; 


(6) urges the Government of South Sudan and the Government of Sudan to reaffirm their commitment to peace, conflict prevention, the inclusion of the peripheral regions and ethnic minorities in political representation and decision making, and the recognition of cultural and ethnic diversity through durable political solutions; and

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (19:00):  I rise to speak about the Labor government's decision in the last federal budget to close the chronic disease dental scheme by December this year. This, like many Labor decisions, has not been thought out and will leave a lot of residents in Macquarie without access to much needed dental care. The coalition government introduced the chronic disease dental scheme in 2007. Since then nearly 13 million dental services have been provided to over half a million Australians. Now the Gillard Labor government wants to close it down. The scheme provides $4,250 worth of dental assistance over two years for patients who are diagnosed with a chronic illness, whose dental condition is exacerbating that illness and who are managed under a general practitioner care plan.


To close this scheme would have disastrous health impacts on the residents of Macquarie. The chronic disease dental scheme has been very beneficial. It has aided many Australians to access dental care in a timely fashion. Dental care can be very costly, and waiting lists are often longer than those in need can afford to wait. Under the scheme a lot of these challenges have been alleviated.


The Labor government have tried on two separate occasions to stop this popular scheme and both times the Senate has disallowed its closure. Labor are now trying to close the scheme for a third time. This is another example of the Labor government thinking they know better than the Australian people.


The need for this scheme cannot be disputed. In its first year, 400,235 New South Wales services accessed this scheme. In the 2010-11 financial year this had surged over 700 per cent to 2,859,175 services. This very effective scheme is being shut down by a Labor government desperate to recover some of the billions of dollars they have wasted in their suite of mismanaged policies, whether it be pink batts, the five-for-one people swap or the carbon tax—and, of course, the list goes on.


Across my electorate I have found strong support for the chronic disease dental scheme. I have spoken to dentists and patients from suburbs such as Blaxland, Bligh Park and Katoomba and the message has always been the same. The chronic disease dental scheme has allowed many people who otherwise could not have gained access to dental health care the opportunity to do so in a timely manner without the cost affecting their ability to receive treatment.


Many local dentists are sceptical of Labor's ability to deliver a viable alternative and have grave concerns about the number of people who, if the scheme is removed, will be sent to the back of a very long public waiting list. Local dentists have highlighted to me how troubling bad teeth can be for your health. To offer a patient a vital life-saving device or operation and not ensure that their teeth are healthy could potentially undo all of that work. Bacteria and other diseases that are on your teeth and gums can spread throughout your body. Healthy teeth are an important part of a healthy life.


I was told stories of how this scheme had affected the lives of Macquarie residents in positive ways. I was told the story of a woman from the Blue Mountains who had lived with no teeth for the past 20 years due to losing them in a shocking case of domestic violence. She had never been able to afford new teeth. Thanks to the chronic disease dental scheme she received the much needed surgery. When she saw herself in the mirror with her brand-new teeth she burst into tears and said it was one of the happiest moments of her life.


Another story was of a young person battling to break the cycle of drug addiction. Due to her challenges with this addiction she had, unfortunately, lost all of her teeth. She qualified for new teeth under the chronic disease dental scheme. Thanks to this and her new lease on life she has been able to break the cycle and turn her life around and obtain work. She now works in a local fruit shop. She is back on track with a healthy lifestyle. Being able to access the workforce has made a real difference in her rehabilitation.


The dentists I spoke to made one thing very clear to me. Dental assistance is valuable not only for a person's physical health but also for their self-esteem and mental health. The chronic disease dental scheme has helped to improve the health and morale of Australians who otherwise could not have afforded to receive this assistance. We live in a time of economic uncertainty. The cost of living is continuing to rise and more members of my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. This Labor government is now proposing to close access to dental health care that has made, and will continue to make, a difference to the lives of my constituents.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (09:30):  I rise today to draw attention to what I consider to be an indication of the declining standards in this place by someone who should know better but who is obviously totally frustrated by his own deficiencies. In last Saturday's Gladstone Observer, the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley and Treasurer, referred to me as the hopeless LNP member for Flynn because I refused to support the failed rollout of the NBN in Gladstone, Australia's industrial powerhouse. I would like to inform him that I fully support the coalition's fast broadband plan, which could be provided sooner and at much less cost to Gladstone and rural and regional centres throughout Australia, as detailed recently by coalition communications spokesman, Mr Malcolm Turnbull.


I am wondering how the Deputy Prime Minister defines hopelessness. Does hopelessness mean his inability to deliver on a Labor promise, one of a series to the people of Gladstone? Does hopelessness mean a person who has to petition his own government and Prime Minister to deliver something he promised a year ago? Or does hopelessness mean failure by the Treasurer to understand basic economics like how to calculate a company's cost of capital, let alone the nation's spiralling debt? Or maybe hopelessness is the same as cluelessness when it comes to understanding that a carbon tax costs people in my electorate and many others their jobs and their livelihoods.


When I joined this place I hoped that I would be able to work with both sides of politics to get things done for my electorate and I have developed a good working relationship with many on the other side. I have great respect for the members for Hotham and Batman, and I thank them for their help across a number of issues that affect my electorate. Senator John Hogg has also been of assistance in helping me sort out a number of problems caused by the BER scheme. 


It would be helpful if the Deputy Prime Minister set some time aside next time he comes to my electorate, and I can show him what really is happening on the ground. In the past he has chosen to fly in, jump on a helicopter to fly over the harbour and then attend a sausage sizzle with his union delegates and ALP members. Next time the Deputy Prime Minister comes to town, give me a chance to take him to talk to small business who are doing it tough in my area. Let him talk to the families that Labor policies are hurting. Let me show him what the majority of workers in Central Queensland think of the carbon tax. Take the politics out of it, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, and put the people of Central Queensland first. (Time expired)

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:02):  I will continue where I left off. While this comment from Justice French was not binding, and he did not express a view at the time as to his opinion on the outcome, it certainly highlights the possibility that, at some point in the future, the ACCC or a court could take this definition. In doing so, it would be very difficult to show that any one merger or acquisition had limited sustainability competition. This could potentially have a number of grave consequences, particularly in relation to creeping acquisitions.


Creeping acquisitions are those acquisitions which in and of themselves do not lessen competition but, taken as a collective, may have a greater effect over time. One area in particular that has been noted is grocery prices. Indeed, this bill is a direct result of the ACCC's inquiry into grocery prices and the government's subsequent public consultation on the matter. In the ACCC's report it stated that it considered that:


… the supermarket industry, because of the particular structural features of the market, is one where creeping acquisitions are a potential area of concern.


Further, I imagine that most Australians buy their groceries from local supermarkets, in most cases only a few kilometres from their home. Given that, the issues raised by Justice French in his comments over the definition of the market are problematic to say the least. It is important to note that, while these issues have not impacted on grocery prices, this is not an excuse for inaction.


We have identified two areas where action is needed and the imperative now is to take adequate action to address these concerns. In doing so, the government is responding with specific remedies to specific problems, rather than with general remedies that could well have unforeseen and detrimental consequences on competition and on the economy as a whole. The government action today is one of the measures I highlighted earlier. It is a measured and appropriate response to the long-term interests of competition, economic growth and the country. In this light, I commend the bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:04):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. There are four main parts to this bill. Chapter 1 deals with mergers and acquisitions, chapter 2 deals with unconscionable conduct, chapter 3 is merely a few minor technical amendments and chapter 4 deals with what is known as creeping acquisitions. In the time permitted I would like to discuss each part separately. However, firstly, sadly, in totality this bill is nothing other than window-dressing—a meaningless nothing. It demonstrates that Labor, after all the sound bites when in opposition, have given up on competition policy. They have simply hoisted the white flag.


Competition policy is arguably one of the most crucial portfolios for any government. But, sadly, after the failed tenures of the current Minister for Trade and the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, when the single highlight was the farce of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, this Labor-Greens government has, appallingly, downgraded the competition portfolio to that of a parliamentary secretary. So it is of little surprise that we end up with a bill like this.


The first chapter of the bill is on the subject of mergers and acquisitions. Our current merger law provides:


A corporation shall not acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares in the capital, or any assets, of a body corporate where the acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods or services.


Let us be clear: when two firms merge, what happens is that firms that have previously been in competition with each other get together to coordinate and fix prices and divide markets. What mergers actually do is take conduct that we find so detrimental to competition and consumers—and our laws make such conduct illegal, with penalties including jail—and make that same conduct legal. The first change proposed by this bill in affecting mergers is purely academic. It changes the words 'substantially lessening competition in a market for goods or services' to the words 'substantially lessening competition in any market for goods or services'. It simply replaces the words 'a market' for the words 'any market'—a change that creates the impression of doing something without doing anything.


The second change is to remove the word 'substantial' as it applies to restrict the application for section 50 to substantial markets. The problem with this bill is that it takes out the wrong 'substantial'. The 'substantial' that should be deleted from the act is in respect of the word 'substantial' as it relates to 'substantially lessening of competition'. Under our current laws we have the absurdity that a merger that results in a mere lessening of competition to the detriment of consumers and to the detriment of our national interest is acceptable provided that such lessening of competition is not deemed as 'substantial'. We are productivity-growth stalled, with problems throughout our economy and hyper-concentration in many of our markets. How can we permit any further concentration occurring through mergers that result in further lessening of competition? If we have the proviso, we can only prevent it if that lessening of competition is 'substantial'.


Considering why this bill proposes to take out the wrong 'substantial' it is important to consider the historical context of the current wording of the bill. The text of Australia's merger laws were inherited from America's antitrust laws—the Clayton act of 1914, a law written almost a century ago. America's Clayton act makes various anticompetitive practices illegal when they might 'substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce'. The problem with the word 'substantial' is that it is capable of meaning many different things and is open to wide interpretation. By way of example, is 25 per cent a substantial proportion? Twenty-five per cent of our nation's exports are sold to China, and I am sure everyone would agree with the statement that a substantial proportion of Australia's exports are sold to China. In that context, 25 per cent is a substantial number. Yet, at the last New South Wales state election, the flyblown New South Wales Labor government achieved a primary vote of 25.5 per cent. So the statement: 'A substantial number of electors voted for the New South Wales Labor Party at the last New South Wales state election' is a complete absurdity. In that context, 25 per cent is not a substantial number. 


Further, for the majority of the last century during America's golden years America's antitrust laws were interpreted as meaning that competition was a process that required numerous participants and a deconcentration of market power and that any lessening of competition was equated with a decrease in the number of participants. However, in the 1970s and 1980s the long-held view that increased concentration means less competition was challenged by a group known as the Chicago school. If you want to mark the time when America started its decline you can circle the time when a small minority who theorised that a lessening of competition is not equated with a decrease in the number of participants in a market took control of the economic leaders of American policy. 


One of the greatest supporters of the theories of the Chicago school was Alan Greenspan. But, in 2008, following the collapse of the US economy, Greenspan gave the mea culpa when he said of this theory:


I have found a flaw …  I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I’ve been very distressed by that fact.


Pressed to clarify his words, Greenspan was asked, 'In other words, you have found that your view of the world—your ideology—was not right; it was not working'. 'Absolutely, precisely,' Greenspan replied.


If anyone wants an example of how these misguided theories of market concentration mean less competition and higher prices for consumers, they only need to study what has happened in the Australian supermarket sector. Over the last 30 years we have seen an ever-increasing concentration in the Australian supermarket sector, where the market share of our two largest retailers has increased from around 30 per cent of the market to where it stands today at around 80 per cent, leaving Australia with one of the most concentrated markets in world economic history outside that of former Eastern Bloc countries. 


The so-called experts have theorised that this period of ever-increasing market concentration would lead to efficiencies and greater synergies to the benefit of consumers. But if you look at the empirical evidence and not the computer generated models you will see the exact opposite has happened. The evidence, as clearly demonstrated by OECD figures, shows that during this period of increasing market concentration Australia consumers have been punished with the fastest accelerating supermarket prices in the developed world. Therefore, what we need to look at is removing the other 'substantial' in our merger laws and returning our laws to the original intent that a merger that results in a lessening of competition should not be permitted.


The second part of this bill deals with unconscionable conduct. Before addressing the provisions of the bill, it is worth noting why we need a statutory prohibition on unconscionable conduct rather than just relying on the common law. The history of our common law traces back to the legal principles that we inherited from decisions reaching back to the aftermath of the Norman invasion of the British Isles. Our common law developed in the age of the village market where both parties to a contract were of approximately equal power and were members of a keenly competitive society. They therefore were able to negotiate freely the terms of their contracts and, importantly, had equal access to the law. However, with today's growth of oligopolies and duopolies, with the special privileges handed out to many of our large corporations today to protect themselves from competition and with small business denied equal access to the courts due to the outrageous cost of litigation today, the conditions of a level playing field that existed when our common laws on unconscionable conduct were developed are simply not present today—especially in contractual relations between big and small business in today's economy. Therefore, to level the playing field it has been necessary to advance the existing common law on unconscionable conduct by having specific statutory provisions. 


Sadly, the proposed amendments to this bill give the impression of doing something without doing anything. The insertion of a statement of interpretive principles into the unconscionable conduct provisions of Australian consumer law simply add nothing. They merely regurgitate what the courts have already stated. Let us look at these changes. The first provides that:


It is the intention of the Parliament that:


(a) this section is not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct …


This simply adds nothing. The courts have already made it very clear that existing statutory provisions are not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct. The problem which is not addressed by this bill is that without a statutory interpretation the courts have given a very narrow interpretation of what unconscionable conduct is. In doing so, they have hardly moved the law beyond the existing common law interpretation. The first part adds nothing; it simply regurgitates what the courts have already stated.


The other changes in this bill are, again, meaningless and add nothing. The existing statutory provisions under section 22 of the Australian Consumer Law state:


(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:


(a) the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person … engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.


The existing section continues:


(1) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a person (the supplier) has contravened section 21 in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (the customer), the court may have regard to …


The section then goes on to list a long list of non-exhaustive factors which the court may have regard to. So our courts are already able to look at all the circumstances and the proposed amendments, again, are simply meaningless.


There is an alternative way to address the inadequacies of our statutory provisions on unconscionable conduct. Firstly, to move the law on from the narrow provisions of interpretation given by the courts we need a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in the act. We need to look at the reasonableness of the conduct and whether it is harsh or oppressive.


Secondly, we need the existing provisions of the unfair contract terms in the Australian Consumer Law extended to small business. If you want an example of the anti-small business agenda of this current Labor government you need look no further than their shameful removal of small business from the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law done by the current Minister for Trade during his term as Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Initially Labor proposed that the unfair contract terms legislation would apply to small business in their dealings with big business, and that they should have been congratulated on. But, instead, cuddling up to their mates at the big end of town, this government have shamefully sold small business down the river by excluding them from the unfair contract provisions. It is an absolute disgrace which every small business person in this country should never ever forget.


The third part of this bill merely makes a few minor technical amendments which are of no significance. The fourth part of the bill involves so-called creeping acquisitions. The theory behind the need for this legislation is that in a series of small acquisitions each individual acquisition when looked at separately may not result in a substantial lessening of competition. But when these single acquisitions are looked at together as a group they may lead to a substantial lessening of competition. This law would be an illusion. It would not have any effect. Just look at the Westpac takeover of St George Bank. St George has over 400 branches. If the ACCC considered that Westpac taking over more than 400 St George Bank branches in one single hit did not substantially reduce competition, how would changing the law to enable Westpac taking over a few at a time through creeping acquisitions make any difference? Again, this is a meaningless nothing.


In conclusion, this bill is a meaningless nothing. It creates the appearance of making changes. It creates the appearance of doing something to address problems with our nation's competition laws while doing absolutely nothing. We have real problems with competition policy in this country. Our productivity growth has stalled. Many of our markets have degenerated into states of hyperconcentration. Consumers are being punished by higher rates of inflation. We need a lot more than what this bill offers.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:19):  The philosophy of those of us on this side of the House is that free markets are the mechanism best developed to generate wealth in society, to raise living standards and to ensure that Australians have the opportunity of work and leisure that is part of a fulfilling life. We on this side of the House recognise that free markets work best when accompanied by appropriate regulation—such as the Trade Practicesw Act 1974 originally brought in under the Whitlam government in 1975. Appropriate regulation such as the Fair Work Act 2009, brought in under this government; legislation that realises that it is critical to strike the right balance between employers and employees. This is a balance which those opposite apparently supported in the last election but which, by now taking the lead from the member for Bennelong, they have begun to abandon, with a new attack on penalty rates and an attack on the overall notion that free markets work best under proper regulation.


The bill before the House today, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, began its life as a bill under the now Minister for Trade, Dr Emerson. It was a product of extensive consultations. The bill does three things: it provides greater clarity to the provisions of the CCA regarding mergers and acquisitions; it streamlines and clarifies the unconscionable conduct provisions; and it corrects some minor drafting errors.


Public consultations, conducted in 2008 and 2009 by the member for Rankin, identified the importance of getting the term 'market' appropriately defined. This bill will replace references to 'a market' with references to 'any market'. That will clarify that a court or the ACCC can consider the competitive effect of a merger or acquisition on multiple markets in any one investigation. This amending legislation will ensure that a court or the ACCC looks beyond the primary market in which the merger or acquisition would occur.


The second area is in relation to the definition of 'market' in section 50(6) of the CCA. The bill will delete the word 'substantial' in the definition of 'market'. That will clarify that the competitive effects of a merger or an acquisition on a local market can be considered under section 50. That will ensure that a court or the ACCC can examine a merger or acquisition in any market, regardless of its size or its geography.


The bill also makes changes in relation to the unconscionable conduct provisions, which will streamline and clarify the operation of the provisions. It will unify the consumer and business related provisions of the ACL and the ASIC Act, replacing sections 21 and 22 of the ACL with a single provision that will apply to both consumers and businesses. The bill will amend the mirrored provisions in sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act, which will reflect these changes to the Australian consumer law.


The bill will clarify the unconscionable conduct provisions by inserting interpretive principles into the acts that will assist courts in applying the prohibition, as well as improving stakeholder understanding of the meaning and scope of the prohibition. There have been substantial improvements in legislative drafting over recent decades, partly to ensure that courts have as much information as possible to help them interpret statute laws. These interpretive principles are derived from existing case law, so they will be clarifying rather than altering the effect of the statutory prohibition against unconscionable conduct. Those principles will include, for example, that unconscionable conduct is not limited by unwritten law; that the prohibition applies to systems of conduct or patterns of behaviour; and that a court can examine the terms and progress of contract in considering whether conduct to which the contract relates is unconscionable.


Finally, as I have mentioned, the bill corrects a number of minor drafting errors in the CCA that were the result of the passage of legislation by this House in 2010. Overall, the measures in the bill will improve the operation of Australia's competition and consumer laws. They will clarify the breadth of matters to be examined by a court or the ACCC in considering whether a proposed merger or acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the market. They will unify the prohibition against unconscionable conduct and provide the courts with greater guidance in its application. Overall, this is legislation which is part of Labor's commitment to free and effective markets, but markets which are appropriately regulated.


I was very proud recently to speak to students in Marist College. Mary-Lou Minty, their economics teacher, brought me in and we had a wide-ranging conversation with the boys about the major principles involved in economic reform. They understood—perhaps even better than some of those opposite—the importance of getting the balance right with regulation. Letting the market rip can often produce outcomes which give less growth, less improvement in living standards and less productivity. Getting the balance right in competition law, as in industrial relations, is critical to improving the living standards of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY:
  The bill will give effect to two important reforms to strengthen and clarify our competition and consumer laws. Firstly, the bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions, by amending the mergers and acquisitions provisions in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. This bill will remove the requirement that a market in which the competition effects of a merger are assessed must be a substantial market. The amendments will also ensure that the courts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including those where creeping acquisition concerns may be raised in the community.


Secondly, the bill enhances and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. The bill will assist consumers, businesses, regulators and the courts by inserting interpretive principles to clarify the meaning of 'unconscionable conduct' in those laws and by unifying their business and consumer related provisions. These amendments clarify the parliament's intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply. They will place the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in a better position to take more effective enforcement action.


Finally, the bill makes minor technical amendments to correct a small number of drafting errors in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010. I thank all of those who have made contributions to the consultation process. I also once again thank my colleagues in the states and territories for their ongoing cooperation in competition and consumer law.

Over the last 30 years we have seen an ever-increasing concentration in the Australian supermarket sector, where the market share of our two largest retailers has increased from around 30 per cent of the market to where it stands today at around 80 per cent, leaving Australia with one of the most concentrated markets in world economic history outside that of former Eastern Bloc countries. 


The so-called experts have theorised that this period of ever-increasing market concentration would lead to efficiencies and greater synergies to the benefit of consumers. But if you look at the empirical evidence and not the computer generated models you will see the exact opposite has happened. The evidence, as clearly demonstrated by OECD figures, shows that during this period of increasing market concentration Australia consumers have been punished with the fastest accelerating supermarket prices in the developed world. Therefore, what we need to look at is removing the other 'substantial' in our merger laws and returning our laws to the original intent that a merger that results in a lessening of competition should not be permitted.


The second part of this bill deals with unconscionable conduct. Before addressing the provisions of the bill, it is worth noting why we need a statutory prohibition on unconscionable conduct rather than just relying on the common law. The history of our common law traces back to the legal principles that we inherited from decisions reaching back to the aftermath of the Norman invasion of the British Isles. Our common law developed in the age of the village market where both parties to a contract were of approximately equal power and were members of a keenly competitive society. They therefore were able to negotiate freely the terms of their contracts and, importantly, had equal access to the law. However, with today's growth of oligopolies and duopolies, with the special privileges handed out to many of our large corporations today to protect themselves from competition and with small business denied equal access to the courts due to the outrageous cost of litigation today, the conditions of a level playing field that existed when our common laws on unconscionable conduct were developed are simply not present today—especially in contractual relations between big and small business in today's economy. Therefore, to level the playing field it has been necessary to advance the existing common law on unconscionable conduct by having specific statutory provisions. 


Sadly, the proposed amendments to this bill give the impression of doing something without doing anything. The insertion of a statement of interpretive principles into the unconscionable conduct provisions of Australian consumer law simply add nothing. They merely regurgitate what the courts have already stated. Let us look at these changes. The first provides that:


It is the intention of the Parliament that:


(a) this section is not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct …


This simply adds nothing. The courts have already made it very clear that existing statutory provisions are not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct. The problem which is not addressed by this bill is that without a statutory interpretation the courts have given a very narrow interpretation of what unconscionable conduct is. In doing so, they have hardly moved the law beyond the existing common law interpretation. The first part adds nothing; it simply regurgitates what the courts have already stated.


The other changes in this bill are, again, meaningless and add nothing. The existing statutory provisions under section 22 of the Australian Consumer Law state:


(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:


(a) the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person … engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.


The existing section continues:


(1) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a person (the supplier) has contravened section 21 in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (the customer), the court may have regard to …


The section then goes on to list a long list of non-exhaustive factors which the court may have regard to. So our courts are already able to look at all the circumstances and the proposed amendments, again, are simply meaningless.


There is an alternative way to address the inadequacies of our statutory provisions on unconscionable conduct. Firstly, to move the law on from the narrow provisions of interpretation given by the courts we need a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in the act. We need to look at the reasonableness of the conduct and whether it is harsh or oppressive.


Secondly, we need the existing provisions of the unfair contract terms in the Australian Consumer Law extended to small business. If you want an example of the anti-small business agenda of this current Labor government you need look no further than their shameful removal of small business from the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law done by the current Minister for Trade during his term as Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Initially Labor proposed that the unfair contract terms legislation would apply to small business in their dealings with big business, and that they should have been congratulated on. But, instead, cuddling up to their mates at the big end of town, this government have shamefully sold small business down the river by excluding them from the unfair contract provisions. It is an absolute disgrace which every small business person in this country should never ever forget.


The third part of this bill merely makes a few minor technical amendments which are of no significance. The fourth part of the bill involves so-called creeping acquisitions. The theory behind the need for this legislation is that in a series of small acquisitions each individual acquisition when looked at separately may not result in a substantial lessening of competition. But when these single acquisitions are looked at together as a group they may lead to a substantial lessening of competition. This law would be an illusion. It would not have any effect. Just look at the Westpac takeover of St George Bank. St George has over 400 branches. If the ACCC considered that Westpac taking over more than 400 St George Bank branches in one single hit did not substantially reduce competition, how would changing the law to enable Westpac taking over a few at a time through creeping acquisitions make any difference? Again, this is a meaningless nothing.


In conclusion, this bill is a meaningless nothing. It creates the appearance of making changes. It creates the appearance of doing something to address problems with our nation's competition laws while doing absolutely nothing. We have real problems with competition policy in this country. Our productivity growth has stalled. Many of our markets have degenerated into states of hyperconcentration. Consumers are being punished by higher rates of inflation. We need a lot more than what this bill offers.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:19):  The philosophy of those of us on this side of the House is that free markets are the mechanism best developed to generate wealth in society, to raise living standards and to ensure that Australians have the opportunity of work and leisure that is part of a fulfilling life. We on this side of the House recognise that free markets work best when accompanied by appropriate regulation—such as the Trade Practicesw Act 1974 originally brought in under the Whitlam government in 1975. Appropriate regulation such as the Fair Work Act 2009, brought in under this government; legislation that realises that it is critical to strike the right balance between employers and employees. This is a balance which those opposite apparently supported in the last election but which, by now taking the lead from the member for Bennelong, they have begun to abandon, with a new attack on penalty rates and an attack on the overall notion that free markets work best under proper regulation.


The bill before the House today, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, began its life as a bill under the now Minister for Trade, Dr Emerson. It was a product of extensive consultations. The bill does three things: it provides greater clarity to the provisions of the CCA regarding mergers and acquisitions; it streamlines and clarifies the unconscionable conduct provisions; and it corrects some minor drafting errors.


Public consultations, conducted in 2008 and 2009 by the member for Rankin, identified the importance of getting the term 'market' appropriately defined. This bill will replace references to 'a market' with references to 'any market'. That will clarify that a court or the ACCC can consider the competitive effect of a merger or acquisition on multiple markets in any one investigation. This amending legislation will ensure that a court or the ACCC looks beyond the primary market in which the merger or acquisition would occur.


The second area is in relation to the definition of 'market' in section 50(6) of the CCA. The bill will delete the word 'substantial' in the definition of 'market'. That will clarify that the competitive effects of a merger or an acquisition on a local market can be considered under section 50. That will ensure that a court or the ACCC can examine a merger or acquisition in any market, regardless of its size or its geography.


The bill also makes changes in relation to the unconscionable conduct provisions, which will streamline and clarify the operation of the provisions. It will unify the consumer and business related provisions of the ACL and the ASIC Act, replacing sections 21 and 22 of the ACL with a single provision that will apply to both consumers and businesses. The bill will amend the mirrored provisions in sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act, which will reflect these changes to the Australian consumer law.


The bill will clarify the unconscionable conduct provisions by inserting interpretive principles into the acts that will assist courts in applying the prohibition, as well as improving stakeholder understanding of the meaning and scope of the prohibition. There have been substantial improvements in legislative drafting over recent decades, partly to ensure that courts have as much information as possible to help them interpret statute laws. These interpretive principles are derived from existing case law, so they will be clarifying rather than altering the effect of the statutory prohibition against unconscionable conduct. Those principles will include, for example, that unconscionable conduct is not limited by unwritten law; that the prohibition applies to systems of conduct or patterns of behaviour; and that a court can examine the terms and progress of contract in considering whether conduct to which the contract relates is unconscionable.


Finally, as I have mentioned, the bill corrects a number of minor drafting errors in the CCA that were the result of the passage of legislation by this House in 2010. Overall, the measures in the bill will improve the operation of Australia's competition and consumer laws. They will clarify the breadth of matters to be examined by a court or the ACCC in considering whether a proposed merger or acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the market. They will unify the prohibition against unconscionable conduct and provide the courts with greater guidance in its application. Overall, this is legislation which is part of Labor's commitment to free and effective markets, but markets which are appropriately regulated.


I was very proud recently to speak to students in Marist College. Mary-Lou Minty, their economics teacher, brought me in and we had a wide-ranging conversation with the boys about the major principles involved in economic reform. They understood—perhaps even better than some of those opposite—the importance of getting the balance right with regulation. Letting the market rip can often produce outcomes which give less growth, less improvement in living standards and less productivity. Getting the balance right in competition law, as in industrial relations, is critical to improving the living standards of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:25):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank members who have taken part in the debate on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The bill will give effect to two important reforms to strengthen and clarify our competition and consumer laws. Firstly, the bill will enact laws—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 10:25 
to 
10:42





Mr BRADBURY:
  The bill will give effect to two important reforms to strengthen and clarify our competition and consumer laws. Firstly, the bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions, by amending the mergers and acquisitions provisions in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. This bill will remove the requirement that a market in which the competition effects of a merger are assessed must be a substantial market. The amendments will also ensure that the courts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including those where creeping acquisition concerns may be raised in the community.


Secondly, the bill enhances and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. The bill will assist consumers, businesses, regulators and the courts by inserting interpretive principles to clarify the meaning of 'unconscionable conduct' in those laws and by unifying their business and consumer related provisions. These amendments clarify the parliament's intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply. They will place the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in a better position to take more effective enforcement action.


Finally, the bill makes minor technical amendments to correct a small number of drafting errors in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010. I thank all of those who have made contributions to the consultation process. I also once again thank my colleagues in the states and territories for their ongoing cooperation in competition and consumer law.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (10:45):  by leave—I will not take much time from the Main Committee or from my colleague the member for Riverina, who was on the Standing Committee on Regional Australia with me, as were you Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore. It was an excellent group of colleagues from right across the political spectrum, who were intimately involved with the basin because it affects their communities. It was a very constructive and positive exercise, and there was a contribution from everyone. To have arrived at a consensus on what is nothing short of a very contentious environment for this report speaks volumes for the character and quality of the people on the committee. I am very honoured and privileged to have served with them. The chair, Tony Windsor, did a fantastic job; I was very pleased to be his deputy chair.


The report of which we are taking consideration, Of drought and flooding rains—an excellent title if I say so myself—is the result of the committee's inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—I will come to it in a moment. What is really worth reiterating for the record is the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin to Australia. That will point towards why people were and are significantly affected by the earlier draft plan and why they reacted as they did in many ways. This reaction to the basin plan has contributed to lessons that have been learnt on the absolute importance of the intermix between communities, the product of those communities and the environment. It has contributed to the appreciation that one without the others has very serious consequences for this nation, not just for the happiness and wellbeing of communities, but also, very importantly, for the gross domestic product of this nation. For example, the gross value of agricultural production as determined between 2008 and 2009 was $42 billion, or two per cent of GDP—32 per cent of this contributed $14.6 billion to the basin economy itself. The gross regional product of the basin was approximately $59 billion, or about eight per cent of Australia's GDP.


The basin itself is home to some 2.1 million people, and a further 1.3 million people depend on its water supply. That is a significant proportion of Australia's population and, most significantly, of the productive capacity of the region in terms of its primary industry—of its growing, processing and further value adding. For instance, 90 per cent of Australia's cotton is grown in the area, 56 per cent of its grapes, 42 per cent of its nuts, and 32 per cent of the nation's dairy produce. The vast majority of the land use in the basin—84 per cent—is dedicated to agriculture yet the majority of the population live in urban centres. The basin covers something like one million square kilometres of south-east Australia and contains 23 river valleys. That gives you some idea of the extent of the geography, the importance of the economic impact and the significance of the social impact in the context of the inquiry. I have to say that the inquiry's essential terms of reference were to look at the triple bottom line in terms of the draft plan—that is, the environment, the society and its communities, and the economic impact.


Our travels were vast. I have to acknowledge the member for Riverina; I think he attended every meeting in every river valley. He did a fantastic job and it speaks volumes for his dedication and willingness to arrive at some form of solution. I congratulate him, as I congratulate you, Deputy Speaker Livermore, for the extensive contribution that you made.


We saw very disturbing pictures on the television of people burning books; I hate seeing the burning of books. It conjures up terrible things. But that expressed an absolute anger in communities who felt that they were not listened to. I do not need to tell you, colleagues, that one of the major criticisms that is directed at us—sometimes pretty unfairly—and at bureaucracies and agencies is that we go about processes and do not really listen actively and try to take on board what people are saying. Although what they are saying might not fit the current economic modelling and whatever, we need to listen to people who have an extensive anchorage in the community and who know about the issues that they are dealing with


Wherever we went in the basin we found that people wanted a basin plan. They wanted it to work. They wanted it to be comprehensive. They wanted certainty, both for their communities and for their environment. So, for instance, we had Matt Linnegar of the National Farmers Federation expressing a view—it is on page 441 of our report—'Do we need a basin plan as such? …Yes, we do, but not the one that was delivered in the guide.' I think that that was a common message that came from the communities where we went. 


This inquiry did listen. Not everything in this report meets the absolute wishes of my government nor, indeed, I reckon, the wishes of some of the policy makers on the other side. But we did listen, and our recommendations were crafted on what we heard by listening—not just to people who may have disregarded the guide or did not want to know about it but to people who were intimately involved in their communities, knew their areas and knew the relationship between the river, their communities and what they produced there. This inquiry listened to those people and crafted the recommendations in the report based on what we regarded as the commonsense logic and rationale of the comments that were made to us. I do not think I am being unfair in summing it up as such.


It is great to have here the member for Makin, who was another significant contributor to this committee, particularly with his insights into South Australia. So I thank him very much for his commentary.


The report manifests what we heard and gives recommendations based on that. I know that we are going to have controversy over some of our recommendations in regard to governance but what we are really trying to achieve with our recommendations about governance is the ability to significantly monitor the data that is available so that it can be used in a way that it is relevant—it is not lost in bureaucracy and people can make decisions based on firm and confirmed data. One of the other major recommendations of this report is a re-engagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with its stakeholders, and that includes not just the communities but also the state governments involved. One of the major criticisms received from the state governments was that in actual fact their contribution and their data were either interpreted in strange ways which they were not able to get an intelligible response to or ignored.


I am pleased to say that this report has received a positive response both from the communities we visited and also our own government. But also, and importantly, the Murray-Darling Authority itself has gone through a major restructuring, particularly under its chair, Craig Knowles. I note both with pleasure and interest that the authority, although it has extended its report—and I know that creates angst amongst communities, because they are still not sure of the certainty that they require—has had a much more consultative process and that the stakeholders themselves, particularly state governments, are having much more of an input in this. I congratulate everyone involved on the committee. I congratulate the authority for now taking on board many of the things recommended here and certainly the sentiment of this report. Thank you.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-08-17,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:56):  The comprehensive bipartisan report Of drought and flooding rains: inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was welcomed, understandably so, by all those who want Australian farmers to continue to grow the food to feed, and fibre to clothe, our nation and its people. The key word in my opening sentence was 'bipartisan'. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia comprises eight members of parliament; four supplementary members were added for the purposes of this inquiry. The inquiry committee comprised six Labor MPs, four Liberals, the Independent member for New England as chair and me, a National.


Given that the 253-page report was unanimously agreed to by committee members, it is now crucial, essential and obligatory that the federal government adopt the 21 recommendations contained therein. Anything less would be an insult to the bipartisan outcome of eight months of hard work by committee members, who drove and flew many thousands of kilometres, up hill and down dale, through four states to listen to people who shared their views on how to achieve healthy rivers while at the same time preserving regional communities. The people have spoken. People from all walks of life—irrigation farmers, business people, mayors, environmentalists, scientists, clergy—you name a profession and we heard from someone in that occupation. We heard heartfelt words from a brave little girl and we heard from those in the twilight of their lives—those who have seen more than the average numbers of droughts and flooding rains. We listened, and Hansard dutifully recorded, what they all had to say. The committee's dedicated secretariat then drilled down into all the detail provided and, with considerable input from members, came up with a draft document which was then, meeting after meeting, line by line, finetuned into this report. It was not easy to reach consensus. It took hours of robust debate, argument and sometimes nitpicking to reach agreement. But at the end it was agreed to. It was accepted by all committee members. Bipartisanship was achieved.


I mentioned earlier that the committee had a multiparty membership. Members came from electorates representing the eastern mainland states, with four from New South Wales, four from Victoria, one from Queensland; and the deputy chair hails from Tasmania. Significantly, the committee also included two MPs from South Australia—appropriately, one from each side of the political divide. Therefore, communities from the top of the basin to the Murray mouth were represented. Therefore, the views of all concerned were invited, listened to, heeded and reported. Therefore, the government now has a duty to accept the people's verdict, the regional Australia committee's findings and implement the recommendations. The government needs to do this forthwith—no deliberating, no delay, no stalling. Do it now. Put in place the 21 recommendations. This is too important to put off. 


Chief among the recommendations is the immediate halt to the government's non-strategic, haphazard buybacks and the necessity to take a more targeted approach to water buybacks which prioritises the lowest possible impact. This government has generated so much uncertainty by continuing to buy water from desperate sellers rather than willing sellers.


Another important recommendation focuses on greater investment in on- and off-farm water savings projects. There was $5.8 billion set aside by the former coalition government in the 2007 Water Act for infrastructure projects, but up until now only $68 million of this has been spent which has actually delivered water—21 gigalitres—into the basin, whereas federal Labor has disgracefully and unjustly spent $1.5 billion on water buybacks. The Prime Minister talks of a patchwork economy. Non-strategic water buybacks lead to a patchwork irrigation community—the dreaded so-called Swiss cheese effect.


It is a true test of this government, which simply has to follow the advice so carefully and diligently constructed for it by a committee headed by an MP whose vote is integral to Labor retaining power. If federal Labor ignores the recommendations of the committee headed by the Independent member for New England then how could he possibly continue to support this minority government? He keeps the Prime Minister in the Lodge. She now needs to provide regional communities within the Murray-Darling Basin with certainty by agreeing to what is being called the Windsor report. If the Prime Minister fails to do so, she will be failing regional Australia. She will be failing everyone who testified at the 12 regional hearings. She will be failing all those who contributed the 643 submissions and 85 supplementary submissions, and she will be failing the man who shored up her tenuous and illegitimate hold on the top job after the hung parliament last year. I hope the Prime Minister realises this. The consequences of doing nothing will be dire. They will be dire for people in the Murray-Darling Basin and they ought to be dire for the Prime Minister if she lets down the member for New England, whose reputation is at stake with what happens to this report.


I commend the committee members for the effort and knowledge they contributed to bring about this report. It was not an easy task. I especially compliment the member for New England for his professionalism in leading the committee, particularly since he came into the role at a heated and difficult time.


Had it not been for the passion and pride shown by those who live and work in the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas in my electorate, the water debate would certainly, I have no doubt, have headed in a different direction. More than 7,000 locals turned up at the 14 October Murray-Darling Basin Authority public rally at Griffith's Yoogali Club. They shouted, they protested and they burned copies of the guide. They were angry, frustrated and demanded answers. They had every reason to feel the way they did. There had been no consultation by the government or the MDBA prior to the 8 October release of the original guide—a flawed document if ever there was one. Riverina people told the MDBA, then headed by Mike Taylor, who ran the meeting, that they were not going to sit back and watch an independent authority, the government or anyone else destroy their communities with an ill-conceived guide which returned too much water to the environment without proper scientific validation or justification. They were not going to let it happen then and they will not let it happen in the future either, let me assure you. If the government lets the opportunity of the Windsor report slip from its grasp, if the MDBA's again delayed draft does not measure up to what its new chairman, Craig Knowles, has promised and if this government legislates a final plan which in any way compromises Australia's ability to feed itself then the protest rally which will result at this place will make the Griffith MDBA rally look like a parish picnic in the park.


Be warned: people in regional Australia are fed up with being told what to do and how to live their lives by a Labor government beholden to the unrepresentative swill that is the Greens. The Greens stood for 150 lower house seats at the 21 August election and won just one. That does not give them a mandate to dictate to this parliament what should and should not happen in any water reform. The Greens hold nine out of 76 Senate seats. They do not, as their leader, Bob Brown, would like to have us all think, have control of this country. The coalition is often accused by those on the other side of trying to wreck everything. If ever a party had an agenda to do that, it is the Greens.


The first and most important job this nation has is to feed its people. You cannot do that by taking away the ability, requirement and right of farmers to grow food. You cannot do that by sending all the water down the river in volumes as demanded by the Greens and their loopy environmental friends, including the Wentworth group, such that regional towns would be permanently underwater and such that the flora and fauna in precious iconic sites would be drowned. People need to be reasonable, sensible, fair dinkum, pro-Australian. 


The Australian Farm Institute says that every Griffith farmer feeds 150 Australians and 450 foreigners every year. How on earth will they be able to fulfil that role if they do not have the water to grow food? Within hours of the fiery Griffith meeting ending, the government had tasked the new regional Australia committee with conducting an inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. If the government does the right thing and accepts the Windsor report, then the people of the Riverina can rightly take much of the credit for saving this nation's water situation.


The Riverina is the food basket of this great nation. Next year my region will celebrate a centenary of irrigation. What a wonderful milestone—a hundred years of service to Australia; 10 decades of producing the world's finest food.


During the many hours of evidence heard by our committee, one of the most compelling statements came from Coleambally Irrigation Co-operative Chief Executive Officer, John Culleton. He quoted a local farmer who said:


I'm not here to survive; I came here 30 years ago to thrive.


Mr Culleton continued:


So all this talk about survival is to essentially say to us that the best we can look forward to is to struggle to survive, and that is an unacceptable prospect for the people of this region. 


Indeed, it is. The Riverina's future, facing considerable uncertainty in recent months, may be saved by this parliamentary inquiry and the Windsor report, which has urged the federal government to put regional communities first in any decision about water management. The report received widespread support. This is what some of key players in my area had to say. Griffith Mayor, Councillor Mike Neville:


The report provides a triple bottom line approach. The Government now has to show it is serious about Australia's foodbowl—Australia's heart and lungs—and declare that growing food is a priority.


Leeton Mayor, Councillor Paul Maytom:


I am extremely happy with the outcome of the report. It is an excellent report and the committee has taken the commonsense approach taking on initiatives that the original guide did not. 


I feel that the committee has given an excellent outcome and hopefully the minister and the MDBA look at the report seriously and this will give the people of the MIA a more prosperous future.


Murrumbidgee Irrigation Chairman, Gillian Kirkup:


The recommendations made by the committee demonstrate that they have heard our concerns and those of Basin communities. 


The MI welcomes the committee's key recommendations. 


We stand committed to working with the MDBA to develop a balanced plan that delivers good environmental outcomes without compromising regional Australia.


New South Wales Farmers Association President, Charles Armstrong:


We have welcomed the recommendations resulting from the House of Representatives' inquiry into the impacts of the Guide to the proposed MDBA plan. 


A number of the 21 recommendations echo concerns outlined in the Association's submission. 


The report is critical in the development of the Basin Plan. It's essential the MDBA carefully review the recommendations before releasing the Draft Plan.


Murray Irrigation General Manager, Anthony Couroupis:


The report contains sensible recommendations that would see better outcomes for community and regional economies without compromising reasonable ecological objectives. 


It is clear the committee has listened and concluded that the concerns of communities expressed after the launch of the guide were significant and genuine.


Southern Irrigators' Chairman, Ted Hatty:


On face value, if the recommendations in the Windsor report are followed, there is a better chance to achieve a balanced outcome for irrigators, Basin communities and the environment.


National Irrigators Council Chief Executive Officer, Danny O'Brien:


Tony Windsor and his bipartisan committee have struck the right balance here. 


They have clearly listened to communities; a far cry from what the MDBA went through last year and they've delivered a good set of recommendations.


New South Wales Irrigators' Council CEO, Andrew Gregson:


I welcome the report and I am pleased to see some of the ideas put forward by irrigators have been embraced. 


It will certainly have a calming effect because people will see that the concerns that they've raised have been listened to. The real proof, however, comes when the draft basin plan is released, to see if the MDBA has listened, has had time to listen and has had time to incorporate what it is that the Windsor inquiry has said.


I will conclude with the remarks of the youngest person to give evidence. This was testimony from a schoolgirl who at the original Griffith rally sat near the front holding a sign which read: 'Keep my family on our farm.' She became, I believe, the face of the region's fight for a fair future. This is what Teneeka Andreazza courageously said at the regional Australia committee's 25 January hearing:


I am nine years old and I live on a farm with my family. I have lived on the farm my whole life and cannot imagine what we would do or where we would go if we had to move away, so please help us and do not let them take our water. Thank you. 


Prime Minister, please heed Teneeka's heartfelt words.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:09):  I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the committee's report titled Of drought and flooding rains. I say from the outset that I agree with other members who have already spoken, that this was a bipartisan committee report. I believe that all members of the committee genuinely worked together in good spirit to try to find solutions which would be acceptable to people right across the Murray-Darling Basin area. In particular I acknowledge the work of the chairperson, the member for New England, and also the deputy chairperson, the member for Braddon, who spoke earlier today. Both of them played a leadership role in ensuring that the committee went about its work methodically and in a very measured way. I thank them for that leadership.


This was an important committee inquiry. It was important because, as everyone in this House would know and as people in most parts of Australia know, the management of the Murray-Darling Basin waters has become a critical issue for the future of this country. It is a matter that has caused grief for over 100 years, ever since 1915, I believe, when the first River Murray Waters Agreement was struck. There have been ongoing negotiations, discussions and disputes along the entire lengths of both the Murray River and the Darling River. It is a matter that, particularly in the period of the long drought we had beginning in the late 1990s through to 2006-07, caused a lot of grief to communities throughout the basin. I suspect it is because of the drought that we have come to the point that we are at today, where we are trying to find sustainable solutions for the ongoing management of the waters in the basin.


The committee's work was initiated by the guide that was put out by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. There has been a lot of criticism of the guide. This was the guide to a plan that would ultimately be presented to the government. Whilst the criticism may well be justified, I say from the outset that it is my view that the guide served an incredibly useful purpose. It triggered the most intensive scrutiny of the Murray-Darling Basin to date that I am aware of—scrutiny by government departments, right across federal, state and local government jurisdictions; scrutiny by irrigators, environmentalists and basin communities in each of the catchments throughout the basin. For the first time ever, the views of every interest sector were put on the table and, in doing so, flaws in previously held views and beliefs were exposed and far more accurate assessments resulted.


The guide also highlighted a lack of communication and coordination by all the sectors that had responsibility for river water management. Additionally, many previously held beliefs or assumptions were seriously challenged by credible analysts or people with lifelong hands-on experience and understanding of the basin. In essence, the guide exposed just how badly the basin waters had been managed until more recent years when the drought made the situation critical and good management of waters by government authorities and irrigators began to take place.


The reforms implemented during the drought will have lasting positive benefits that will serve the basin communities well into the future and, importantly, serve the communities well in the event of another long drought. What is also clear is that the river system no longer operates as a natural system. Lochs and weirs which were originally installed between 1922 and 1935 and the barrages built around 1914 have changed the nature of the Murray-Darling Basin river system. Since the lochs and barrages were installed, the system has been regulated to the point that an unnatural river system has been created. From the evidence presented, much of the science on which decisions were based has been questioned. Estimates made about evaporation losses, seepage and extractions are just that—estimates—and may be considerably underestimated or overestimated. The problem is that these estimates are then relied upon for other calculations that in turn magnify the possible errors. Indeed, the system is complex. The relationship between the 23 catchments is not clear—for example, reducing extractions from one catchment does not necessarily add an equal amount of water in another catchment area. What is indisputable, however, is that since the mid-sixties extraction rates have increased. Extractions have increased by 100 per cent since the early 1960s from around 6,000 gigalitres then to about 12,000 gigalitres today. In New South Wales, extractions have increased by 100 per cent from about 3,000 gigalitres around 1960 to 6,000 gigalitres today. In Victoria, extractions have also increased by about 100 per cent from about 2,000 gigalitres in the 1960s to around 4,000 gigalitres today. And Queensland, where there was little water extracted in 1960, today draws some 600 or 700 gigalitres. Interestingly, in South Australia licences were capped in 1969 and extractions have hardly changed since that time. 


The volume and impact of diversions is also not well quantified or understood because since the 1960s the diversion of waters away from rivers into dams has impacted on inflows into the Murray-Darling system. Returning water to the system is critical to its sustainability. How that is achieved is dependent on who you speak to because there have been a number of proposals and options put on the table by communities right across the basin. Of course, the volume of water that needs to be returned depends on annual rainfall and, in turn, inflows. In high rainfall years current extraction rates are sustainable; in low rainfall years that is not the case. Complicating the issue is that inflows vary between catchment valleys, and nor do inflows in one valley necessarily flow on to the next, as I have said earlier. Therefore, extractions are best managed on a valley-by-valley basis. 


The science around volumes of water that should be returned to the system is also not clear. Not surprisingly, we have had figures mooted of anywhere between 3,000 and 7,600 gigalitres of water that should be returned to the system. Figures are also based on average inflows. Again, not only do average inflows vary across the basin but, importantly, average inflows are of very little value or of very little use unless all the water is able to be stored. Since that is not possible, extraction rates will need to be closely monitored on a year-by-year basis across each of the catchments. The alternative is to impose ultraconservative extraction reductions and that would unnecessarily constrain productivity and cause hardship to basin communities. The use of adjustable allocations, as has been the case in recent years, is likely to be necessary into the future. The use of allocations could be used to further regulate the system on a year-by-year basis with relatively little impact on agricultural communities and food production. 


For the basin to remain sustainable we must have a healthy river system. If the rivers die the basin communities will also die. Now that the reform process has begun, we must see it through and we must get it right. In fact, it is my view that Australians are counting on us to do that. We must commit to what is required and not fall into a false sense of security because of the recent rains. With a growing world population, any reduction in food production should also be of concern. The Murray-Darling Basin is not only Australia's food bowl but offers huge potential for growth. A growing world population will need to be fed and the Murray-Darling Basin presents Australia with substantial economic opportunities. We should not dismiss those opportunities. As a member of the committee I have seen examples, as we moved through communities, of that occurring today, where on-farm efficiency is producing greater volumes of produce by using lesser amounts of water. It is that kind of innovation that we should be supporting, encouraging and investing in. 


One of the important issues relating to all of the committee's work was to try to come up with a proposal and recommendations that would be embraced firstly by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and then by the government. The committee worked through the inquiry in a very intense way. In fact, I am not aware that any committee has worked as intensely as this committee—certainly not in my time in this parliament. We did so because we set ourselves a deadline to try and report by the middle of this year. The authority has now extended its reporting time frame out by several months, and it will be interesting to see just what the authority reports to the government.


It was interesting, though, and relevant to the point I am making, that one of the very clear messages reflected in most of the communities we went to was that there was a sense of urgency about resolving a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and that uncertainty within the basin communities as to what would be in the plan was contributing to insecurity within the plan. So it is my view that the sooner the authority reports, the sooner there is a plan on the table, the better it will be for communities throughout the basin because they will have certainty, and with that certainty they will be able to manage their future operations. I certainly do not want to see the good work of this committee—which to some extent you could say was rushed, but it was rushed for good reason—now left sitting for months on end whilst others report back to the government.


I want to briefly talk about the situation with respect to South Australia, because South Australia has some unique issues. I said earlier that South Australia capped its issuing of licences in the 1960s. Effectively no new licences have been issued since then, and the amount of water that has been extracted from the system has remained pretty stable. In addition there has been a huge amount of investment in irrigation systems in the Riverland of South Australia. South Australia did not cause the overuse, nor was it responsible for any mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin waters. South Australia will also draw on very little of the federal government's $12.9 billion water-funding allocation.


One of the issues that was clearly raised was the management of the Lower Lakes, and that was raised more by communities in the eastern states. I accept that the management of the Lower Lakes is a contentious issue. There is, again, a divergence of views about how they should best be managed. I do not accept, however, that the Lower Lakes are the cause of all the problems with respect to water allocations upstream. I do not accept the argument that the system could be managed simply by tearing down the barrages at the Lower Lakes or something similar. The reality is, as I said earlier, that the whole system is no longer a natural system, and since the installation of the locks between, I think, 1922 and 1935 the whole system has dramatically changed.


There was a submission, however, from Mr Ian Mott, which talked about connecting the southern lagoon of the Coorong directly to the sea. It is a submission that I believe has merit and ought to be looked at. I also believe that for South Australia the issue is not so much how much water is returned to the river system but rather how much water crosses the South Australian border and ultimately reaches the Murray mouth. That is the real question for South Australians. Quite frankly, I wait with interest to see what the authority recommends in that respect.


This is a matter that I have spoken about in this parliament on other occasions. I will continue to do so and I am sure I will speak on the matter again when the authority's report is presented. In the last few seconds left, I not only thank the members of the committee whom I worked with in the preparation of this report—the member for New England is in the chamber this morning, as are the member for Riverina, the member for Barker and the member for Braddon—for the cooperative way that we worked together but also particularly thank the staff who supported the committee in what we did, every step of the way, and who organised the inquiry for us.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (11:24):  First off, let me say that I totally agree with the member for Makin on a couple of issues. I think the submission by Ian Mott as an alternative way of fixing up the problems of the Coorong and the Murray mouth should be seriously looked at and assessed by this government. Anyone who has looked at that submission, and I have pointed out this submission to the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Craig Knowles, as well, will see that it does warrant as a possible cost effective way to fix up a lot of those problems. One has only to look at what has been done at West Lakes in the western suburbs of Adelaide to see that, on a smaller scale, it has worked quite well. I plead with the government: at least spend the money to make an assessment of whether this could work, because it creates big possibilities for fixing up some of those problems.


I also support the observation by member for Makin about how hard this committee worked. In my time, and I have been here twice as long as the member for Makin, I have never been involved with a committee—and I been involved with a lot—that has worked so hard on a report. We actually met in December, which is virtually unheard of for a committee. For obvious reasons it is a very busy time for members of parliament, with schools breaking up and different functions that you need to attend in that period. On top of that, having a 10-day tour of the basin in January is also unheard of in my experience. That all members of the committee were prepared to make time to be part of this committee's deliberations is an indication of how important they felt this inquiry to be. For example, in December we went up to look at the Menindee Lakes. Six months earlier they were dry, but when we were there we saw that they had filled up. An enormous change had been brought about not by government or communities but by Mother Nature—I think Mother Nature is a lot cleverer than any of us. To see the enormous change there and to speak with the people of Broken Hill, who rely on the lakes for their water supply and their irrigation, was an important start.


We started our tour in my electorate, at the bottom of the system. We went over the barrages at the Lower Lakes, which gave every member of the committee a hands-on approach to the effects the barrages have had and how important they are. Again, I agree with the member for Makin: ripping down those barrages is not the answer. It is one of the fallacies that have been put out that all would be fixed if we just let the sea into the lakes. I think it would actually destroy the lakes. The Lower Lakes have never been naturally saline except for very small periods in our time. Like most estuaries they are mostly freshwater but occasionally, during droughts, they become saline for perhaps weeks at a time—certainly not for centuries, years or months. It is very much a very minor thing.


I remember one Melbourne Cup day, I think it was in 2006, when the federal government had just set up a water bureaucracy. We suddenly found that there was a real concern with how the states were reacting to the drought. I remember the Premier of South Australia coming back, almost like Neville Chamberlain with 'peace in our time,' saying, 'We're going to build a weir at Wellington.' We have spent millions at the proposed site, but no weir has been built. They had to do up all the roads so they could eventually, perhaps, build a weir. I do not think the weir was ever going to be the right answer. Perhaps a lock of some sort might have been the answer, but certainly not the weir as proposed by the government. I am very thankful that Mother Nature, again, stepped in and stopped the pressure to build the weir at Wellington.


I represent all of the Murray River in South Australia, all of Lake Albert and half of Lake Alexandrina. In fact, the boundary of my electorate basically goes through the middle of Lake Alexandrina and through the Murray mouth, so I suppose you could say that one side of the Murray mouth is represented by the member for Mayo and the other side is represented by me, as the member for Barker. I remember in the last election campaign that the candidates were often asked by the media or by people what we thought the biggest issues were. I always replied that the three biggest issues were water, water and water. That is very much a South Australian thing. It is an iconic issue. 


Having the honour of representing the Murray in South Australia is an iconic issue for me and will continue to be. Water supply is so important, not only for our communities but for our capital city Adelaide and for our industries that rely on the Murray. It is a very important part of our community, but the fact is that South Australia only takes six per cent of the allocations of the water that is diverted from the Murray-Darling Basin. I think Queensland takes about six per cent and the rest is basically taken by New South Wales and Victoria.


I have never taken the parochial view that you should only look after your own dung heap, because the Murray-Darling does not recognise electoral boundaries. It does not recognise states. So, if you are ever going to fix up this whole problem, you will have to take an overview of the whole basin and not just your own dung heap. It always concerned me that wherever you went in the basin there was always a view that you blamed everyone upstream and said, 'Blow those downstream!' Looking after your own dung heap is not the way to fix the Murray-Darling Basin; you have to look at the basin as a whole. That is why I have always believed that we need an independent Murray-Darling Basin authority, as John Howard proposed on Australia Day 2007. That did not come to pass because all the states bar Victoria would not sign up to referring their constitutional powers for seven or eight years to this national body. Unfortunately, we still have a bit of that problem but we should not ignore the wealth of knowledge that the state bureaucracies have when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin.


I also thank the secretariat, who I think did a great job. They worked as hard as us—probably harder in many ways. As a supplementary member for the purposes of this inquiry I was able to provide a voice for the constituents of Barker and also the whole Murray-Darling Basin. I think it is very interesting, if you look at our history, to see that the member for Braddon, the member for Farrer, and the member for New England and I were on a similar inquiry during 2003 and 2004. Not a lot changed except that I became even better informed as a result of being part of this committee, and I hope the other members did as well. We created a bit of controversy with that report, but the fact is that I think most of the recommendations that we made then were borne out. History often has a way of proving people right or wrong and I think in this situation we were pretty right. So, interestingly, we had the corporate knowledge of people who had previously been on an inquiry into water resources in Australia generally, because most of those seemed to be around the Murray-Darling Basin. I think it was important that we had that corporate knowledge and I think it was very useful to the committee that we did. In my electorate, water and the Murray-Darling is pretty big—I think that goes without saying. We have had some problems. On the one hand there are the irrigators that are struggling to keep their crops alive and the families and wider communities that are affected by the flow-on effects of, especially, the drought we have gone through. Some people have said it is the worst drought in our history. I think the records will show that the Federation drought from 1895 to 1903 was very similar in its effect. Of course, in those days we did not have the locks and we did not have the extraction from the Murray-Darling Basin that we have now. So I think the effects of the drought were exacerbated by what humans have done over the last 100 years. I am not saying we should get rid of the locks. Please do not get me wrong on that—because I think we have a pretty good regulated system that works pretty well—but we were found wanting when it came to the drought and it showed that we needed to take some serious action if we wanted to keep this a sustainable river system.


Part of this inquiry was purely to get out there and listen to all those people up and down the system. They wanted their opinion and the situation to be known and what decisions are made. I think people should realise our committee did not have the power to say, 'The Murray-Darling Basin Authority should take this action'; we were there to listen to how the guide to the plan would have affected the communities if it had been taken holus-bolus. I think we all agree that the PR that went out with that was not particularly good and it caused a lot of anger in the communities. So a large part of our job was to listen to those concerns and make some recommendations as a result. To be fair—I'm not blowing my own trumpet—I think the committee did a very good job. I think we helped the communities get their message across but also feel that they had been listened to and that we were prepared to make some pretty strong recommendations about the way ahead.


I certainly attended both public meetings in my electorate. In fact, I remember the member for Makin being at one of those meetings. Yes, there was a bit of heat. It was probably not as bad as we saw in Griffith, but there was a bit of heat. It was packed out. They had to use two rooms and try and set up a video and audio display so that people could show their concerns and needs. 


It gave a voice to people. We made a list of recommendations to the government—21 in total—and it would be a real shame if the government did not take notice of these because they are as a result of the consultation with the communities and that is where it counts, I believe. Any member of parliament worth their salt would always recognise that you have got to listen to your community and take the respective actions that come from talking to those people.


I want to speak about a couple of those recommendations. The most important one, I believe, is recommendation No. 7—an immediate end to non-strategic buybacks. That had widespread support across the committee but I think also through the whole community. It needed to be listened to and I do hope that government take note of that.


As Mr Rel Heckendorf put it, for people to sell their water at the price the government is offering, they would be desperate sellers, not willing sellers. If you do not have a strategic buyback you also have the problem of the Swiss cheese effect. I think everyone on the committee understands that. There is another thing we should be looking at—this is my suggestion—that every community, every irrigator take a 10 per cent cut. The government say that they will not do it could do it compulsorily, but there could be a 10 per cent cut stretched out over 10 years, one per cent a year, and fully compensated. I think that would return 1,200 gigs to the river and be quite successful. (Time expired)


Debate adjourned.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (10:45):  by leave—I will not take much time from the Main Committee or from my colleague the member for Riverina, who was on the Standing Committee on Regional Australia with me, as were you Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore. It was an excellent group of colleagues from right across the political spectrum, who were intimately involved with the basin because it affects their communities. It was a very constructive and positive exercise, and there was a contribution from everyone. To have arrived at a consensus on what is nothing short of a very contentious environment for this report speaks volumes for the character and quality of the people on the committee. I am very honoured and privileged to have served with them. The chair, Tony Windsor, did a fantastic job; I was very pleased to be his deputy chair.


The report of which we are taking consideration, Of drought and flooding rains—an excellent title if I say so myself—is the result of the committee's inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—I will come to it in a moment. What is really worth reiterating for the record is the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin to Australia. That will point towards why people were and are significantly affected by the earlier draft plan and why they reacted as they did in many ways. This reaction to the basin plan has contributed to lessons that have been learnt on the absolute importance of the intermix between communities, the product of those communities and the environment. It has contributed to the appreciation that one without the others has very serious consequences for this nation, not just for the happiness and wellbeing of communities, but also, very importantly, for the gross domestic product of this nation. For example, the gross value of agricultural production as determined between 2008 and 2009 was $42 billion, or two per cent of GDP—32 per cent of this contributed $14.6 billion to the basin economy itself. The gross regional product of the basin was approximately $59 billion, or about eight per cent of Australia's GDP.


The basin itself is home to some 2.1 million people, and a further 1.3 million people depend on its water supply. That is a significant proportion of Australia's population and, most significantly, of the productive capacity of the region in terms of its primary industry—of its growing, processing and further value adding. For instance, 90 per cent of Australia's cotton is grown in the area, 56 per cent of its grapes, 42 per cent of its nuts, and 32 per cent of the nation's dairy produce. The vast majority of the land use in the basin—84 per cent—is dedicated to agriculture yet the majority of the population live in urban centres. The basin covers something like one million square kilometres of south-east Australia and contains 23 river valleys. That gives you some idea of the extent of the geography, the importance of the economic impact and the significance of the social impact in the context of the inquiry. I have to say that the inquiry's essential terms of reference were to look at the triple bottom line in terms of the draft plan—that is, the environment, the society and its communities, and the economic impact.


Our travels were vast. I have to acknowledge the member for Riverina; I think he attended every meeting in every river valley. He did a fantastic job and it speaks volumes for his dedication and willingness to arrive at some form of solution. I congratulate him, as I congratulate you, Deputy Speaker Livermore, for the extensive contribution that you made.


We saw very disturbing pictures on the television of people burning books; I hate seeing the burning of books. It conjures up terrible things. But that expressed an absolute anger in communities who felt that they were not listened to. I do not need to tell you, colleagues, that one of the major criticisms that is directed at us—sometimes pretty unfairly—and at bureaucracies and agencies is that we go about processes and do not really listen actively and try to take on board what people are saying. Although what they are saying might not fit the current economic modelling and whatever, we need to listen to people who have an extensive anchorage in the community and who know about the issues that they are dealing with


Wherever we went in the basin we found that people wanted a basin plan. They wanted it to work. They wanted it to be comprehensive. They wanted certainty, both for their communities and for their environment. So, for instance, we had Matt Linnegar of the National Farmers Federation expressing a view—it is on page 441 of our report—'Do we need a basin plan as such? …Yes, we do, but not the one that was delivered in the guide.' I think that that was a common message that came from the communities where we went. 


This inquiry did listen. Not everything in this report meets the absolute wishes of my government nor, indeed, I reckon, the wishes of some of the policy makers on the other side. But we did listen, and our recommendations were crafted on what we heard by listening—not just to people who may have disregarded the guide or did not want to know about it but to people who were intimately involved in their communities, knew their areas and knew the relationship between the river, their communities and what they produced there. This inquiry listened to those people and crafted the recommendations in the report based on what we regarded as the commonsense logic and rationale of the comments that were made to us. I do not think I am being unfair in summing it up as such.


It is great to have here the member for Makin, who was another significant contributor to this committee, particularly with his insights into South Australia. So I thank him very much for his commentary.


The report manifests what we heard and gives recommendations based on that. I know that we are going to have controversy over some of our recommendations in regard to governance but what we are really trying to achieve with our recommendations about governance is the ability to significantly monitor the data that is available so that it can be used in a way that it is relevant—it is not lost in bureaucracy and people can make decisions based on firm and confirmed data. One of the other major recommendations of this report is a re-engagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with its stakeholders, and that includes not just the communities but also the state governments involved. One of the major criticisms received from the state governments was that in actual fact their contribution and their data were either interpreted in strange ways which they were not able to get an intelligible response to or ignored.


I am pleased to say that this report has received a positive response both from the communities we visited and also our own government. But also, and importantly, the Murray-Darling Authority itself has gone through a major restructuring, particularly under its chair, Craig Knowles. I note both with pleasure and interest that the authority, although it has extended its report—and I know that creates angst amongst communities, because they are still not sure of the certainty that they require—has had a much more consultative process and that the stakeholders themselves, particularly state governments, are having much more of an input in this. I congratulate everyone involved on the committee. I congratulate the authority for now taking on board many of the things recommended here and certainly the sentiment of this report. Thank you.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-08-17,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:56):  The comprehensive bipartisan report Of drought and flooding rains: inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was welcomed, understandably so, by all those who want Australian farmers to continue to grow the food to feed, and fibre to clothe, our nation and its people. The key word in my opening sentence was 'bipartisan'. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia comprises eight members of parliament; four supplementary members were added for the purposes of this inquiry. The inquiry committee comprised six Labor MPs, four Liberals, the Independent member for New England as chair and me, a National.


Given that the 253-page report was unanimously agreed to by committee members, it is now crucial, essential and obligatory that the federal government adopt the 21 recommendations contained therein. Anything less would be an insult to the bipartisan outcome of eight months of hard work by committee members, who drove and flew many thousands of kilometres, up hill and down dale, through four states to listen to people who shared their views on how to achieve healthy rivers while at the same time preserving regional communities. The people have spoken. People from all walks of life—irrigation farmers, business people, mayors, environmentalists, scientists, clergy—you name a profession and we heard from someone in that occupation. We heard heartfelt words from a brave little girl and we heard from those in the twilight of their lives—those who have seen more than the average numbers of droughts and flooding rains. We listened, and Hansard dutifully recorded, what they all had to say. The committee's dedicated secretariat then drilled down into all the detail provided and, with considerable input from members, came up with a draft document which was then, meeting after meeting, line by line, finetuned into this report. It was not easy to reach consensus. It took hours of robust debate, argument and sometimes nitpicking to reach agreement. But at the end it was agreed to. It was accepted by all committee members. Bipartisanship was achieved.


I mentioned earlier that the committee had a multiparty membership. Members came from electorates representing the eastern mainland states, with four from New South Wales, four from Victoria, one from Queensland; and the deputy chair hails from Tasmania. Significantly, the committee also included two MPs from South Australia—appropriately, one from each side of the political divide. Therefore, communities from the top of the basin to the Murray mouth were represented. Therefore, the views of all concerned were invited, listened to, heeded and reported. Therefore, the government now has a duty to accept the people's verdict, the regional Australia committee's findings and implement the recommendations. The government needs to do this forthwith—no deliberating, no delay, no stalling. Do it now. Put in place the 21 recommendations. This is too important to put off. 


Chief among the recommendations is the immediate halt to the government's non-strategic, haphazard buybacks and the necessity to take a more targeted approach to water buybacks which prioritises the lowest possible impact. This government has generated so much uncertainty by continuing to buy water from desperate sellers rather than willing sellers.


Another important recommendation focuses on greater investment in on- and off-farm water savings projects. There was $5.8 billion set aside by the former coalition government in the 2007 Water Act for infrastructure projects, but up until now only $68 million of this has been spent which has actually delivered water—21 gigalitres—into the basin, whereas federal Labor has disgracefully and unjustly spent $1.5 billion on water buybacks. The Prime Minister talks of a patchwork economy. Non-strategic water buybacks lead to a patchwork irrigation community—the dreaded so-called Swiss cheese effect.


It is a true test of this government, which simply has to follow the advice so carefully and diligently constructed for it by a committee headed by an MP whose vote is integral to Labor retaining power. If federal Labor ignores the recommendations of the committee headed by the Independent member for New England then how could he possibly continue to support this minority government? He keeps the Prime Minister in the Lodge. She now needs to provide regional communities within the Murray-Darling Basin with certainty by agreeing to what is being called the Windsor report. If the Prime Minister fails to do so, she will be failing regional Australia. She will be failing everyone who testified at the 12 regional hearings. She will be failing all those who contributed the 643 submissions and 85 supplementary submissions, and she will be failing the man who shored up her tenuous and illegitimate hold on the top job after the hung parliament last year. I hope the Prime Minister realises this. The consequences of doing nothing will be dire. They will be dire for people in the Murray-Darling Basin and they ought to be dire for the Prime Minister if she lets down the member for New England, whose reputation is at stake with what happens to this report.


I commend the committee members for the effort and knowledge they contributed to bring about this report. It was not an easy task. I especially compliment the member for New England for his professionalism in leading the committee, particularly since he came into the role at a heated and difficult time.


Had it not been for the passion and pride shown by those who live and work in the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas in my electorate, the water debate would certainly, I have no doubt, have headed in a different direction. More than 7,000 locals turned up at the 14 October Murray-Darling Basin Authority public rally at Griffith's Yoogali Club. They shouted, they protested and they burned copies of the guide. They were angry, frustrated and demanded answers. They had every reason to feel the way they did. There had been no consultation by the government or the MDBA prior to the 8 October release of the original guide—a flawed document if ever there was one. Riverina people told the MDBA, then headed by Mike Taylor, who ran the meeting, that they were not going to sit back and watch an independent authority, the government or anyone else destroy their communities with an ill-conceived guide which returned too much water to the environment without proper scientific validation or justification. They were not going to let it happen then and they will not let it happen in the future either, let me assure you. If the government lets the opportunity of the Windsor report slip from its grasp, if the MDBA's again delayed draft does not measure up to what its new chairman, Craig Knowles, has promised and if this government legislates a final plan which in any way compromises Australia's ability to feed itself then the protest rally which will result at this place will make the Griffith MDBA rally look like a parish picnic in the park.


Be warned: people in regional Australia are fed up with being told what to do and how to live their lives by a Labor government beholden to the unrepresentative swill that is the Greens. The Greens stood for 150 lower house seats at the 21 August election and won just one. That does not give them a mandate to dictate to this parliament what should and should not happen in any water reform. The Greens hold nine out of 76 Senate seats. They do not, as their leader, Bob Brown, would like to have us all think, have control of this country. The coalition is often accused by those on the other side of trying to wreck everything. If ever a party had an agenda to do that, it is the Greens.


The first and most important job this nation has is to feed its people. You cannot do that by taking away the ability, requirement and right of farmers to grow food. You cannot do that by sending all the water down the river in volumes as demanded by the Greens and their loopy environmental friends, including the Wentworth group, such that regional towns would be permanently underwater and such that the flora and fauna in precious iconic sites would be drowned. People need to be reasonable, sensible, fair dinkum, pro-Australian. 


The Australian Farm Institute says that every Griffith farmer feeds 150 Australians and 450 foreigners every year. How on earth will they be able to fulfil that role if they do not have the water to grow food? Within hours of the fiery Griffith meeting ending, the government had tasked the new regional Australia committee with conducting an inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. If the government does the right thing and accepts the Windsor report, then the people of the Riverina can rightly take much of the credit for saving this nation's water situation.


The Riverina is the food basket of this great nation. Next year my region will celebrate a centenary of irrigation. What a wonderful milestone—a hundred years of service to Australia; 10 decades of producing the world's finest food.


During the many hours of evidence heard by our committee, one of the most compelling statements came from Coleambally Irrigation Co-operative Chief Executive Officer, John Culleton. He quoted a local farmer who said:


I'm not here to survive; I came here 30 years ago to thrive.


Mr Culleton continued:


So all this talk about survival is to essentially say to us that the best we can look forward to is to struggle to survive, and that is an unacceptable prospect for the people of this region. 


Indeed, it is. The Riverina's future, facing considerable uncertainty in recent months, may be saved by this parliamentary inquiry and the Windsor report, which has urged the federal government to put regional communities first in any decision about water management. The report received widespread support. This is what some of key players in my area had to say. Griffith Mayor, Councillor Mike Neville:


The report provides a triple bottom line approach. The Government now has to show it is serious about Australia's foodbowl—Australia's heart and lungs—and declare that growing food is a priority.


Leeton Mayor, Councillor Paul Maytom:


I am extremely happy with the outcome of the report. It is an excellent report and the committee has taken the commonsense approach taking on initiatives that the original guide did not. 


I feel that the committee has given an excellent outcome and hopefully the minister and the MDBA look at the report seriously and this will give the people of the MIA a more prosperous future.


Murrumbidgee Irrigation Chairman, Gillian Kirkup:


The recommendations made by the committee demonstrate that they have heard our concerns and those of Basin communities. 


The MI welcomes the committee's key recommendations. 


We stand committed to working with the MDBA to develop a balanced plan that delivers good environmental outcomes without compromising regional Australia.


New South Wales Farmers Association President, Charles Armstrong:


We have welcomed the recommendations resulting from the House of Representatives' inquiry into the impacts of the Guide to the proposed MDBA plan. 


A number of the 21 recommendations echo concerns outlined in the Association's submission. 


The report is critical in the development of the Basin Plan. It's essential the MDBA carefully review the recommendations before releasing the Draft Plan.


Murray Irrigation General Manager, Anthony Couroupis:


The report contains sensible recommendations that would see better outcomes for community and regional economies without compromising reasonable ecological objectives. 


It is clear the committee has listened and concluded that the concerns of communities expressed after the launch of the guide were significant and genuine.


Southern Irrigators' Chairman, Ted Hatty:


On face value, if the recommendations in the Windsor report are followed, there is a better chance to achieve a balanced outcome for irrigators, Basin communities and the environment.


National Irrigators Council Chief Executive Officer, Danny O'Brien:


Tony Windsor and his bipartisan committee have struck the right balance here. 


They have clearly listened to communities; a far cry from what the MDBA went through last year and they've delivered a good set of recommendations.


New South Wales Irrigators' Council CEO, Andrew Gregson:


I welcome the report and I am pleased to see some of the ideas put forward by irrigators have been embraced. 


It will certainly have a calming effect because people will see that the concerns that they've raised have been listened to. The real proof, however, comes when the draft basin plan is released, to see if the MDBA has listened, has had time to listen and has had time to incorporate what it is that the Windsor inquiry has said.


I will conclude with the remarks of the youngest person to give evidence. This was testimony from a schoolgirl who at the original Griffith rally sat near the front holding a sign which read: 'Keep my family on our farm.' She became, I believe, the face of the region's fight for a fair future. This is what Teneeka Andreazza courageously said at the regional Australia committee's 25 January hearing:


I am nine years old and I live on a farm with my family. I have lived on the farm my whole life and cannot imagine what we would do or where we would go if we had to move away, so please help us and do not let them take our water. Thank you. 


Prime Minister, please heed Teneeka's heartfelt words.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:09):  I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the committee's report titled Of drought and flooding rains. I say from the outset that I agree with other members who have already spoken, that this was a bipartisan committee report. I believe that all members of the committee genuinely worked together in good spirit to try to find solutions which would be acceptable to people right across the Murray-Darling Basin area. In particular I acknowledge the work of the chairperson, the member for New England, and also the deputy chairperson, the member for Braddon, who spoke earlier today. Both of them played a leadership role in ensuring that the committee went about its work methodically and in a very measured way. I thank them for that leadership.


This was an important committee inquiry. It was important because, as everyone in this House would know and as people in most parts of Australia know, the management of the Murray-Darling Basin waters has become a critical issue for the future of this country. It is a matter that has caused grief for over 100 years, ever since 1915, I believe, when the first River Murray Waters Agreement was struck. There have been ongoing negotiations, discussions and disputes along the entire lengths of both the Murray River and the Darling River. It is a matter that, particularly in the period of the long drought we had beginning in the late 1990s through to 2006-07, caused a lot of grief to communities throughout the basin. I suspect it is because of the drought that we have come to the point that we are at today, where we are trying to find sustainable solutions for the ongoing management of the waters in the basin.


The committee's work was initiated by the guide that was put out by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. There has been a lot of criticism of the guide. This was the guide to a plan that would ultimately be presented to the government. Whilst the criticism may well be justified, I say from the outset that it is my view that the guide served an incredibly useful purpose. It triggered the most intensive scrutiny of the Murray-Darling Basin to date that I am aware of—scrutiny by government departments, right across federal, state and local government jurisdictions; scrutiny by irrigators, environmentalists and basin communities in each of the catchments throughout the basin. For the first time ever, the views of every interest sector were put on the table and, in doing so, flaws in previously held views and beliefs were exposed and far more accurate assessments resulted.


The guide also highlighted a lack of communication and coordination by all the sectors that had responsibility for river water management. Additionally, many previously held beliefs or assumptions were seriously challenged by credible analysts or people with lifelong hands-on experience and understanding of the basin. In essence, the guide exposed just how badly the basin waters had been managed until more recent years when the drought made the situation critical and good management of waters by government authorities and irrigators began to take place.


The reforms implemented during the drought will have lasting positive benefits that will serve the basin communities well into the future and, importantly, serve the communities well in the event of another long drought. What is also clear is that the river system no longer operates as a natural system. Lochs and weirs which were originally installed between 1922 and 1935 and the barrages built around 1914 have changed the nature of the Murray-Darling Basin river system. Since the lochs and barrages were installed, the system has been regulated to the point that an unnatural river system has been created. From the evidence presented, much of the science on which decisions were based has been questioned. Estimates made about evaporation losses, seepage and extractions are just that—estimates—and may be considerably underestimated or overestimated. The problem is that these estimates are then relied upon for other calculations that in turn magnify the possible errors. Indeed, the system is complex. The relationship between the 23 catchments is not clear—for example, reducing extractions from one catchment does not necessarily add an equal amount of water in another catchment area. What is indisputable, however, is that since the mid-sixties extraction rates have increased. Extractions have increased by 100 per cent since the early 1960s from around 6,000 gigalitres then to about 12,000 gigalitres today. In New South Wales, extractions have increased by 100 per cent from about 3,000 gigalitres around 1960 to 6,000 gigalitres today. In Victoria, extractions have also increased by about 100 per cent from about 2,000 gigalitres in the 1960s to around 4,000 gigalitres today. And Queensland, where there was little water extracted in 1960, today draws some 600 or 700 gigalitres. Interestingly, in South Australia licences were capped in 1969 and extractions have hardly changed since that time. 


The volume and impact of diversions is also not well quantified or understood because since the 1960s the diversion of waters away from rivers into dams has impacted on inflows into the Murray-Darling system. Returning water to the system is critical to its sustainability. How that is achieved is dependent on who you speak to because there have been a number of proposals and options put on the table by communities right across the basin. Of course, the volume of water that needs to be returned depends on annual rainfall and, in turn, inflows. In high rainfall years current extraction rates are sustainable; in low rainfall years that is not the case. Complicating the issue is that inflows vary between catchment valleys, and nor do inflows in one valley necessarily flow on to the next, as I have said earlier. Therefore, extractions are best managed on a valley-by-valley basis. 


The science around volumes of water that should be returned to the system is also not clear. Not surprisingly, we have had figures mooted of anywhere between 3,000 and 7,600 gigalitres of water that should be returned to the system. Figures are also based on average inflows. Again, not only do average inflows vary across the basin but, importantly, average inflows are of very little value or of very little use unless all the water is able to be stored. Since that is not possible, extraction rates will need to be closely monitored on a year-by-year basis across each of the catchments. The alternative is to impose ultraconservative extraction reductions and that would unnecessarily constrain productivity and cause hardship to basin communities. The use of adjustable allocations, as has been the case in recent years, is likely to be necessary into the future. The use of allocations could be used to further regulate the system on a year-by-year basis with relatively little impact on agricultural communities and food production. 


For the basin to remain sustainable we must have a healthy river system. If the rivers die the basin communities will also die. Now that the reform process has begun, we must see it through and we must get it right. In fact, it is my view that Australians are counting on us to do that. We must commit to what is required and not fall into a false sense of security because of the recent rains. With a growing world population, any reduction in food production should also be of concern. The Murray-Darling Basin is not only Australia's food bowl but offers huge potential for growth. A growing world population will need to be fed and the Murray-Darling Basin presents Australia with substantial economic opportunities. We should not dismiss those opportunities. As a member of the committee I have seen examples, as we moved through communities, of that occurring today, where on-farm efficiency is producing greater volumes of produce by using lesser amounts of water. It is that kind of innovation that we should be supporting, encouraging and investing in. 


One of the important issues relating to all of the committee's work was to try to come up with a proposal and recommendations that would be embraced firstly by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and then by the government. The committee worked through the inquiry in a very intense way. In fact, I am not aware that any committee has worked as intensely as this committee—certainly not in my time in this parliament. We did so because we set ourselves a deadline to try and report by the middle of this year. The authority has now extended its reporting time frame out by several months, and it will be interesting to see just what the authority reports to the government.


It was interesting, though, and relevant to the point I am making, that one of the very clear messages reflected in most of the communities we went to was that there was a sense of urgency about resolving a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and that uncertainty within the basin communities as to what would be in the plan was contributing to insecurity within the plan. So it is my view that the sooner the authority reports, the sooner there is a plan on the table, the better it will be for communities throughout the basin because they will have certainty, and with that certainty they will be able to manage their future operations. I certainly do not want to see the good work of this committee—which to some extent you could say was rushed, but it was rushed for good reason—now left sitting for months on end whilst others report back to the government.


I want to briefly talk about the situation with respect to South Australia, because South Australia has some unique issues. I said earlier that South Australia capped its issuing of licences in the 1960s. Effectively no new licences have been issued since then, and the amount of water that has been extracted from the system has remained pretty stable. In addition there has been a huge amount of investment in irrigation systems in the Riverland of South Australia. South Australia did not cause the overuse, nor was it responsible for any mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin waters. South Australia will also draw on very little of the federal government's $12.9 billion water-funding allocation.


One of the issues that was clearly raised was the management of the Lower Lakes, and that was raised more by communities in the eastern states. I accept that the management of the Lower Lakes is a contentious issue. There is, again, a divergence of views about how they should best be managed. I do not accept, however, that the Lower Lakes are the cause of all the problems with respect to water allocations upstream. I do not accept the argument that the system could be managed simply by tearing down the barrages at the Lower Lakes or something similar. The reality is, as I said earlier, that the whole system is no longer a natural system, and since the installation of the locks between, I think, 1922 and 1935 the whole system has dramatically changed.


There was a submission, however, from Mr Ian Mott, which talked about connecting the southern lagoon of the Coorong directly to the sea. It is a submission that I believe has merit and ought to be looked at. I also believe that for South Australia the issue is not so much how much water is returned to the river system but rather how much water crosses the South Australian border and ultimately reaches the Murray mouth. That is the real question for South Australians. Quite frankly, I wait with interest to see what the authority recommends in that respect.


This is a matter that I have spoken about in this parliament on other occasions. I will continue to do so and I am sure I will speak on the matter again when the authority's report is presented. In the last few seconds left, I not only thank the members of the committee whom I worked with in the preparation of this report—the member for New England is in the chamber this morning, as are the member for Riverina, the member for Barker and the member for Braddon—for the cooperative way that we worked together but also particularly thank the staff who supported the committee in what we did, every step of the way, and who organised the inquiry for us.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,24,2
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (11:24):  First off, let me say that I totally agree with the member for Makin on a couple of issues. I think the submission by Ian Mott as an alternative way of fixing up the problems of the Coorong and the Murray mouth should be seriously looked at and assessed by this government. Anyone who has looked at that submission, and I have pointed out this submission to the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Craig Knowles, as well, will see that it does warrant as a possible cost effective way to fix up a lot of those problems. One has only to look at what has been done at West Lakes in the western suburbs of Adelaide to see that, on a smaller scale, it has worked quite well. I plead with the government: at least spend the money to make an assessment of whether this could work, because it creates big possibilities for fixing up some of those problems.


I also support the observation by member for Makin about how hard this committee worked. In my time, and I have been here twice as long as the member for Makin, I have never been involved with a committee—and I been involved with a lot—that has worked so hard on a report. We actually met in December, which is virtually unheard of for a committee. For obvious reasons it is a very busy time for members of parliament, with schools breaking up and different functions that you need to attend in that period. On top of that, having a 10-day tour of the basin in January is also unheard of in my experience. That all members of the committee were prepared to make time to be part of this committee's deliberations is an indication of how important they felt this inquiry to be. For example, in December we went up to look at the Menindee Lakes. Six months earlier they were dry, but when we were there we saw that they had filled up. An enormous change had been brought about not by government or communities but by Mother Nature—I think Mother Nature is a lot cleverer than any of us. To see the enormous change there and to speak with the people of Broken Hill, who rely on the lakes for their water supply and their irrigation, was an important start.


We started our tour in my electorate, at the bottom of the system. We went over the barrages at the Lower Lakes, which gave every member of the committee a hands-on approach to the effects the barrages have had and how important they are. Again, I agree with the member for Makin: ripping down those barrages is not the answer. It is one of the fallacies that have been put out that all would be fixed if we just let the sea into the lakes. I think it would actually destroy the lakes. The Lower Lakes have never been naturally saline except for very small periods in our time. Like most estuaries they are mostly freshwater but occasionally, during droughts, they become saline for perhaps weeks at a time—certainly not for centuries, years or months. It is very much a very minor thing.


I remember one Melbourne Cup day, I think it was in 2006, when the federal government had just set up a water bureaucracy. We suddenly found that there was a real concern with how the states were reacting to the drought. I remember the Premier of South Australia coming back, almost like Neville Chamberlain with 'peace in our time,' saying, 'We're going to build a weir at Wellington.' We have spent millions at the proposed site, but no weir has been built. They had to do up all the roads so they could eventually, perhaps, build a weir. I do not think the weir was ever going to be the right answer. Perhaps a lock of some sort might have been the answer, but certainly not the weir as proposed by the government. I am very thankful that Mother Nature, again, stepped in and stopped the pressure to build the weir at Wellington.


I represent all of the Murray River in South Australia, all of Lake Albert and half of Lake Alexandrina. In fact, the boundary of my electorate basically goes through the middle of Lake Alexandrina and through the Murray mouth, so I suppose you could say that one side of the Murray mouth is represented by the member for Mayo and the other side is represented by me, as the member for Barker. I remember in the last election campaign that the candidates were often asked by the media or by people what we thought the biggest issues were. I always replied that the three biggest issues were water, water and water. That is very much a South Australian thing. It is an iconic issue. 


Having the honour of representing the Murray in South Australia is an iconic issue for me and will continue to be. Water supply is so important, not only for our communities but for our capital city Adelaide and for our industries that rely on the Murray. It is a very important part of our community, but the fact is that South Australia only takes six per cent of the allocations of the water that is diverted from the Murray-Darling Basin. I think Queensland takes about six per cent and the rest is basically taken by New South Wales and Victoria.


I have never taken the parochial view that you should only look after your own dung heap, because the Murray-Darling does not recognise electoral boundaries. It does not recognise states. So, if you are ever going to fix up this whole problem, you will have to take an overview of the whole basin and not just your own dung heap. It always concerned me that wherever you went in the basin there was always a view that you blamed everyone upstream and said, 'Blow those downstream!' Looking after your own dung heap is not the way to fix the Murray-Darling Basin; you have to look at the basin as a whole. That is why I have always believed that we need an independent Murray-Darling Basin authority, as John Howard proposed on Australia Day 2007. That did not come to pass because all the states bar Victoria would not sign up to referring their constitutional powers for seven or eight years to this national body. Unfortunately, we still have a bit of that problem but we should not ignore the wealth of knowledge that the state bureaucracies have when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin.


I also thank the secretariat, who I think did a great job. They worked as hard as us—probably harder in many ways. As a supplementary member for the purposes of this inquiry I was able to provide a voice for the constituents of Barker and also the whole Murray-Darling Basin. I think it is very interesting, if you look at our history, to see that the member for Braddon, the member for Farrer, and the member for New England and I were on a similar inquiry during 2003 and 2004. Not a lot changed except that I became even better informed as a result of being part of this committee, and I hope the other members did as well. We created a bit of controversy with that report, but the fact is that I think most of the recommendations that we made then were borne out. History often has a way of proving people right or wrong and I think in this situation we were pretty right. So, interestingly, we had the corporate knowledge of people who had previously been on an inquiry into water resources in Australia generally, because most of those seemed to be around the Murray-Darling Basin. I think it was important that we had that corporate knowledge and I think it was very useful to the committee that we did. In my electorate, water and the Murray-Darling is pretty big—I think that goes without saying. We have had some problems. On the one hand there are the irrigators that are struggling to keep their crops alive and the families and wider communities that are affected by the flow-on effects of, especially, the drought we have gone through. Some people have said it is the worst drought in our history. I think the records will show that the Federation drought from 1895 to 1903 was very similar in its effect. Of course, in those days we did not have the locks and we did not have the extraction from the Murray-Darling Basin that we have now. So I think the effects of the drought were exacerbated by what humans have done over the last 100 years. I am not saying we should get rid of the locks. Please do not get me wrong on that—because I think we have a pretty good regulated system that works pretty well—but we were found wanting when it came to the drought and it showed that we needed to take some serious action if we wanted to keep this a sustainable river system.


Part of this inquiry was purely to get out there and listen to all those people up and down the system. They wanted their opinion and the situation to be known and what decisions are made. I think people should realise our committee did not have the power to say, 'The Murray-Darling Basin Authority should take this action'; we were there to listen to how the guide to the plan would have affected the communities if it had been taken holus-bolus. I think we all agree that the PR that went out with that was not particularly good and it caused a lot of anger in the communities. So a large part of our job was to listen to those concerns and make some recommendations as a result. To be fair—I'm not blowing my own trumpet—I think the committee did a very good job. I think we helped the communities get their message across but also feel that they had been listened to and that we were prepared to make some pretty strong recommendations about the way ahead.


I certainly attended both public meetings in my electorate. In fact, I remember the member for Makin being at one of those meetings. Yes, there was a bit of heat. It was probably not as bad as we saw in Griffith, but there was a bit of heat. It was packed out. They had to use two rooms and try and set up a video and audio display so that people could show their concerns and needs. 


It gave a voice to people. We made a list of recommendations to the government—21 in total—and it would be a real shame if the government did not take notice of these because they are as a result of the consultation with the communities and that is where it counts, I believe. Any member of parliament worth their salt would always recognise that you have got to listen to your community and take the respective actions that come from talking to those people.


I want to speak about a couple of those recommendations. The most important one, I believe, is recommendation No. 7—an immediate end to non-strategic buybacks. That had widespread support across the committee but I think also through the whole community. It needed to be listened to and I do hope that government take note of that.


As Mr Rel Heckendorf put it, for people to sell their water at the price the government is offering, they would be desperate sellers, not willing sellers. If you do not have a strategic buyback you also have the problem of the Swiss cheese effect. I think everyone on the committee understands that. There is another thing we should be looking at—this is my suggestion—that every community, every irrigator take a 10 per cent cut. The government say that they will not do it could do it compulsorily, but there could be a 10 per cent cut stretched out over 10 years, one per cent a year, and fully compensated. I think that would return 1,200 gigs to the river and be quite successful. (Time expired)

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:40):  I knew Clyde Holding largely through the anecdotes and the reflections of others, but I certainly know just how fondly he was regarded by colleagues, by branch members and others in the labour movement, in the legal profession, in the land rights movement, in the arts community and very much beyond. I certainly associate myself with the remarks the Prime Minister made yesterday about such an extraordinary life and such an extraordinary contribution to this place and the parliamentary life of Australia generally.


As an alumnus of Holding Redlich, I would like to record in this place the regard in which he was held by members of the firm past and present. The firm was founded in 1976 by Clyde together with Peter Redlich. Since its earliest days, it has supported the labour movement, the arts and human rights and has engaged in public discussion about corporate social responsibility. Clyde Holding will certainly be best remembered for his contributions as a parliamentarian, but I think it important to reflect also on his contribution to the legal profession, of which I am certainly a beneficiary.


I know that my colleagues at the firm have publicly expressed their appreciation and pride at having been associated with a great Victorian and a great Australian, a man who supported the underdog and had a deep and lifelong commitment to supporting and advancing the causes of human rights and the rights and welfare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, a man who worked tirelessly to advance the interests of ordinary Australians. As a relative newcomer to the corridors of this place, I hope that I can measure up to at least a little of the legacy of a compassionate, determined and irreverent Labor leader and a very decent human being.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (11:42):  As the member for Melbourne Ports, I am very pleased to be speaking on this resolution about my predecessor, Clyde Holding, who died on 31 July aged 80. I join the member from La Trobe, in her remarks today, and the Prime Minister, in her remarks yesterday in the House, in saying that we express the appreciation of the Australian people and people in Victoria for his life and work in politics.


Yesterday at the National Gallery of Victoria many people across the political spectrum made very generous comments. The beautiful singing of Deborah Cheetham was an appropriate response to his life and work in politics. The speeches of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, whom Holding served as Aboriginal affairs minister and immigration minister, and former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, now Chancellor of the Australian National University, were particularly memorable. I congratulated former Senator Evans on particularly picking up the larrikin element that Clyde had, in a very affectionate kind of way.


Clyde represented Melbourne Ports for 21 years from 1977 to 1998 and is remembered with great respect by Labor people, by his many supporters in my electorate and by people of goodwill. He belonged to that generation of Labor men and women whose political careers were formed in the fires of the great Labor split of 1955. He was the son of a police officer, and both of his parents were from Northern Ireland. He was president of the Melbourne University ALP Club while he was a law student. He was president of Victorian Young Labor at the height of the split, from 1955 to 1957.


Clyde grew up in a very tough political school, fighting with both the DLP on the Right and the Communists on the Left in the inner suburbs of Melbourne. In the 1955 election he was the campaign director for Jim Cairns in the then seat of Yarra, which covered Richmond and Collingwood. The campaign is regarded as probably the most violent single election in Australian history, and I am sure it was, from everything that I have read, with both groupers and wharfies brawling in the streets of Richmond and Collingwood—the Collingwood Football Club does not have its reputation and its supporters for no reason—prior to that election, because of course the seat prior to the split was held by the Labor anti-Communist, later DLP, Stan Keon, and the contest was between Jim Cairns, with Clyde as his campaign manager, and Stan Keon. From that point, Clyde Holding was recognised as a person on the way up in the then devastated Victorian Labor Party. His chance came with the by-election for the Victorian state seat of Richmond in 1962. In the meantime he had been co-founding with Mr Ryan and Peter Redlich—who has played such a prominent role in Victorian public life both in running various companies and in setting up his own law firm and nurturing so many people in politics, human rights and the law—an industrial law firm. They set up this industrial law firm which nurtured many generations of Labor talent—the member for La Trobe being a very recent example.


Clyde became a prominent civil libertarian, campaigning against censorship, White Australia and the death penalty. Senator Evans described a most amusing incident where, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Richmond, Clyde Holding, was actually there are on the front line protesting against the hanging of the last man who was hanged in Victoria, Ronald Ryan. Clyde was actually arrested. Can you believe that? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Victoria was at the demonstration against hanging in Victoria and was asked by a policeman for his occupation, according to Senator Evans, which he reported as parliamentarian and lawyer and then was asked by the copper if he could read or write. Obviously the two things were not connected in the policeman's imagination.


In 1967, aged only 36, Clyde Holding became leader of the Labor opposition in the Victorian parliament. He modernised the party's platform and made a good impression on voters who were emerging from the oppressions of the split. In 1970 the Bolte Liberal government had become very tired and arrogant and Labor was set to make big gains. Unfortunately, however, their campaign was sabotaged on the eve of the state election by the extreme Left faction in the then Victorian central executive, led by Bill Hartley. They issued a statement in blatant and obvious opposition to federal Labor policy and to Mr Holding's announced public policy. They said that the Victorian Labor government would cut off funding to Catholic schools. As a result, a furious federal Labor leader, Gough Whitlam, refused to campaign in Victoria and the Bolte government was re-elected and Clyde denied his chance to become Premier of Victoria.


This was the last straw for many people in Victoria. The Button-Duffy group participants, including Michael Duffy—a very famous federal minister who was there at the ceremony yesterday at the National Gallery—and Bob Hawke and Clyde Holding, together with Gough Whitlam, engineered probably the most important event in the modern history of the Labor Party—the 1971 federal intervention in the Victorian and New South Wales branches. This ended the factional dictatorship of the hard Left in Victoria. It got rid of the influences of Crawford and Hartley, and it laid the foundations for Labor's subsequent successes in Victoria and federally. In fact, former Prime Minister Keating made the point to Premier Baillieu that ever since those days Victoria has been the jewel in the Labor crown. He said, 'We have lent it to you, Ted, and we will get it back soon.' I thought that was a very affable way of handling political differences.


Unfortunately for Clyde he was not the beneficiary of the long-term revival of Labor's position post the split in Victoria as state leader. The appeal to Melbourne voters of a modernised Liberal Party of Dick Hamer was too strong for Clyde to overcome and he was defeated in the 1973 and 1976 elections. So when Frank Crean, one of five members who had been the member for Melbourne Ports, retired as the member for Melbourne Ports in 1977, Clyde was ready to switch to federal politics.


Clyde was an early and strong believer that Bob Hawke was the man to lead Labor back to office after the heavy defeat of 1975. Clyde was a tough operator and played the dual roles of parliamentary headkicker and numbers man for Bob Hawke with great skill. Together with my dear friend and mentor Barry Cohen, he was one of Bob Hawke's numbers men. It was a tough decision that the Labor caucus had to make in those days, but I think the 1983 election result was proof of the wisdom of their undertaking. 


No less an authority than Graham Richardson described Clyde Holding as tough, resourceful and utterly ruthless. He was the main organiser of Hawke's challenge to Bill Hayden in 1982 and of Hawke's rise to leadership on the eve of the 1983 election. His reward, a strange reward—in fact it was something that was made very clear yesterday in the National Gallery of Victoria—that was requested by him was the Aboriginal affairs portfolio in the Hawke government. This is to his great credit. This choice surprised some people because it was, and still is, a difficult and thankless portfolio. You would not have thought it was the choice of an ambitious, hard-headed factional warrior. It was not the choice you would expect him to make. But Clyde was not just a political operator; he was an idealist and he wanted to make a difference for Indigenous people. As he expected, he found the portfolio frustrating. He had some great achievements. We all remember the appointment of probably the most prominent Aboriginal Indigenous leader of the time, Charles Perkins, as the first head of the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and the return of that great Australian landmark, Uluru, to its traditional owners. 


The member for Brand, the Special Minister of State, pointed out to me that these great decisions, including the resumption of Uluru to Aboriginal ownership, had political consequences; nonetheless Clyde was indomitable and it was the right thing to do. He also provided personally the funding that allowed Eddie Mabo to take his historic case to the High Court. All of us who have seen the film The Castle know about the vibe around Mabo, but it actually began with private funding of a case that wended its way through the High Court and ended up with a decision that authorised some of the things that Clyde had been thwarted on earlier. His great ambition was a uniform national Indigenous land rights act. That had been thwarted by the mining lobby and the WA government and, some people would say, the unwillingness of the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to stand up to them. I notice that Bob Hawke has since expressed his regret about that episode and I think that his judgment is correct. Clyde's reward came in the support, as I said, of the Mabo case, leading to the landmark 1992 ruling by the High Court, which has revolutionised Indigenous land claims in Australia. 


From 1987 to 1990 Clyde held several other portfolios in which he made an important contribution, particularly in the arts and immigration. We heard about both of them yesterday in great detail, particularly about his contribution to the arts and the purchase of homes of very important Australian painters, including Arthur Boyd, for the National Estate. I must note also Clyde's staunch and unswerving support for the Australian Jewish community, which began long before he was the member for Melbourne Ports. He was the founder of Labor Friends of Israel, an organisation which is still going strong. He has a forest in Israel named in his honour, and deservedly so. 


It is less than three years since we in Melbourne Ports farewelled the member for Hotham's father, Frank Crean, our federal member from 1951 to 1977, and we are now farewelling his successor, Clyde Holding. They were both great Labor men. What they had in common was a deep and lifelong commitment to the values of the labour movement: fairness, social justice and the rights of workers and the disadvantaged. Melbourne Ports has changed a lot since their day, but I think they are still the values that are supported by voters in my electorate. On behalf all Labor members and supporters in Melbourne Ports, I extend my sympathies to Margaret Holding, his first wife; to Judy Holding; to their children, Peter, Jenny, Danny and Isabella; and to Clyde's four grandchildren who, from the pictures at the National Gallery of Victoria, obviously held him in great affection. It was a wonderful video presentation of his life from the great state conferences of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which I can remember as a teenager, in the black and white films, right through to his last days in a nursing home in Castlemaine.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:55):  It gives me great pleasure, despite the sadness of the occasion, to rise to speak in tribute to Clyde Holding, a colleague and a friend, and to follow his successor in the seat of Melbourne Ports who has just spoken so eloquently about Clyde's contribution. I want to do something of that, too, and to acknowledge at the outset that Clyde made a great contribution to this country in the world of politics.


He was the member for Richmond from '62 to '77 and member for Melbourne Ports from '77 to '98, so that is a long stint in a representative collection of parliaments. He was the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria from '67 to '77, and he was also, as has been noted, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. But some of the issues I want to touch on today go to those areas that he always also had ministerial responsibility for that overlap with some of my responsibilities—those of local government, the arts and the territories. But he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from '83 to '87 and subsequently minister for local government and then Minister for the Arts and Territories.


I first became aware of Clyde Holding and his passion for social justice and for taking action in terms of causes and seeking to change things around the demonstrations associated with the hanging of Ronald Ryan, the last man hanged in Victoria. Clyde was leader of the Labor Party at the time. He was passionately against capital punishment, and there were many demonstrations around those issues. In one, which was referred to in a humorous way yesterday by another former colleague, Gareth Evans, Clyde actually got himself arrested. But I first really met Clyde during 1970, and that, again, was associated with other causes for social change driven by activism, and they were the Vietnam War moratoriums. In many ways, these were the first awakening for me of the importance of activism and determination in fighting for change. Clyde was up there at the front of the marchers with Jim Cairns and others. I was a university student in the day, but actively involved, and I got to know Clyde from that day onwards.


It was, of course, a different circumstance, not long after that, where the party, led by people, including Clyde Holding, understood the need for fundamental reform in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. This came about on the back of the bandwagon of Gough Whitlam's rise to popularity and support within the community, and the winning of the Geelong by-election in '67 and the Bendigo by-election in '68. But what we did not do was to win the swing to Labor election in '69 and, fundamentally, what dragged us back was our failure in Victoria. In many ways, our problem as a Labor Party in winning support translated to both the federal and state level: our disasters at the state level when Clyde Holding, who was a supporter of support for schools, not just state schools—this was the state aid debate—had his position changed by the then party secretary, Bill Hartley. This was a fundamental challenge in terms of the relationships between party administrations and parliamentary representation. Clyde, as a democrat, was not only furious at the circumstances he was put in around the issue, but also at the circumstances. That, amongst other things—like the loss in 1969—led to federal intervention in the state of Victoria. It did not stop Bill Hartley as party secretary making pronouncements completely contrary to whatever the Labor Party was pursuing at the time. We had many important rallies and mass meetings of party membership, incensed with where the party was going, including at Festival Hall in Victoria. There were some 3,000 people at conferences, talking about the reconstitution of the branch and the way forward.


Clyde was a determined leader in that, and he did it not just because of his anger at the circumstances he found himself in but also because of the realisation that, if Labor was to have a chance, it needed to reform itself. That said a lot about his determination to pursue issues that were unpopular. Clyde did not make many friends within the Victorian branch of the Labor Party in the day, backing Whitlam on the one hand and ousting the state secretary on the other, but he was prepared to do it because he understood it was the right thing to do.


I also note that that really was the turning point for Labor in Victoria, both federally and at the state level. Not only did it pave the way for John Cain's victory in 1982—and Labor has dominated government in Victoria since that time, something that eluded Clyde as opposition leader; he could not take the party to victory for a whole lot of internal reasons—but it also laid the foundations for what was the jewel in the Liberal crown, Victoria, becoming a Labor stronghold at the federal level as well. Not only did the party continue to win in the Victorian parliament; it also provided huge ballast in terms of the numbers that constitute this parliament. At the last election, for example, the strength of Labor's vote in Victoria was instrumental to our winning government.


Since that intervention, there have not been many periods in which, at the federal level, Labor has not held the majority of federal seats in Victoria. I think that attests to the importance of the need for reform and the importance of the party fundamentally understanding its democratic roots and engaging more actively with the broader community.


At the end of 1977, my father resigned from Melbourne Ports, which the current member for Melbourne Ports has referred to. I remember it well because I contested the preselection! I contested it against Clyde. We both came from the same faction. The faction in those days was incapable of making the call because, obviously, we were both excellent candidates! So we went to a rank-and-file ballot, and Clyde won—but he won by one vote.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
12:04 
to 
12:27





Mr CREAN:
  Before the suspension I was talking about the circumstances in which Clyde Holding won the preselection for Melbourne Ports in 1977. Whilst I was disappointed with the result, I was the FEA secretary and it was my duty to run his campaign. We became very close in terms of the local area, because it was the area in which I lived and an area that I knew well, and he represented the area with distinction from 1977 through to 1998. He was an asset to this parliament and I served in the parliament with him when I was elected in 1990 to the seat of Hotham. He was a great orator. He obviously had a store of corporate knowledge around a whole series of issues.


As the current member for Melbourne Ports previously said, Clyde was also instrumental in agitating for and getting the numbers for Bob Hawke to become Labor's leader and go on to victory in 1983. Clyde went into the ministry after that as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and in that portfolio showed his strong commitment to social conscience and social justice. He sought the portfolio and approached it with intensity. He appointed Charlie Perkins as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and together they did important work, including protecting much of Kakadu as a national park, handing over Uluru to the traditional owners and also, importantly, laying the foundations for land rights and the Mabo judgment. He also oversaw the importance and significance of the repatriation of Indigenous remains from overseas museums.


Clyde was also Minister for the Arts and had a number of major achievements in this field. Yesterday I had the honour to attend his memorial service, along with the member for Melbourne Ports, the Prime Minister and a number of former and present colleagues. We held it in the National Gallery of Victoria, in the Great Hall under the Leonard French ceiling. It was an appropriate circumstance to farewell and recognise his important contribution. He was Minister for the Arts and Territories from 1989 to 90 and he fought for the national cultural institutions at a time in which the arts were under severe pressure for cutbacks. He argued the value of the arts, particularly the national collecting institutions, and he was also instrumental in seeing the National Film and Sound Archive established on a much sounder footing. I will be doing a function in relation to that this afternoon, Sounds of Australia, but Clyde was important in securing their base, because he understood the importance of recording in film and audio the great works of this nation.


He was also a champion of the then new Australian Film Finance Corporation, which invested in a new wave of production of major film and TV projects, and he was active in supporting leadership change for our national institutions, including the appointment of Betty Churcher at the National Gallery of Australia. He was also a champion of Arthur Boyd's gift of his property on the Shoalhaven, the Bundanon Trust, to the Australian people. He helped Arthur Boyd and his wife approach the government in 1992 and supported the proposal with cabinet ministers. He was one of the founding members of that Bundanon Trust in 1993. In terms of cross-fertilisation—joining the dots, so to speak, given the nature of Indigenous art—he was also really important in understanding the significance of Indigenous art in the power of its message and its creativity. When he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he was instrumental in making the country more aware of the significance and power of this art form.


It is a sad occasion when we speak on this motion, but it is a rich and proud history and a great contribution that Clyde Holding made. I will just conclude by saying he was a person of courage, a person of compassion and certainly a person of determination. He made a massive contribution not just to the life of the Labor Party but also to the betterment of the nation. My condolences again are expressed to Judy, his wife; his former wife, Margaret; and their children, Peter, Danny, Jenny and Isabella.

For somebody to have served in both parliaments shows dedication and commitment not just to his own state but also to the nation's interests. I would also endorse the remarks made about his passion for Catholic school education and funding. It is something that is very near and dear to my heart. I acknowledge his contribution in that area, as well to the welfare of Aboriginal people in this nation.

Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (16:00):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 and to indicate that the coalition will support the amendment. The bill amends legislation to apply to the National Energy Retail Law, the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations as Commonwealth law and thereby facilitates its nationally consistent and effective application. It provides for the conferral of functions and powers of the Commonwealth bodies acting within the framework, including the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also provides for judicial review of decisions of the AER under the NERL.


It is a procedural bill but, nonetheless, an important bill. The NERL is the final major component of the National Energy Market Reform program agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in response to the 2002 COAG energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement. I am advised that participating jurisdictions have committed to commencing legislation applying to the NERL by 1 July 2012. The amendments to the Commonwealth legislation in this bill will ensure that the relevant Commonwealth bodies, which are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the NERL, including the AER, are able to perform those functions and duties and to exercise those powers from the commencement date.


I am particularly glad to take this opportunity to speak on this bill today, given that it puts in place the final pieces of a comprehensive program of national energy market reform which began under the COAG process in 2002 and took major steps during my time as the responsible minister. This has not always been an easy process. At times, dare I say, it has been an entertaining but fruitless process. However, in the long run we have succeeded. In the end, energy market reform is literally the driving force behind our economy and it is therefore important that we maintain the momentum on this reform and complete it. As I say, it was a difficult process. I saw state energy ministers come and go, particularly from New South Wales, with monotonous regularity—names that are simply blasts from the past. Whatever happened to Kim Yeadon? We know what happened to Carl Scully. There were ministers who saw energy market reform as something that should not happen because their state treasurers were opposed to changes that may endanger their income supply from the energy assets that those states have. Of course, we know what has continued to happen with regard to those energy assets and the impact that they are having on electricity prices.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  Am I interrupting you, Jill?




Ms Hall:
  I was just trying to correct your information, but I will—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  How nice for everyone involved. What about going through the chair? Would you not distract the member for Groom.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought there was only one speaker allowed at a time. As I was saying, in the end, there were some ministers who actually understood how important this process was. The ministers from Queensland, in the main, did just that. Minister Conlon, from South Australia, continued to push ahead, despite occasionally being buffeted by his colleagues. I have to say that, when Minister Batchelor, from Victoria, under the then Labor government, arrived on the scene, a breath of fresh air came with him. As a result of that, we are where we are now—almost at the end of this process. 


I congratulate all those ministers who took a positive attitude to this, all those ministers who assisted in processes undertaken by both me and my successor, the current Minister for Resources and Energy and Tourism, because in the end this is an incredibly important set of reforms. Energy market reform, if you get it right, will help your economy grow. If you get it wrong and if you allow the instances of parochialism and state Treasury interference to derail the process, then what you do is cut your economy's growth. So it is pleasing to see this has finally arrived at this point.


The reform of the national energy market, though, is an ongoing process. In this instance, I am glad that the government is continuing the work of its coalition predecessor in moving forward with these reforms, albeit at a significantly slower place. Energy reform is a necessary process, despite the fact that in most instances it has been completed with little or no fanfare. It is only a shame that this government is so badly failing to uphold its reform responsibilities in other areas and failing to build on the previous work that had been so painstakingly completed. In particular, I am thinking of the government's repeated failure to deliver on the energy white paper and I will have more to say about that later in my speech.


This is an important bill because, as I have noted in this place and before many other groups in the community, questions about Australia's energy supply and energy security have greater prominence now than they ever had in the past. If you were to ask Australians about the most pressing issues facing their households and their budgets, in most cases you would find the mention of electricity prices very close to the top of any list. While it is important that this final piece of reform, which started in 2002, is put in place, Australians cannot afford to become complacent. Unfortunately, there is every sign from this government that it intends to undo all the hard work that has been completed in the area of energy market reform with the disastrous policies that it is inflicting on other parts of the energy sector. In the 3½ years since this government has come to power, Australians have been forced to fork out more and more to pay for their electricity and other energy bills. Since 2007, electricity prices across Australia have increased on average by 50 per cent and gas prices have increased on average by 30 per cent. It is forecast that electricity prices will double by 2020, and that is before you take into account any of this government's policies that are guaranteed to cause further spikes in the price of electricity. In every state and territory of Australia, energy prices are putting greater stresses on household and business budgets.


A few weeks ago, I spoke in this place about the disastrous consequences of the South Australian government's decision to slash support for its remote area energy scheme, which subsidises off-grid generation for isolated communities. It is almost incomprehensible that, against this backdrop, we have a federal government that is so doggedly pursuing a policy that is squarely aimed at forcing up the price of electricity and eroding the benefits Australians have enjoyed as a result of access to affordable and reliable electricity. Because that is exactly what this government's carbon tax will do: it will force the price of electricity up by another 20 per cent, over and above the increases that are already in the pipeline. Over and above the predicted doubling of electricity prices, we will see a further 20 per cent added on top by this government's carbon tax. The problem with the carbon tax in Australia which other countries do not have to face is that this tax puts our industries at a greater competitive disadvantage, whether it is the steel industry, the motor industry, the aluminium industry, the coal industry—the list goes on. In fact, this tax will impact on individual Australians at a rate 400 times greater than that of the next comparable scheme, which is in Europe. The most significant way in which it creates this disadvantage is that it forces such a dramatic increase in the price of electricity. I know some raise their eyebrows when we mention the 20 per cent figure, but of course it is not our figure. It is the government's figure. Their direct goal is to lift the price of electricity by 20 per cent.


I have spent a great deal of time in the community of late, talking to householders, small business and the largest and smallest of Australia's companies, from the big miners to the corner shop. One thread that brings all of these groups together is that they are already doing everything they can to reduce their energy usage and thus their electricity costs. It is therefore patronising in the extreme for this government to suggest that the way to avoid this punitive tax is to be more energy efficient; these companies already are. At least that is a more sensible suggestion relative to others that have been made, such as not having a shower before bed, or sleeping with a pet. That is some of the information currently available from the government on how to cut your household electricity bill! I really do wonder where we are getting to with this. Yes, we have been able to prosper because of our ready access to affordable and reliable energy, but I can assure the House that this is not an advantage that most Australians take for granted.


The other enormous problem with the Gillard government's carbon tax is that it launches an assault on the very industry that provides the majority of Australia's baseload electricity, the coal industry. The government's carbon tax will dramatically downgrade the value of Queensland's and New South Wales's electricity assets, without providing any compensation. The vast majority of the government's $5.5 billion compensation package for electricity generators will go to the high-emitting brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia. An ACIL Tasman report released by the Baillieu government put the figure for the Victorian based generators at 97 per cent of the compensation package. This leaves Queensland and New South Wales out in the cold when it comes to their black coal fired generators, despite the fact that they are facing multibillion dollar write-downs in the value of their electricity assets because of the tax. The O'Farrell government in New South Wales has made it clear that its black coal fired power stations will suffer a loss of value of at least $5 billion because of the Gillard government's carbon tax.


Even in Queensland, Anna Bligh has made some strong statements about the lack of compensation for Queensland assets, which she claims will be written down by $1.7 billion. But I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, as anyone who knows anything about the industry knows—and I know a little, but others I have spoken to know a great deal more—$1.7 billion will not be the write-down figure; it will be significantly higher than that, double that or perhaps even more. We know from the past that Labor leaders tend to get their numbers wrong and make statements that they are not able to back up.


Given this is the only thing that the Queensland Labor government has had to say about the carbon tax, it is certainly not for us to come out and applaud it. We can discern the truth of just how unpopular this tax is with members of the public and state governments across the political spectrum.


The significant losses in value for generators have important ramifications for energy security and will also drive up electricity prices for consumers. A drastic reduction in the value of an asset or a reduction in the viability of an asset makes it very difficult, given that the owners of the power stations are now or soon will be looking to refinance their loans. I am sorry to say that the Gillard government's destructive carbon tax casts a long shadow over the subject matter of this bill before the House today. What good is an ongoing energy market reform when the government is simultaneously engaged in energy market sabotage?


Earlier I mentioned the failure of this government to deliver the long overdue energy white paper. This is an astounding failure of government responsibilities given that, under the normal five yearly cycle, an updated energy white paper was due two years ago, in 2009. I know this all too well because I was the minister who actually delivered the last white paper, on time, in 2004. It is important not to underestimate the significance of the failure of the Labor Party to deliver in this area. While we all know the Labor Party loves a good review and cannot resist the temptation to set up another committee to compile another report, the energy white paper is a profoundly significant document. It is not just a piece of paper and it is not just a review; it is a framework for the direction of Australia's entire suite of energy policies. 


Given how reliant our economy is on the energy industry and how fundamental questions of energy security are for every single home and business in Australia, the significance of the energy white paper cannot be overstated. At the moment, this government is forcing energy companies, investors, generators and suppliers to make long-term investment decisions in the absence of any updated guiding principles. 


What the Labor Party has not been short on is excuses as to why the white paper has yet to materialise. We have had claims that the CPRS process had to be completed, then there was the uncertainty created by the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, aided and abetted by the current Prime Minister, to back down on the then ETS proposal. That was followed by the current Prime Minister's ironclad assertion that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Now we have an increasingly desperate sales pitch for a toxic carbon tax, which I understand from members opposite is creating some real nightmares for them in their constituencies.


The energy industry cannot wait for the Labor Party to get its policy chaos in order. We need an energy white paper now. I know the Minister for Resources and Energy will have heard this time and time again from industry representatives but, that said, I implore him once again to do all in his power to get the government's house in order and to release the energy white paper.


In conclusion, the coalition supports this largely procedural bill to complete the process of energy market reform, which began in 2002. It is now the Labor government's clear responsibility to continue to take this policy area seriously. 


The Rudd and Gillard governments have a very chequered history when it comes to dealing with the energy and resources sector. The carbon tax, the mineral tax, the lack of a white paper, their comprehensive list of policy missteps and letdowns, new taxes and changes of direction have shaken investor confidence to the absolute core.  


The energy industry needs two things. It needs the confidence of knowing where the reforms are going and the confidence of knowing that its investments are safe. At the moment, it has neither. All it sees, almost at every turn, is policy chaos and new taxes which affect parts of the sector. In 2008, it saw changes to the condensate rules in Western Australia, then the CPRS, then the MRRT, then not the CPRS and now the carbon tax. All these send a message to overseas investors that Australia is not the investment place it used to be. That will have one consequence: despite these reforms, which the coalition are supporting, there will be a reluctance to make the big, long-term investments in Australia which we need to ensure that not only do we have reliable electricity and a supply that industry can rely on but we have a long-term prospect of lower than world average electricity prices, because that has been our competitive edge. That has been the reason that we have seen so many high-energy investments in Australia.


Whether it is the smelter in Bell Bay—close to Deputy Speaker Sidebottom's electorate—nickel refineries, aluminium refineries, copper refineries, the heavy industry that backs up the resource sector or the manufacturing sector, they all rely on one thing: an internationally competitive energy price. These reforms are there to try to provide that. The carbon tax, in particular, will destroy it. It will catapult our electricity prices into a region that simply makes us uncompetitive.


The reason the coalition are keen to support these reforms is that we want to do everything we can—in the face of the disaster, chaos and policy coming from the government—to keep energy prices down for industry. We want to keep energy prices down for households. We want people to be able to afford basic energy needs. We will wait and see what will happen as a result of these reforms and whether this government has the courage to commit itself to a white paper and continue the process. We hope so.


We hope in that haze that the government can give a modicum of confidence not only for to the refinancing process that the energy sector has to go through, particularly in the next two years, but also for the investment in the energy sector that we all need. Until that chaos ends and until that confidence is restored, we will not have significant confidence in Australia's future economic growth—and the energy sector with it. Until that chaos ends the true gains of energy market reform will not be realised.

 (Greenway) (16:22):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. This bill represents the final major step in the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 energy market review.


In my former life I was a legal practitioner in network industries Primarily I was in telecommunications, but I must say that I found few aspects of competition and regulation in network industries more complex than in the gas and electricity segments. I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge Gilbert and Tobin, my former employers, for everything I learnt and their continuing expertise on a group level and as individuals. Their practice is indeed without peer in this area.


In June 2001, the Council of Australian Governments recognised that the effective operation of an open and competitive national energy market would contribute to improved economic performance and would deliver benefits to households, small business and industry, including in regional areas. Very significant and important reform around the economic regulation of energy markets covering electricity and gas transmission and distribution has taken place since that time.


The reform that has occurred includes the establishment of the Ministerial Council on Energy to provide national oversight and coordination of energy policy development and a national energy policy framework to guide future energy policy decision making by jurisdictions and to provide increased policy certainty of energy users and for the energy sector itself. The Australian Energy Market Commission has been established as the maker and administrator of the rules under which electricity and gas distribution and transmission businesses operate. The Australian Energy Regulator, a division of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, investigates potential breaches of the rules and is otherwise responsible for the enforcement of the rules.


The focus of earlier reforms has been on the economic regulation of gas and electricity networks in the states and territories participating in the national market. These networks now operate in a national regime, administered by national bodies. This approach has facilitated consistent decision making, and the detailed rules that govern the economic regulation of the energy networks have provided greater certainty to stakeholders in relation to both the regulatory processes and the likely outcomes of those processes. In particular, for businesses operating in more than one jurisdiction, the move to a single rule administrator and rule enforcer responsible for the economic regulation of energy networks has significantly reduced the regulatory burden that was previously faced with dealing with multiple regulators applying sometimes very different regulatory regimes. The reforms with respect to the establishment of a national framework for the economic regulation of the gas and electricity markets in the participating jurisdictions are now complete. The final step that is necessary to realise the vision of a truly national approach to energy regulation is to elevate the non-economic regulation of energy services to the national level, and it is the shift from the jurisdictional based approach to our national approach to the non-economic regulation of energy that is the focus of this bill. 


Earlier this year the South Australian parliament passed legislation that establishes the framework for the national regulation of the non-price aspects of gas and electricity retail and distribution activities. Important elements of this framework include the Australian Energy Market Commission as the rule maker with respect to these non-price aspects and the Australian Energy Regulator as the relevant regulator and enforcement body. This government has a central role in facilitating the conferral of relevant powers and functions on these national bodies. 


The regulatory package that is created by the South Australian legislation includes the national energy retail law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that law which are referred to as the national energy retail rules and the national energy retail regulations. The objective of the national energy retail law is to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy. These issues are of critical importance to all consumers of energy. The national energy retail law, together with the national energy retail rules, will deliver important outcomes for residential and business consumers alike. 


Specifically in relation to residential customers, the national energy retail law and the national energy retail rules provide for standard retail contracts to be established by designated retailers. The designated retailer is obliged to make a standing offer applicable to the customer. The prices associated with a standard offer must be published on the retailer's website. The national energy retail law also sets out the manner in which the standard offer prices may be varied. The national energy retail rules set out model terms and conditions for standard retail contracts, and retailers are required to adopt those model terms and conditions with only those alterations that are permitted or required under law or the rules. 


The national energy retail law and rules provide greater scope for the negotiation of contracts between retailers and business customers. For business customers that consume energy at business premises below the upper consumption threshold, the customer and the retailer may negotiate and enter into a market retail contract for the provision of energy to the customer as well as the provision of other services. The rules set out some minimum requirements that the market retail contracts are required to meet to ensure the protection of this particular class of customers. These requirements include that a market retail contract must set out all the tariffs and charges payable by the customers and the circumstances in which the contract will terminate. In order to provide guidance to retailers as to the presentation of standard offer prices and market offer prices, the Australian Energy Regulator is also given the powers under the national energy retail law to make and amend retail pricing information guidelines. The guidelines may specify the manner and form in which details of standing offer prices and market offer prices are to be presented when publishing or advertising those prices. The disclosure regime around prices set up under the national energy retail law is designed to assist small customers to consider and compare standing offer prices and market offer prices offered by retailers. 


The national energy retail law also sets out important safeguards for consumers in terms of customer hardship policies. The national energy retail law requires retailers to develop these policies and submit them to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval. The Australian Energy Regulator has the power to direct the retailer to review the policy and make variations in accordance with the requirements it sets out. A retailer is required to vary the policy in accordance with those requirements and to submit it for approval and to publish the policy after it has been approved by the regulator, and it must also maintain and implement their customer hardship policy. The national energy retail law sets out minimum requirements for such a policy, including processes to identify residential customers experiencing payment difficulties as a consequence of hardship, flexible payment options and processes to identify appropriate government concession programs and financial counselling services and to notify hardship customers of their availability. Pursuant to the rules, a retailer will be required to inform a hardship customer of the retailer's customer hardship policy.


The National Energy Retail Law and rules also deal with the important subject of energy marketing. The law provides for the development of rules for, or with respect to, the carrying out of energy marketing activities. The rules set out the minimum information that a retail marketer is required to provide to small customers, such as information that includes all applicable prices, charges, early termination payments and penalties. The rules also provide for the establishment by retailers of a no-contact list, being a list of customers who have indicated they do not wish to be contacted by mail or in person by the retailer.


The relationship between distributors and end users of energy is usefully clarified under the National Energy Retail Law and rules and will become the subject of a consistent regime across the participating jurisdictions. The rules provide certainty to customers in terms of connection to the electricity and gas distribution networks. The rules also contain model terms and conditions that, with permitted variations, will form the deemed standard connection contracts between distributors and customers.


Of relevance to the important issue of security of supply are the provisions in the National Energy Retail Law and rules which establish the retailer-of-last-resort scheme. The approach to dealing with the circumstance in which a retailer is unable to continue to supply energy to its customers is currently the subject of varied approaches across the jurisdictions. The National Energy Retail Law and the rules also set up a retailer-of-last-resort scheme, which will require the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that at all times there is one default retailer of last resort for each connection point in the case of electricity and for each distribution system in the case of gas. Additional retailers of last resort may also be registered in respect of connection points and distribution systems. The law gives the Australian Energy Regulator important powers to enable appropriate action where the regulator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any event, circumstance or matter that it has reason to believe may or will affect the continuity of supply to the customers of a retailer.


To the extent that the relevant jurisdictions enact relevant legislation, the Australian Energy Regulator will have the power under the National Energy Retail Law to develop and make available on the internet a price comparator. The purpose of the price comparator is to assist a small customer to compare the standing offer prices available to that customer and the market offer prices that are generally available to classes of small customers in the relevant jurisdiction.


In relation to large customers, the National Energy Retail Law recognises that it is appropriate to be less prescriptive and to provide more scope for commercial negotiations between large customers and retailers and distributors. However, the framework still provides for adequate oversight of these arrangements. For example, the law provides that a distributor may prepare and submit to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval one or more proposed forms of standing connection contracts applicable to one or more classes of large customers. The Australian Energy Regulator is required to approve a proposed form of standing connection contract if it is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the contract are fair and reasonable and comply with any applicable requirements of the energy laws. On approval, the proposed standard form connection contract becomes the deemed energy regulator approved standard connection contract for the relevant class of large customer or the distributor.


It will be clear from the matters that I have mentioned that the National Energy Retail Law deals with issues that are of importance to all consumers of energy, particularly individual households and small business, including certainty around the supply of energy, the transparency around prices and the terms and conditions of supply by retailers. It will also be apparent that bodies such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission are absolutely central to the implementation of a national approach to the retail regulation of energy service providers.


The National Energy Retail Law gives the Australian Energy Regulator an important role in protecting the interests of consumers, particularly in relation to standing offers required to be made available to small customers, including residential customers, approving customer hardship policies and ensuring continuity of supply through the retailer-of-last-resort scheme.


The Australian Energy Market Commission is also given important functions and powers under the National Energy Retail Law, primarily those relating to the making of rules regulating the provision of energy services to customers and the activities of persons involved in the sale and supply of energy to customers. Bringing the price and non-price regulation of all parts of the energy supply chain within the purview of the rules administered by the Australian Energy Market Commission and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator will reduce regulatory complexity, particularly for service providers operating in multiple jurisdictions in our national energy market. Reducing the regulatory burden and providing greater certainty around the circumstances in which distributors are required to deal with retailers will facilitate heightened levels of competition in the retail market and provide consumers with greater choice.


The Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill is an important part of the realisation of a national framework for energy regulation. The oversight of energy regulation by national bodies, in particular the Australian Energy Regulator, whose powers and functions are to be supported by appropriate investigative and enforcement powers, is crucial to the stability and overall performance of the national energy market. I am therefore a strong supporter of this bill.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:35):  I rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. It has been a long decade since June 2001 when COAG met and established the Ministerial Council on Energy. The whole purpose of establishing a ministerial council on energy was to reach this point. It has taken a decade. In 2002, the energy market review released its report entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market. The review proposed the establishment of:


A statutory National Energy Regulator should be established under a legislative approach agreed by COAG to be the independent energy regulator in all jurisdictions, interconnected or otherwise, and to encompass the energy-related regulatory roles of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the National Electricity Code Administrator and state and territory regulations.


It has taken a decade, because it was only on 9 March this year that the South Australian government finally passed its National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010. That bill received royal assent on 17 March, which was the enabling process for this bill to go ahead. The effect of this bill will require a transition period until 1 July 2012.


Why is this bill so important? As stated by the shadow minister for energy and resources, the member for Groom, having a competitive energy sector is key and critical to growing an economy. We need reliable, efficient, affordable, energy to grow our economy. We need security also. The one thing that is being undermined in the energy sector at the moment is confidence in investment. That is affecting the long-term security of the energy sector in Australia. There is nothing in Australia, no person and no business, that does not rely in one way, shape or form on energy. Each and every person could be positively benefited by this legislation, because the purpose of this legislation is to cut the red tape for retailers who operate across state borders, and who therefore have to operate under different sets of legislation and regulation. The ambition and the purpose behind this bill are to make sure that more retailers will enter the market and increase competition. Hopefully, as proven by experience, increased competition will reduce the cost of energy.


By way of background, while talking about electricity prices, since December 2007, just after the Rudd government was elected, electricity prices across Australia have increased by an average of 50 per cent and gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent. In addition to that, water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs, such as hospital, dental and pharmaceutical costs, have increased by an average of 20 per cent; education costs, such as school fees, have increased by an average of 24 per cent; and rent by an average of 21 per cent. The thing that flies in the face and makes it hypocritical in pursuing this bill, which the government supports, is the fact that the Gillard Labor government wants to introduce a carbon tax and a carbon tax will increase power bills by a minimum of 10 per cent in the first year alone, rising to over 20 per cent. 


Competition in the energy sector is what will drive and develop our economy. Putting cost burdens on and setting prices through a carbon tax will actually reduce competition. One of the key aspects in relation to our energy market in Australia is that most of the electrical generation is owned by state governments. As the shadow minister said, state governments have taken a hit on their bottom line with the devaluation of their assets and will find it increasingly difficult, as indeed will private existing energy generation, to seek further loans to upgrade. This is not good for the security of energy. In fact, competition will not be addressed by the imposition of a carbon tax. 


I agree with what the shadow minister said, that as of now, having the effect of this national energy retail law and the other bills associated with it, what we need to truly understand the energy requirements and needs in Australia is an energy white paper. It has been long talked about but it is much needed. If we want to give those in the private sector or indeed state government instruments any level of security in their investment, they need to have a clear understanding across a national market, national grid work, of what is required, what are the impediments, what are the opportunities. So I would encourage the government to take up the opportunity and spend taxpayers' money on an energy white paper, which would probably cost a lot less than the glossy coloured brochure that was distributed on the need for a carbon tax, after the Prime Minister promised that they would not spend taxpayers' funds on political advertising. But the need for the energy white paper is paramount to understand planning and investment and long-term energy security for our nation.


Price, as I have said, is a driver to our economy. You would think that by just driving up the price of electricity, which is the whole matrix of evaluation that has been incorporated in the establishment of this carbon tax, by increasing the cost of energy you would drive down consumption and therefore provide this great environmental benefit. I regret to inform you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that between 2000 and 2008 the cost of electricity in Australia across the board rose by 55.9 per cent. Yet over the same period consumption rose by 10 per cent, from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So with the great ambition of this Labor government to jack up energy prices to reduce consumption and save the world, I have got to say that the record over the past decade has not delivered that, so I fail to see where putting a price on carbon will deliver the outcomes. 


The coalition and Labor have the same targeted goal: five per cent by 2020. The problem is that the Labor government believes, along with the Greens, probably driven by the Greens, that the only way you can do it is by taxing and putting a price on things, instead of providing leadership example and direct investment, which would achieve the same outcome without cruelling Australian energy and cruelling the industry factor. In fact, there has been some benefit by investing in programs such as solar hot water systems and the like. I would like to quote from an article on 15 August by Brian Robins, who said:


An energy efficiency specialist with Ausgrid, Paul Myors, said: 'We have seen consumption falling by around 2 per cent a year for average household electricity use over the past four years. That goes against the long-term trend of a steady rise.


'It could be the global financial crisis - and rising tariffs is a factor. We are seeing the impact of energy efficiency,' he said, pointing to the move away from electric hot water systems, previously the main user of electricity in the home.


It is critical that investment in programs like that, carefully managed and financially viable, occurs. It is a pity that the minister is not here for this. I have just read a media release about the government having replaced solar hot water systems in the Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory with electric hot water systems, which shows the hypocrisy in their argument.


A lot of industries will be hurt by the introduction of a carbon tax. Industries require a competitive energy price, which is the purpose of this bill. Prior to the deregulation of the dairy industry I had one of the strongest dairy belts in New South Wales. I still have quite a number of dairy producers—in fact we have Oak, at Hexham, which still processes milk. But a release put out by the Australian Dairy Industry Council on 11 July, entitled 'Carbon tax to hurt dairy farmers' says:


The cost to dairy farming families of this carbon tax is estimated to be $5,000 - $7,000 per year. Electricity is a major component of dairy farming operating costs and this tax will have a severe, direct impact on dairy farmers.


Given that we export so much of our processed dairy product from this country, the carbon tax will affect not only the price of a litre of milk on the shelves, but now affect the export opportunities that are already being marred by the high Australian dollar.


It is not just the dairy industry that will be negatively impacted by a carbon tax. In a release dated 14 July, the Housing Industry Association says:


The residential building industry will be affected more than most.


It goes on to say:


Around 500 facility operators will be required to pay the new carbon tax. For everyone else, the tax will be embedded in the products they produce, such as electricity, gas and other fuels, and in the primary materials such as steel, glass, cement, bricks and aluminium. The cost will further increase progressively as they pass through the various manufacturing and fabrication faces.


This is a cumulative tax—it is an add on, add on, add on imposition of costs. What will it cost to build an average new home? According to the Housing Industry Association:


… an average new house and land package is due to the carbon tax will be between $5,000 and $6,000.


For those young people who are struggling—working hard and saving to build the great Australian dream—this puts their dream one further step away from reality, because they also going to suffer from there being fewer jobs. 


There will be massive job losses under this tax. In fact, on the tourism industry, which is part of my portfolio, the Tourism and Transport Forum said in its report on the carbon tax that 6,400 jobs will go in the tourism industry alone. That does not count the jobs that will be lost in the region I represent, in the coal industry, the aluminium industry and the energy industry, and in the indirect jobs that support those. So those young people struggling, working hard and saving to get the financial wherewithal to buy their home will have to pay another $5,000. And when they get in there, their electricity bills are going to be higher and their furnishings will cost more. This is not a good way of creating opportunity. 


One of the hidden aspects in relation to the carbon tax, and a reason we need a nationally regulated energy market to increase competition, is local government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may not be aware, as indeed other members may not be aware, that the energy bill for the street lights in the community is paid for by the council. In New South Wales, I am not sure about other states, councils have their rate increases capped by the state government. I will give an example: in discussions with Maitland council's mayor, Peter Blackmore, I discovered that the council's electricity bill is currently $1.8 million per year. If it goes up 10 per cent, that is an extra $180,000; if it goes up 20 per cent, that is $360,000. And they will not be able to recover that from ratepayers. Where is their compensation package? In fact, Glenn Wall, the former mayor of Dungog council, said in an email to me last week, 'I am duly concerned regarding the impacts on local government and our capacity to absorb increased taxation liabilities and utility and resource costs increase, which are also being capped by the New South Wales government.' He went on to say:


The only people again that will be impacted will be our communities. Councils do not have the capacity to generate any further income. The community cannot afford huge rate increases to cover these increases (this is also problematic in New South Wales due to rate capping.) So the only option available will be to reduce the level of service we provide to the community.


Service delivery by government is key; it is essential. As I said right at the very beginning, this has been a decade-long approach. It needs to be introduced but it does not need the impediment of a carbon tax. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:50):  I am pleased to contribute on the consideration of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. We arrive at this point today after a journey spanning two decades, a journey embarked upon in the 1990s when the Council of Australian Governments had the foresight to agree upon the need to establish a national electricity market. It was a key microeconomic reform of the 1990s and something that a former Labor government was involved in in conjunction with state Labor and Liberal governments at the time. In the time since the establishment of the market we have seen more dynamic pricing and breaking down of the old monopolies that existed in the sector and witnessed the entry of new companies, the creation of new jobs and the creation of a more customer responsive climate that has benefited both business and residential customers and that has helped deliver significant historical savings on business inputs.


COAG has maintained its commitment to this important microeconomic reform and I emphasise the point that both sides of politics have worked together to see reform work to the advantage of the nation, the economy and the community. In fact, the legislation that we debate here today is the last big part of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the recent 2002 energy market review paper Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.


The main aims of the bill that is before the Main Committee and that will be considered by the House include streamlining regulatory requirements, increasing efficiency by harmonising regulations and delivering best practice consumer protection. What I like about this bill is that it aims to deliver benefit to industry—to businesses within the sector—and, importantly, to consumers, which will balance that out. That is to be commended and I will reflect on this further in my contribution today.


The national energy retail law will provide energy consumers with a range of benefits, ensuring that they can access energy services on fair and reasonable terms. Over the longer term, the expected reduction in red tape that the national energy retail law facilitates will provide an efficiency boost in energy service delivery and foster greater competition, helping provide an environment that can deliver more competitive electricity prices and offers. This increase in competition will also see retail customers benefit from more choice in energy retailers and in the services that they offer. The bill recognises that energy is an essential service and therefore will give consumers stronger protections.


The bill makes structural changes to a number of existing acts, like the Australian Energy Market Act and the Competition and Consumer Act, in order to give the necessary powers to the Australian Energy Regulator, the Australian Competition Tribunal and the Federal Court. The national energy retail law will work hand in hand with our new Australian consumer law to provide small customers with a range of strong consumer protections. It will also see the entire energy supply chain from wholesale markets to transmission and distribution networks through to retail markets brought under one regulatory umbrella via the Australian Energy Regulator. This is a significant improvement, especially considering the enormous level of state based regulation applied to the sector. Embedded within the legislation is a national energy retail objective to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and supply security; and, importantly, it will guarantee access for all small customers to an offer of supply of energy. It will set out mandatory minimum terms and conditions for retail contracts for all small customers and set up a framework for customers wishing to connect to new gas and electricity networks, including the installation of solar photovoltaic systems for the export of energy to the grid, and that will become something of greater prominence in the years ahead as more people seek to engage in that form of activity. 


I reflected earlier on the way this legislation seeks to balance the interests of all those affected or working within the sector, and as much as the legislation is designed to help businesses operating in the sector nationally, it is mindful of the needs of consumers across the country. One area I was heartened to see some focus on was the way in which energy suppliers deal with customers experiencing difficulties paying bills. This legislation will require retailers to develop a customer hardship policy which will need to be approved by the Australian Energy Regulator and which must contain a range of programs to help residential customers experiencing longer term financial difficulties. The hardship regime includes protections for vulnerable customers, including a prohibition on the charging of late payment fees, which has been controversial in their implementation and operation; a ban on requiring a security deposit; and a requirement on retailers to allow payment by using Centrepay. Beyond this there will be limitations on the disconnection of customers—which I think a lot of people, particularly in hardship situations, will welcome—including distinct processes to follow, restrictions on when a disconnection may occur, additional protections for customers experiencing hardship or difficulty, and a prohibition on disconnecting premises particularly where life support equipment is required. 


Another feature to emerge from changes within the sector has been the rise of door-to-door sales techniques designed to encourage customers to switch energy suppliers by signing new contracts for energy from a rival supplier to the one they currently use. While some consumers have welcomed the chance to change suppliers and lock in savings and get better service, others have felt pressured to sign the contracts. They have felt overawed by the complexity of the contract wording or they have had difficulties in exiting contracts where they feel that the contracts themselves have not lived up to the expectations promised in the actual negotiation phase. Energy marketing rules that build on the requirements set out in the Australian Consumer Law will ensure energy consumers receive full information before they enter into an energy contract, be it for electricity or gas or both. Importantly, the bill will hold retailers accountable for marketing that is conducted on their behalf. Again, I think that it an important learning that has emerged out of the process of change that has occurred, particularly through the course of the last decade.


The Australian Energy Regulator will develop a price comparator website like the ones currently available for health and car insurance so that customers will be able to compare retail offers put before them, and, where they need to be accessed, consumers will be able to resolve disputes with energy businesses through a consistent approach across jurisdictions. Retailers and distributors will be required to handle customer complaints in accordance with published procedure, which must be consistent with the applicable Australian Standard. Given that a lot of retailers are operating across state boundaries, it is important to be able to set in place a consistent set of arrangements as they apply to customer complaint resolution. If the customer is not satisfied with how the retailer or the distributor has handled the complaint, obviously they can refer the matter to the energy Ombudsman in their state or territory. 


On this point, as much as we have seen improvements in the way that the sector has responded to customer need, we also know that they can perform better. One only needs to refer to the workloads of Energy and Water Ombudsman operations to know that consumers are not backward in coming forward about poor service. Some of the matters I remarked upon earlier form a healthy part of the day-to-day work of the ombudsmen as they operate in different states. I am mindful, in particular, of reference to the Energy and Water Ombudsman in New South Wales, who has got a healthy workload, particularly if you look at the latest stats that have been put out, which span from October 2010 to March 2011. They do remark that over the course of four years complaints about retailers have increased or continued to increase. A lot of them revolve around billing issues—for example, disputed accounts. The number of consumers complaining about debt collection or credit default listings because of a high utility debt has increased. Also, in terms of retail competition, complaints about marketers misleading or pressuring consumers continue to increase. That, as I have said and reflected on earlier, is what has been looked at through the course of this legislation and what is intended to be introduced through the course of the work of the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that there are standards that exist across the nation so that, regardless of where consumers live, they can have some sort of protection and some sort of ability to resolve disputes. The legislation itself establishes a strong national regime to protect, as I have said, customers, particularly in the event that a retailer fails, and I would draw attention to the fact that there are provisions for a retailer of last resort. Of themselves these arrangements are not exceptional—they have been in place as a result of state based retail deregulation—but it is important to deliver a degree of consistency about the application and operation of retailer of last resort arrangements, especially when one considers how critical they will be in providing continuity of service in the event of a company being unable to continue in operation.


Services and protections such as the ones that I have reflected upon in the contribution in the Main Committee today will become increasingly important in the face of a rise in electricity prices that is occurring in states and territories, and it is our responsibility to enshrine them now to assist those that may be vulnerable. I will just leave my remarks at that, and I do commend the legislation to the Main Committee and welcome the fact that, as remarked upon earlier, we have now a national energy or electricity market and we have operators that are moving across state boundaries. There are opportunities now for businesses to participate in this sector in a way that 20 years ago they would not have imagined. As much as this seeks to liberate a lot of those companies from needless regulation or conditions that do not necessarily benefit consumers or those industries—or those businesses, I should say—it also puts in place a strong consumer protection regime. I note that the minister is present. Again I commend the fact that the legislation does seek to balance out the industry interests along with those of consumers. Thank you.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:02):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011, and I am pleased to follow the member for Chifley, who has significant experience working in both the energy sector and the communications sector, both networked industries. I note that there are a growing number of members of parliament with experience working in the networked industries. I do not think that is a coincidence, because across the broad sector of networked industries there has been a program of deregulation, competition and liberalisation for some 20 years, and that has led to growth, to opportunities and, I would argue, to the increasing importance of those sectors within the national economy. That is a good thing, and I argue that it is also a good thing that people with experience working in those sectors are now serving in the national parliament.


The bill that is before us is part of the long-term program to reform the national energy market. Its effect is to amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 so that that amended act will apply the National Energy Retail Law, the law which is set out in the South Australian act of 2011, which itemises the specific provisions of that law. It forms part of the cooperative Commonwealth, state and territory regime to regulate the non-economic distribution and retail regulation of gas and energy. The National Energy Retail Law has this to say as a statement of its objectives:


The objective of this law is to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply.


In its operations, this bill confers key powers on the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Regulator. The Australian Energy Market Commission is the national rule-making and development body in electricity and gas. The Australian Energy Regulator regulates electricity and gas transmission and distribution and, included within that, pricing.


The provisions of this bill are in one sense procedural, but they are important nevertheless in facilitating the nationally consistent application of the National Energy Retail Law and National Energy Retail Rules. They represent yet a further stage in the implementation of a set of measures that goes back to a process initiated by the Council of Australian Governments' 2002 energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.


In the brief time available to me I want to make three key points. Firstly, as I have already indicated, these reforms are part of the broader competition reform process in Australia, which began some 20 years ago and has played out over that period. Energy is clearly one of the most important sectors where reform has occurred. I secondly want to highlight the tensions between that reform process and the Gillard government's stated policy in relation to the carbon tax. And also I want to highlight some inconsistencies with developments in another parallel market, which is telecommunications. 


Let me start by talking about the broad competition reform process, which in many ways goes back to the Hilmer review reporting in 1993. That report noted that at that time:


Government businesses account for 10% of Australia's GDP, with rail, electricity, gas and water utilities alone accounting for nearly 5% of GDP. Improving the efficiency of these sectors remains a national priority. 


The report went on to say:


While there have been some encouraging improvements … progress is being made from a low base, and Australian public enterprise productivity levels remain well below international best practice. For important industries such as rail, electricity and telecommunications, most Australian enterprises are achieving only 75% or less of the productivity levels achieved elsewhere.


That therefore was the starting point in the early 1990s, when the Hilmer review reported. Triggered by that review and some other processes, we saw the carrying out of a reform process over a number of years in the gas and electricity sectors, as well as a whole range of other sectors. But in the gas and electricity sectors we saw the separation of a previously vertically integrated supply chain; the introduction of competition between generators and retailers; network elements become subject to access and price regulation; the creation of the national electricity market; and gas pipelines become subject to third-party access. 


Progress on this reform agenda was reviewed in 2002. If you go back and look at the 2002 review it does make some interesting reading, some nine years later. It opens with the observation that:


Australia is endowed with significant, diverse and high quality energy resources. Australia has approximately 800 years supply of easily accessible brown coal and 290 years supply of black coal. It has large natural gas resources in the North West, in Bass Strait and in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin … 


It also referred to good wind, hydro and solar resources. The report went on to note that:




… Australia’s electricity and gas prices—





this is speaking in 2002—





are close to the lowest in the developed world … for both major industrial and residential users.



And it made this observation, which I would suggest remains as timely today as it was in 2002: 


Energy is, therefore, a very significant strategic policy matter for the Australian economy. It underpins the competitiveness of our exported goods sector, is a vital ingredient for domestic industry, and it is a very important item in the monthly household expenditure budget.


A key objective of the program of the national competition reforms was to improve productivity. As Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, observed in a speech in 2000, talking about progress which had been achieved to that point, a key benefit of the reform agenda was to reduce prices. He had this to say:


The increased competition that has come with these reforms has also helped to ensure that the productivity improvements have benefited consumers, through consequent reductions in prices (and improvements in quality). For example:


households and industrial users have benefited from declines in real electricity prices in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent …


Declines in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent—how things have changed.


If we turn to the second point that I want to highlight, there is a real tension between this policy agenda—the bill before us today, which implements one of the components of that policy agenda—on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the direction that the Gillard government has been pursuing when it comes to carbon tax. We now have a government going deliberately and directly in the opposite direction from the one which was cited so approvingly by Gary Banks in 2000 and from the direction which underpins the competition reforms going back to the start of the 1990s. We saw, as I do not need to remind anybody in this House, a promise by the Prime Minister in 2010 that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, and of course we subsequently saw in February 2011 a complete reversal of direction.


What is significant about that, apart from the issues of integrity and trust, is that we have the Gillard government, in substance, reversing the policy direction which has been pursued in energy markets for many years. Since December 2007, electricity prices across Australia have risen by an average of 50 per cent and gas by an average of 30 per cent. What a stark contrast that is to the track record of improvements in competition and efficiency and reduction in prices in the 1990s which I cited earlier. Of course, what we can now expect is further sharp increases in electricity prices, stimulated in part by the carbon tax.




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, in accordance with the standing orders for the Main Committee, will the honourable member take a question with respect to the cause of the current increases in electricity prices?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Member for Bradfield, will you allow a question?




Mr FLETCHER:
  I am more than happy to take a question from the minister.




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the honourable member: does he accept the statements by the member for Groom reported in the Australian on 20 and 21 August last year, when he stated that power prices in Australia are likely to double in the next five to seven years regardless of who is in government? Does he also accept that in making those statements the member for Groom indicated that he recognised that, irrespective of who is in government, those electricity prices would occur because they are a result of requirements for investment across Australia to ensure that electricity supply reliability and security continue to meet community reliability standards—that is, relating to maintaining the existing distribution network?




Mr FLETCHER:
  I thank the minister for the question and the opportunity to answer it. The point that I would make in answering the question is that, in an environment where prices are expected to rise, it is extraordinary that you would then stick on a discretionary tax which is likely to increase prices by a further 20 per cent, and that is the consequence of this government's policy. That is why I say and we say on this side of the House that there has been a complete reversal in policy direction by this government.


The 2002 review which I cited earlier noted correctly that our low energy prices are a huge competitive advantage, and it is clearly therefore a matter of considerable concern that we have such a sharp and direct reversal in policy direction by this government. It is further concerning that a consequence of the carbon tax policies being pursued by this government is that there is a key negative effect on major sectors of energy generation. The New South Wales government, for example, estimates a $5 billion loss in the values of its black coal based generation assets. to So it is very hard to understand why it makes sense on the one hand to be pursuing a continuation of the energy market reform process while on the other hand introducing a completely separate policy which goes in the opposite direction.


The other thing that is very interesting in the 2002 review is that it highlights the importance of certainty in the regulatory regime applying to the energy sector for the purpose of encouraging investment. I cannot imagine that the authors of that review would have predicted a scenario in which a government would be elected in 2007 promising an emissions trading scheme, would in 2010 abandon that policy, would later in 2010 make a solemn promise to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax and then in February 2011 announce, capriciously and with no notice, that there would now be a carbon tax. The degree of uncertainty facing the industry has been ramped up beyond what might reasonably have been expected or predicted when this review was written in 2002.


The third point I want to make in the very brief time that remains to me is to highlight the difference, the contrast, between the reform agenda in energy and the way in which the reform agenda has gone wildly off track in the telecommunications sector. These are two networked industries with very considerable similarities. The regulatory frameworks are in many ways quite similar. Both were the subject of competition policy reforms throughout the 1990s. In the energy sector, the Gillard government is at least nominally continuing to implement the Howard government's reform agenda, albeit undermined, as I have noted, by its contrasting policy direction to do with the carbon tax. But it is very noteworthy that when it comes to telecommunications there has been a complete reversal of a reliance on competition. This government has effectively abandoned competition. Compare it to the electricity sector, where there has been a continued reliance on the existing assets in the sector rather than the government building new assets, where companies have been permitted to continue to operate based upon their current ownership structure rather than an effective policy of nationalisation, where existing players have been structurally separated through breaking up vertically integrated companies into generation, transmission and distribution as opposed to the spurious argument we hear in the telecommunications sector that the only way to achieve structural separation is to build a brand-new company at vast government expense. And where in the energy sector there has continued to be a commendable reliance on competition, the comparison is not a favourable one. I make the point that it is one of the many ways in which policy in these areas is rife with internal contradictions.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (17:17):  I thank the members for Groom, Paterson, Bradfield, Greenway and Chifley for their contributions to this debate. In closing, can I indicate that the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth play an important role facilitating the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments' cooperative legislative regime for regulating the relationship between energy retailers and their customers. This regime, I am pleased to report, is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the 2002 report in terms of energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.


By applying the National Energy Retail Law as Commonwealth law, this bill will help reduce the regulatory burden on energy retailers, open the market to greater competition and provide a strong suite of energy-specific consumer protections. This bill amends three Commonwealth acts. The Australian Energy Market Act 2004 is amended to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 of South Australia and the rules and regulations made under it as a law of the Commonwealth in Australia's offshore area. The Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal will have important roles in overseeing the proper operation of this legislative regime to ensure efficient and competitive outcomes in the energy market that protect the long-term interests of energy consumers. To this end, this bill amends the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to explicitly allow the new national energy retail law to confer relevant functions and powers and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies. Under the national energy retail law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses, except in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, will be undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator, bringing the whole energy supply chain under national regulation for the first time.


The Australian Energy Regulator will oversee a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions in a manner that will contribute to the achievement of the national energy retail objective. It will also have a number of new approval functions. The amendments to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 contained in this bill provide jurisdiction to the Federal Court to hear proceedings under the national energy retail law. This bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to ensure the administrative decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator under the national energy retail law are subject to appropriately rigorous judicial review.


In summary, the amendments in this bill represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator. This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy markets, while minimising the regulatory burden on industry.


Having dealt with the legislative nature of the bill, which is important, I will deal with some of the issues raised, principally in the contributions from the members for Groom, Paterson and Bradfield, about energy prices. Then I might go to a question raised by the member for Groom about the energy white paper, which is related to these proceedings. Let us be very clear about electricity prices. This is the question that the member for Bradfield refused to answer or acknowledge. The biggest cause of recent prices is increasing network charges, particularly for distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission, which collectively account for around 50 per cent of a household electricity bill. These problems confront all states and territories, irrespective of who is in government—be it a coalition government in New South Wales or a Labor government in Queensland. The changes are being driven by the substantial investment required in new and ageing network infrastructure. It is a fact of life. The investment is required to ensure the continued reliability of electricity supply that the community has come to expect. In essence, electricity is an essential service and the last thing the Australian community is going to accept from a state government of any political persuasion is shedding or blackouts. The reliability of the electricity supply underpins the operation of the Australian economy. I also indicate that some electricity networks are up to 40 to 55 years of age and are reaching the end of their useful life. There are therefore serious questions of reliability without that investment.


As a growing economy, our community's ever increasing expectations for the use of such things as air conditioners and widescreen televisions et cetera are part of a rising peak demand for electricity. This is largely caused, as I indicated, by the growing use of appliances such as air conditioners, which is placing additional pressure on the network. The size of the investment needed to meet these challenges varies across jurisdictions, but independent regulators recently authorised substantial expenditure by network businesses to carry out these upgrades, which obviously flow through to both industrial and household customer bills.


Let us be clear: these increases would also occur under a coalition government. There is no avoiding these increases in electricity prices. Perhaps the member for Flinders is not prepared to acknowledge that, as was the case on 7.30 on 24 May when he incorrectly and in a most dishonest way said that under a coalition government:


There will be no increase in electricity prices to consumers …


I contrast those comments with those of someone who has some understanding, the former minister for energy, the member for Groom, who understands the challenges faced by the electricity market. I referred earlier, in a question to the member for Bradfield, to comments made by the member for Groom on 20 and 21 August last year, the Friday before the election day and the election day. In the Australian he is reported very clearly as saying that power prices were likely to double in the next five to seven years regardless of who is in government. That represents the harsh reality of the situation before us. And these types of increases are being experienced under coalition premiers.


I refer to a range of comments by the Premier of Western Australia since he was elected only a matter of couple of years ago. He has had to front up to increases in electricity prices. This is reflected, for example, in a report in the West Australian of 9 February in which he said, 'The government has been increasing power prices as it seeks to overcome two decades of officially sanctioned caps on prices at a time when the cost of producing electricity has soared.' He then went on to say this in a statement on 15 February this year: 


Some of the hardest decisions have been those that have increased the cost of electricity, water and gas for West Australian households and businesses. ... The reality is that the cost of delivering electricity, gas and water to households and businesses throughout this vast, hot, dry state—


Sounds like Australia, not just Western Australia—


is an expensive business. In the case of electricity, the cost of providing power is still significantly above what people pay for it. The recent increases have been necessary to ‘catch up’, after some poor decisions in the past and years of no price rises.


Decisions made across the political spectrum, I might add. He went on to say:


It is important to note that even with the increases of the past two years, taxpayers still have to contribute to cover the gap.


In his budget speech of 2010, he also said, 'Moving towards ensuring charges reflect the true cost of delivering electricity is what this budget is about.'


It is about time that we had a little bit of honesty about what is driving the increase in electricity prices in Australia at the moment. Past generations built the network. Our responsibility is to maintain and extend the network in accordance with our demands. We have a growing economy. The demand for energy is increasing. We as a community not only expect reliability but we also expect the system to meet our peak energy requirements in a couple of weeks of the year. That effectively means that we need to build a system that is only used for a couple of weeks of the year. Our responsibility is to try and work out how to reduce that peak demand through improvements in energy efficiency. That is clearly part of the responsibility of the Ministerial Council on Energy and Resources. We need to work with industry and the community on those efficiency issues.


There was a serious question raised by the member for Groom. I respect his understanding of the challenges confronting Australia from an energy security point of view. One way or another, the debate about a price on carbon has to be resolved. The record shows that we as a community have lacked baseload investment for some considerable time. There are special challenges coming the way of Queensland and New South Wales. In New South Wales, it is fair to say that the last real baseload investments were under the Wran government. When it was elected on 2 May 1976, it inherited an unstable electricity system, which led to blackouts and real problems for industry and households. That government built ahead of its requirements in terms of the needs of the community at that time, and New South Wales lived off that for many decades.


Because of the uncertainty over a price on carbon, we have not had baseload investments for some time in coal-fired power in Australia. That raises ongoing issues over the next decade about where we go in terms of energy security. We have had growth in wind power. In more recent times, we have had a growth in solar PV, mainly because the price of solar PV manufactured imports has gone down. That growth has been assisted by a range of feed-in tariffs at a state and territory level, by governments of all political persuasions, and the introduction of the RET. In terms of reliability, the only real investment has been in peaking gas capacity. I might also say that in this transition, yes, there will be a growth in wind, a mature form of renewable energy, but there is also going to be a significant reliance on gas. The energy white paper was well underway in the last parliament. What derailed it was our inability as a community, in November 2009, to resolve the issue of a price on carbon. A price on carbon goes to the question of how you price the available energy options for Australia. Once this debate about where we go on a price on carbon is completed in this calendar year the work that is already underway and well advanced on the energy white paper will proceed to conclusion. All being well, a draft energy white paper will be released by Christmas for further debate and consideration by the broader community and finalisation in 2012.


The member for Groom is right to raise the need to resolve the issue of this energy white paper. I wanted to resolve it in the last parliament. You cannot resolve it without bringing to the debate the question of certainty about where we as a community are up to with a price on carbon. That is an important input in enabling us to consider the different energy options for Australia in the decades to come. So I, in a proper way, indicate to the member for Groom that the work is underway and that my desire is, with the support of the department, to conclude this work, which has been done in full consultation with industry, prior to Christmas this year. Then it will be released for public debate. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (16:00):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 and to indicate that the coalition will support the amendment. The bill amends legislation to apply to the National Energy Retail Law, the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations as Commonwealth law and thereby facilitates its nationally consistent and effective application. It provides for the conferral of functions and powers of the Commonwealth bodies acting within the framework, including the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also provides for judicial review of decisions of the AER under the NERL.


It is a procedural bill but, nonetheless, an important bill. The NERL is the final major component of the National Energy Market Reform program agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in response to the 2002 COAG energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement. I am advised that participating jurisdictions have committed to commencing legislation applying to the NERL by 1 July 2012. The amendments to the Commonwealth legislation in this bill will ensure that the relevant Commonwealth bodies, which are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the NERL, including the AER, are able to perform those functions and duties and to exercise those powers from the commencement date.


I am particularly glad to take this opportunity to speak on this bill today, given that it puts in place the final pieces of a comprehensive program of national energy market reform which began under the COAG process in 2002 and took major steps during my time as the responsible minister. This has not always been an easy process. At times, dare I say, it has been an entertaining but fruitless process. However, in the long run we have succeeded. In the end, energy market reform is literally the driving force behind our economy and it is therefore important that we maintain the momentum on this reform and complete it. As I say, it was a difficult process. I saw state energy ministers come and go, particularly from New South Wales, with monotonous regularity—names that are simply blasts from the past. Whatever happened to Kim Yeadon? We know what happened to Carl Scully. There were ministers who saw energy market reform as something that should not happen because their state treasurers were opposed to changes that may endanger their income supply from the energy assets that those states have. Of course, we know what has continued to happen with regard to those energy assets and the impact that they are having on electricity prices.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  Am I interrupting you, Jill?




Ms Hall:
  I was just trying to correct your information, but I will—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  How nice for everyone involved. What about going through the chair? Would you not distract the member for Groom.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought there was only one speaker allowed at a time. As I was saying, in the end, there were some ministers who actually understood how important this process was. The ministers from Queensland, in the main, did just that. Minister Conlon, from South Australia, continued to push ahead, despite occasionally being buffeted by his colleagues. I have to say that, when Minister Batchelor, from Victoria, under the then Labor government, arrived on the scene, a breath of fresh air came with him. As a result of that, we are where we are now—almost at the end of this process. 


I congratulate all those ministers who took a positive attitude to this, all those ministers who assisted in processes undertaken by both me and my successor, the current Minister for Resources and Energy and Tourism, because in the end this is an incredibly important set of reforms. Energy market reform, if you get it right, will help your economy grow. If you get it wrong and if you allow the instances of parochialism and state Treasury interference to derail the process, then what you do is cut your economy's growth. So it is pleasing to see this has finally arrived at this point.


The reform of the national energy market, though, is an ongoing process. In this instance, I am glad that the government is continuing the work of its coalition predecessor in moving forward with these reforms, albeit at a significantly slower place. Energy reform is a necessary process, despite the fact that in most instances it has been completed with little or no fanfare. It is only a shame that this government is so badly failing to uphold its reform responsibilities in other areas and failing to build on the previous work that had been so painstakingly completed. In particular, I am thinking of the government's repeated failure to deliver on the energy white paper and I will have more to say about that later in my speech.


This is an important bill because, as I have noted in this place and before many other groups in the community, questions about Australia's energy supply and energy security have greater prominence now than they ever had in the past. If you were to ask Australians about the most pressing issues facing their households and their budgets, in most cases you would find the mention of electricity prices very close to the top of any list. While it is important that this final piece of reform, which started in 2002, is put in place, Australians cannot afford to become complacent. Unfortunately, there is every sign from this government that it intends to undo all the hard work that has been completed in the area of energy market reform with the disastrous policies that it is inflicting on other parts of the energy sector. In the 3½ years since this government has come to power, Australians have been forced to fork out more and more to pay for their electricity and other energy bills. Since 2007, electricity prices across Australia have increased on average by 50 per cent and gas prices have increased on average by 30 per cent. It is forecast that electricity prices will double by 2020, and that is before you take into account any of this government's policies that are guaranteed to cause further spikes in the price of electricity. In every state and territory of Australia, energy prices are putting greater stresses on household and business budgets.


A few weeks ago, I spoke in this place about the disastrous consequences of the South Australian government's decision to slash support for its remote area energy scheme, which subsidises off-grid generation for isolated communities. It is almost incomprehensible that, against this backdrop, we have a federal government that is so doggedly pursuing a policy that is squarely aimed at forcing up the price of electricity and eroding the benefits Australians have enjoyed as a result of access to affordable and reliable electricity. Because that is exactly what this government's carbon tax will do: it will force the price of electricity up by another 20 per cent, over and above the increases that are already in the pipeline. Over and above the predicted doubling of electricity prices, we will see a further 20 per cent added on top by this government's carbon tax. The problem with the carbon tax in Australia which other countries do not have to face is that this tax puts our industries at a greater competitive disadvantage, whether it is the steel industry, the motor industry, the aluminium industry, the coal industry—the list goes on. In fact, this tax will impact on individual Australians at a rate 400 times greater than that of the next comparable scheme, which is in Europe. The most significant way in which it creates this disadvantage is that it forces such a dramatic increase in the price of electricity. I know some raise their eyebrows when we mention the 20 per cent figure, but of course it is not our figure. It is the government's figure. Their direct goal is to lift the price of electricity by 20 per cent.


I have spent a great deal of time in the community of late, talking to householders, small business and the largest and smallest of Australia's companies, from the big miners to the corner shop. One thread that brings all of these groups together is that they are already doing everything they can to reduce their energy usage and thus their electricity costs. It is therefore patronising in the extreme for this government to suggest that the way to avoid this punitive tax is to be more energy efficient; these companies already are. At least that is a more sensible suggestion relative to others that have been made, such as not having a shower before bed, or sleeping with a pet. That is some of the information currently available from the government on how to cut your household electricity bill! I really do wonder where we are getting to with this. Yes, we have been able to prosper because of our ready access to affordable and reliable energy, but I can assure the House that this is not an advantage that most Australians take for granted.


The other enormous problem with the Gillard government's carbon tax is that it launches an assault on the very industry that provides the majority of Australia's baseload electricity, the coal industry. The government's carbon tax will dramatically downgrade the value of Queensland's and New South Wales's electricity assets, without providing any compensation. The vast majority of the government's $5.5 billion compensation package for electricity generators will go to the high-emitting brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia. An ACIL Tasman report released by the Baillieu government put the figure for the Victorian based generators at 97 per cent of the compensation package. This leaves Queensland and New South Wales out in the cold when it comes to their black coal fired generators, despite the fact that they are facing multibillion dollar write-downs in the value of their electricity assets because of the tax. The O'Farrell government in New South Wales has made it clear that its black coal fired power stations will suffer a loss of value of at least $5 billion because of the Gillard government's carbon tax.


Even in Queensland, Anna Bligh has made some strong statements about the lack of compensation for Queensland assets, which she claims will be written down by $1.7 billion. But I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, as anyone who knows anything about the industry knows—and I know a little, but others I have spoken to know a great deal more—$1.7 billion will not be the write-down figure; it will be significantly higher than that, double that or perhaps even more. We know from the past that Labor leaders tend to get their numbers wrong and make statements that they are not able to back up.


Given this is the only thing that the Queensland Labor government has had to say about the carbon tax, it is certainly not for us to come out and applaud it. We can discern the truth of just how unpopular this tax is with members of the public and state governments across the political spectrum.


The significant losses in value for generators have important ramifications for energy security and will also drive up electricity prices for consumers. A drastic reduction in the value of an asset or a reduction in the viability of an asset makes it very difficult, given that the owners of the power stations are now or soon will be looking to refinance their loans. I am sorry to say that the Gillard government's destructive carbon tax casts a long shadow over the subject matter of this bill before the House today. What good is an ongoing energy market reform when the government is simultaneously engaged in energy market sabotage?


Earlier I mentioned the failure of this government to deliver the long overdue energy white paper. This is an astounding failure of government responsibilities given that, under the normal five yearly cycle, an updated energy white paper was due two years ago, in 2009. I know this all too well because I was the minister who actually delivered the last white paper, on time, in 2004. It is important not to underestimate the significance of the failure of the Labor Party to deliver in this area. While we all know the Labor Party loves a good review and cannot resist the temptation to set up another committee to compile another report, the energy white paper is a profoundly significant document. It is not just a piece of paper and it is not just a review; it is a framework for the direction of Australia's entire suite of energy policies. 


Given how reliant our economy is on the energy industry and how fundamental questions of energy security are for every single home and business in Australia, the significance of the energy white paper cannot be overstated. At the moment, this government is forcing energy companies, investors, generators and suppliers to make long-term investment decisions in the absence of any updated guiding principles. 


What the Labor Party has not been short on is excuses as to why the white paper has yet to materialise. We have had claims that the CPRS process had to be completed, then there was the uncertainty created by the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, aided and abetted by the current Prime Minister, to back down on the then ETS proposal. That was followed by the current Prime Minister's ironclad assertion that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Now we have an increasingly desperate sales pitch for a toxic carbon tax, which I understand from members opposite is creating some real nightmares for them in their constituencies.


The energy industry cannot wait for the Labor Party to get its policy chaos in order. We need an energy white paper now. I know the Minister for Resources and Energy will have heard this time and time again from industry representatives but, that said, I implore him once again to do all in his power to get the government's house in order and to release the energy white paper.


In conclusion, the coalition supports this largely procedural bill to complete the process of energy market reform, which began in 2002. It is now the Labor government's clear responsibility to continue to take this policy area seriously. 


The Rudd and Gillard governments have a very chequered history when it comes to dealing with the energy and resources sector. The carbon tax, the mineral tax, the lack of a white paper, their comprehensive list of policy missteps and letdowns, new taxes and changes of direction have shaken investor confidence to the absolute core.  


The energy industry needs two things. It needs the confidence of knowing where the reforms are going and the confidence of knowing that its investments are safe. At the moment, it has neither. All it sees, almost at every turn, is policy chaos and new taxes which affect parts of the sector. In 2008, it saw changes to the condensate rules in Western Australia, then the CPRS, then the MRRT, then not the CPRS and now the carbon tax. All these send a message to overseas investors that Australia is not the investment place it used to be. That will have one consequence: despite these reforms, which the coalition are supporting, there will be a reluctance to make the big, long-term investments in Australia which we need to ensure that not only do we have reliable electricity and a supply that industry can rely on but we have a long-term prospect of lower than world average electricity prices, because that has been our competitive edge. That has been the reason that we have seen so many high-energy investments in Australia.


Whether it is the smelter in Bell Bay—close to Deputy Speaker Sidebottom's electorate—nickel refineries, aluminium refineries, copper refineries, the heavy industry that backs up the resource sector or the manufacturing sector, they all rely on one thing: an internationally competitive energy price. These reforms are there to try to provide that. The carbon tax, in particular, will destroy it. It will catapult our electricity prices into a region that simply makes us uncompetitive.


The reason the coalition are keen to support these reforms is that we want to do everything we can—in the face of the disaster, chaos and policy coming from the government—to keep energy prices down for industry. We want to keep energy prices down for households. We want people to be able to afford basic energy needs. We will wait and see what will happen as a result of these reforms and whether this government has the courage to commit itself to a white paper and continue the process. We hope so.


We hope in that haze that the government can give a modicum of confidence not only for to the refinancing process that the energy sector has to go through, particularly in the next two years, but also for the investment in the energy sector that we all need. Until that chaos ends and until that confidence is restored, we will not have significant confidence in Australia's future economic growth—and the energy sector with it. Until that chaos ends the true gains of energy market reform will not be realised.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (16:22):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. This bill represents the final major step in the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 energy market review.


In my former life I was a legal practitioner in network industries Primarily I was in telecommunications, but I must say that I found few aspects of competition and regulation in network industries more complex than in the gas and electricity segments. I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge Gilbert and Tobin, my former employers, for everything I learnt and their continuing expertise on a group level and as individuals. Their practice is indeed without peer in this area.


In June 2001, the Council of Australian Governments recognised that the effective operation of an open and competitive national energy market would contribute to improved economic performance and would deliver benefits to households, small business and industry, including in regional areas. Very significant and important reform around the economic regulation of energy markets covering electricity and gas transmission and distribution has taken place since that time.


The reform that has occurred includes the establishment of the Ministerial Council on Energy to provide national oversight and coordination of energy policy development and a national energy policy framework to guide future energy policy decision making by jurisdictions and to provide increased policy certainty of energy users and for the energy sector itself. The Australian Energy Market Commission has been established as the maker and administrator of the rules under which electricity and gas distribution and transmission businesses operate. The Australian Energy Regulator, a division of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, investigates potential breaches of the rules and is otherwise responsible for the enforcement of the rules.


The focus of earlier reforms has been on the economic regulation of gas and electricity networks in the states and territories participating in the national market. These networks now operate in a national regime, administered by national bodies. This approach has facilitated consistent decision making, and the detailed rules that govern the economic regulation of the energy networks have provided greater certainty to stakeholders in relation to both the regulatory processes and the likely outcomes of those processes. In particular, for businesses operating in more than one jurisdiction, the move to a single rule administrator and rule enforcer responsible for the economic regulation of energy networks has significantly reduced the regulatory burden that was previously faced with dealing with multiple regulators applying sometimes very different regulatory regimes. The reforms with respect to the establishment of a national framework for the economic regulation of the gas and electricity markets in the participating jurisdictions are now complete. The final step that is necessary to realise the vision of a truly national approach to energy regulation is to elevate the non-economic regulation of energy services to the national level, and it is the shift from the jurisdictional based approach to our national approach to the non-economic regulation of energy that is the focus of this bill. 


Earlier this year the South Australian parliament passed legislation that establishes the framework for the national regulation of the non-price aspects of gas and electricity retail and distribution activities. Important elements of this framework include the Australian Energy Market Commission as the rule maker with respect to these non-price aspects and the Australian Energy Regulator as the relevant regulator and enforcement body. This government has a central role in facilitating the conferral of relevant powers and functions on these national bodies. 


The regulatory package that is created by the South Australian legislation includes the national energy retail law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that law which are referred to as the national energy retail rules and the national energy retail regulations. The objective of the national energy retail law is to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy. These issues are of critical importance to all consumers of energy. The national energy retail law, together with the national energy retail rules, will deliver important outcomes for residential and business consumers alike. 


Specifically in relation to residential customers, the national energy retail law and the national energy retail rules provide for standard retail contracts to be established by designated retailers. The designated retailer is obliged to make a standing offer applicable to the customer. The prices associated with a standard offer must be published on the retailer's website. The national energy retail law also sets out the manner in which the standard offer prices may be varied. The national energy retail rules set out model terms and conditions for standard retail contracts, and retailers are required to adopt those model terms and conditions with only those alterations that are permitted or required under law or the rules. 


The national energy retail law and rules provide greater scope for the negotiation of contracts between retailers and business customers. For business customers that consume energy at business premises below the upper consumption threshold, the customer and the retailer may negotiate and enter into a market retail contract for the provision of energy to the customer as well as the provision of other services. The rules set out some minimum requirements that the market retail contracts are required to meet to ensure the protection of this particular class of customers. These requirements include that a market retail contract must set out all the tariffs and charges payable by the customers and the circumstances in which the contract will terminate. In order to provide guidance to retailers as to the presentation of standard offer prices and market offer prices, the Australian Energy Regulator is also given the powers under the national energy retail law to make and amend retail pricing information guidelines. The guidelines may specify the manner and form in which details of standing offer prices and market offer prices are to be presented when publishing or advertising those prices. The disclosure regime around prices set up under the national energy retail law is designed to assist small customers to consider and compare standing offer prices and market offer prices offered by retailers. 


The national energy retail law also sets out important safeguards for consumers in terms of customer hardship policies. The national energy retail law requires retailers to develop these policies and submit them to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval. The Australian Energy Regulator has the power to direct the retailer to review the policy and make variations in accordance with the requirements it sets out. A retailer is required to vary the policy in accordance with those requirements and to submit it for approval and to publish the policy after it has been approved by the regulator, and it must also maintain and implement their customer hardship policy. The national energy retail law sets out minimum requirements for such a policy, including processes to identify residential customers experiencing payment difficulties as a consequence of hardship, flexible payment options and processes to identify appropriate government concession programs and financial counselling services and to notify hardship customers of their availability. Pursuant to the rules, a retailer will be required to inform a hardship customer of the retailer's customer hardship policy.


The National Energy Retail Law and rules also deal with the important subject of energy marketing. The law provides for the development of rules for, or with respect to, the carrying out of energy marketing activities. The rules set out the minimum information that a retail marketer is required to provide to small customers, such as information that includes all applicable prices, charges, early termination payments and penalties. The rules also provide for the establishment by retailers of a no-contact list, being a list of customers who have indicated they do not wish to be contacted by mail or in person by the retailer.


The relationship between distributors and end users of energy is usefully clarified under the National Energy Retail Law and rules and will become the subject of a consistent regime across the participating jurisdictions. The rules provide certainty to customers in terms of connection to the electricity and gas distribution networks. The rules also contain model terms and conditions that, with permitted variations, will form the deemed standard connection contracts between distributors and customers.


Of relevance to the important issue of security of supply are the provisions in the National Energy Retail Law and rules which establish the retailer-of-last-resort scheme. The approach to dealing with the circumstance in which a retailer is unable to continue to supply energy to its customers is currently the subject of varied approaches across the jurisdictions. The National Energy Retail Law and the rules also set up a retailer-of-last-resort scheme, which will require the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that at all times there is one default retailer of last resort for each connection point in the case of electricity and for each distribution system in the case of gas. Additional retailers of last resort may also be registered in respect of connection points and distribution systems. The law gives the Australian Energy Regulator important powers to enable appropriate action where the regulator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any event, circumstance or matter that it has reason to believe may or will affect the continuity of supply to the customers of a retailer.


To the extent that the relevant jurisdictions enact relevant legislation, the Australian Energy Regulator will have the power under the National Energy Retail Law to develop and make available on the internet a price comparator. The purpose of the price comparator is to assist a small customer to compare the standing offer prices available to that customer and the market offer prices that are generally available to classes of small customers in the relevant jurisdiction.


In relation to large customers, the National Energy Retail Law recognises that it is appropriate to be less prescriptive and to provide more scope for commercial negotiations between large customers and retailers and distributors. However, the framework still provides for adequate oversight of these arrangements. For example, the law provides that a distributor may prepare and submit to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval one or more proposed forms of standing connection contracts applicable to one or more classes of large customers. The Australian Energy Regulator is required to approve a proposed form of standing connection contract if it is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the contract are fair and reasonable and comply with any applicable requirements of the energy laws. On approval, the proposed standard form connection contract becomes the deemed energy regulator approved standard connection contract for the relevant class of large customer or the distributor.


It will be clear from the matters that I have mentioned that the National Energy Retail Law deals with issues that are of importance to all consumers of energy, particularly individual households and small business, including certainty around the supply of energy, the transparency around prices and the terms and conditions of supply by retailers. It will also be apparent that bodies such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission are absolutely central to the implementation of a national approach to the retail regulation of energy service providers.


The National Energy Retail Law gives the Australian Energy Regulator an important role in protecting the interests of consumers, particularly in relation to standing offers required to be made available to small customers, including residential customers, approving customer hardship policies and ensuring continuity of supply through the retailer-of-last-resort scheme.


The Australian Energy Market Commission is also given important functions and powers under the National Energy Retail Law, primarily those relating to the making of rules regulating the provision of energy services to customers and the activities of persons involved in the sale and supply of energy to customers. Bringing the price and non-price regulation of all parts of the energy supply chain within the purview of the rules administered by the Australian Energy Market Commission and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator will reduce regulatory complexity, particularly for service providers operating in multiple jurisdictions in our national energy market. Reducing the regulatory burden and providing greater certainty around the circumstances in which distributors are required to deal with retailers will facilitate heightened levels of competition in the retail market and provide consumers with greater choice.


The Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill is an important part of the realisation of a national framework for energy regulation. The oversight of energy regulation by national bodies, in particular the Australian Energy Regulator, whose powers and functions are to be supported by appropriate investigative and enforcement powers, is crucial to the stability and overall performance of the national energy market. I am therefore a strong supporter of this bill.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:35):  I rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. It has been a long decade since June 2001 when COAG met and established the Ministerial Council on Energy. The whole purpose of establishing a ministerial council on energy was to reach this point. It has taken a decade. In 2002, the energy market review released its report entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market. The review proposed the establishment of:


A statutory National Energy Regulator should be established under a legislative approach agreed by COAG to be the independent energy regulator in all jurisdictions, interconnected or otherwise, and to encompass the energy-related regulatory roles of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the National Electricity Code Administrator and state and territory regulations.


It has taken a decade, because it was only on 9 March this year that the South Australian government finally passed its National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010. That bill received royal assent on 17 March, which was the enabling process for this bill to go ahead. The effect of this bill will require a transition period until 1 July 2012.


Why is this bill so important? As stated by the shadow minister for energy and resources, the member for Groom, having a competitive energy sector is key and critical to growing an economy. We need reliable, efficient, affordable, energy to grow our economy. We need security also. The one thing that is being undermined in the energy sector at the moment is confidence in investment. That is affecting the long-term security of the energy sector in Australia. There is nothing in Australia, no person and no business, that does not rely in one way, shape or form on energy. Each and every person could be positively benefited by this legislation, because the purpose of this legislation is to cut the red tape for retailers who operate across state borders, and who therefore have to operate under different sets of legislation and regulation. The ambition and the purpose behind this bill are to make sure that more retailers will enter the market and increase competition. Hopefully, as proven by experience, increased competition will reduce the cost of energy.


By way of background, while talking about electricity prices, since December 2007, just after the Rudd government was elected, electricity prices across Australia have increased by an average of 50 per cent and gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent. In addition to that, water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs, such as hospital, dental and pharmaceutical costs, have increased by an average of 20 per cent; education costs, such as school fees, have increased by an average of 24 per cent; and rent by an average of 21 per cent. The thing that flies in the face and makes it hypocritical in pursuing this bill, which the government supports, is the fact that the Gillard Labor government wants to introduce a carbon tax and a carbon tax will increase power bills by a minimum of 10 per cent in the first year alone, rising to over 20 per cent. 


Competition in the energy sector is what will drive and develop our economy. Putting cost burdens on and setting prices through a carbon tax will actually reduce competition. One of the key aspects in relation to our energy market in Australia is that most of the electrical generation is owned by state governments. As the shadow minister said, state governments have taken a hit on their bottom line with the devaluation of their assets and will find it increasingly difficult, as indeed will private existing energy generation, to seek further loans to upgrade. This is not good for the security of energy. In fact, competition will not be addressed by the imposition of a carbon tax. 


I agree with what the shadow minister said, that as of now, having the effect of this national energy retail law and the other bills associated with it, what we need to truly understand the energy requirements and needs in Australia is an energy white paper. It has been long talked about but it is much needed. If we want to give those in the private sector or indeed state government instruments any level of security in their investment, they need to have a clear understanding across a national market, national grid work, of what is required, what are the impediments, what are the opportunities. So I would encourage the government to take up the opportunity and spend taxpayers' money on an energy white paper, which would probably cost a lot less than the glossy coloured brochure that was distributed on the need for a carbon tax, after the Prime Minister promised that they would not spend taxpayers' funds on political advertising. But the need for the energy white paper is paramount to understand planning and investment and long-term energy security for our nation.


Price, as I have said, is a driver to our economy. You would think that by just driving up the price of electricity, which is the whole matrix of evaluation that has been incorporated in the establishment of this carbon tax, by increasing the cost of energy you would drive down consumption and therefore provide this great environmental benefit. I regret to inform you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that between 2000 and 2008 the cost of electricity in Australia across the board rose by 55.9 per cent. Yet over the same period consumption rose by 10 per cent, from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So with the great ambition of this Labor government to jack up energy prices to reduce consumption and save the world, I have got to say that the record over the past decade has not delivered that, so I fail to see where putting a price on carbon will deliver the outcomes. 


The coalition and Labor have the same targeted goal: five per cent by 2020. The problem is that the Labor government believes, along with the Greens, probably driven by the Greens, that the only way you can do it is by taxing and putting a price on things, instead of providing leadership example and direct investment, which would achieve the same outcome without cruelling Australian energy and cruelling the industry factor. In fact, there has been some benefit by investing in programs such as solar hot water systems and the like. I would like to quote from an article on 15 August by Brian Robins, who said:


An energy efficiency specialist with Ausgrid, Paul Myors, said: 'We have seen consumption falling by around 2 per cent a year for average household electricity use over the past four years. That goes against the long-term trend of a steady rise.


'It could be the global financial crisis - and rising tariffs is a factor. We are seeing the impact of energy efficiency,' he said, pointing to the move away from electric hot water systems, previously the main user of electricity in the home.


It is critical that investment in programs like that, carefully managed and financially viable, occurs. It is a pity that the minister is not here for this. I have just read a media release about the government having replaced solar hot water systems in the Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory with electric hot water systems, which shows the hypocrisy in their argument.


A lot of industries will be hurt by the introduction of a carbon tax. Industries require a competitive energy price, which is the purpose of this bill. Prior to the deregulation of the dairy industry I had one of the strongest dairy belts in New South Wales. I still have quite a number of dairy producers—in fact we have Oak, at Hexham, which still processes milk. But a release put out by the Australian Dairy Industry Council on 11 July, entitled 'Carbon tax to hurt dairy farmers' says:


The cost to dairy farming families of this carbon tax is estimated to be $5,000 - $7,000 per year. Electricity is a major component of dairy farming operating costs and this tax will have a severe, direct impact on dairy farmers.


Given that we export so much of our processed dairy product from this country, the carbon tax will affect not only the price of a litre of milk on the shelves, but now affect the export opportunities that are already being marred by the high Australian dollar.


It is not just the dairy industry that will be negatively impacted by a carbon tax. In a release dated 14 July, the Housing Industry Association says:


The residential building industry will be affected more than most.


It goes on to say:


Around 500 facility operators will be required to pay the new carbon tax. For everyone else, the tax will be embedded in the products they produce, such as electricity, gas and other fuels, and in the primary materials such as steel, glass, cement, bricks and aluminium. The cost will further increase progressively as they pass through the various manufacturing and fabrication faces.


This is a cumulative tax—it is an add on, add on, add on imposition of costs. What will it cost to build an average new home? According to the Housing Industry Association:


… an average new house and land package is due to the carbon tax will be between $5,000 and $6,000.


For those young people who are struggling—working hard and saving to build the great Australian dream—this puts their dream one further step away from reality, because they also going to suffer from there being fewer jobs. 


There will be massive job losses under this tax. In fact, on the tourism industry, which is part of my portfolio, the Tourism and Transport Forum said in its report on the carbon tax that 6,400 jobs will go in the tourism industry alone. That does not count the jobs that will be lost in the region I represent, in the coal industry, the aluminium industry and the energy industry, and in the indirect jobs that support those. So those young people struggling, working hard and saving to get the financial wherewithal to buy their home will have to pay another $5,000. And when they get in there, their electricity bills are going to be higher and their furnishings will cost more. This is not a good way of creating opportunity. 


One of the hidden aspects in relation to the carbon tax, and a reason we need a nationally regulated energy market to increase competition, is local government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may not be aware, as indeed other members may not be aware, that the energy bill for the street lights in the community is paid for by the council. In New South Wales, I am not sure about other states, councils have their rate increases capped by the state government. I will give an example: in discussions with Maitland council's mayor, Peter Blackmore, I discovered that the council's electricity bill is currently $1.8 million per year. If it goes up 10 per cent, that is an extra $180,000; if it goes up 20 per cent, that is $360,000. And they will not be able to recover that from ratepayers. Where is their compensation package? In fact, Glenn Wall, the former mayor of Dungog council, said in an email to me last week, 'I am duly concerned regarding the impacts on local government and our capacity to absorb increased taxation liabilities and utility and resource costs increase, which are also being capped by the New South Wales government.' He went on to say:


The only people again that will be impacted will be our communities. Councils do not have the capacity to generate any further income. The community cannot afford huge rate increases to cover these increases (this is also problematic in New South Wales due to rate capping.) So the only option available will be to reduce the level of service we provide to the community.


Service delivery by government is key; it is essential. As I said right at the very beginning, this has been a decade-long approach. It needs to be introduced but it does not need the impediment of a carbon tax. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:50):  I am pleased to contribute on the consideration of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. We arrive at this point today after a journey spanning two decades, a journey embarked upon in the 1990s when the Council of Australian Governments had the foresight to agree upon the need to establish a national electricity market. It was a key microeconomic reform of the 1990s and something that a former Labor government was involved in in conjunction with state Labor and Liberal governments at the time. In the time since the establishment of the market we have seen more dynamic pricing and breaking down of the old monopolies that existed in the sector and witnessed the entry of new companies, the creation of new jobs and the creation of a more customer responsive climate that has benefited both business and residential customers and that has helped deliver significant historical savings on business inputs.


COAG has maintained its commitment to this important microeconomic reform and I emphasise the point that both sides of politics have worked together to see reform work to the advantage of the nation, the economy and the community. In fact, the legislation that we debate here today is the last big part of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the recent 2002 energy market review paper Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.


The main aims of the bill that is before the Main Committee and that will be considered by the House include streamlining regulatory requirements, increasing efficiency by harmonising regulations and delivering best practice consumer protection. What I like about this bill is that it aims to deliver benefit to industry—to businesses within the sector—and, importantly, to consumers, which will balance that out. That is to be commended and I will reflect on this further in my contribution today.


The national energy retail law will provide energy consumers with a range of benefits, ensuring that they can access energy services on fair and reasonable terms. Over the longer term, the expected reduction in red tape that the national energy retail law facilitates will provide an efficiency boost in energy service delivery and foster greater competition, helping provide an environment that can deliver more competitive electricity prices and offers. This increase in competition will also see retail customers benefit from more choice in energy retailers and in the services that they offer. The bill recognises that energy is an essential service and therefore will give consumers stronger protections.


The bill makes structural changes to a number of existing acts, like the Australian Energy Market Act and the Competition and Consumer Act, in order to give the necessary powers to the Australian Energy Regulator, the Australian Competition Tribunal and the Federal Court. The national energy retail law will work hand in hand with our new Australian consumer law to provide small customers with a range of strong consumer protections. It will also see the entire energy supply chain from wholesale markets to transmission and distribution networks through to retail markets brought under one regulatory umbrella via the Australian Energy Regulator. This is a significant improvement, especially considering the enormous level of state based regulation applied to the sector. Embedded within the legislation is a national energy retail objective to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and supply security; and, importantly, it will guarantee access for all small customers to an offer of supply of energy. It will set out mandatory minimum terms and conditions for retail contracts for all small customers and set up a framework for customers wishing to connect to new gas and electricity networks, including the installation of solar photovoltaic systems for the export of energy to the grid, and that will become something of greater prominence in the years ahead as more people seek to engage in that form of activity. 


I reflected earlier on the way this legislation seeks to balance the interests of all those affected or working within the sector, and as much as the legislation is designed to help businesses operating in the sector nationally, it is mindful of the needs of consumers across the country. One area I was heartened to see some focus on was the way in which energy suppliers deal with customers experiencing difficulties paying bills. This legislation will require retailers to develop a customer hardship policy which will need to be approved by the Australian Energy Regulator and which must contain a range of programs to help residential customers experiencing longer term financial difficulties. The hardship regime includes protections for vulnerable customers, including a prohibition on the charging of late payment fees, which has been controversial in their implementation and operation; a ban on requiring a security deposit; and a requirement on retailers to allow payment by using Centrepay. Beyond this there will be limitations on the disconnection of customers—which I think a lot of people, particularly in hardship situations, will welcome—including distinct processes to follow, restrictions on when a disconnection may occur, additional protections for customers experiencing hardship or difficulty, and a prohibition on disconnecting premises particularly where life support equipment is required. 


Another feature to emerge from changes within the sector has been the rise of door-to-door sales techniques designed to encourage customers to switch energy suppliers by signing new contracts for energy from a rival supplier to the one they currently use. While some consumers have welcomed the chance to change suppliers and lock in savings and get better service, others have felt pressured to sign the contracts. They have felt overawed by the complexity of the contract wording or they have had difficulties in exiting contracts where they feel that the contracts themselves have not lived up to the expectations promised in the actual negotiation phase. Energy marketing rules that build on the requirements set out in the Australian Consumer Law will ensure energy consumers receive full information before they enter into an energy contract, be it for electricity or gas or both. Importantly, the bill will hold retailers accountable for marketing that is conducted on their behalf. Again, I think that it an important learning that has emerged out of the process of change that has occurred, particularly through the course of the last decade.


The Australian Energy Regulator will develop a price comparator website like the ones currently available for health and car insurance so that customers will be able to compare retail offers put before them, and, where they need to be accessed, consumers will be able to resolve disputes with energy businesses through a consistent approach across jurisdictions. Retailers and distributors will be required to handle customer complaints in accordance with published procedure, which must be consistent with the applicable Australian Standard. Given that a lot of retailers are operating across state boundaries, it is important to be able to set in place a consistent set of arrangements as they apply to customer complaint resolution. If the customer is not satisfied with how the retailer or the distributor has handled the complaint, obviously they can refer the matter to the energy Ombudsman in their state or territory. 


On this point, as much as we have seen improvements in the way that the sector has responded to customer need, we also know that they can perform better. One only needs to refer to the workloads of Energy and Water Ombudsman operations to know that consumers are not backward in coming forward about poor service. Some of the matters I remarked upon earlier form a healthy part of the day-to-day work of the ombudsmen as they operate in different states. I am mindful, in particular, of reference to the Energy and Water Ombudsman in New South Wales, who has got a healthy workload, particularly if you look at the latest stats that have been put out, which span from October 2010 to March 2011. They do remark that over the course of four years complaints about retailers have increased or continued to increase. A lot of them revolve around billing issues—for example, disputed accounts. The number of consumers complaining about debt collection or credit default listings because of a high utility debt has increased. Also, in terms of retail competition, complaints about marketers misleading or pressuring consumers continue to increase. That, as I have said and reflected on earlier, is what has been looked at through the course of this legislation and what is intended to be introduced through the course of the work of the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that there are standards that exist across the nation so that, regardless of where consumers live, they can have some sort of protection and some sort of ability to resolve disputes. The legislation itself establishes a strong national regime to protect, as I have said, customers, particularly in the event that a retailer fails, and I would draw attention to the fact that there are provisions for a retailer of last resort. Of themselves these arrangements are not exceptional—they have been in place as a result of state based retail deregulation—but it is important to deliver a degree of consistency about the application and operation of retailer of last resort arrangements, especially when one considers how critical they will be in providing continuity of service in the event of a company being unable to continue in operation.


Services and protections such as the ones that I have reflected upon in the contribution in the Main Committee today will become increasingly important in the face of a rise in electricity prices that is occurring in states and territories, and it is our responsibility to enshrine them now to assist those that may be vulnerable. I will just leave my remarks at that, and I do commend the legislation to the Main Committee and welcome the fact that, as remarked upon earlier, we have now a national energy or electricity market and we have operators that are moving across state boundaries. There are opportunities now for businesses to participate in this sector in a way that 20 years ago they would not have imagined. As much as this seeks to liberate a lot of those companies from needless regulation or conditions that do not necessarily benefit consumers or those industries—or those businesses, I should say—it also puts in place a strong consumer protection regime. I note that the minister is present. Again I commend the fact that the legislation does seek to balance out the industry interests along with those of consumers. Thank you.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:02):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011, and I am pleased to follow the member for Chifley, who has significant experience working in both the energy sector and the communications sector, both networked industries. I note that there are a growing number of members of parliament with experience working in the networked industries. I do not think that is a coincidence, because across the broad sector of networked industries there has been a program of deregulation, competition and liberalisation for some 20 years, and that has led to growth, to opportunities and, I would argue, to the increasing importance of those sectors within the national economy. That is a good thing, and I argue that it is also a good thing that people with experience working in those sectors are now serving in the national parliament.


The bill that is before us is part of the long-term program to reform the national energy market. Its effect is to amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 so that that amended act will apply the National Energy Retail Law, the law which is set out in the South Australian act of 2011, which itemises the specific provisions of that law. It forms part of the cooperative Commonwealth, state and territory regime to regulate the non-economic distribution and retail regulation of gas and energy. The National Energy Retail Law has this to say as a statement of its objectives:


The objective of this law is to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply.


In its operations, this bill confers key powers on the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Regulator. The Australian Energy Market Commission is the national rule-making and development body in electricity and gas. The Australian Energy Regulator regulates electricity and gas transmission and distribution and, included within that, pricing.


The provisions of this bill are in one sense procedural, but they are important nevertheless in facilitating the nationally consistent application of the National Energy Retail Law and National Energy Retail Rules. They represent yet a further stage in the implementation of a set of measures that goes back to a process initiated by the Council of Australian Governments' 2002 energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.


In the brief time available to me I want to make three key points. Firstly, as I have already indicated, these reforms are part of the broader competition reform process in Australia, which began some 20 years ago and has played out over that period. Energy is clearly one of the most important sectors where reform has occurred. I secondly want to highlight the tensions between that reform process and the Gillard government's stated policy in relation to the carbon tax. And also I want to highlight some inconsistencies with developments in another parallel market, which is telecommunications. 


Let me start by talking about the broad competition reform process, which in many ways goes back to the Hilmer review reporting in 1993. That report noted that at that time:


Government businesses account for 10% of Australia's GDP, with rail, electricity, gas and water utilities alone accounting for nearly 5% of GDP. Improving the efficiency of these sectors remains a national priority. 


The report went on to say:


While there have been some encouraging improvements … progress is being made from a low base, and Australian public enterprise productivity levels remain well below international best practice. For important industries such as rail, electricity and telecommunications, most Australian enterprises are achieving only 75% or less of the productivity levels achieved elsewhere.


That therefore was the starting point in the early 1990s, when the Hilmer review reported. Triggered by that review and some other processes, we saw the carrying out of a reform process over a number of years in the gas and electricity sectors, as well as a whole range of other sectors. But in the gas and electricity sectors we saw the separation of a previously vertically integrated supply chain; the introduction of competition between generators and retailers; network elements become subject to access and price regulation; the creation of the national electricity market; and gas pipelines become subject to third-party access. 


Progress on this reform agenda was reviewed in 2002. If you go back and look at the 2002 review it does make some interesting reading, some nine years later. It opens with the observation that:


Australia is endowed with significant, diverse and high quality energy resources. Australia has approximately 800 years supply of easily accessible brown coal and 290 years supply of black coal. It has large natural gas resources in the North West, in Bass Strait and in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin … 


It also referred to good wind, hydro and solar resources. The report went on to note that:




… Australia’s electricity and gas prices—





this is speaking in 2002—





are close to the lowest in the developed world … for both major industrial and residential users.



And it made this observation, which I would suggest remains as timely today as it was in 2002: 


Energy is, therefore, a very significant strategic policy matter for the Australian economy. It underpins the competitiveness of our exported goods sector, is a vital ingredient for domestic industry, and it is a very important item in the monthly household expenditure budget.


A key objective of the program of the national competition reforms was to improve productivity. As Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, observed in a speech in 2000, talking about progress which had been achieved to that point, a key benefit of the reform agenda was to reduce prices. He had this to say:


The increased competition that has come with these reforms has also helped to ensure that the productivity improvements have benefited consumers, through consequent reductions in prices (and improvements in quality). For example:


households and industrial users have benefited from declines in real electricity prices in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent …


Declines in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent—how things have changed.


If we turn to the second point that I want to highlight, there is a real tension between this policy agenda—the bill before us today, which implements one of the components of that policy agenda—on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the direction that the Gillard government has been pursuing when it comes to carbon tax. We now have a government going deliberately and directly in the opposite direction from the one which was cited so approvingly by Gary Banks in 2000 and from the direction which underpins the competition reforms going back to the start of the 1990s. We saw, as I do not need to remind anybody in this House, a promise by the Prime Minister in 2010 that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, and of course we subsequently saw in February 2011 a complete reversal of direction.


What is significant about that, apart from the issues of integrity and trust, is that we have the Gillard government, in substance, reversing the policy direction which has been pursued in energy markets for many years. Since December 2007, electricity prices across Australia have risen by an average of 50 per cent and gas by an average of 30 per cent. What a stark contrast that is to the track record of improvements in competition and efficiency and reduction in prices in the 1990s which I cited earlier. Of course, what we can now expect is further sharp increases in electricity prices, stimulated in part by the carbon tax.




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, in accordance with the standing orders for the Main Committee, will the honourable member take a question with respect to the cause of the current increases in electricity prices?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Member for Bradfield, will you allow a question?




Mr FLETCHER:
  I am more than happy to take a question from the minister.




Mr Martin Ferguson:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the honourable member: does he accept the statements by the member for Groom reported in the Australian on 20 and 21 August last year, when he stated that power prices in Australia are likely to double in the next five to seven years regardless of who is in government? Does he also accept that in making those statements the member for Groom indicated that he recognised that, irrespective of who is in government, those electricity prices would occur because they are a result of requirements for investment across Australia to ensure that electricity supply reliability and security continue to meet community reliability standards—that is, relating to maintaining the existing distribution network?




Mr FLETCHER:
  I thank the minister for the question and the opportunity to answer it. The point that I would make in answering the question is that, in an environment where prices are expected to rise, it is extraordinary that you would then stick on a discretionary tax which is likely to increase prices by a further 20 per cent, and that is the consequence of this government's policy. That is why I say and we say on this side of the House that there has been a complete reversal in policy direction by this government.


The 2002 review which I cited earlier noted correctly that our low energy prices are a huge competitive advantage, and it is clearly therefore a matter of considerable concern that we have such a sharp and direct reversal in policy direction by this government. It is further concerning that a consequence of the carbon tax policies being pursued by this government is that there is a key negative effect on major sectors of energy generation. The New South Wales government, for example, estimates a $5 billion loss in the values of its black coal based generation assets. to So it is very hard to understand why it makes sense on the one hand to be pursuing a continuation of the energy market reform process while on the other hand introducing a completely separate policy which goes in the opposite direction.


The other thing that is very interesting in the 2002 review is that it highlights the importance of certainty in the regulatory regime applying to the energy sector for the purpose of encouraging investment. I cannot imagine that the authors of that review would have predicted a scenario in which a government would be elected in 2007 promising an emissions trading scheme, would in 2010 abandon that policy, would later in 2010 make a solemn promise to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax and then in February 2011 announce, capriciously and with no notice, that there would now be a carbon tax. The degree of uncertainty facing the industry has been ramped up beyond what might reasonably have been expected or predicted when this review was written in 2002.


The third point I want to make in the very brief time that remains to me is to highlight the difference, the contrast, between the reform agenda in energy and the way in which the reform agenda has gone wildly off track in the telecommunications sector. These are two networked industries with very considerable similarities. The regulatory frameworks are in many ways quite similar. Both were the subject of competition policy reforms throughout the 1990s. In the energy sector, the Gillard government is at least nominally continuing to implement the Howard government's reform agenda, albeit undermined, as I have noted, by its contrasting policy direction to do with the carbon tax. But it is very noteworthy that when it comes to telecommunications there has been a complete reversal of a reliance on competition. This government has effectively abandoned competition. Compare it to the electricity sector, where there has been a continued reliance on the existing assets in the sector rather than the government building new assets, where companies have been permitted to continue to operate based upon their current ownership structure rather than an effective policy of nationalisation, where existing players have been structurally separated through breaking up vertically integrated companies into generation, transmission and distribution as opposed to the spurious argument we hear in the telecommunications sector that the only way to achieve structural separation is to build a brand-new company at vast government expense. And where in the energy sector there has continued to be a commendable reliance on competition, the comparison is not a favourable one. I make the point that it is one of the many ways in which policy in these areas is rife with internal contradictions.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (17:17):  I thank the members for Groom, Paterson, Bradfield, Greenway and Chifley for their contributions to this debate. In closing, can I indicate that the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth play an important role facilitating the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments' cooperative legislative regime for regulating the relationship between energy retailers and their customers. This regime, I am pleased to report, is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the 2002 report in terms of energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.


By applying the National Energy Retail Law as Commonwealth law, this bill will help reduce the regulatory burden on energy retailers, open the market to greater competition and provide a strong suite of energy-specific consumer protections. This bill amends three Commonwealth acts. The Australian Energy Market Act 2004 is amended to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 of South Australia and the rules and regulations made under it as a law of the Commonwealth in Australia's offshore area. The Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal will have important roles in overseeing the proper operation of this legislative regime to ensure efficient and competitive outcomes in the energy market that protect the long-term interests of energy consumers. To this end, this bill amends the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to explicitly allow the new national energy retail law to confer relevant functions and powers and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies. Under the national energy retail law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses, except in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, will be undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator, bringing the whole energy supply chain under national regulation for the first time.


The Australian Energy Regulator will oversee a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions in a manner that will contribute to the achievement of the national energy retail objective. It will also have a number of new approval functions. The amendments to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 contained in this bill provide jurisdiction to the Federal Court to hear proceedings under the national energy retail law. This bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to ensure the administrative decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator under the national energy retail law are subject to appropriately rigorous judicial review.


In summary, the amendments in this bill represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator. This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy markets, while minimising the regulatory burden on industry.


Having dealt with the legislative nature of the bill, which is important, I will deal with some of the issues raised, principally in the contributions from the members for Groom, Paterson and Bradfield, about energy prices. Then I might go to a question raised by the member for Groom about the energy white paper, which is related to these proceedings. Let us be very clear about electricity prices. This is the question that the member for Bradfield refused to answer or acknowledge. The biggest cause of recent prices is increasing network charges, particularly for distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission, which collectively account for around 50 per cent of a household electricity bill. These problems confront all states and territories, irrespective of who is in government—be it a coalition government in New South Wales or a Labor government in Queensland. The changes are being driven by the substantial investment required in new and ageing network infrastructure. It is a fact of life. The investment is required to ensure the continued reliability of electricity supply that the community has come to expect. In essence, electricity is an essential service and the last thing the Australian community is going to accept from a state government of any political persuasion is shedding or blackouts. The reliability of the electricity supply underpins the operation of the Australian economy. I also indicate that some electricity networks are up to 40 to 55 years of age and are reaching the end of their useful life. There are therefore serious questions of reliability without that investment.


As a growing economy, our community's ever increasing expectations for the use of such things as air conditioners and widescreen televisions et cetera are part of a rising peak demand for electricity. This is largely caused, as I indicated, by the growing use of appliances such as air conditioners, which is placing additional pressure on the network. The size of the investment needed to meet these challenges varies across jurisdictions, but independent regulators recently authorised substantial expenditure by network businesses to carry out these upgrades, which obviously flow through to both industrial and household customer bills.


Let us be clear: these increases would also occur under a coalition government. There is no avoiding these increases in electricity prices. Perhaps the member for Flinders is not prepared to acknowledge that, as was the case on 7.30 on 24 May when he incorrectly and in a most dishonest way said that under a coalition government:


There will be no increase in electricity prices to consumers …


I contrast those comments with those of someone who has some understanding, the former minister for energy, the member for Groom, who understands the challenges faced by the electricity market. I referred earlier, in a question to the member for Bradfield, to comments made by the member for Groom on 20 and 21 August last year, the Friday before the election day and the election day. In the Australian he is reported very clearly as saying that power prices were likely to double in the next five to seven years regardless of who is in government. That represents the harsh reality of the situation before us. And these types of increases are being experienced under coalition premiers.


I refer to a range of comments by the Premier of Western Australia since he was elected only a matter of couple of years ago. He has had to front up to increases in electricity prices. This is reflected, for example, in a report in the West Australian of 9 February in which he said, 'The government has been increasing power prices as it seeks to overcome two decades of officially sanctioned caps on prices at a time when the cost of producing electricity has soared.' He then went on to say this in a statement on 15 February this year: 


Some of the hardest decisions have been those that have increased the cost of electricity, water and gas for West Australian households and businesses. ... The reality is that the cost of delivering electricity, gas and water to households and businesses throughout this vast, hot, dry state—


Sounds like Australia, not just Western Australia—


is an expensive business. In the case of electricity, the cost of providing power is still significantly above what people pay for it. The recent increases have been necessary to ‘catch up’, after some poor decisions in the past and years of no price rises.


Decisions made across the political spectrum, I might add. He went on to say:


It is important to note that even with the increases of the past two years, taxpayers still have to contribute to cover the gap.


In his budget speech of 2010, he also said, 'Moving towards ensuring charges reflect the true cost of delivering electricity is what this budget is about.'


It is about time that we had a little bit of honesty about what is driving the increase in electricity prices in Australia at the moment. Past generations built the network. Our responsibility is to maintain and extend the network in accordance with our demands. We have a growing economy. The demand for energy is increasing. We as a community not only expect reliability but we also expect the system to meet our peak energy requirements in a couple of weeks of the year. That effectively means that we need to build a system that is only used for a couple of weeks of the year. Our responsibility is to try and work out how to reduce that peak demand through improvements in energy efficiency. That is clearly part of the responsibility of the Ministerial Council on Energy and Resources. We need to work with industry and the community on those efficiency issues.


There was a serious question raised by the member for Groom. I respect his understanding of the challenges confronting Australia from an energy security point of view. One way or another, the debate about a price on carbon has to be resolved. The record shows that we as a community have lacked baseload investment for some considerable time. There are special challenges coming the way of Queensland and New South Wales. In New South Wales, it is fair to say that the last real baseload investments were under the Wran government. When it was elected on 2 May 1976, it inherited an unstable electricity system, which led to blackouts and real problems for industry and households. That government built ahead of its requirements in terms of the needs of the community at that time, and New South Wales lived off that for many decades.


Because of the uncertainty over a price on carbon, we have not had baseload investments for some time in coal-fired power in Australia. That raises ongoing issues over the next decade about where we go in terms of energy security. We have had growth in wind power. In more recent times, we have had a growth in solar PV, mainly because the price of solar PV manufactured imports has gone down. That growth has been assisted by a range of feed-in tariffs at a state and territory level, by governments of all political persuasions, and the introduction of the RET. In terms of reliability, the only real investment has been in peaking gas capacity. I might also say that in this transition, yes, there will be a growth in wind, a mature form of renewable energy, but there is also going to be a significant reliance on gas. The energy white paper was well underway in the last parliament. What derailed it was our inability as a community, in November 2009, to resolve the issue of a price on carbon. A price on carbon goes to the question of how you price the available energy options for Australia. Once this debate about where we go on a price on carbon is completed in this calendar year the work that is already underway and well advanced on the energy white paper will proceed to conclusion. All being well, a draft energy white paper will be released by Christmas for further debate and consideration by the broader community and finalisation in 2012.


The member for Groom is right to raise the need to resolve the issue of this energy white paper. I wanted to resolve it in the last parliament. You cannot resolve it without bringing to the debate the question of certainty about where we as a community are up to with a price on carbon. That is an important input in enabling us to consider the different energy options for Australia in the decades to come. So I, in a proper way, indicate to the member for Groom that the work is underway and that my desire is, with the support of the department, to conclude this work, which has been done in full consultation with industry, prior to Christmas this year. Then it will be released for public debate. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:32):  As Edmund Burke once famously wrote, 'All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.' However, Nancy Wake's life demonstrates that the famous quote should be rewritten and for all time remembered as: 'All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.'


Nancy Wake was born in Wellington in New Zealand in 1912. Nancy was the youngest of six children, and in 1914, when she was just two, her family moved to Sydney. At the age of 16, she left Sydney and travelled to New York, then later to London, where she trained as a journalist. In the 1930s she worked in Paris, where in 1937 she met a wealthy French industrialist, Henri Fiocca, whom she married on the eve of World War II.


Nancy could have escaped France and she could have gone to the relative safety of New York and seen the war out there, but instead she elected to stay and fight and to risk her life every day by taking on the Nazis, helping downed British pilots and Jewish families to escape. Through her efforts, by 1943 she was the Gestapo's most wanted person, with a five million franc price on her head. So she decided to relocate to Britain, where she joined the Special Operations Executive. On the night of 29 April 1944, she was parachuted back into France to join the resistance. A French resistance comrade said of Nancy Wake that, when fighting, she was like five men and she would kill the enemy with her bare hands. Immediately after the war, Nancy Wake learnt that the Gestapo had tortured her husband to death in 1943 for his refusing to disclose her whereabouts. 


Upon her return to Australia, Nancy joined the New South Wales Liberal Party, and we are proud to call her one of our own. Never one to run from a fight, Nancy Wake was the Liberal candidate for the Sydney seat of Barton in 1949—running against Dr Evatt, the Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs in the Chifley government. She needed a 16 per cent swing. While Chifley lost government to Robert Menzies, Wake recorded a 13 per cent swing against Evatt, with Evatt retaining the seat with a two-party preferred vote of 53.2 per cent. In 1951 Wake ran again. This time, Evatt was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Again the result was extremely close, however, Evatt retained the seat with a margin of fewer than 250 votes. As an example of the truism that the more things change, the more they stay the same, an article from page 2 of the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 April 1951, entitled 'Whispering Campaign: Liberal claim in Barton', reads:


Communists had associated with Dr. H. V. Evatt's campaign organisers to make the election fight for Barton electorate ""a filthy campaign,"" Mr. H. R. Mallard alleged yesterday.


Mr. Mallard is campaign director for Mrs. Nancy Wake, Liberal Party candidate opposing Dr. Evatt, who holds the Barton seat.


Mr. Mallard said opposition supporters had started a whispering campaign ""concocting all sorts of lying stories about Mrs. Wake.


""One is that she was chucked out of Legacy,"" he said. ""The truth is she resigned from Legacy last year.


""Another is she dealt on the blackmarket in France while serving with the French Underground Movement.


""Mrs. Wake certainly dealt on the blackmarket there. She had to because she had only two ration books—her husband's and her own—with which to feed 50 Allied airmen she was sheltering from the Nazis.""


In the 1966 election Wake was again preselected, for the seat of Kingsford Smith. Despite recording a swing of 6.9 per cent against the sitting Labor member, Daniel Curtin, she was again unsuccessful. Our parliament is the poorer for not having had Nancy Wake as a member. One can only imagine the contribution she would have made to our parliament and our society if she had had the opportunity to represent her area in the federal parliament.


Nancy Wake died on 7 August 2011, aged 98, at Kingston Hospital. We salute her bravery, her life, her selflessness and her service. She was a true hero in every sense of the word. We trust that the Nancy Wake story will continue to be told for generations, to serve as an inspiration to us all. May she rest in peace.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (17:37):  It is a curiosity of Australian history that such a genuinely towering figure as Nancy Wake is not as well known as she should be. This is a person whose history, story, contribution, energy and simple impact on history far outstrip that of anybody other than a very few number of Australians over the last century.


Nancy Wake was born in New Zealand, but came to Australia at the age of two. She fled at age 16 to New York and Europe. She became a correspondent in the Hearst empire. Most importantly, while in Europe she was motivated by the early signs she saw of what the Nazis were doing to the Jewish population. She could see creeping evil working its way across Germany and across Europe, and she vowed to stand against it. So during the Second World War, because of her marriage to a French industrialist, she became an agent of the Resistance. She fought heroically, as others have set out magnificently in both chambers of this parliament. She was an extraordinary leader, and the fact that a young Australian woman, living in France, could become the number one most wanted person on the Gestapo list says that this was an Australian who transcended all boundaries to be utterly vital and utterly effective for the French Resistance, which was critical in aiding Allied pilots who were shot down, critical for leading the French resistance movement, critical to defying of the German war movement and critical to providing a beachhead in the lead up to D-Day. This was about preparing the ground, preparing the way and being engaged in the fundamental activities that helped to break down and weaken the German front across France. This was freedom's front line in its absolute definition.


The life that she lived was a life well worth living. She lived it in her early days during the wartime years and then in the postwar years. For us, it is a great thing that she was a Liberal candidate in 1949 and 1951—coming close to defeating Evatt, who was the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in those two respective elections—and again in 1966. She achieved great swings on each of those three occasions as a candidate for the Liberal Party but fell just short. It was the parliament's loss that one of the really great but unsung figures of the last century in Australia never made it to this parliament. It was certainly the Liberal Party's loss, but it was the parliament's loss as well.


But we can reflect on a life well lived, in the best sense. It was a life of adventure. It was a life of opinion. It was a life that was willing to risk everything for the sake of something greater and it was a life of profound impact. We as a country are better for it. My one thought is that, strangely and curiously, we have not told her story properly. I hope that it is not just this short period of remembrance where her deeds are elevated again but that she becomes a part of the curriculum taught in Australian schools as an icon, an indicator and a role model of courage, integrity and simple chutzpah, as somebody who lived life as well as it could be lived. Vale Nancy Wake.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (17:39):  I rise to support the motion of condolence of the Prime Minister for the late Nancy Wake and, in doing so, associate myself with and support all of the eloquent remarks that have been made both in the House and in this Main Committee chamber. As earlier speakers have pointed out, Nancy Wake led an incredible life, a long life and a life that mattered at a point in international history where the choices between freedom and the terrible alternative were startling for her.


Previous speakers, from the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister through, have outlined in great detail her feats. Her main feat was courage in a critical situation. In doing what she did through World War II, risking her own life and taking what was clearly an instinctive decision that in the face of evil she would do something, no matter what the cost, she saved countless lives—and not just the lives of those in her immediate vicinity where she was working during her time with the underground. Critically, she was there risking her life in preparation for D-Day, as the previous speaker said, and the invasion of Normandy, which was to be the turning point in the European war that would drive the Nazis back and ultimately end that awful war in Europe. Each day Nancy Wake's life was at risk. She would have gone about her work thinking, I suspect, that her life would come to an end at some point. As the member for Hughes pointed out, she should be praised for taking risks—but an additional point is that she would have known the odds were that she would be caught and would suffer an awful fate.


As you would expect, in recent days there has been a great deal written about Nancy Wake. There has been a wonderful book written about her, which I have not read, but I have read some of the commentary in the papers. We have some great historians in Australia who have written about the exploits of Nancy Wake, and we can reflect on the richness of her life and her contributions. One of those commentaries that stuck out for me was written by one of the gallery journalists, Paul Daley, who has written a few books on World War I. He wrote about an assignment he had when he was in London—he was told to track down Nancy Wake to interview her, and to do it within one day. He pointed out in the article that he had to find Nancy Wake somewhere in London to interview her—I think she was into her early 90s at the time—and it dawned on him that he had to do in a day what the Gestapo was never able to do over the course of the war. I recommend that the member for Higgins and others read that comment that Paul Daley wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald Sunday edition a couple of weeks ago. He found her in a hospital near the hotel where she lived. She had aged but she had lost none of her spirit and none of her forthrightness.


It is no surprise that on Nancy Wake's return to Australia she sought to involve herself in public affairs. The story of this parliament in the years immediately after the Second World War is of people of both political persuasions, having served in that war and having sacrificed so much, wanting to come back and very much be a part of this parliament. It is no surprise at all, having fought so hard for the principles she believed in, having seen the sacrifice that people like her had made and having seen first-hand the atrocities in Europe, that coming back to Australia she would want to make her contribution in a democracy and in the federal parliament of Australia. She never quite got there, as we have heard. As some of my colleagues have said, maybe parliament was not suited to her—imagine what she would have been like in the party room! I think she would have been fantastic in the party room. It would have been another chapter in her history but I think we can all agree that few people have led lives like hers, with so many chapters and having done so much.


It is right that we honour her in this parliament today but it is also right that we teach her story—which is an Australian story—and that it be taught not just in schools but right throughout the country in the years to come, ensuring that in the decades ahead everyone knows the story of Nancy Wake.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:49):  During the winter recess Australia lost one of its greatest war heroes, Nancy Wake. Nancy died at the grand old age of 98 years, the world being a better place for her having been here. Many thousands of people lived due to her acts of courage, tenacity and sacrifice during the Second World War. Horrified by the acts of cruelty and injustice that she witnessed while a journalist in Europe, Nancy joined the French Resistance after Germany invaded France in 1940. A true inspiration, Nancy Wake embodied the Allied spirit, dedicated to freedom and democracy.


Nancy is of course one of the most decorated women of the Second World War. She received many awards, including: the George Medal; the 1939-45 Star; the France and Germany Star; the Defence Medal; the British War Medal 1939-45; the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur; the Croix de Guerre, with two Palms and a Star; the Medal of Freedom, with Bronze Palm; and the Medaille de la Resistance for her courageous endeavours. Australia, of course, finally recognised her achievements when they awarded her the Companion of the Order of Australia in 2004.


Nancy Wake was born in 1912 in Wellington, New Zealand, but moved to Sydney at the age of two, and we claim her as our own. The youngest of six children, at the age of 16 years Nancy left home to pursue a career as a nurse, before leaving Sydney shortly thereafter for Europe, where she became a journalist for the Hearst newspaper group. After witnessing some of the abhorrent acts carried out by the Nazis, Nancy Wake felt duty bound to join the war effort. As Nancy Wake herself recounted:


The stormtroopers had tied the Jewish people up to massive wheels. They were rolling the wheels along, and the stormtroopers were whipping the Jews. I stood there and thought, 'I don't know what I'll do about it, but if I can do anything one day, I'll do it.


She got that opportunity after Germany invaded France in 1940, shortly after she had married Henri Fiocca, a wealthy French industrialist.


Wake started her resistance activities by becoming a courier for the French Resistance. She then joined the escape network managed by Captain Ian Garrow. So successful was she at defeating and evading the Germans that the Gestapo dubbed her the 'White Mouse' for her ability to elude capture. By 1943, she had become one of the Gestapo's most wanted persons in France.


After Nancy's network was compromised she made her way to Britain where she received special training before parachuting back into France to build the French guerrilla forces, which she did, to over 7,000 strong. Wake remained and fought with the Marquis group until the end of the war. In Peter FitzSimon's seminal biography of Nancy Wake it was reported that, even though they were outnumbered three to one, under Nancy's leadership the Nazis suffered causalities in the order of 14 to one. Nancy's friend Henri Tardivat said of her, and I think this best sums her up:


She is the most feminine woman I know until the fighting starts. Then she is like five men.


After the war, Wake continued working for British intelligence in Europe until 1957. She then moved back to Australia where she married former British fighter pilot John Forward. Nancy stood for politics three times, each time for the Liberal Party. Sadly for the Liberal Party and the parliament, she was not successful. Her two attempts in the federal seat of Barton against Dr Evatt in 1949 and 1951 came very close, with only 250 votes in it on her second attempt. In 1966 she stood for the seat of Kingsford-Smith and, sadly, again was defeated.


She moved back to Britain in 2001, four years after the death of her second husband, and remained there for the rest of her life. Wake never regretted any of her involvement in the war or what she had to do in that war. She saw it as a just cause. She said:


In my opinion, the only good German was a dead German, and the deader, the better. I killed a lot of Germans, and I am only sorry I didn't kill more.


You can understand her sentiments when you realise what she witnessed and what she went through. In fact, she is very famous for having killed a Nazi sentry with her bare hands at the Gestapo headquarters in Montucon during a raid on a munitions factory. She also undertook a very dangerous solo mission to get new codes after her old codes were destroyed that required her to cycle on a bike, by herself, over 800 kilometres through many German checkpoints.


I think that Peter Wertheim, head of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, put it best when he said of Nancy:


She became resolved to fight Nazism after witnessing the shocking mistreatment of Jewish civilians by Nazi troops in Vienna.


In today's superficial world, obsessed with appearances and material concerns, Nancy Wake's example reminds us of the things that really matter in life. She demonstrated that one person standing up against monstrous evil can make a difference.


She was an amazing woman. Thank you, Nancy Wake, for making that difference for your country and for the world.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:54):  Other people will do a lot more justice when it comes to Nancy Wake's life, and I hope that we all read about her entirely. I like the fact that she left New Zealand at two years of age to come to Australia—if she had only moved to Queensland she could have been a real legend.


The thing that always strikes me when it comes to Nancy Wake's life is her bravery. To leave home at 16 and travel to Europe—who does that? No one does that. She inherited £200 and studied journalism in London and then became involved in the French Resistance. There are a couple of things I would like to say. First of all, she ran three times for parliament. Her war record will stand out for all time and she is truly one of the greatest people ever to draw breath. She ran for Parliament three times and in some ways you would think that for someone like Nancy Wake it is probably a good thing she did not get in. It takes a special person to put up with a lot of the stuff in here and people like Nancy Wake are very much at the cutting-edge. We all have our troubles at question time but can you imagine a speaker trying to put Nancy Wake in her place? It does not happen lightly. Someone like Nancy Wake has to be revered. Someone like Nancy Wake is not a person to sit there and listen. Someone like Nancy Wake is out there doing stuff, and out there leading.


I am old enough that when I was a kid I watched Vic Morrow in combat and played war games and read war comics. I know what it is like to play these games. You think to yourself what it would be like to be in a war. I am one of the lucky generation who were too young to go to Vietnam, and I have not been away to war. You think to yourself about bravery and what it takes to be brave. You think of what it must have been like in France in 1940 when the Germans came in. You think of what it must have been like to have your husband taken away from you, tortured and killed. You think of what it must have been like to be a mere slip of a girl—and she was a tiny girl—going around France working for the Resistance and showing true bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and at any time knowing that her life could be snuffed out.


I speak to my children about what it takes to be a grown-up. I speak to my nine-year-old son about what it is to be a man. I know it is paraphrasing to say 'Men do this, because you have to be straight-up when you're a ma,' but I talk to my daughters about what it is to be responsible. I talk to people at schools. So much more is expected of children now in year 12 than when we were in year 12. I often say to the kids when we are at a function that I would not have been there—I would have been out the back with a couple of mates having a cigarette. Kids today are so much more together than we ever were. I say to every child, to every girl, look for people like Nancy Wake to show you what is possible. There was this tiny little young girl, in 1940, running around France doing stuff that men were afraid to do, that everyone was afraid to do. She was a very special lady.


I told my son the Nancy Wake story and he said to use the Chuck Norris joke: that she was probably ready to die a few years earlier but death was too afraid to come to her; that she slept with the light on because darkness was afraid of Nancy Wake. Those sorts of things are what we should be saying about Nancy Wake. Her record will stand for itself. At last we recognised her, in 2004. To be honest, I had not been aware of her before 2004, so she was a well-kept secret. Vale, Nancy Wake. At last she gets her long-earned rest.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (17:58):  Nancy Grace Augusta Wake was born on 30 August 1912 and died on 7 August 2011, just a few weeks short of her 99th birthday. Nancy Wake is revered as one of Australia's greatest war heroes, serving on the Special Operations Executive of the French Resistance during World War II. Her efforts earned her a listing on the Nazi's most wanted list and the nickname the 'White Mouse', which the Gestapo attributed in recognition of her elusiveness. Like so many great Australians, Nancy Wake was born in New Zealand. Following the success of her father's journalistic career, the family of eight moved to Sydney and established themselves in the northern suburbs of Sydney, not far from the electorate of Bennelong. Nancy developed respect for the military service from an early age, attending the very first Anzac Day service at Martin Place and returning every year after. This was a different time—a time when Australia was still very much ensconced in the yoke of mother England. Just prior to World War I, future Australian Prime Minister Andrew Fisher declared that Australia would fight on Britain's side to the last man and the last shilling. Nancy was conscious and respectful of this reality. In Peter FitzSimons's wonderful book Nancy Wake: A Biography of Our Greatest War Heroine, Nancy states: 


That was simply the way it was.  I was brought up in a family where, although we were from New Zealand and living in Australia, we were of Great Britain and we were loyal to whoever was on the throne. It was never something we questioned.


Nancy had an adventurous spirit and was greatly influenced by Lucy Maud Montgomery's books, Anne of Green Gables and its sequel Anne of the Island, whose title character approached life with a level of enthusiasm uncommon for girls of that era. This spirit and imagination led to Nancy's strong desire to travel and explore the world. Nancy Wake trained as a nurse, then travelled to London to study journalism, becoming a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune in Paris where she first hand saw the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. In an ABC Radio interview in 1985, she said:


I saw the disagreeable things that he was doing to people, first of all to the Jews. I thought it was quite revolting.


In 1939, Nancy married a wealthy French industrialist and when war broke out they helped British airmen and Jewish families to escape the occupying German forces, in the process planning escape routes for thousands of Allied troops. Her activities and reputation grew and by 1943 the Nazis were directly targeting her capture, putting a 5 million franc bounty on her head. Her husband was captured, tortured and then executed for refusing to provide the Gestapo with any information about her activities or whereabouts. Nancy fled to Spain, carrying the guilt of her husband's death for the rest of her days. If it had not been for her, she mourned, he would have survived the war. 


Over the next few years, Nancy Wake trained as a special operations executive spy, parachuted into regions of France to organise the resistance, and facilitated ammunition deliveries and the establishment of radio links—all essential services in a war campaign. She helped to recruit an additional 3,000 fighters, nearly doubling the size of her force. She physically led fighters on guerrilla missions against German troops and installations, reportedly killing some soldiers with her bare hands and winning the respect of forces on both sides.


Stories abound of her selflessness and heroism to support the war effort. This was recognised by the post-war French who awarded her the Croix de Guerre and the Resistance Medal and later made her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. The British awarded her the George Medal, the Americans gave her the Medal of Freedom, yet, in a quirk of history, she received no formal recognition from her home country.


After the war, Nancy became bored with her desk-bound London existence and returned to Australia, deciding to try her hand in the far less noble world of politics. Showing great judgment and foresight she joined the New South Wales Liberal Party and quickly became a hero within a young party. She served on the party's state executive and stood at the historic 1949 federal election that brought Robert Menzies to power, choosing to battle Labor legend Doc Evatt in his home seat of Barton. It is said that after winning preselection she sent Dr Evatt a telegram reading:


Nancy Wake, Liberal candidate, parachuted into Barton tonight.


The 13 per cent swing that she garnered fell just short but she chose to challenge him again in 1951, this time falling short by only a few hundred votes. Never one to give up, Nancy contested the seat of Kingsford-Smith at the 1966 federal election, earning a seven per cent swing for the Liberal Party but again falling just short. Whilst Nancy was bitterly disappointed at her three losses, it must be remembered that she was no ordinary woman of the Liberal Party and, whilst I never had the pleasure of meeting Nancy, I am sure that there are some conservative ladies within current day Liberal branches who would find her brashness and brutal honesty quite confronting. When asked about this for her biography, she responded:


What did I care about trying to be a lady? After what I had been through the thought that I would worry about whether or not I wore stockings or a hat was completely ludicrous. If any of them ever wanted to chip me about it, I told them off in the strongest possible language.


The irony of going through the history of this legendary character is that she would have hated all of this fuss being made about her. A close friend of mine knew Nancy well, and when I asked what she would have thought about this speech the answer was a gin-soaked response: 'They're all talking bull-dust. Just shut up and have a drink!' Nancy was renowned for her straight talking and her plain speaking, and this never changed. She was incredibly brave, fun, happy-go-lucky, feisty and never ambiguous. When I asked this friend, who is far more eloquent than I, what the best way was to sum up Nancy, he simply said, 'She was a bloody good lady.'


It has been said several times already that Nancy enjoyed little more than a drink or three, and later in life she chose to sell her war medals in order to fund her lifestyle, being quoted at the time: 'There was no point in keeping them. I'll probably go to hell and they'd melt anyway.' When successive Australian governments offered her some belated recognition, she responded: 'If they gave this to me now it wouldn't be for love. They can stick their medals where the monkey sticks his nuts.' But she did have great respect and admiration for John Howard, who made time for a private meeting with her during one trip in London. As a result, in 2004 she accepted the Howard government's offer of recognition and was finally made a Companion of the Order of Australia.


Nancy Wake's life is an inspiration to all Australians and those across Europe, who have written with reverence since her death. I am informed that it was her wish that her ashes be scattered in central France, where she attacked the local Gestapo headquarters in 1944. I hope that in death her wishes can be recognised by her government in a timely fashion, in a way that perhaps her wishes during her life were not. There will never be another Nancy Wake. May she rest in peace.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-08-17,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:07):  I rise today to add my voice to everything that has been said before on Nancy Wake. I will not detail that remarkable life, because I think it has been detailed already and probably will be done so after me in great deal and probably more eloquently. I really would just like to make three points about Nancy's life. The first is how inspirational she is to young Australians through the fact that aged 16, in the1930s, she was prepared, with £200, to set sail to go to America and then Europe and start her life. To have such courage at such a young age and to have such vision to want to see the world at that time is, I think, an inspiration to all young Australians. As a 19-year-old, I headed off for my European adventure to work on a family farm. I know how much that took, as a single male in the eighties, going to countries where the languages were foreign. So for a single female, aged 16, to head first to the United States and then for Europe, shows courage and foresight beyond her age. I hope my daughters and all young Australian females and males look at her absolute courage in saying at age 16 that she was going off to see the world.


The second point that I would like to make is: what a true heroine she was. That she was on the Gestapo's 'most wanted' list, with a price of five million francs on her head shows how remarkable her war courage was. At a time when the Gestapo and their tactics were known to all—and it would have been known to Nancy what would have happened to her if she was caught—to continue the fight against the Nazis in the way that she did shows that the word 'heroine' truly fits this remarkable Australian. The third point I would like to mention is about why she acted as she did. We have already heard the quote, but I would like to give it again because I think it clearly indicates the type of woman that she was. It was made when she was offered a decoration. She said:


The last time there was a suggestion of that I told the government they could stick their medals where the monkey stuck his nuts. The thing is, if they gave me a medal now, it wouldn't be given with love, so I don't want anything from them.


That goes to the heart of why she did what she did. It was not because she sought fame; it was not because she sought recognition; she just had a strong belief that what she was doing was the right thing to do. Once again, especially for young Australians, she is an absolute inspiration in this regard. At this time when social media dominates the agenda of our youth, Nancy Wake stands as someone who can show us a way through this. It was not about seeking publicity or grandeur; for her it was all about believing in the cause and acting for that cause. As I have indicated, the bravery with which she acted was remarkable.


Also inspirational was the way she was prepared to put her hand up for the Liberal Party and take on Doc Evatt. She could potentially have found much easier options, but they were not for Nancy; she wanted to take on Doc. When she ran for the seat of Kingsford Smith, once again this was not an easy option but an incredibly difficult one. The swings that she achieved each time she stood are an indication of what the people thought of her. There is no doubt that at that time a woman running for political office would have had a fair few people voting against her just on the basis of her gender. The fact that she was able to achieve swings in those seats is remarkable in itself.


I conclude by saying: vale Nancy Wake—she was a true heroine.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2011-08-17,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (18:12):  I too would like to honour Nancy Wake. Nancy Wake was a truly exceptional Australian and one who deserves to be celebrated. Many of the things I will say have been said by other speakers tonight, but they bear repeating. This was a girl who was born in very humble circumstances in New Zealand in 1912. She came to Australia as a child of four and lived in Sydney in the tough days of the First World War. She was deserted by her father and had a fairly ordinary relationship with her mother. This led her to adopt a fairly independent lifestyle even when she was in her mid-teens. For a time she was a junior nurse at the hospital at Mudgee in New South Wales. Because of a bequest from an aunt, she was able to go to Europe. She fell in love with Europe and decided to become a journalist.


It was in her capacity as journalist that she found in the depths of her spirit an acute distaste for the Nazis. She was in Austria and she saw, following the Anschluss, how the Germans treated the Austrian Jews. She resolved that she would not be part of that but would do something about it. She became first a courier and later a member of the Resistance and still later again a spy. On her second encounter in Europe during the war she joined the SOE, the Special Operations Executive, and they were the best trained and the bravest of the brave. 


Very few books have had as much impact on me as the story of her life, The White Mouse. As other speakers have said tonight, the name 'white mouse' was the title given her by the Gestapo because she was always one step ahead of them, she was always on the move and she took on many daring tasks but never once was corralled. It is funny how the Germans call the early troops in the First World War the Old Contemptibles and they called our troops in North Africa the Desert Rats and then they called her a white mouse. All those titles live in legend. In her case, indeed it should. 


In the story of her life some remarkable events occurred. There were occasions of amazing courage and daring, flirting with people who could put a gun to her head and shoot her at any time, riding 700 kilometres across France until the tops of her legs were literally bleeding so that she could get some equipment to the Resistance. She became such a legend that the Germans closed in on her and she escaped via Spain to England. Sadly, her husband paid the price. He would not give her up to the Gestapo and he was summarily executed. She came back in 1943 ahead of the D-Day invasion to lead the Resistance and at one stage she led 7,000 men. It was truly remarkable activity. She was competent in the use of weapons and she was known to have killed one of the Germans with her bare hands. She was a formidable soldier. I think today we have a sort of ambivalence, Australians in particular and perhaps Anglo-Saxons in general, about letting our females fight on the front line. Quite frankly, I still believe that today, that they should not. Nevertheless, imagine what the resistance to people like her was at that stage. She was commanding 7,000 in France in the lead-up to D-Day.


Her remarkable feats during the Second World War led to her becoming the most decorated woman of the Second World War and certainly the most decorated Australian. She received the Legion of Honour, three Croix de Guerre, the George Medal and the American Medal of Freedom. That by any standards is a remarkable thing. The member for Bennelong rather graciously said that by quirk of fate she never received an Australian honour at that time. It was not a quirk of fate; it was plain bloody-mindedness and bureaucracy that denied the bravest Australian woman of the Second World War her just entitlement. Oh yes, they said, she fought in another army. She did not fight in the Australian forces. There were all sorts of excuses under the sun that were thrown up as to why she should not have an award. I have always found it extraordinary that the American President could grant the 3rd Battalion RAR after the Battle of Kapyong in Korea a presidential citation. The American President, in the immediate wake of the battle, granted our whole battalion his citation. Again, Lyndon B Johnson, after the Battle of Long Tan, granted D Company, 6RQR the same honour—the Presidential Citation—as did the Vietnamese government. Yet Nancy Wake, from her own country, did not receive a decoration until quite late in her life; following a visit from John Howard to see her, the Governor-General, Major General Jeffery, presented her with the Companion of the Order of Australia at Australia House in England in 2004. That was after slightly more than 60 years. Quite frankly, that was a disgrace. 


While on this condolence motion I am not anxious to add a fractious note, I feel compelled to, in one sense. I have been an unapologetic promoter of those who served so bravely at the Battle of Long Tan. And still to this day a number of them have not been properly honoured. I had the pleasure of putting the Star of Gallantry on the chest of Colonel Harry Smith, who was the commander as Major Harry Smith at Long Tan, just last year in Maryborough outside the Long Tan museum display. It was extraordinary that he would have to wait for over 40 years to have the DSO that he was originally recommended for granted. It is a disgrace. It is a blight on our country and it continues. His two lieutenants, Sabben and Kendall, had their awards upgraded to medals of gallantry, which is roughly the equivalent of the Military Cross. But there is still the commander of the carrier group that went in at Long Tan. 


As honourable members will know, 105 Australians and three New Zealanders faced 2½ thousand Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong in the rubber plantation at Long Tan. Eighteen of them died that day. It was one of the most incredible battles; they were outnumbered by over 20 to 1. And still, until this day, eight from D Company, two from A Company and one from the troop carriers—11 of them—have still not had their awards upgraded. Nine of them received only MIDs, mentioned in dispatches, which is almost an insult. These 11 unresolved awards burn in my psyche every Anzac Day, Long Tan Day,  Kapyong Day and Remembrance Day when I think of that injustice. 


It took us 60 years to recognise Nancy Wake—60 long years to recognise a hero who fought for the allied cause right at the front of the pack. Let us not make it another 60 years—it is 40 years now—for those 11 troops that still have not been properly acknowledged. Let us not treat them in the way we treated Nancy Wake. Nancy Wake, although New Zealand born, was certainly a great Australian, a courageous person, a person who loved life, a person who asked for her ashes to be distributed where she fought with her comrades in France, a truly remarkable woman. Rest in peace.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (19:18):  Not since Australia II won the America's Cup in 1983 has there been so much hype and excitement over an Australian sporting win on the international stage. Many Australians all over the world sat glued to their social media outlets to track Cadel Evans on his path to Tour de France glory. As a nation we are used to winning; it is something we do very well for a country of our size. Losing generally is not an option. The Tour de France was, however, a sporting achievement yet to be accomplished by an Australian. Put on a pedestal with the likes of cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, tennis ace Evonne Goolagong Cawley and swimmer Ian Thorpe, Cadel Evans has successfully put Australians ahead of the game in yet another global sporting triumph.


Over a gruelling three weeks cycling more than 3,600 kilometres through the Pyrenees, Cadel crossed the line wearing the yellow jersey in Grenoble to become the first-ever Australian to do so. The final ride into Paris was one of excitement and joy not only for Cadel, his team and his family but also for a nation which wanted him to succeed so badly and finally fulfil his dream of winning, arguably, the world's most arduous and toughest sporting event. After being runner-up in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the Tour de France, Evans' 2011 triumph is a massive moment for the sport in Australia. The victory makes the 34 year old the oldest winner of the tour in the 88 years since Frenchman Henri Pelissier finished on top in 1923. Such has been the dominance of Europeans at the tour, Evans is only the third champion to have come from outside the continent's clutches. Paving the way for future Australian wins, Cadel has been described as the inspiration to the next generation of Australian cyclists to match his mighty feats. If it is anything to go by, Australians do not like to hand back their trophies. Once the title is in our country, we like it to stay here.


Since Cadel's win in July cycling clubs have been popping up all over the country. The love for one of the original modes of transport is taking over the streets. Many fine cyclists hail from my home town of Wagga Wagga: Paul Fellows, junior world individual bronze medallist in South Africa in 2008; Jamie Green, who won silver in the team sprint at the junior world championships in Italy in 2010, and Max Housden, the current national team sprint champion—all outstanding track riders. Road racers Josh Collingwood, Bill Robertson and Ashley Humbert will also be inspired by Cadel's feat. It will be especially significant for Collingwood, who in 1995 was junior world champion, Cadel finishing third in that particular event. For long time Wagga Wagga cycling coaches Barry O'Hagan and Bob Robertson, Cadel's win raises the profile of the sport they love and to which they have dedicated much of their spare time. The whole cycling community comes to a standstill during the staging of the Tour de France. 


My electorate has its own version, the Tour de Riverina. This local race is a series of events held throughout my region bringing together some of the area's best and providing motivation and recognition for all competitors across the wonderful backdrop of the landscape that is the Riverina. Now in its ninth year, the Tour de Riverina has resulted in some exciting finishes, particularly those coincidentally in 2007 and 2008, when Cadel Evans went so close to winning the great French classic. Sport crosses all cultural, religious, age, gender and ethnic boundaries. It brings us together. Cadel Evans' Tour de France victory certainly united a nation. Well done to him.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (19:21):  In 1914, with the world on the brink of war, a Victorian named Don Kirkham teamed up with a friend, Ivan 'Snowy' Munro, to take the then very arduous task of travelling to Europe. But this was no ordinary trip: Kirkham and Snowy were the first-ever English-speaking competitors in one of the world's great sporting events, the Tour de France. From 143 starters in that year's race, only 54 finished, with Kirkham and Munro claiming 17th and 20th respectively. Not long after, the legendary Sir Hubert Opperman made the same journey, with 'Oppy' riding in 1928 to finish 12th and again in 1931, when he crossed the line in 18th position.


Those men inspired generations of cyclists. Fast-forward 50 years to Phil Anderson, known as Skippy in Europe, who became the first non-European to wear the leader's yellow jersey along the road in France. And fast-forward again to 2011, to last month, when a Victorian, born in the Northern Territory, became a national sporting hero and created worldwide headlines.


For the thousands that watched bleary-eyed on TV screens across the country through to the thousands that turned out in Melbourne last week to welcome Cadel Evans home, and the many who watched into the small hours, Cadel represents more than a wonderful Australian sporting victory. His win reached out to anyone who takes even a passing interest in bikes: from our phenomenally successful Cycling Australia elite athletes, to weekend warriors and kids on training wheels getting a push along down the driveway from mum or dad.


Cadel's win represented a number of milestones. Not only did he become the first Australian to win the tour, at 34 he was the oldest winner of the race in 88 years, something that may give my colleagues the members for Oxley and Parramatta—and perhaps even the Leader of the Opposition—something to aspire to. For those who saw those crucial stages of the race itself, sport doesn't get much more gripping—in the mountains, desperately hanging on under a fierce attack from his competitors, and then, in that final time trial, a picture of utter determination as, second by second, he wound back the lead of Andy Schleck. Then the final ride down the Champs Elysees, effectively a victory lap.


There is a tradition in the Tour de France known as the lanterne rouge. Translated literally as the red lantern, it is the moniker given to the rider finishing last in the tour. It is the person who never hits the headlines but one who is just as courageous as the winner. He shines a light along the road in order to see the way ahead.


For all the accolades Cadel has received, I am certain he would be the first to acknowledge that heroism stretches well beyond the peloton on the roads of France, and past the fields and courts on which our sporting idols ply their trade. To the everyday Australians carrying their own lanterne rouge, to the unsung heroes, champions from the fields of health, emergency services, law enforcement, environment and many more, Cadel's win in so many ways represents your achievements, encapsulating those very Australian traits of hard work, tenacity, staying in the race and simply giving it a red hot go. No one could fail to be inspired by those efforts of Cadel and other Australians in other fields.
