Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  I had commenced my speech yesterday on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill, so I am pleased to return to it today because there are other matters that I need to detail. 


Other problems have been identified during the inquiry that my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam initiated and these have also come out at the seven-week trial that was held into the technology at both Sydney and Melbourne airports. Almost half the people scanned in this trial had to undergo further searches after triggering the scanner alarm. The minister's department, the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, submission to the Senate inquiry, cited the common causes of what is triggering these many false alarms. We are finding out that anything from buckles, watches, hairclips, studs to zippers can result in false positives occurring with the alarms going off. 


The department conceded that the process proved slower than the currently used metal detectors, so, again, it comes back to: how do we ensure that the safety measures put in place for air travel actually work and do not result in a false sense of security? 


In the minister's closing speech in the House of Representatives he noted that aviation security screening in Australia must use non-ionising millimetre-wave technology and that X-ray technology, also often called ionising radiation, will not be allowed. It is good that he said that but, having recognised that there is a problem because, as we know, in Europe—for example, in France and Germany—ionising radiation scanners have been banned. Why has the minister left open in the bill the possibility of introducing screening technologies? This is unnecessary excess that the minister has not explained and it is why the Greens will move an amendment to rule out the use of ionising backscatter X-ray equipment. It needs to be in the legislation. It needs to be clear. The ban needs to be put in place. 


This was also a point that was included in the submission of the Australian airline pilots association. It is relevant to airport workers, pilots, cabin crew and frequent flyers who are going through these scanners on a regular basis. So, yes, the minister has said that they should not be used. Surely, we need to take the responsible step and ensure that it is in legislation that it will not occur. 


The minister also noted that images produced by a body scanner must only be a generic or stick-figure image that is gender neutral, does not identify the person and that the image is not stored. I acknowledge that, in terms of civil liberties, this is an improvement but it does not address the more fundamental right of people to opt out of the scan, if they so wish, on a myriad personal and privacy grounds well beyond medical reasons. Again, I put it to you to imagine being at an airport. You are waiting in a queue, and it is mandatory for this screening to be carried out. It could put some people in a very embarrassing situation. A woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer and has a breast prosthesis or somebody with a colostomy bag have to explain to a security person, a stranger, about their medical situation. That should not happen. They should have the option to opt out, and opt out means that they are then patted down. So the search is still undertaken. This is how it works in the United States. This is how we could improve this legislation. 


Documents released under freedom of information reveal that staff from the Office of Transport Security confirmed the machines would detect people who are wearing a prosthesis. This is a very real problem. It has been recognised by the Breast Cancer Network Australia. They have sent out alerts to their 70,000 members recommending that they carry a letter from their doctor and speak to security staff before passing through the body scanner to ensure discreet treatment.


It is worth clarifying here that breast implants would not be detected, but prosthetic breasts used by women who have had a mastectomy will be. Similarly, transgender people who use prosthetics could also be forced to undergo a scan and be put in an embarrassing situation. This can easily be handled in a respectful way by allowing the opt-out in favour of the patting down. Then people would not have to explain their personal situation; and, for privacy reasons, they should not have to. 


Many significant privacy concerns with the proposed use of the scanners were outlined to the Senate committee inquiry. The premise of the bill is that a person is taken to consent to an intrusive screening procedure whenever they present at a screening point at an airport. Many civil liberties groups put in submissions to the inquiry, even though it was a very rushed inquiry—only two weeks to get those submissions in—and many raised how that it is a gross and unnecessary incursion on people's rights to decline the scan and their right to object to the creation of the scanner image. 


We certainly acknowledge that the right to privacy is not an absolute. But it is a crucial part of the democratic process and it should not be compromised wholesale when there are acceptable ways to handle this issue of airport security, with a more layered response and without being absolute about scanners. The President of Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Michael Cope, said in their submission:


… people are being asked to undergo the equivalent of a strip search with a bag over their head. 


…   …   …


The fundamental question is whether the risk of being killed on in a terrorist attack, which is considerably less than that of dying crossing a road or falling off a ladder, justifies strip searching everyone who gets on a plane.


…   …   …


As one privacy expert put it if you are trying to stop bombers at the airport it's probably too late.


Mr Cope commented to the media that the government's decision to ensure that the image thrown up by a scan would be a stick figure rather than a person's naked body shape was a significant advance but still denied passengers the choice of a body frisk search.


The Chair of the Australian Privacy Foundation, Roger Clark, defended the rights of people to object to being scanned, noting that the bill went beyond allowing the introduction of one specific type of body scanner. He noted the rushed process for inquiry into the bill, saying that civil liberties groups had not been told in advance about the two-week parliamentary inquiry. He also noted the government's failure to complete a privacy impact assessment.


So it is disappointing again that Minister Albanese—and now we hear the coalition is working with them on this—is presenting this inadequate legislation. We could have worked together to get it right, to make sure that protections are in place and to make sure that the scanning equipment is reliable and is not going to throw up a large number of false negatives. 


Given that the government has already commenced the phase-in of these scanners, the Greens are putting up amendments, as I have mentioned, that would: ensure an opt-out provision remains—a frisk search—as an alternative to a full-body scan; rule out the use of ionising backscatter X-ray equipment rather than limiting it to certain circumstances prescribed by regulation; and ensure that any new technologies are rigorously assessed for compliance with health regulations prior to their introduction.


This security system has been proven to be slower and less effective than the current system. It has been proven to be unreliable, with a high percentage of triggered false alarms. It has been shown to slow down processing times at airport security checkpoints. It is an incursion on the civil liberties of many people who have good grounds on which to opt-out of the scan and request an alternative frisk search. The system also has public health implications which are not fully known, especially considering the possibility of introducing new scanner technologies in the future.


It is by no means certain that these significant drawbacks are outweighed by any increased measure of security compared with that provided by an opt-out regime. The Greens believe that the government should have heeded the community's concerns, the submissions to the inquiry and the recommendations of the Senate committee that addressed the serious privacy, civil liberties and public health concerns. As such, we do not support the bill in its current form and will argue strongly for the amendments. Thank you.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (09:42):  I rise to address the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. The bill implements a number of amendments to support the introduction of body scanners at Australian international airports. 


Specifically, section 41A is inserted and it assumes—this is an important differentiation—the very fact that somebody has arrived and wants to travel means that they have consented to a search, with the exception of a frisk search, which people can explicitly refuse to consent to.


It amends section 44, to deal with people who are not able to pass through a screening point, and it inserts a number of sections that list but do not limit the type of equipment that can be used for screening. I will touch on that a little later because I think that is an important point to be made during the second reading debate—the impacts of technology which may not currently be intended but could potentially cause harm if routinely used for all folk, particularly frequent flyers or aircrew. The bill also repeals section 95A, which removes the right of a person to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure. 


So why are we doing this? Ever since 9-11 we have been aware of the fact that aircraft can be used as weapons. Going right back to the seventies and various hijackings, we have seen that aircraft and air travel have been targets of various terror groups. The 2009 incident is probably the one that kicked this off: the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. A man who became known as 'the underwear bomber' managed to take explosives on board hidden in his underwear. Because the explosives were not metallic, none of the existing procedures picked them up. Had he successfully detonated the explosives, the plane, carrying 290 people, would have perished. 


So it is important in terms of protecting the travelling public and particularly providing them with the confidence to travel, which is a really important part of our economy. People's confidence to spend and people's confidence to travel go a long way to actually keeping things like our tourism industry, for example, viable as well as facilitating the safe and effective travel of people who need to move around our nation or indeed the globe for business or personal reasons.


There was a voluntary trial conducted in August and September of last year at Sydney and Melbourne airports in which some 20,000 scans were conducted in a three-week period to have a look at the efficacy of the machine but also the impact on the rate of clearance of people moving through. There have been two inquiries, one in the House and one in the Senate, looking into the scanning technology and its implementation. Of note also is the fact that in the US, even just recently, a similar device to that used in 2009 was detected, which shows that the threat is still extant. Even though it has taken us some years to go from that incident to now, the nonmetallic threat remains extant and so it is an important measure to continue with. The technology that has been proposed by the government is a millimetre-wave body scanner technology and the degree of exposure or risk to people is expected to be less than that of a mobile phone being used by someone else some metres away. So there is a low possibility and a low expectation that exposure to this kind of technology will be harmful to people. 


I think it is important to note that, given that one of the clauses that is being inserted here lists but is not exclusive to technology, it means that the other kind of technology, which is more of an X-ray or an ionising technology, could potentially be used. It is used in some other countries. That one does expose people to doses of radiation. I have particular concerns there for people such as aircrew, who frequently will be exposed to this, or even security staff at airports who need to move between the general public areas and those secure areas. I will discuss those a bit later. But in terms of this legislation currently we are talking about the body-scanning technology, which is millimetre-wave scanner.


One of the issues is that some people are concerned about the no-opt-out rule. I understand those concerns. There are many areas where people may feel uncomfortable about security provisions. My experience and my expectation is that, if people wish to travel and they wish to feel safe, they need to recognise that we do have a set of rules and regulations that will apply uniformly. The fact that somebody could have the opportunity to opt out other than for a clear physical or medical reason, or the fact that they are an infant or a child, opens up a huge hole in the whole purpose of having the technology. If somebody had something to hide and they were happy that they had placed it on their body in such a way that a frisk would not identify it then clearly they would choose to opt out. It would almost be pointless to have the technology investment in that if we allow people without good reason to opt out. So whilst I understand the concerns I am happy to support that provision.


The health impact is another concern people have raised. As I have said, the power density exposure for the technology that is being used is some several thousand times lower than that of a single mobile phone call. It is comparable to the passive exposure of a mobile phone being used several metres away. In fact, the US Transportation Security Administration has stated that the technology emits 10,000 times less radiofrequency energy than the average mobile phone call and the scans are well within the limits set by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency.


My concern there, however, is not only that people who have to frequently travel—again, aircrew, security staff at airports and to a certain extent even frequent fliers—are exposed to this radiation but also that if the technology were changed, as this legislation allows for, it would expose people to doses of radiation. Aircrew in particular, because they are operating at high altitudes frequently, already have ongoing health concerns with exposure to radiation in the atmosphere. This on top of that, I believe, is an issue that should be considered.


My belief is that we have systems in place through both the selection processes and the personnel management of the airlines, particularly Australian based airlines, and also the ASIC cards—the security cards issued by CASA—to make sure the people who need to be airside are appropriately vetted and checked. Certainly my contention is that, where we have confidence in the company—for example, Qantas or Virgin, Australian-based companies—and their aircrew as well as our own Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the ASIC process, we should have an exemption for aircrew, even under this legislation. Certainly were the technology to change I believe it would be essential that we trust the other mechanisms we have in place about the security considerations of those people who are crewing the aircraft.


At the end of the day, as 9-11 indicated, if people who are flying the aircraft have ill intent, it is not often because they are carrying a weapon on board; the aircraft is the weapon. So, given that the pilots are in control of what potentially could be a weapon, to scan them seems a little superfluous. Particularly in the light of the checks that they have already undergone, I believe this is one measure that could and should be implemented to make sure that we expedite the movement of people through those security points but that we are also addressing where the real threat is. I note, for example, that countries who have a high threat of hijack or terrorist incidents, such as Israel, do not actually use the same kind of technology. They have much more of a profile based approach to identifying threats and then dealing appropriately with people through questioning and other measures. Therefore, the reverse, those whom we have already seen vetted, trained and taken into a very strict system such as airline training and employment, should be able to pass without that kind of scrutiny.


Privacy concerns are another issue people have raised. I am satisfied from my reading of the explanation from the department that this particular device, unlike some overseas, will not record and transmit or store images of people. What is displayed and then discarded after the assessment is a cartoon like character which indicates if there is an object that is a source of alarm. Essentially, it is a generic cartoon character with an indication of where the issue is. That is not stored, it is not transmitted—nor is the underlying raw image. So I do not believe there are privacy concerns that need to be addressed.


The efficacy of the machines is another issue. In the Sydney and Melbourne trials, there were some 23,000 scans undertaken, and 57 per cent of the passengers were able to immediately proceed through security. But that is a higher alarm rate than walk-through metal detectors. People might say that is good, but it is picking things up like boots with buckles, loose coins, hairclips, watches and jewellery. So part of it comes down to better educating people about what they need to remove. We may end up with a situation you would be more likely to see in Heathrow, for example, where there is significant effort before people go through the scanner to advise them of the things that they need to remove from their pockets and place in trays. This would cut down on false alarms—the downside of which, obviously, is that there is a requirement then for follow-up, whether that is people emptying out their pockets or having further checks, which slows the rate of people facilitated through the security checks. 


So I believe we need to monitor the efficacy of the machines in terms of the genuine alarm and false alarm rates as well as the flow of people through the machines, hence my call to consider 'known passenger' programs where people submit themselves to early identification by security agencies in Australia or overseas such that their reason for movement, their background and their security are known upfront. I imagine most frequent flyers for business would be happy to participate in such a program. It also means that you could facilitate a large number of people far more rapidly through security than under the current approach, which assumes that everyone, even the pilot flying the aircraft, needs to be checked. There is a balance to be had there. Again, there is no such thing as zero risk; you are always balancing risk and probability. But profiling in other jurisdictions has been proved to have a high rate of success, and I believe voluntary engagement through something like a 'known traveller' program is a good way to address any residual concerns about the efficacy of the machines in terms of facilitation rates.


Another concern that has been raised is about implanted devices such as pacemakers et cetera. However, the machines have less radiation than a mobile phone, and implanted devices all have an EMC, an electromagnetic compatibility, to be able to work with radioactive devices such as mobile phones. Certainly, the department here and authorities overseas have indicated that there is no concern about implanted devices like pacemakers.


I do raise a concern. though about the context of the security. On one hand, we have legislation coming in and expenditure on things such as scanning machines, with no exception for people like pilots, who already have ASICs and have had security checks; but, on the other hand, those kind of exceptions are allowed in other areas of airports to which people have access. During estimates I have asked questions, and I have not received answers, about the access of people such as cleaners, caterers and even mechanics. My understanding from having worked in the industry is that many of these groups can simply scan themselves through a security point, as in swipe a card, enter the secure airside area with their vehicles and, without any personal checks or scans, even of their tool kits or cleaning equipment, access the aircraft. 


So, if we are concerned that there be no pathway for getting a weapon or an explosive device on board an aircraft and we are going to be bringing in legislation that has a no-opt-out provision and requires everyone, including pilots and cabin crew, to go through a scan every time they go on the aircraft, then surely common sense dictates that we should be applying a more even handed approach and making sure that everyone who has access to an aircraft has been through the appropriate clearance. If ground based people have access without that kind of process, what possible justification can there be for folks such as aircrew, who already have ASICs, to have to undergo a scan? My sense is that we need some additional provisions at the aircrew end to allow easier access and we probably need to tighten things up on the ground side to make sure that we have suitable security throughout the whole system.


The opposition are not going to oppose this bill, but I do maintain that we need to monitor the efficacy of the machines and the facilitation rates. If there is any attempt to introduce X-ray technology, we must make provision for aircrew and even frequent flyers with a 'known traveller' opt-in type program of security checks to be exempt from mandatory screening. We need to have appropriate security at all points of access to the secure area.


The government also needs to think carefully about how it is charging for these kinds of measures. We are increasingly seeing charges being levied on airports and therefore transferred to the airlines and hence to the passengers. There is something like a $40 million per year charge by airports to partly recover airport policing costs. But at the same time that we are concerned about the country's security the government is cutting funding to Customs. So, on one hand, we are seeing Customs and Quarantine reduce the number of cargo and baggage inspections and, on the other hand, we are seeing cost increases in areas such as this.


All of those costs have an impact on the viability of airlines' operations and on the attractiveness of Australia as a destination and, at a time when we have a strong dollar and we are seeing a lot of people travelling overseas in preference to holidaying in Australia because the exchange rate is good, a lot of our tourism operators here are really struggling. The more we put charges onto the airports—even things like the carbon tax—the harder the struggle becomes. It will cost Qantas some $110 million in 2012-13 and will add some $45 million to Virgin Australia's costs. So, by layering these costs upon the industry, we are making Australia a very unattractive place. I believe the government needs to take heed of its own words—for it is asking for productivity and to make Australia an attractive place to do business—and reconsider the cost that it is imposing on industry unnecessarily and indeed, in the case of the carbon tax, unnecessarily on the whole of the Australian economy.


The coalition will not be opposing this bill. We support the requirement for security, but my personal belief is that there are some things we could be doing better and some things we need to monitor carefully about the implementation of this legislation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-08-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:00):  I would like to indicate my support for the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 and for the proposed amendments by the Australian Greens. Can I say at the outset that I find myself agreeing substantially with what Senator Rhiannon said—that this bill could be giving a false sense of security, and I will go into those details further—and also with another considered contribution by Senator Fawcett in relation to the issue of airport security cards. I will refer to that briefly. 


What concerns me is that there is a bit of spin happening here. The government, the minister, said in the House of Representatives that this amendment bill will support the upcoming introduction of body scanners at Australia's international airports. He went on to say:


This will ensure that Australian travellers are afforded the highest level of protection against aviation terrorism, bringing Australia into line with countries such as the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.


But it is not so simple, for reasons I will refer to when I make reference to the case of Allan Kessing shortly. Security has come to define the way we travel. There is something about trusting your life to a metal tube thousands of feet in the air. Sadly, in these times we have learned to trust the metal tube more than we trust our fellow human beings. There is no doubt that we must make our transport systems, and particularly aviation, as safe as we can. I do not think anyone disagrees with the idea of sacrificing some of our time and patience to fly in safety.


The introduction of these scanners, and the measures included in the bill to ensure their safe and appropriate use, are a useful step. But we cannot become complacent. There are still serious issues with the integrity of the safety systems in place at our airports. In my home town of Adelaide, people have reported seeing passengers in the international terminal at Adelaide Airport having knives and other dangerous objects confiscated. This is after they have already gone through the standard scanning procedures in place at the terminal entry, effectively for domestic passengers. These basic procedures, including the current body and luggage scanners, have failed to pick up these dangerous objects, and they are only found in the more detailed security procedures undertaken in the international terminal. That is a cause for real concern.


It would be easy to say that at least they are being picked up, and this is true. But we should be aiming higher. It begs the question as to why there was an issue in the first place and why those dangerous objects were not picked up at the first point of scanning. I hope the scanners implemented through this bill will live up to their promises in this regard.


I have also been approached by a number of whistleblowers within airport security around Australia after my involvement with Mr Allan Kessing. In the early 2000s, Allan was part of the Air Border Security Unit within Customs, and he analysed a large amount of information relating to security that the organisation had accumulated. He produced two reports—erudite, articulate, comprehensive and forensic. As I recollect, those reports were prepared in 2002 and in 2003. The reports Mr Kessing prepared highlighted serious issues within Australia's border and airport security, including abuses of Customs regulations, theft, smuggling and systemic criminality. The reports were not released or actioned. What happened next is still under debate. Mr Kessing went to then shadow minister Albanese. Nothing appeared to come of this either. Months later, in a series of articles commencing in the Australian on 31 May 2005, the Australian published details from Mr Kessing's report. It was a front-page story by Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter headed 'Airport staff ""smuggling drugs"" secret Customs report exposes criminal links""' The article started off:


Workers at the nation's largest airport, including baggage handlers with high-level security clearances, have been involved in drug-smuggling and stealing from passengers, according to a classified Customs report that also suggests staff pose a terrorism threat.


There were a series of articles that exposed that. For instance, on the next day the Australian published an article, again by Martin Chulov and, in this case, Dennis Shanahan headed, 'Secret Customs report reveals major security breaches: drug convict on airport frontline'. The article starts off by saying:


A man who served eight years in prison for smuggling drugs into Australia is one of dozens of employees still working at Sydney Airport, despite his serious criminal record.


These were the matters that were raised in Mr Kessing's comprehensive and forensic reports. At first the then Howard government denied there were any such reports. Then there was what could be described as a backflip and, to the government's credit, they commissioned the Rt Hon. Sir John Wheeler, from the United Kingdom, an airport security expert, to conduct a review of airport security. That report was published and released to the public in September 2005 and was headed, An independent review of airport security and policing for the government of Australia.


The Wheeler report in effect endorsed Mr Kessing's reports. In effect it repeated its recommendations and it extended further substantial criticisms of airport security in this country. The report raised concerns about the lack of a mechanism to regularly draw together and assess the threat of crime and criminality at major airports, as well as a lack of reporting and a level of tolerance of theft at airports and cargo areas. So forgive me for being a bit cynical about the government saying that this is going to provide the highest levels of airport security. As Senator Rhiannon said, there is a concern that it will give us a false sense of security. It will not address the key issues that were quite rightly identified by Senator Fawcett in relation to airport security.


The Rt Hon. Sir John Wheeler stated in his report:


Intelligence material, particularly from Customs, confirmed significant threats and vulnerabilities at major airports that are consistent with the reporting by The Australian on 31 May and 1 June 2005 of the unauthorised release of a classified Customs staff-level assessment at Sydney Airport.


The report went on to describe policing at airports in Australia as 'inadequate and dysfunctional' and described security systems as 'typically uncoordinated'. It also pointed out serious flaws in the aviation security identification card, the ASIC system, where applicants with a pattern of criminality or with major criminal associations were potentially not denied access. At that time, there were 188 ASIC databases and authorising bodies around Australia. They were neither consistent nor linked. The review concluded that significant improvements:


… will require a changed culture of cooperation, sharing, and openness to new technologies and methods across Federal, State and private sector agencies and personnel, in order to replace the silos and insularity which continue to provide unnecessary weaknesses that could be exploited by criminals and terrorists.


The Howard government, to its credit, allocated well over $200 million towards the reforms recommended by the Rt Hon. Sir John Wheeler. There is a question as to the extent to which they have been implemented. I think it is fair to say that many of those recommendations have been implemented. Their effectiveness and monitoring is an issue for legitimate questioning at Senate estimates and through this parliament.


So the matter seemed to be settled at a public level, at least. But it is worth reflecting on a couple more recommendations by Sir John Wheeler. He said in his report that staff could be bribed to ignore criminality or paid large sums to assist in drug trafficking or theft. Once compromised, such employees may be unable to stand up to terrorists. Any airport staff who are not thoroughly background checked and routinely searched are potentially weak links. He went on to refer to the lack of cooperation between agencies. His report said:


The Review had great difficulty in obtaining comprehensive airport crime data … However, there is a culture of under-reporting and tolerance of theft at airports and related cargo areas …


That compromises people when there is a real threat of terrorism—because they have been compromised, they could be subject to blackmail. Sir John Wheeler said:


Policing at major airports in Australia is often inadequate and dysfunctional, and security systems are typically uncoordinated. The roots of this include bureaucratic turf protection and unresolved Commonwealth/State conflicts over resources.


It went on and on and on with recommendation after recommendation that indicated everything that Allan Kessing said in his reports and more.


Was Mr Kessing given an Order of Australia? Was he congratulated by Customs for writing these reports, which were hitherto suppressed? Was he praised in the parliament? No. Mr Kessing was charged with providing the information published in the Australian under section 70 of the Crimes Act, a charge that he denies. Having spent many hours with Mr Kessing, I believe absolutely in his innocence. He was not the person who released those reports to the Australian. Many others could have released those reports. He was not that person. I believe that. Mr Kessing has been unable to clear his name. He was convicted and given a suspended jail term. It has had a devastating impact on his life.


I have taken up Mr Kessing's cause for three reasons. Firstly, I absolutely and fundamentally believe he was not the one who leaked the report to the Australian and therefore he should not have been convicted—his conviction was an unsafe one. Secondly, I believe we need to stand up and protect people who seek to speak out where others would prefer to remain silent and let others take the fall. Thirdly, these reports, vindicated by the Wheeler review, were very much in the public interest. Mr Kessing should have been congratulated for preparing the reports. They should have seen the light of day much earlier than they did. There are serious doubts about the safety of Mr Kessing's conviction and that is why, as long as I am in this place, I will agitate for a full pardon for Mr Kessing.


Let's turn to this bill and the false sense of security it will provide us because of the unambiguous statements of the government. We cannot assume that introducing new scanners will solve all of the problems at Australia's airports, but I do welcome these changes. While I acknowledge that there have been steps taken to address these issues, including the introduction of airport police commanders to coordinate security matters in airports, we cannot assume that everything is now okay. But what is most worrying to me is that we might not even know what all of those problems are. We did not know what was happening before Mr Kessing's report was leaked, triggering the Wheeler review. So what is to say we know what is happening now? It is interesting that an article in the Fairfax media back in June 2009 was headlined 'ID cards and good intentions won't solve old problem'. It was an editorial in the Age that began:


It is time to overhaul security at Australia's docks and airports.


It continued:


At airports there are problems of inadequate screening of casual employees, nepotism and security camera blind spots. More than three years after the Wheeler inquiry found major problems at airports, it raises the question of what effective measures have been taken.


It went on to say:


What is also now apparent is that many hundreds of aviation and maritime workers with criminal records are being approved for security cards. Of 5764 applicants found to have a criminal record since last October, fewer than 200 were refused security cards.


That is a very serious issue. Before the government waxes lyrical about aviation scanners, which I welcome and support, how about dealing with those issues that appear to still be unresolved since Mr Kessing's reports of a decade ago and the Wheeler review back in 2005?


We need to encourage and protect whistleblowers who work within Customs and our airports to come forward. Unless we do that, we will not get the full picture. We can only know all the necessary details—all the loopholes and clauses and ins and outs—if we listen to the people on the ground. But these people will never speak out as long as their jobs and futures are in danger, because they will look to what happened to Allan Kessing. They will look at the shameful and disgusting way he was treated by the system.There are great opportunities for us if we care to take them, if we encourage and support those whistleblowers to come forward. We might have to shift our thinking a bit to try new things and come up with new ideas, but the outcomes will be better for us all if we encourage those whistle blowers to come forward. 


I wish to record my support for the proposed amendments put forward by the Australian Greens. These amendments are in line with the recommendations made by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee during their inquiry into the bill. So I would like to hear from both the government and the opposition why they appear not to support those amendments. The committee did its work, and Senate committees do a particularly outstanding job of analysing legislation, hearing evidence, hearing the facts and making recommendations to improve legislation. These amendments are straightforward and common sense and they will help the bill stay true to its intentions. I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides to support them.


This bill and the technology it introduces is an important step in improving our airport security but it is only part of the process. We need to heed what occurred to Mr Kessing. We need to heed his report and the Wheeler review and the fact that it appears those recommendations have not been carried out fully. Just because this is a big and visible step does not mean it is the only one we should take. It is important to be seen to be taking action, but sometimes the small things are the details which can have the biggest impact. The fact that there seem to be some serious problems with airport security cards is a real worry. 


I encourage the government to continue its reforms but also call on them to conduct greater consultation with people who work in the industry, to encourage whistleblowers to come forward and to heed the information on the ground, which can be the most valuable in deterring terrorists. If the government wants to be true to its word and true to its 2007 election manifesto, about looking out for Mr Kessing in particular, they can start by giving him a full and absolute pardon for his reports back in 2002 and 2003 and to overturn what many regard as a wrongful conviction.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:16):  All politicians who participated in the debate on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 should perhaps declare an interest in it because we, as a group of Australians, use airlines perhaps more than most other groups of Australians. We are very conscious of aircraft, airlines and air travel safety. Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, you are from the Northern Territory and would also experience this: each day you see more and more Australians on aeroplanes going to work, very often in their fluoro jackets and steelcapped boots, and so air travel in Australia is a very common exercise for a lot of people. That is why it is important that the government of the day continue to work towards maximum safety and security for all those who are travelling in aeroplanes. 


The security and safety of our transport system is a matter for the national government and a matter that the national government, using its funds collected from the taxpayer, should fund. Whilst I am gratified to see this further step forward, I take note of what Senator Xenophon has just said: that there are perhaps other things we could be doing. I digress by saying I was recently, as part of the defence subcommittee, with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in Adelaide. Of course I cannot say too much about what was happening there, but I can say how gratified I was to see the work that the DSTO is also doing on matters of airline safety. 


It is important that the Australian government and the Australian taxpayer take the maximum steps possible to secure the safety of our skies. That is why I am particularly concerned about the way this particular program has been implemented by a government that has shown itself to be quite incapable and inept at administering any program. I raise today the instance of the airport on Horn Island in the Torres Strait. Again as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, as one who travels widely in the more remote parts of Australia, using an aircraft to get to Horn Island and the Torres Strait is not a luxury; it is the only way you can get there. The costs of living on Thursday Island are notoriously high, obviously because of the transport costs into the area. The average cost of a return airfare from Cairns to Horn Island or Thursday Island is $623. The cheapest you can get this week is $540; the highest is $716. That is just to get from Cairns to Thursday Island. If you live on Thursday Island and you want to go to school or a doctor or visit relatives, you do not have the option of jumping in your car and driving there; you have got to go by air. There is only one airline operator—they provide a very good service, but it is not cheap. Double the price from Cairns to Thursday Island, and you could almost fly from Sydney to London return these days. I only mention that to show how very expensive it is to live on Thursday Island or the other islands in the Torres Strait. 


In addition to the normal extra costs of living in those parts of the world—and I cannot let this or any debate go by without emphasising this to a government which seems uncaring—you add the carbon tax to the price of airline fuel and other costs, and the cost of living for people living in that part of remote Australia is exacerbated. It increases exponentially beyond that for every other Australian, and every other Australian knows the impact that the toxic carbon tax is having on their cost of living. In the Torres Strait, it is even worse. On top of that, you then have the aviation transport security amendment, which has required Thursday Island airport at Horn Island to install this facility to screen everyone.


I say to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, again as a Northern Territorian, that you would know what I am talking about here. If you are worried about the security of Australia, I have to tell you that people getting on a plane in Horn Island are low priority. Thursday Island and the other Torres Strait Islands are just a few kilometres from another country, Papua New Guinea, where TB is rife and where there are different things—and let me say there is more than that—that come through the chain from PNG down through the islands into North Queensland and into a wider Australian operation. There are illegal immigrants looking at getting into Australia through those areas.


Whilst it is great to hear the government insisting that Horn Island gets its screening facility, at the same time they remove the only Navy patrol boat that was based on Thursday Island and which used to participate in it. I have had reports this last week that the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which is the eyes and ears of the Army in Northern Australia, has had its training areas cut back. I am told that the Customs facility, which used to be on Thursday Island in strength, has been decimated. They are the real issues. If the Gillard government is interested in the security of Australia then it should be actually increasing funding for those front-line security enhancements rather than insisting that Horn Island Airport install a screening facility to screen the people who move through that airport.


Again, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would understand the accuracy of this statement: most people on Horn Island, Thursday Island and the other Torres Strait Islands know everybody else. If there is a terrorist in the islands, most people would know about it fairly quickly. Most people at the airport know each other, and they know that when people come through in suits they are politicians from the south or public servants from Canberra—and a lot of them come through. 


The government has insisted—in its inimitable way of messing up the administration of any good policy—that this airport have this screening facility by 1 July 2012. I suspect that not many in this chamber have been through Horn Island Airport. It is part of my electorate in the state of Queensland; I go there regularly. I know Senator Boyce goes there quite a bit as well. I sure hope Senator McLucas does. I am disappointed that Senator McLucas, based in Cairns, has not been out there trying to help the people of the Torres Strait Islands on this particular issue. 


The Torres Strait Island airport, Horn Island Airport, is owned by the Torres Shire Council. It has to operate it as a commercial business. I am told that already, to help with the administration of that airport, the Torres Shire Council imposes a passenger movement charge of $27.50. That is just to make sure that it can continue to operate that essential facility. I repeat: to get in and out of the Torres Strait Islands, you have to go through that airport. There is no other way of getting there. Do you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, what that passenger movement charge of $27.50 imposed by the shire council has increased to since 1 July because of this screening facility? An additional $30. So, on top of the expensive airfare to get schoolchildren from the Torres Strait to Cairns and back, they now have to pay a $57 passenger movement charge; $30 of which has been imposed to pay for this facility.


To give credit where credit is due—if you call it credit; I am not quite sure that you would—when this was introduced, the government said: 'Yes, we will put in some money. We will put in $650,000 to help you buy the equipment.' Buying the equipment is okay, but in the Torres Strait you have to house it somewhere. The terminal is small and the council has said that it has to either add to its existing terminal or build a new terminal at a cost of $7 million or $8 million or $15 million; I forget what it was. Whatever it was, it does not matter, because it is way outside its financial capacity. This is a council, I might say, that has very few ratepayers; it has a lot of financial assistance grants but not much other income. So it has to either build a new terminal or add to its existing terminal to house this screening facility, for which the government generously gave it $650,000. 


That had to start from 1 July. The council had no chance from when it was advised this had to happen until 1 July of extending the existing airport or building a new air terminal to facilitate and house this screening equipment. So what did it have to do prior to 1 July? It had to build a new temporary facility at a cost of, I think, several hundred thousand dollars—and I think I am being light there. It had to build this new facility adjacent to the existing terminal. It got a couple of containers, cut them up, cemented them in and put in the screening facility. It is making people walk out of the terminal, through the tropical sun or rain, down the street and in through these containers, so they can be screened and then get on their aircraft and go to school or hospital in Cairns. 


Again, Mr Albanese, in the typical generosity of the Gillard government, announced a program providing $4.9 million in funding assistance to help various regional airports in accommodating this. Of that $4.9 million, the Torres Shire Council was allocated $460,000. 'Very generous', one might say? But it is on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So the government will put in $460,000, providing that the Torres Shire Council puts in $460,000, but that council does not have one cent to put into that $460,000. It is a council that looks after Thursday Island. As I say and I repeat, it has a limited rate base and a limited income base. It has no means of getting its part of the $460,000. So, even to look after the temporary facility, up go the charges to get out of the airport from $27.50 to $57.50.


The total cost of installing the screening facility, I am told, is $2.48 million. The initial $650,000 was provided by the government. If it were able to get the $460,000 that Mr Albanese has promised, provided it can match it dollar for dollar, the total funding would have been just over $1 million, leaving a shortfall of $1.141 million that somehow the Torres Strait shire council has got to find from somewhere. I would have thought that Senator McLucas, who claims an interest in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait, would have been jumping up and down until that council got some fairness and equity.


I have gone at some length to the figures as I understand them for the Horn Island Airport in the Torres Strait. Can I just emphasise that, whilst I relate specific figures in the specific locality, the same thing has happened everywhere across regional and remote Australia. It is a decision, again, of a government that has little interest in Australia beyond Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. It is all very well to put in these great enhancements, which the taxpayers as a whole should be paying for. It is good of the government to make air travel safer through screening. But please remember the pink batts. There is more to good policy than just announcing it; you actually have to implement it. If you are implementing it, you have got to understand that there are many Australians who already pay through the neck because they live in remote parts and this sort of policy that we are debating today means that this remote community is going to really get it in the neck financially.


I repeat myself again: in the Torres Strait there is no other way of getting in and out. A lot of Torres Strait children go to universities and schools in Townsville and Cairns because the same opportunities are not available in that part of remote Australia. It is a matter of necessity; it is not a matter of choice—they have got to go through that airport. The cost of living in the Torres Strait is already enormous. The carbon tax is going to exacerbate that. On top of that we have this great safety decision of the government to install this screening, but they leave it to the local shire council, which means the local people, to actually house it.


I see the minister taking some interest. Whilst I am, as usual, being political and emphasising the political points and the toxicity of the carbon tax, I do hope that the minister might at least investigate what I am saying and perhaps try to help those people in remote Australia. We all know that Torres Strait Islanders are not in the most wealthy quartile of the Australian population. There are a lot of public servants up there, but most of the locals work and earn an income, but not the sort of income that allows them to pay $716 just to fly down to the nearest place where there are senior hospitals, schools, boarding schools and universities. That is a cost of living. On top of that is the normal $27.50 passenger movement charge, because it is the council that runs the airport—nobody else—and then on top of that an additional bill of $30 per passenger to move through the airport to pay for this. I am told that some of the cost is being passed on to Qantas, which takes the air service there. But naturally Qantas is a business and you would expect it to do nothing other than pass whatever its additional cost is on to the passengers. So up go the airfares again.


I conclude by again saying, yes, we want security in our airlines and we do need transport security facilities. This is a step towards doing that, but it should be paid for by Australia as a whole. It should be paid for—could I suggest, rudely perhaps—by Canberra public servants paying their taxes, as well as every other Australian paying their taxes. It should not be lumbered onto the people of Torres Strait, who have a huge additional cost just to have this screening facility installed at Horn Island Airport. As I say, I hope the minister may, whilst rejecting my political rhetoric, at least have a look at the issues I raise and see if there is some way that the government can further assist places like the Torres Strait or other parts of regional Australia who are in real difficulties and have real unfairness thrust upon them by the implementation of what should be a very good policy initiative.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (10:36):  I thank senators for their comments in their contributions to the debate on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. The government are very concerned about ensuring that we are able to operate our airports with the highest level of safety possible and that the travelling public has the confidence that all actions have been taken to protect their safety while at the same time protecting their privacy and their health, and that is what this particular amendment bill seeks to do. The passage of the bill will help ensure the safety of the 13 million people who depart from Australia's international airports each year and, of course, optimise security for domestic travellers as well.


I have listened carefully to what has been said around the chamber, and there have been opportunities to canvass some of these issues, no doubt, through the committee stages of the bill. Senator Macdonald was at least gracious enough to acknowledge that his comments were political—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Some of them.




Senator KIM CARR:
  He did pursue a political line of argument, so we should not take everything he says at face value. But, in regard to the effects on Horn Island, I asked the officers from the department and from the minister's office to provide some information as to the cost of the screening. The policy is designed to cause as little impact as possible to business and, of course, to ensure that a safe and secure aviation system remains a No. 1 priority for the whole nation and not just for any particular airport but for the entire airport system. I am advised that the government has provided assistance to Horn Island Airport so it can comply with the aviation security requirements. The government has provided funding both for the purchase of the security equipment and to assist with the infrastructure modifications that are required for the installation of that equipment. That comes to a total of $1,110,000 for the Horn Island Airport.


The average cost of each body scanner, I am told, is $230,000. The Horn Island Airport received significant funding through the government for the expansion of its infrastructure in 2011. The government contributed funding of $4.65 million for the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; $340,000 for the Department of Infrastructure and Transport; and $100,000 for the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. That funding is in the context of each body scanner costing, as I said, $230,000. So there is quite clearly a significant discrepancy between the propositions that were put to this chamber today by Senator Macdonald and the amount of assistance that the government has provided to Horn Island.


I look forward to the swift passage of this bill. As many have indicated already, there are many other matters that need to be dealt with by this chamber.


Question agreed to.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:41):  I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7257:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 18), at the end of subsection 41A(2), add:


   ; or (c)   the procedure is a body scan and, as an alternative, the person chooses to undergo afrisk search.


The essence of this amendment is that airline passengers who are randomly selected for a body scan would be able to opt out and opt for an alternative screening method without having to provide any reasons, such as a medical certificate, a letter from a doctor or any other justification of their physical ability. The law currently allows for a person to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure, such as a body scan. It is worth remembering what the current law states:


If a person chooses to undergo a frisk search as an alternative to another screening procedure, a screening officer may frisk search the person to the extent necessary to screen the person properly.


That is what we could be about to lose. This is an important privacy provision, and it should be kept in the bill. It is relevant to repeat what Minister Albanese said in an interview on 9 February 2010. He stated:


… we'll be having full consultation and involvement with the Privacy Commissioner, with other organisations … including looking at health issues…


He did go on to say:


But we have a responsibility to use the best technology available.


But, as I said, he spoke about full consultation around the issue of privacy.


It is also interesting to look at the recommendations that came from the Senate committee inquiry. Yes, it was rushed, but the inquiry, made up of many senators here from the various parties, did consider the 16 submissions that came forward, heard from some witnesses and came forward with recommendations, including the important recommendation 1, which states:


The committee recommends that the use of frisk searches continue to be an alternative screening procedure at Australian international airports and, accordingly, that the bill not repeal section 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004.


Minister Carr, this recommendation was not accepted. Could you explain why that was the case, considering Minister Albanese gave a commitment that there would be consultation? Why wasn't this opt-out provision allowed to stand?

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (10:44):  So I do not have to repeat myself, I will speak to both Greens amendments (1) and (3), as the thrust of both is the opting-out provisions. This amendment seeks to retain the frisk search as an alternative screening procedure at international airports. I am advised that we want to emphasise that this is for international travellers. This is not for every domestic traveller; it is for international travellers. In response to the amendment specifically, I would like to assure members of the Senate that frisk searches will continue as an alternative screening procedure for any passenger who has a legitimate reason for why they cannot be screened with the new technology. Currently, passengers who are unable to pass through a walk-through metal detector because they have a pacemaker or are confined to a wheelchair, for instance, are able to have alternative security arrangements made.


These arrangements will not change with the introduction of body scanners. If a passenger is selected for a body scan and they have a medical or physical reason that prevents them from being scanned, they will be screened using a frisk search. However, the amendment bill will mean that a person selected for a body scan who does not have a legitimate reason why they cannot be screened by a body scanner will not have the option of choosing to undergo a frisk search instead. The reason for this is that the style of frisk search currently used at Australian airports simply cannot provide the same security outcome that the body scanners can. The only method of screening that could provide a similar security outcome to that of a body scanner is the type of invasive body search that is conducted overseas. The government remains resolute in not introducing invasive body searches as part of our airport security arrangements. As such, section 95A must be removed in order to close this loophole in which an individual with an intent to cause unlawful interference with aviation may opt out of the body scan and undergo a less comprehensive screening measure in order to avoid detection.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:46):  The coalition will not be supporting this. Having just come back from overseas, I have to be honest and say that the units that are used are far less confronting and invasive than having to be searched. At one stage I had to go through the indignity of the search and, to be honest, I would much prefer to stand in the booth.


The reason that everybody is going down this path is that some very bad people decided to fly a plane into a building and then to fly another plane into another building. They persisted in that, with breaches right up until Christmas Day in 2009. People have now gone to the next stage and are trying to take different liquids in different forms onto planes so as to create combustible materials. The result of this is that people die. Also, a pervasive sense of unease has come over international travel. People are not doing this because they want to; they are doing it because of the public demands that safety be paramount. If these issues were not there, we would not even need metal detectors, and there was a stage where we did not have them. This has been brought about because of the global circumstances in which we unfortunately live.


As stated, if there is a clear medical reason why someone cannot go through the scanner, they still are able to be searched. But I think this will become part and parcel of international travel, just as metal detectors are. We come into this building every day and we go through a form of security. If we had talked to people about it 10 to 15 years ago, they would not have comprehended it, but nobody actually blinks an eye at it now. We have to make sure that our duty is, first and foremost—as onerous as it may be in some instances—to the protection and security of the Australian travelling public and, second, to be part of the international effort in making sure we make the confines in which terrorists operate as narrow as possible and as marginal as possible.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:49):  Air travel safety clearly is a priority, and we have the responsibility to get that right. So many of the authorities in this area have identified what they often call a layered approach. One of the Greens' concerns is that, because of the way this bill is constructed, it can result in a false sense of security by putting so much emphasis on these full body scanners.


I note that Senator Joyce, both in his contribution to the bill and in his comments now, referred to his overseas visit. I understand that he went to the United States, but what he failed to share with us is that in the United States, as in Canada and in the Netherlands, they do use body scanners but they allow people to opt out in favour of a frisk search. So, again, that privacy issue is respected. They get the balance right and it certainly addresses some of the points that the minister made.


There has been a change here. It is correct, as the minister said, that people can request a frisk search, but they have to provide proof—they have to explain their circumstances. I put to my colleagues in this place the very unpleasant position that that can put many people in—people who may have a prosthetic body part for some reason. They would then have to explain that to a stranger, to a security person. I think that is wrong. I think there is a way that we can manage this—that is, by retaining section 95A. I want to ask the minister: did you consider recommendation 1 set out in the report of the inquiry? There was also a recommendation from the Australian Airline Pilots' Association along similar lines. Clearly they have a lot of experience in this area and have a lot vested in it, considering the day-to-day involvement of their members. I am interested in whether the government considered their recommendation:


That the Australian Government follow the lead of its counterparts in the United States of America and Europe and direct that screening of passengers using any active body scanning technology be conducted on a totally voluntary basis.


Were those two recommendations considered? If they were, why were they not acted on? If they were not considered, why was that?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (10:52):  I thank the senator for her question. I can indicate that the government has considered these alternatives and has rejected the approach that is being taken. I would ask you to consider the changes that have occurred in the Australian aviation industry in recent years and, in fact, in the international aviation industry. You would have to agree that there has been a very, very substantial response and success in securing the safety of the Australian and international aviation industries from attacks by terrorists. That is something I think we would all applaud. There is a basic civil and human right to be able to get on a plane and not be blown up. Frankly, 13 million Australians would look to that right to be enforced by governments and they would look to this parliament to enforce that right.


As to alternatives, it is suggested that we should look to the American airline system as an alternative to ours. It is the sort of thing people talk about until they actually experience the American airline system. I have found that people who complain about Qantas service do so until such time as they have experienced the American airline system. The US frisk searches in particular are notorious—absolutely notorious, Senator—for being very intrusive. I am advised that the American regulations actually require 'the running of the hand up the inside leg to the point of resistance'. That is the method by which they establish the security of their airline system. If you think that is an improvement, I suggest it is not an approach that the government could support.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:54):  Senator Joyce has indicated that the coalition will not be supporting this, and of course I support that position. I acknowledge that we are talking about international travel, but I say to the mover of the amendment that this is the first step. Perhaps it would lead to this occurring domestically. Could you then think what this might do to an airport like Horn Island in the Torres Strait? Perhaps Horn Island might even be considered an international airport; everyone is aware that a lot of PNG nationals come down through the Torres Strait from PNG, get on a plane in Cairns and travel elsewhere in Australia. Should it be introduced domestically, it is a cost that will be imposed on a small airport like Horn Island, run by the Torres Shire Council, which is struggling to even cope with the cost of installing the screening facility.


I emphasise to the minister that in my speech I did acknowledge that the government had funded, according to my figures, $1.338 million from various sources, but the total cost is $2.48 million. So there is a shortfall of $1.14-odd million that the Torres council has to try and find. It has already increased the passenger movement charge from $27.50 by another $30 per head. It just means that the costs of living in this remote part of Australia are going to be exacerbated. I acknowledged what your government and other governments have provided to the Torres Strait, but in relation to this particular facility there is this shortfall that the council, quite frankly, has no idea how it is going to fund.


In joining my colleague Senator Joyce in opposing this amendment, I repeat: if this were made mandatory around airports in Australia, how would an airport like Horn Island cope if every second passenger opted to have a frisk search instead of walking through the screening apparatus? It is just an additional burden. If Senator Rhiannon were ever successful in getting this implemented, I would hope that she would add as a rider to any implementation of a new system or arrangement that the additional costs involved in doing this be borne by the taxpayers as a whole rather than, in the case of Horn Island, by a very small group of people who are simply unable to afford even the screening facility that they are required implement now.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:57):  The issue of costs has been brought up, but what is more relevant here, if we want to talk about costs, is that that is actually one of the reasons the government has given for making this change. The minister has said that it would be more cost effective for the industry to force people to take a body scan than to offer the alternative of a frisk search. It really is not acceptable to justify removing an opt-out provision on the grounds that it is more costly to preserve people's civil liberties. Again, we could get it right here and it has been shown in many other jurisdictions how that can be done.


To comment briefly, I was obviously disappointed in the minister's comments. Considering the position the government has locked itself into, I would like to share with my colleagues a comment Civil Liberties Australia made to the inquiry. They argued:


… where freedom of choice is practical, it should be offered to Australians in all possible circumstances.


These principles were upheld by the Senate inquiry. I note the minister failed to answer my question regarding if and how the recommendations from the Senate inquiry and from the Australian Airline Pilots' Association submission were considered.


The evidence provided to the inquiry did not demonstrate that there will be a reduction in the level of security if the current arrangement for a frisk search as an alternative screening procedure is continued. That is the essence of it. We are here to ensure the safety of air travel and there is the expert evidence that it would not be compromised, so why is the government going down this path? That is a question that still has not been answered.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:00):  I move Greens amendment (2):


(2)   Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (after line 28), after subsection 44(3A), insert:


(3AA)   Body scanning equipment of a kind that has not previously been used for the screening of a person must not be used for the screening of a person unless equipment of that kind has been:


   (a)   tested for compliance with health standards prescribed by the regulations; and


   (b)   found to comply with those standards.


(3AB)   Body scanning equipment that uses ionising backscatter x-ray technology must not be used for the screening of a person other than in exceptional circumstances. If such equipment is to be used for the screening of a person, the regulations must set out what those exceptional circumstances are.


I will first deal with the first section, 3AA. In summary, this is that the government should ensure that the screening technology is thoroughly tested for compliance with health regulations. Interestingly, this was another of the Senate committee's recommendations that the government should ensure that all screening technology is thoroughly tested for compliance with health regulations—that was recommendation 3 from the inquiry.


The health concerns of this technology are very significant for frequent flyers, workers at airports, cabin crews and airline pilots. It is an issue that was also taken up strongly in the Australian Airline Pilots' Association's submission, which had a lot of useful information in it. They argued that for a large percentage of the travelling public, understandably, there would be minimal exposure to body scanning equipment and therefore minimal health risks; however, the health risk is exacerbated for that group that I have just mentioned: people who are working at airports and frequent flyers. These people, they state, could have higher exposure rates of between 200 and 400 times per year and possibly significantly higher. Crews have to change between aircraft, terminals, flights or domestic/international operations and could be screened multiple times during a single-duty period.


They also went on to argue that pilots and cabin crew should not be subject to body scanning as they have already undergone rigorous security assessments and have been issued with airport security identity cards. Pilots and cabin crew have these, and they argue that they should be entitled to work in and around aircraft as part of their normal duties, obviously with the identification being shown as required. Those provisions surely should be taken into account. 


Considering we are dealing with a very important health issue, I would like to ask the minister why they did not accept those recommendations, considering again, Minister Albanese, in that comment that I shared with members earlier from 2010, said there would be consultation on this very issue of the health impacts. What was the response to that recommendation?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (11:03):  The government has considered this approach. There has been extensive consultation, and the result of that consultation has meant that the government has chosen an alternative approach. It has considered these recommendations and rejected them. In terms of the specifics of this amendment, I will just indicate the government's attitude to these matters. I also understand that amendment (3) will be subsequently put and I have already indicated the government's opposition to it—or it is not proceeding? 




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Marshall
):  We have dealt with it. 




Senator KIM CARR:
  Amendment (3)?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Yes.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The amendment requires that all body scanning equipment be tested for compliance with health standards prescribed by regulations. That might sound reasonable enough on the surface of it and it should apply to health regulations. The amendment in fact is redundant, because that is exactly what this bill does: all screening equipment used in Australian airports must of course comply with Commonwealth and state and territory laws and regulations.


ARPANSA, the Department of Health and the Therapeutic Goods Administration have each given consideration to the introduction of the millimetre-wave body scanners. The only health related regulation that applies to the use of these devices is the ARPANSA standard 'Maximum exposure levels to radiofrequency fields—3 kHz to 300 gHz'. This is the amount of energy that is emitted by the millimetre-wave body scanner during a scan, which of course I might remind senators is thousands of times lower than the maximum permissible exposure level for the public, which is outlined in the ARPANSA standard itself. So it is simply unnecessary to replicate in the Aviation Transport Security Act a requirement to meet the standard that already exists. 


I wish to turn to the additional matter that is being raised through these amendments—that is amendment (2)(3AB), the particular types of technology that are being sought to be deployed. This amendment would seek to limit the use of ionising backscatter X-ray equipment for security screening to certain, clearly defined and exceptional circumstances. The government's view on this matter is that we can assure members of this chamber that the government has no intention of introducing body scanners that use ionising X-ray technology for aviation security screening. 


The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, in any event, is not the appropriate place for regulations of this type on the use of radiation technology. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 exists to protect the health and safety of people from the harmful effects of radiation. The Australian Radiation and Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency is charged with the responsibility of administering that act. Furthermore, each state and territory has its own legislation with regard to radiation protection so that any equipment that uses ionising radiation must be licensed for operation by either ARPANSA or the appropriate state and territory radiation authority.


ARPANSA, in connection with the state and territory radiation regulators, has formal mechanisms in place to ensure that any proposal to use ionising radiation on humans for non-medical purposes is fully justified before a licence is issued. The justification process is in fact rigorous and takes into account consideration of the benefits of the proposed activity versus the potential risks to human health. The justification is also assessed based on whether the same outcome can be achieved by an alternative form of technology. It is the government's view that the current radiation protection regulatory framework is robust, and it is there to ensure that the only equipment that meets the highest health and safety standards is in fact introduced. As such, any restriction of the type that is being proposed in this amendment would be unnecessary.

 (New South Wales) (11:11):  Thank you. Minister, I would be interested especially in the report that states that there are no cumulative impacts. If you could take it on notice to supply that report as well, please. 


I want to move on to 3AB, and ask the minister some questions about that. I am interested that the government says it has no intention of introducing the ionising radiation form of screening—and Senator Carr has reiterated this point that Minister Albanese has made on a number of occasions. If that is the case, why don't you support a ban on the use of ionising backscatter radiation equipment?


The European Union has banned the use of such scanners because of possible health risks. This is the opportunity to get it right, to get it into law and to get the ban in place. Backscatter scanners continue to be used in the US, but there at least passengers have the right to request a frisk search as an alternative. 


We have a ban in place in the European Union, and here the government is leaving the door open to this very dangerous technology being introduced. Again, that was a recommendation that came from the Australian pilots association. I would ask the minister what the government's response is to that recommendation and why the ban has not been included.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:41):  I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7257:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 18), at the end of subsection 41A(2), add:


   ; or (c)   the procedure is a body scan and, as an alternative, the person chooses to undergo afrisk search.


The essence of this amendment is that airline passengers who are randomly selected for a body scan would be able to opt out and opt for an alternative screening method without having to provide any reasons, such as a medical certificate, a letter from a doctor or any other justification of their physical ability. The law currently allows for a person to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure, such as a body scan. It is worth remembering what the current law states:


If a person chooses to undergo a frisk search as an alternative to another screening procedure, a screening officer may frisk search the person to the extent necessary to screen the person properly.


That is what we could be about to lose. This is an important privacy provision, and it should be kept in the bill. It is relevant to repeat what Minister Albanese said in an interview on 9 February 2010. He stated:


… we'll be having full consultation and involvement with the Privacy Commissioner, with other organisations … including looking at health issues…


He did go on to say:


But we have a responsibility to use the best technology available.


But, as I said, he spoke about full consultation around the issue of privacy.


It is also interesting to look at the recommendations that came from the Senate committee inquiry. Yes, it was rushed, but the inquiry, made up of many senators here from the various parties, did consider the 16 submissions that came forward, heard from some witnesses and came forward with recommendations, including the important recommendation 1, which states:


The committee recommends that the use of frisk searches continue to be an alternative screening procedure at Australian international airports and, accordingly, that the bill not repeal section 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004.


Minister Carr, this recommendation was not accepted. Could you explain why that was the case, considering Minister Albanese gave a commitment that there would be consultation? Why wasn't this opt-out provision allowed to stand?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (10:44):  So I do not have to repeat myself, I will speak to both Greens amendments (1) and (3), as the thrust of both is the opting-out provisions. This amendment seeks to retain the frisk search as an alternative screening procedure at international airports. I am advised that we want to emphasise that this is for international travellers. This is not for every domestic traveller; it is for international travellers. In response to the amendment specifically, I would like to assure members of the Senate that frisk searches will continue as an alternative screening procedure for any passenger who has a legitimate reason for why they cannot be screened with the new technology. Currently, passengers who are unable to pass through a walk-through metal detector because they have a pacemaker or are confined to a wheelchair, for instance, are able to have alternative security arrangements made.


These arrangements will not change with the introduction of body scanners. If a passenger is selected for a body scan and they have a medical or physical reason that prevents them from being scanned, they will be screened using a frisk search. However, the amendment bill will mean that a person selected for a body scan who does not have a legitimate reason why they cannot be screened by a body scanner will not have the option of choosing to undergo a frisk search instead. The reason for this is that the style of frisk search currently used at Australian airports simply cannot provide the same security outcome that the body scanners can. The only method of screening that could provide a similar security outcome to that of a body scanner is the type of invasive body search that is conducted overseas. The government remains resolute in not introducing invasive body searches as part of our airport security arrangements. As such, section 95A must be removed in order to close this loophole in which an individual with an intent to cause unlawful interference with aviation may opt out of the body scan and undergo a less comprehensive screening measure in order to avoid detection.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:46):  The coalition will not be supporting this. Having just come back from overseas, I have to be honest and say that the units that are used are far less confronting and invasive than having to be searched. At one stage I had to go through the indignity of the search and, to be honest, I would much prefer to stand in the booth.


The reason that everybody is going down this path is that some very bad people decided to fly a plane into a building and then to fly another plane into another building. They persisted in that, with breaches right up until Christmas Day in 2009. People have now gone to the next stage and are trying to take different liquids in different forms onto planes so as to create combustible materials. The result of this is that people die. Also, a pervasive sense of unease has come over international travel. People are not doing this because they want to; they are doing it because of the public demands that safety be paramount. If these issues were not there, we would not even need metal detectors, and there was a stage where we did not have them. This has been brought about because of the global circumstances in which we unfortunately live.


As stated, if there is a clear medical reason why someone cannot go through the scanner, they still are able to be searched. But I think this will become part and parcel of international travel, just as metal detectors are. We come into this building every day and we go through a form of security. If we had talked to people about it 10 to 15 years ago, they would not have comprehended it, but nobody actually blinks an eye at it now. We have to make sure that our duty is, first and foremost—as onerous as it may be in some instances—to the protection and security of the Australian travelling public and, second, to be part of the international effort in making sure we make the confines in which terrorists operate as narrow as possible and as marginal as possible.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:49):  Air travel safety clearly is a priority, and we have the responsibility to get that right. So many of the authorities in this area have identified what they often call a layered approach. One of the Greens' concerns is that, because of the way this bill is constructed, it can result in a false sense of security by putting so much emphasis on these full body scanners.


I note that Senator Joyce, both in his contribution to the bill and in his comments now, referred to his overseas visit. I understand that he went to the United States, but what he failed to share with us is that in the United States, as in Canada and in the Netherlands, they do use body scanners but they allow people to opt out in favour of a frisk search. So, again, that privacy issue is respected. They get the balance right and it certainly addresses some of the points that the minister made.


There has been a change here. It is correct, as the minister said, that people can request a frisk search, but they have to provide proof—they have to explain their circumstances. I put to my colleagues in this place the very unpleasant position that that can put many people in—people who may have a prosthetic body part for some reason. They would then have to explain that to a stranger, to a security person. I think that is wrong. I think there is a way that we can manage this—that is, by retaining section 95A. I want to ask the minister: did you consider recommendation 1 set out in the report of the inquiry? There was also a recommendation from the Australian Airline Pilots' Association along similar lines. Clearly they have a lot of experience in this area and have a lot vested in it, considering the day-to-day involvement of their members. I am interested in whether the government considered their recommendation:


That the Australian Government follow the lead of its counterparts in the United States of America and Europe and direct that screening of passengers using any active body scanning technology be conducted on a totally voluntary basis.


Were those two recommendations considered? If they were, why were they not acted on? If they were not considered, why was that?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (10:52):  I thank the senator for her question. I can indicate that the government has considered these alternatives and has rejected the approach that is being taken. I would ask you to consider the changes that have occurred in the Australian aviation industry in recent years and, in fact, in the international aviation industry. You would have to agree that there has been a very, very substantial response and success in securing the safety of the Australian and international aviation industries from attacks by terrorists. That is something I think we would all applaud. There is a basic civil and human right to be able to get on a plane and not be blown up. Frankly, 13 million Australians would look to that right to be enforced by governments and they would look to this parliament to enforce that right.


As to alternatives, it is suggested that we should look to the American airline system as an alternative to ours. It is the sort of thing people talk about until they actually experience the American airline system. I have found that people who complain about Qantas service do so until such time as they have experienced the American airline system. The US frisk searches in particular are notorious—absolutely notorious, Senator—for being very intrusive. I am advised that the American regulations actually require 'the running of the hand up the inside leg to the point of resistance'. That is the method by which they establish the security of their airline system. If you think that is an improvement, I suggest it is not an approach that the government could support.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:54):  Senator Joyce has indicated that the coalition will not be supporting this, and of course I support that position. I acknowledge that we are talking about international travel, but I say to the mover of the amendment that this is the first step. Perhaps it would lead to this occurring domestically. Could you then think what this might do to an airport like Horn Island in the Torres Strait? Perhaps Horn Island might even be considered an international airport; everyone is aware that a lot of PNG nationals come down through the Torres Strait from PNG, get on a plane in Cairns and travel elsewhere in Australia. Should it be introduced domestically, it is a cost that will be imposed on a small airport like Horn Island, run by the Torres Shire Council, which is struggling to even cope with the cost of installing the screening facility.


I emphasise to the minister that in my speech I did acknowledge that the government had funded, according to my figures, $1.338 million from various sources, but the total cost is $2.48 million. So there is a shortfall of $1.14-odd million that the Torres council has to try and find. It has already increased the passenger movement charge from $27.50 by another $30 per head. It just means that the costs of living in this remote part of Australia are going to be exacerbated. I acknowledged what your government and other governments have provided to the Torres Strait, but in relation to this particular facility there is this shortfall that the council, quite frankly, has no idea how it is going to fund.


In joining my colleague Senator Joyce in opposing this amendment, I repeat: if this were made mandatory around airports in Australia, how would an airport like Horn Island cope if every second passenger opted to have a frisk search instead of walking through the screening apparatus? It is just an additional burden. If Senator Rhiannon were ever successful in getting this implemented, I would hope that she would add as a rider to any implementation of a new system or arrangement that the additional costs involved in doing this be borne by the taxpayers as a whole rather than, in the case of Horn Island, by a very small group of people who are simply unable to afford even the screening facility that they are required implement now.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:57):  The issue of costs has been brought up, but what is more relevant here, if we want to talk about costs, is that that is actually one of the reasons the government has given for making this change. The minister has said that it would be more cost effective for the industry to force people to take a body scan than to offer the alternative of a frisk search. It really is not acceptable to justify removing an opt-out provision on the grounds that it is more costly to preserve people's civil liberties. Again, we could get it right here and it has been shown in many other jurisdictions how that can be done.


To comment briefly, I was obviously disappointed in the minister's comments. Considering the position the government has locked itself into, I would like to share with my colleagues a comment Civil Liberties Australia made to the inquiry. They argued:


… where freedom of choice is practical, it should be offered to Australians in all possible circumstances.


These principles were upheld by the Senate inquiry. I note the minister failed to answer my question regarding if and how the recommendations from the Senate inquiry and from the Australian Airline Pilots' Association submission were considered.


The evidence provided to the inquiry did not demonstrate that there will be a reduction in the level of security if the current arrangement for a frisk search as an alternative screening procedure is continued. That is the essence of it. We are here to ensure the safety of air travel and there is the expert evidence that it would not be compromised, so why is the government going down this path? That is a question that still has not been answered.

(2)   Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (after line 28), after subsection 44(3A), insert:


(3AA)   Body scanning equipment of a kind that has not previously been used for the screening of a person must not be used for the screening of a person unless equipment of that kind has been:


   (a)   tested for compliance with health standards prescribed by the regulations; and


   (b)   found to comply with those standards.


(3AB)   Body scanning equipment that uses ionising backscatter x-ray technology must not be used for the screening of a person other than in exceptional circumstances. If such equipment is to be used for the screening of a person, the regulations must set out what those exceptional circumstances are.


I will first deal with the first section, 3AA. In summary, this is that the government should ensure that the screening technology is thoroughly tested for compliance with health regulations. Interestingly, this was another of the Senate committee's recommendations that the government should ensure that all screening technology is thoroughly tested for compliance with health regulations—that was recommendation 3 from the inquiry.


The health concerns of this technology are very significant for frequent flyers, workers at airports, cabin crews and airline pilots. It is an issue that was also taken up strongly in the Australian Airline Pilots' Association's submission, which had a lot of useful information in it. They argued that for a large percentage of the travelling public, understandably, there would be minimal exposure to body scanning equipment and therefore minimal health risks; however, the health risk is exacerbated for that group that I have just mentioned: people who are working at airports and frequent flyers. These people, they state, could have higher exposure rates of between 200 and 400 times per year and possibly significantly higher. Crews have to change between aircraft, terminals, flights or domestic/international operations and could be screened multiple times during a single-duty period.


They also went on to argue that pilots and cabin crew should not be subject to body scanning as they have already undergone rigorous security assessments and have been issued with airport security identity cards. Pilots and cabin crew have these, and they argue that they should be entitled to work in and around aircraft as part of their normal duties, obviously with the identification being shown as required. Those provisions surely should be taken into account.

 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (11:10):  The advice that I have been provided with says that, firstly, in terms of the nonionised radiation, there is no evidence of cumulative effects. In regard to the mechanism by which the standards are set, ARPANSA takes these questions into consideration. There are regulations that meet those standards. In terms of any additional material you are seeking as to the details of research projects on this, we will have to take that on notice.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (11:11):  Thank you. Minister, I would be interested especially in the report that states that there are no cumulative impacts. If you could take it on notice to supply that report as well, please. 


I want to move on to 3AB, and ask the minister some questions about that. I am interested that the government says it has no intention of introducing the ionising radiation form of screening—and Senator Carr has reiterated this point that Minister Albanese has made on a number of occasions. If that is the case, why don't you support a ban on the use of ionising backscatter radiation equipment?


The European Union has banned the use of such scanners because of possible health risks. This is the opportunity to get it right, to get it into law and to get the ban in place. Backscatter scanners continue to be used in the US, but there at least passengers have the right to request a frisk search as an alternative. 


We have a ban in place in the European Union, and here the government is leaving the door open to this very dangerous technology being introduced. Again, that was a recommendation that came from the Australian pilots association. I would ask the minister what the government's response is to that recommendation and why the ban has not been included.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  The first of July this year marked the 80th anniversary of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The ABC is a national institution and one of the world's great public broadcasters. It is not without fault, but too often it has been the object of criticism for those who seek to silence it or use its influence for their own ends. Instead of dwelling today on its flaws, I want to focus on the contribution the ABC has made to our country's character and to the national conversation.


On 17 May 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act created a national broadcaster committed, in then Prime Minister Lyons's words, to 'serve all sections and to satisfy the diversified tastes of the public'. In that same year, the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened and Aldous Huxley published his novel Brave New World. The ABC was indeed part of a brave new world—a brave new world of communication where, for the first time, wireless broadcasting was able to traverse a vast and sparsely populated continent. The ABC's ability, then and now, to overcome the tyranny of distance and bind a nation together makes it a piece of national infrastructure every bit as important as the Sydney Harbour Bridge.


Early radio programs were dedicated to such topics as needlecraft and the proper care of goldfish. Another feature were synthetic cricket broadcasts, where commentators such as Charles Moses, Mel Morris and Alan McGilvray used cables from London and sound effects in their Sydney studio to recreate the match in play. While these broadcasts reflect our fascination with the national game, the fact that the complete works of Shakespeare were performed between 1936 and 1938 speaks to the ABC's abiding dedication to high culture.


Whilst cricket remains an indispensable part of the schedule and Shakespeare a continuing star, ABC radio has changed dramatically in 80 years. It now includes the popular youth station triple j, charged with unearthing much of the nation's contemporary music talent. ABC local radio provides vital information to rural and regional Australia and provides much-needed competition to commercial stations in our cities. And Classic FM and Radio National are essential parts of the nation's cultural and intellectual life.


But radio is not the sole province of the ABC. On 5 November 1956, in a voice now peculiarly British in intonation, host Michael Charlton welcomed viewers to 'your television service'. And so began ABC television just in time for the Melbourne Olympics, just in time for postwar Australia to watch a teenage girl from Western Sydney win gold in the 100 and 200 metres.


And, while multiple stations and relatively low production costs enable ABC radio to hold the attention of both popular and particular audiences, the unique economic pressures of television have forced it to hold these extremes in closer tension, to try—although often fail—to appeal to both the many and the few. Consequently, it is often criticised for being either elitist or banal; sometimes it is accused of being both at the same time. But despite these complaints ABC television remains home to the country's most compelling drama, adventurous comedy and biting satire. And it is still the station that families turn to for intelligent and engaging children's programming—programs like Playschool, Behind the News and Sesame Street.


But where the ABC really excels is in current affairs, for it is when the ABC works in the public interest that it performs its most important duty. While he was editor of Quadrant, Robert Manne wrote:


... ABC's public affairs—AM, PM, The 7.30 Report, Lateline, Four Corners at its best—are irreplaceable. Taken together these programs represent by far the most important national political discussions we have7.


Robert Manne is right to highlight the ABC's importance to our public life for it is hard to imagine another broadcaster with the capacity or temerity to dedicate most of its schedule, across all of its platforms, to the pressing events of the day, and harder still to imagine another broadcaster able to produce journalists of the calibre and with the courage to uncover scandals like cash for comments, to report on a moonlight state, or to connect the French secret service to a ship in a New Zealand harbour.


For the most part, the ABC remains an independent and fearless public advocate. In the words of its historian Ken Inglis it is:


… a watchdog, dedicated to preventing the people's liberties from being burgled by holders of power.


The need for a public broadcaster dedicated to the public interest is an uncomfortable truth for those of us who frequent this place—an uncomfortable truth but a necessary truth nonetheless. After all, even former Prime Minister Howard once argued:


… Australia needs an independent, fearless, professional ABC.


The future of the ABC remains unwritten and uncertain. In the digital age, in which how we consume media is an increasingly atomised affair, the media landscape is an unpredictable terrain. But I take heart from the fact that ABC online remains among the most popular sources of information in the country and ABC podcasts among the most downloaded of programs. In an age increasingly suspicious of traditional authority, the ABC remains one of this country's most trusted institutions.


In a country as vast and diverse as our own, there is only one institution trusted with the task of presenting Australia's story to itself. In this role it has developed the national character, ensuring that the many disparate communities of this nation remain connected to a public space of the airwaves and screen. Perhaps this partly explains why Australia on the whole remains such a cohesive society with a common disposition.


Paul Chadwick once wrote that the ABC is:


… a sentry who watches and warns; a guide who searches, maps and explains; a scribe who listens and records; a witness with the courage to speak; a host to debates amongst others; an advocate for the weak; a keeper of collective memory.


For 80 years the ABC has performed these tasks on our behalf. Today I want to use this matter of public interest debate to say, 'Happy anniversary, Aunty!' and to thank the ABC for all it has achieved in the national interest.

The 2012-13 defence budget was developed following a comprehensive review of the department's budget to identify contributions defence could make across the forward estimates to support the government's broader fiscal strategy. The decisions taken to determine defence's contribution to the budget bottom line have all been carefully designed to protect our service men and women and our defence operations, and to minimise the impact on core capabilities. This contribution will have no adverse effect on operations taking place, whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere. The short answer is, 'No, they are not', and that is the only— (Time expired)

The key point to make is that the Houston committee reported to parliament the result of their extensive inquiry to try to find an appropriate response to the increase in boat arrivals we have seen in the last couple of years. It is the case that the government, following that report, endorsed its recommendations. It is true to say that some of those recommendations were not easy for either of the major parties in this place to support, but, given the strength of the report and the fact that they came up with what they see as an integrated and comprehensive response which focuses on a regional cooperation and protection framework, the government has brought legislation—

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) to a question without notice asked by Senator Macdonald today relating to Australian Defence Force funding.


In so doing I want to say that the parliament should be very concerned. We have had reports of cuts in Defence, but a new low has been reached in the last 24 hours with respect to the support and supply of ammunition to Reserve soldiers, and I am told it is in North Queensland. A common metric for the measure of how well things are going in Defence over many years has been the supply of ammunition. Apparently it is one of the first things that begins to show up as being depleted in supply when funds are tight.


We heard yesterday and again today of men running around in training, being without blank ammunition in exercises and being asked to shout out the words, 'Bang! Bang!' Can I say that the first time I ever saw this was on Dad's Army. Captain Mainwaring and all of those guys on Dad's Army as I was growing up, with their picket rifles that were made out of wood, were told to shout, 'Bang! Bang!' It is embarrassing. It is morale sapping that highly trained people who are prepared to commit their lives to this country are asked to do that in training. That is the low ebb that this level of government incompetence has taken us to.


It is things like the rising sun badge on the Australian uniform being apparently under threat and no longer supplied and 51 FNQR, a unit with 33 per cent Indigenous Australian soldiers, having their operations substantially reduced because of cuts. I actually heard that one of our submarines is sitting on the hard at ASC in Adelaide and a committee was informed by people at ASC that the Defence department had said, 'Don't start doing the maintenance for at least six months because we haven't got the money.' We have not got the money and we are one month into the new financial year. How can you not have the money in August? In two words, Defence is an 'unsustainable mess'.


Dr Mark Thomson, one of the lead analysts in the government's own Australian Strategic Policy Institute has categorised defence finance as an unsustainable mess delivered to us by this minister and his representative minister here, who is probably the most cavalier, disrespectful minister in the government. He just waves away these allegations that people do not have money. He is not even concerned that people are training by saying, 'Bang! Bang!' He just says, 'No, not true'. He does not say, 'I am concerned about that; I did go and ask about that. I had a report on my desk first thing this morning when I heard about it because it is very serious allegation.' No, there is none of that. This unsustainable mess is met with cavalier disregard. Army training reserve days—usually 100 days per year for people who are committed to train to protect us—have been reduced from the 100 I mentioned down to 20 to 21. Most of them will not even turn up. It is not even worth putting on the uniform for that.


Richard Armitage is a very, very respected United States strategic adviser and public official. For him to chat us about the level of spending on defence is one of the lowest ebbs I have ever seen. It is a disgrace and this minister should be ashamed that someone of his standing has had to chat us. He should be more ashamed, because he is no orphan. There are Peter Leahy, former Chief of Army; Major General Jim Molan, who was in charge in Iraq; and John Cantwell, a very decorated, brave soldier who led us in Afghanistan. He says that this budget is a shocker. Also, of course, there is the well-renowned and respected Peter Cosgrove. He says that this government has lost the plot on defence.


No other portfolio had to stump up for this crazy budget surplus. Why was it only Defence that had to find the $5.5 billion? This is a complex, expensive and difficult portfolio, way beyond the expertise of these incompetent ministers. Why did they only go to Defence and treat it like an ATM? It is because they hate Defence. They hate Defence and they hate what Defence stands for—the strength to oppose aggression of our country. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:06):  It is interesting to have to follow Senator Johnston and what can only be described as the most bizarre claims. We know we have shared a view in Australia that we support our defence forces, and our defence industries as well which is something that he just mentioned. The notion that a government would look to undermine defence spending and that we would be starting our conversation in question time today around the issue of blank rounds during exercises for reservists and the issue of the rising sun badge just goes to show that really the thing that the opposition does not want people to know is the extent of the current investment in the defence portfolio. I will give two examples of that if I could. The first is the redevelopment of Holsworthy Army Base. The redevelopment of that base will receive $870 million—for specialist equipment for our special air commando training facilities, parachute training and diver training, and for a six-metre deep pool. This is state-of-the-art investment to make sure that our defence personnel have the training facilities they need to maintain cutting edge skills. The idea that we have abandoned defence in the way that Senator Johnston has suggested really is an insult. And there is $179 million for the royal military school of engineering project, which is all about ensuring that we can rebuild the skills base that has dissipated out of the defence services over the last decade or so. It is an issue that we have all been dealing very closely with on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, so I find it quite insulting that that would be Senator Johnston's attack today.


Let us go to this nonsense issue that was raised, the question asked of Senator Carr about using blank rounds. Senator Macdonald asked that question, suggesting that it was due to budget cuts. Quite frankly, let us get this story properly on the record. First of all, the Army advised quite clearly in Senate estimates that there is no shortage of blank or live ammunition and that ammunition has not been impacted by budget reductions. Everyone has been clearly thinking about how to reconfigure the defence expenditure. Of course we have asked Defence to find some savings. They were not the only department asked to find savings. And, as the Army has said, this issue about ammunition has not been impacted by budget reductions.


Let us get this issue on the table and get the truth out there: there is an issue that in some training areas for Army reservists there are environmental noise restrictions. In those circumstances, soldiers are advised. It is a general practice. It is called a dry drill. It is very generally understood and a common practice across the reservists, and again it has nothing to do with budget reductions. Army training, we know, continues to be very effective, whether involving dry drills or whether using blank or live ammunition.


The idea that this would be the critical, leading question from the opposition today in question time really beggars belief. I know the concern was raised about the rising sun badge and at the time Senator Carr did not have information on that. But that too was raised in Senate estimates and it was very clear from the information that the defence officials gave that it was the Chief of Army who made that decision to remove the rising sun badge from the downturned brim of the general duty grade 2 slouch hat. His decision had nothing to do with budget announcements or any other financial considerations. His actual justification for the decision—so that people do understand—was that the rising sun badge should never be hidden from view or worn pointed to the ground, as is the case when worn on the downturned brim of the general duty grade 2 slouch hat, because it is disrespectful.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:11):  The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said: 'Next year, 2012-13, the defence budget will fall in real terms by 10.5 per cent, the largest year-on-year reduction since the end of the Korean conflict in 1953. As a result, defence spending, as a share of GDP, will fall to 1.56 per cent, the smallest figure recorded by Australia since the eve of World War II.'


We are talking about the questions I asked today. The first question asked was whether reports could be confirmed that the iconic rising sun badge that has been worn as part of the uniform of Australian soldiers since 1901 was going to be removed. I have it on good authority—and forget about what Senator Ursula Stephens just said; she is talking about a different issue—that the rising sun badge will no longer be allocated as part of the Australian uniform. As a result of the question today, Senator Carr assured me that that is wrong and he assured me that the badge will continue to be given. I will hold him to account. If by asking that question, I have that assurance then I and every member of the Army will be delighted.


My second question asked whether it was true that reservist training would be cut from 100 to 21 days per reservist member. Senator Carr did not directly answer it, but I take it from his demeanour and from his non-answer that he disagrees with that. Again, I am assured by Senator Carr that the cutting of Army reserve training days to 21 is not true and that every reservist in Australia will be able to get at least 100 training days per financial year. Again, I have it in writing that that is not true, but Senator Carr has said I am wrong and that the 100 remains. I will be following Senator Carr with a microscope to see what happens with that.


My third question was about 51 Far North Queensland Regiment, one-third of whose soldiers are Indigenous people and whose role is to be the eyes and ears of Australia, and to interact with Indigenous communities, up on our remote borders. I understand from information given to me that training days are to be cut by 75 per cent. I accept absolutely the information that has come to me. Senator Carr is saying that is not correct. I know Senator Carr is not right and I am sure that, having made that assurance here in the parliamentary chamber, he is back on the phone as I speak, ringing the generals and saying, 'General, I don't care where else you cut defence spending but make sure it's not to 51 Far North Queensland Regiment, make sure it's not about the rising sun badge and make sure it's not about reducing reserve force training days.'


I know and have on firsthand authority from any number of reservists who contact me in my office in Townsville, the garrison city of Australia, that in recent weeks there has been no ammunition, live or blank. The troops have been going around pointing their weapons and saying, 'Bang, bang, you're dead!' because there is no other way they can indicate that their training is being effected. So let the Labor Party and Senator Ursula Stephens try to misrepresent the situation, but these are real cuts to our reserve training and to our reservists. I have put on the record that I am delighted with Senator Carr's off-the-cuff answers, which he knew nothing about but said them in the chamber, and I am going to hold him to them. And isn't every reservist and every Army member around Australia delighted! (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  I rise to take note of the answers to questions today about defence expenditure and the defence budget. Senator Stephens in her contribution touched on a couple of the issues, about blank rounds and the Army's rising sun badge, that were raised in the questions. Before I touch on those two issues I want to say that there is, of course, no greater responsibility for a government than the defence of Australia and Australia's interests.


The defence budget was developed following a comprehensive review of the department's budget to identify contributions defence could make across the forward estimates to support the government's broader fiscal strategy. The government has made its choices very carefully. None of the savings will impede our nation's defences. We will maintain an Australian Defence Force able to protect our interests and help maintain the peace and stability of our region. Most savings come from deferring some defence acquisitions and adjusting the defence capital equipment program, but they also come from delivering further operating efficiencies. Also planned is a reduction of 1,000 civilian positions in the defence department. These will be achieved primarily through natural attrition and the tightening of recruitment practices.


Notably, there will be no adverse impact on operations—all are fully funded. I repeat: there will be no adverse impact on operations; they are all fully funded. There will be no adverse impact on military numbers—Navy, Army or Air Force. There will be no adverse implications for kit or forces about to be deployed or on deployment. There will be no reductions in conditions or entitlements for service personnel other than those already being considered as part of the Strategic Reform Program. The focus of this budget's capability activities will be on improving airlift, land mobility and submarines, afloat support, communications, interoperability and electronic and cyber warfare. The total value of projects planned to be considered for 2012-13 is approximately $9 billion. So for Senator Macdonald and Senator Johnston to come in here and try to indicate to Australians listening to the Senate today that somehow the government is putting at risk Australians and Australia's welfare is absolutely untrue. It could not be further from the truth.


One of the issues Senator Macdonald raised in his question in the Senate today was about the use of blank rounds. Senator Ursula Stephens in her contribution to this debate has already indicated that the Army has advised there is no shortage of blank or live ammunition. Ammunition has not been impacted by the budget reductions. It is very important that that is repeated and reinforced, because it appears that senators on the other side just do not understand when you tell them that the Army has advised that there is no shortage of blank or live ammunition.


Another issue which Senator Stephens went to in her contribution was the Army's rising sun badge. She was talking about the wearing of the badge on the downturned brim of the general duty grade-2 slouch hat, which may be viewed as disrespectful. I understand the rising sun badge will remain proudly worn on the upturned brim of the ceremonial grade-1 slouch hat in plain view for all to see and reflect on when ceremonial duties are being performed. The rising sun badge is the proud symbol of the Australian Army and has become an integral part of the digger tradition. I understand that this is— (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:22):  Many in our community, particularly the defence community, the defence industry community and those who are concerned about our national security, cannot wait until this government's time has expired. We have just had Senator Brown tell us that there are no conditions of service that will be impacted. Tell that to the single servicemen, 21 years and older, who have just lost their entitlement to a free trip home to see their loved ones. This Labor government have probably about seven sitting days remaining before the disallowance motion tabled by the opposition will take effect. They have that long to stand up and nail their colours to the mast and say whether they will actually take away that entitlement of a serviceman as part of the budget cuts or, indeed, whether they will live up to the rhetoric that we have just heard again about how much Labor values our defence men and women.


In terms of defence cuts and their impact on training, under the Hawke government when I was still serving, when they started limiting track miles and flying hours and mothballing equipment, we did have to do exercises and rather than use blank ammunition say 'bang bang'. As I look at this current government under Prime Minister Gillard, who has limited track miles, has mothballed equipment and has reduced flying hours, it comes as no surprise to hear that, despite what may be reported through the echelons in Senate estimates, the reality on the ground for people is that those kinds of cuts may be in place.


We have heard much about the fact that current operations are not effective. But we also know that, despite those claims and despite the comments about not really touching the reserves, we are hearing day to day, week in and week out and as we would go and talk with reservists that their training days are being cut. When I go to welcome home parades and when I speak to people who are in the reserves, that is what is occurring. That affects current operations because our reserves are integrally engaged with the regular forces. Whether you are talking about the Air Force, the Navy or the Army, the reserves not only deploy with regular forces at times but particularly they backfill a lot of skills. I spoke just last night about the 300-odd reservists who have been called up to work in DMO because their skill sets are required in the technical area. People who are operations officers working with the Air Force are being used in backfilling. There are communications specialists, medical officers, dentists and lawyers. All of these people support our operations, so it is a complete fallacy for this government to say that the cuts are not affecting defence.


We heard in estimates about things like the self-propelled artillery and we can see how this government just do not get it. They are saying that was the decision by Army to cancel the self-propelled artillery. The Army admitted that this is a less capable piece of equipment that they are now going to have to buy with more field guns. It is going to offer less protection to the troops and, perversely, because it takes more people to operate it, over its life it is actually going to cost the taxpayer more. The government says, 'Well, that is what Army advised us,' but, when pressed, what did Army say? They said that they would not have done it except for the government's budget cuts. So, yes, they advised the government on that course of action, but only because the government cut the budget. The budget expenditure as a percentage of GDP is now at pre-World War II levels—1938—and if you are any kind of a student of history you will know how poorly prepared Australia was for the Second World War.


The US Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, has said of the US as they scale back with budget cuts that the most important thing they must do is not hollow out the force. It is not just the opposition saying that about the Australian situation; there are a number of people who have had long careers in defence, people who have been commentators working in the national security space. ASPI just today has come out with an article saying that a number of commentators have expressed 'dismay with the government's recent handling of defence'. It is not just that defence funding has been reduced substantially over the next few years; most observers conclude, probably rightly, that 'the government's long-term commitment to strengthen Australia's defence has evaporated'. The commitment has evaporated and the commitment to strengthen our defence means that their commitment to our national security has evaporated.


ASPI goes on to say that it is more to do with the 'way that defence is run', and I have certainly got much more to say in this place in the light of the defence procurement inquiry and looking at the impact of government initiatives—things like the Strategic Reform Program, where again cost-saving measures are being driven that are bringing about decisions like the self-propelled artillery decision, which is not in our national interest.

  The Gillard government know that there are too many Australians who are homeless. This is the Labor government that made reducing homelessness a national priority through our inaugural white paper on homelessness, which makes it clear we want to halve overall homelessness and by 2020 provide supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it. To back our commitment, the government have invested an unprecedented $5 billion into supporting homeless people and services through programs since 2008. The government have been working with states and territories, business, charities and the community to reduce homelessness in Australia through our $1.1 billion national partnership agreement on homelessness, which is delivering 180 new, expanded homelessness services. The Labor government have also invested a record $2.2 billion in a mental health reform package. Since being elected the government have invested a record $20 billion in making housing more affordable.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:11):  This particular acceptance represents for the government, and for the now Prime Minister Ms Gillard, a most disappointing reversal and embarrassment. But it is all the fault of one person—that is, the Prime Minister herself. 


It was as shadow minister that Ms Gillard came up with the now infamous statement, 'Another boat, another policy failure.' Very rarely did she or her staff ever have to trouble the press gallery with that particular statement. More importantly, it was during the period in which the Hon. Philip Ruddock was the minister that he invited and subsequently took then shadow minister Ms Gillard to Nauru, where she had every opportunity to observe for herself the success of the program instituted by the coalition in response to a need. The coalition then, as the coalition now, had and has a plan to stop the boats. 


Worse than that, then Deputy Prime Minister Gillard was part of a group that dismantled a policy that was working. There is nothing worse in the Australian democratic system than to have ideology replace good policy; it inevitably comes back to bite you, and it has on this occasion. Since I began working in this chamber, early in 2009, this side of the chamber has suffered the scorn, disdain and ridicule of what was a successful coalition policy by the now government. They have to eat humble pie, because they were the makers of that pie and they were the bakers of that pie. 


When she became the Prime Minister of this country, it was Ms Gillard who said that one of her key priorities was to fix up border protection. We know that she has not. She has lost control of our borders; a fundamental priority for the Prime Minister of any country. Six weeks ago, she outsourced—fortunately to an eminent group of three consultants—the job of advising her, because her own ministers could not and she did not accept the advice of the coalition. This is advice that we have been so often willing to provide to the government. I believe our leader, Mr Abbott, has suggested on more than 100 occasions the very solution that now is being proposed for this place. As our then coalition Prime Minister Mr Howard said, 'We will decide who comes to this country.' 


We have not yet got the full restoration of the policy that worked for Australia and worked for genuine refugees. That is a three-plank policy. The first plank is the use of Nauru and Manus Island, which of course now the government, embarrassedly, has had to come back to ask us to accept, and I believe it is the intention that the coalition will. The second and third are temporary protection visas and a policy to turn the boats back when it is safe to so do. These form the three planks of the policy. In the absence of the second two we cannot be confident that we are actually going to see a successful outcome.


Air Vice Marshal Houston and his team have indicated that they agree with the concept of turning the boats back when it is prudent to do so. The Sri Lankan government has even pleaded with this government to do the same thing. We would say the same. We know that naval personnel support that particular element.


What has happened as a result of five years of the failure of this government to continue a policy of the coalition which worked? The first, of course, has been the regrettable death of at least 600 people drowned at sea that we know about. Of course, there are probably more than that and there may be more than those into the future, particularly as on a daily basis those boats are putting to sea in the middle of winter. 


The second has been a massive cost blow-out at a time when the budget can ill afford the blowing out of costs as a result of other profligate spending by this Labor government and its mismanagement. The third is a loss of confidence by the Australian community, and gross embarrassment in the Australian community, in what has become a laughing stock internationally—our border protection policy. And in so doing, of course, making fools of the Australian Navy—it now being said throughout the Asian region that the Australian Navy has become the people-smugglers' taxi service. Who can be proud of that sort of criticism in the region? Yet it is this government that has led to that level of embarrassment.


Lastly but not least is the fact that genuine refugees as a result of this mismanagement of the Labor government have been left to rot in refugee camps around the world at a time when, as we know, they should have been coming into this country under our very, very generous refugee program. Recent surveys point to the concern by Australians that we want to see people come through the right and correct channels. It has been this failure to do so that has caused so much concern.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:17):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to this debate as well. I guess the one thing I agree with Senator Back on is the eminence of the group of those who made up the panel to bring about an end to this particular situation that we have had, and we have had it for many years. Even under the coalition there were issues with boat arrivals, so it is not a case of being solely an issue that this government has had to deal with.


When you look at the report there are certainly signposts that indicate the problems in dealing with this particular issue. One is the range of disincentives to discourage irregular and dangerous maritime travel to Australia. If we put a stop to that we have done our job as a parliament. I am pleased that the coalition has finally seen through the opportunity to come on board—




Senator Brandis:
  You've adopted our policy, you clown!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Brandis!




Senator FURNER:
  rather than being belligerent, like they have been over the last several years, and come to a compromise with us, as we have had to compromise as well.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  You do not have your TPVs or your 'turn back the boats' policies, either, Senator Brandis, so do not worry about that. You go on about your three-pillar policy; you should really read the evidence around the issues associated with turning boats back. I will get to that in a minute, because there are major issues in turning boats back. It is not as simple as Abbott picking up the phone—that was the policy of Mr Abbott some years ago: claiming that he could pick up some phone and decide on how a captain of a patrol boat should operate dealing with illegal immigrants. Instead of individuals reaching out for help, the coalition sees desperate asylum seekers as figures, statistics and numbers they can flaunt in the media. 



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  That is correct, Senator Collins. This is exactly what their policy on turning the boats back is. Turning boats around is unsafe. I note that the member for Cook claimed in his opening address on this that Air Vice Marshal Houston has 'belled the cat'. What a load of nonsense. There is no cat that has been belled in this outcome of our government compromising on a solution to stop asylum seekers boarding dangerous ships and travelling to our shores. There has been a litany of examples provided at Senate estimates. I know Senator Brandis as a conscientious senator appears at many of the Senate estimates, at the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and raises many issues along with many of the other senators opposite us here. I am sure they have heard the evidence that has been provided by the public servants from many of the departments and also the Chief of Navy of the risks of turning boats back on our seas. I will get to some of those risks in a short while.


In September last year Minister Bowen explained in the Australian three reasons why the coalition's policy of turning around boats was not viable. First of all was that Indonesia did not support it. That has been a position that Indonesia has taken for some time. We have built up a healthy dialogue with that particular country and with that government and we know that if this policy were enforced by the coalition our relationship with Indonesia would be jeopardised to the extent that our relationship would deteriorate. It is only as a result of this government building up that rapport with that country that we have been able to address some of the issues around boat arrivals. We have sent people over there to address particular problems, supplied machinery in maritime assistance and provided education to address some of the issues associated with boats coming to our shores. As for the Indonesians, Brigadier General Agung Sabar Santoso of the national police said:


It will certainly affect relations if (Australia) turns boats away …


He also said:


We don't want them to die at sea. You can imagine that there are children and women as well.


We have experienced those sad situations where there have, unfortunately, been deaths at sea. Here we have the Indonesians concurring with that position—that turning back the boats will not work.


The second major issue, as I mentioned before, is that it is unsafe. We do not want to see people injured and we definitely do not want to see people lose their lives at sea. That also goes for our brave men and women aboard the Armidale class patrol boats. I have personally been on one of those boats, up in Darwin in 2009, and have seen the good work they do. I know, Senator Humphries, you have done a lot of parliamentary defence programs as well, probably as many as I have—




Senator Humphries:
  Probably more.




Senator FURNER:
  and it is a great opportunity to understand what our men and women have concerns about in turning boats back. In fact, Senator Humphries, on that same trip I was on, one of your opposition lower house members asked, quite rightly, whether it would work. The response he got was, 'No, it won't work, because we know from history that it's unsafe.'


The report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers explained some of the issues associated with it when you were in government. There were about 12 interceptions, and eight of those occasions could be termed 'miserable excuses for a success'. On four of those eight occasions, asylum-seeker boats were successfully intercepted and escorted or towed back to international waters, in the direction of Indonesian territorial waters. Although successful, those four operations included the following incidents: on two occasions, Royal Australian Navy personnel had to undertake repairs to the boat engines in order to be able to turn back those boats; and, on the other two occasions, asylum seekers jumped overboard. Is that the situation you want, where our Royal Australian Navy personnel have to repair the engines of boats that have been damaged as a result of these asylum seekers being so desperate to be rescued, to come to our shores, that they then—the second point made in the panel report—jump overboard? Let us not forget the unfortunate situation that occurred in Darwin, where asylum seekers set fire to boats. That is the sort of desperate thing that occurs when you send that message, 'Let's turn the boats back.' It does not work. 


On the other four occasions out of the eight interceptions, either the boats became unseaworthy at some point during the interception or turn-back operation, or non-compliant behaviour by the asylum seekers made the attempt unsustainable, and those asylum seekers ended up at Christmas Island anyway. That is the evidence from the past on this policy of turning boats back—your three planks of policy. It just does not work. When are you going to get it? I do not think you will ever get it. 


Then you went to temporary protection visas. Let us have a look at what happened. Let us look at the truth and shine a light on what you guys failed to do. You made out that TPVs were this golden way to stop people coming here. Well, they did not stop people coming here. They did not stop the boats; they did not turn them around. The number of women and children getting onto boats actually increased when you introduced TPVs, and the restrictions that these visas imposed on asylum seekers were unjust and hindered their ability to carry out normal lives. In fact, former immigration minister Chris Evans said in 2008:


Under the unjust regime set up by the previous government, unauthorised arrivals who were owed protection under Australia’s international obligations were only eligible for TPVs in the first instance.


It meant that refugees had no travel rights, reduced access to refugee settlement services such as English language programs, employment and income assistance, and could not be reunited with other family members.


Minister Evans also said:


The Temporary Protection visa was one of the worst aspects of the Howard government’s punitive treatment of refugees, many of whom had suffered enormously before fleeing to Australia.


This is clear evidence that the TPV arrangements did nothing to prevent unauthorised boat arrivals. In fact, illegal arrival numbers increased not long after the regime was introduced. Furthermore, if you want to know what happened as a result, as Peter van Onselen said in the Australian, the paper that those opposite often rely on, on 26 June 2012:


More than 95 per cent—


that is 95 per cent—


of TPV holders who were irregular maritime arrivals went on to get a permanent visa to live in Australia.


That is also reflected in the Houston report, so you cannot deny that. Once again, you need to study the evidence to make sure what you are saying actually occurred. (Time expired)

After 10½ years of the ALP telling anyone who would listen, preaching to the Australian people, that the Pacific solution was inhumane and that Nauru and Manus Island were expensive, ineffective tools in deterring people-smuggling, they changed their minds. It will not come as a surprise to anybody here that, over those 10½ years, the Labor Party made those points with very little subtlety.


I have a wealth of examples of the ALP lording it over the then coalition government, and saying with moral superiority, 'You guys have got it wrong; we've got it right.' The then immigration spokesperson for the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, said in May 2004:


Labor will end the so-called Pacific solution—the processing and detaining of asylum seekers on Pacific islands—because it is costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle.


In 2008, Chris Evans, the immigration minister, said:


The Pacific solution was a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise …


Stephen Smith, the shadow minister for immigration in 2004, said:


The Pacific solution is now a ridiculously expensive farce, and the government should end it immediately.


So that was the language of the Labor Party over those 10½ or 11 years. They were full of self-righteousness. We were lectured; we were hectored by the Labor Party. Labor promised a better way. In May 2002 Senator Lundy said:


Labor is committed to developing a comprehensive and lasting solution …


Madam Acting Deputy President, six—count them—'comprehensive and lasting solutions' later under this government and this week the Australian Labor Party admitted that none of those solutions had actually worked, that none of them had been effective in turning back the boats, and that they are now back to the original solution that they had inherited but which they had dumped in 2008 because they did not like it philosophically. It was wrong as a matter of principle, Ms Gillard told us. But this week they told us—rather ungraciously—that they were wrong, that in effect they had been wrong for the past 10½ years.


Labor have had an epiphany. Of course Australians are used to the Labor Party having epiphanies from time to time. In fact, as a government they have made a career of having epiphanies. But this was one that the Australian people welcomed because rather than taking something away, removing a promise that they had made—'No carbon tax under a government I lead' et cetera—they were finally giving something back to the Australian people. They were giving back to them a solution which actually worked in preventing the arrival of unauthorised boats on our northern shores. People realised Labor had thrashed about hopelessly, aimlessly for four years with this unsustainable succession of policies—six different policies on my count—that saw the arrival of 386 boats, 22½ thousand people, 2,600 of them in this financial year—that is, the last six weeks alone! People realised that something had to change and finally, in the light of overwhelming evidence, it is changing.


But of course those 22½ thousand people who arrived were the lucky ones because the biggest toll of Labor's chaotic border policy was not the billions of dollars wasted on this incredibly expensive policy, it was not the embarrassment of Australia having to go cap in hand to nations around the region saying, 'Please, be our regional partner,' with a complete lack of success, it was not the total collapse of public confidence in Australia's humanitarian resettlement program; it was the deaths at sea. At least 500 people, it could be as many as 1,000 people, have died at sea.


And even while those deaths were occurring literally on television screens in front of Australians, Labor still were unwilling to grasp the obvious solution sitting there in front of them—the one that had worked, the one that had stopped the boats, the one that they pretended could not be applied but today they admit can be. Of course it must have been applied and was capable of being applied in the past. They could not adopt it because, horror of horrors, that would have meant saying that John Howard must have been right in applying the Pacific solution. It was worth letting people die at sea rather than make that terrible, terrible admission.


Here is the irony: we were told time and again that the Pacific solution was inhumane, but today we are returning to the Pacific solution because it is the most humane of all of the solutions that have been attempted in the last decade to prevent people making unsafe journeys in small, unseaworthy boats across the Timor Sea. It is the most humane solution, the one least likely to lead to deaths at sea.


Senator Thistlethwaite yesterday suggested that this debate was going to go away now that the government had finally adopted the obvious Nauru solution, but they have not adopted the full suite of Howard government solutions and I suspect this issue will not go away because this is not the complete solution to the boat arrival problem. Until the government accept that others have a better idea of what to do in this matter than they do, they still have this monkey well and truly around their neck.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:34):  My, how times have changed. What is so different to the days of Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating? Even during the Howard years, the then opposition leader Kim Beazley continued that policy of bipartisanship: the policy of cooperation on migration that had previously existed between governments and oppositions for many, many years. Many in the Labor Party did not support Kim Beazley's action in supporting the Howard plan on asylum seekers, but it was supporting a bipartisan approach.


The successful Fraser government's Indochina refugee program would not have been possible without the cooperation of refugee transit countries such as Malaysia. The same is true today. Not the simplistic, go it alone approach of the coalition as they repeat their mantra over and over again: Nauru, temporary protection visas, turn the boats back. One-liners derived from focus groups and dog whistling do not add up to a refugee policy.


Meanwhile, the coalition hang onto their delusion that the Pacific solution stopped the boats under Howard. On the other hand, the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was asked to help present a solution after the intransigence of the coalition.




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is it not the courtesy of the Senate to refer to members or former Prime Ministers by their proper title—Mr Howard?




Senator POLLEY:
  I said the Howard government.



An opposition senator:  You said Howard!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  It is preferable, Senator Polley, if you do so.




Senator POLLEY:
  There was no point of order on that. I know they do not like to hear the realities of having any sorts of policies on that side. Six weeks ago there was absolutely no doubt that the coalition had no intention of, or in fact was capable of, any compromise. The government does not want people to continue to drown at sea. These deaths are completely unacceptable. The government has been and is prepared to compromise to get a solution in place to stop the unnecessary drowning of desperate people.


However, before I explore the intricate plan of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, let us look at what the coalition are proposing. According to the UNHCR:


If we compare the flow of asylum seekers to the OECD countries and to Australia in the years 2000 to 2009 it is quite clear that the flows of asylum seekers in Australia followed very closely those to other OECD countries.


It is clear that the major reason for the fall of asylum seeker numbers in the early period of the Howard government was not its policies but a decline in the number of asylum seekers in the world. When world refugee numbers rose again after the mid-2000s, so did the numbers coming to Australia. The Howard government's policies had only a marginal impact on the total number of asylum seekers coming to Australia.


All but 45 of the 1,637 asylum seekers incarcerated in Nauru who were found to be refugees then gained residence in Australia or New Zealand. TPVs were introduced in 1999, but had no effect during the next few years. Not until the international decline in asylum seeker numbers began to occur was there a reduction in boat arrivals in Australia. Let us put the facts on the table. The link between boat arrivals and TPVs is a figment of the imagination of the coalition. When was Tampa? Certainly not in 1999.


However, one consequence of temporary protection visas was that the number of women and children arriving on boats after the introduction of TPVs increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. Just because two things appear to occur at a similar time does not mean they are linked. The conditions necessary for effective, lawful and safe turn back of irregular vessels carrying asylum seekers to Australia are not currently in place. In fairness, those conditions might change but that would require Indonesian agreement. Has that been addressed by the coalition? I do not think so.


The report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers was asked to help present a solution after the intransigence of the coalition. The government and the Australian community do not want people to continue to drown at sea. These deaths are completely unacceptable. The committee's integrated plan has made 22 recommendations. The plan states quite clearly that achieving a regional cooperation framework on protection and asylum issues is 'fundamentally important', a central focus of this report. This requires domestic policies that enjoy broad-based support and that are sustainable over time. That is, regional engagement that is not limited to countries party to the refugee conventions; with no advantage gained by people who circumvent regular migration pathways; enhanced asylum and protection opportunities; involvement of international organisations, NGOs and civil society. It already sounds like the Pacific solution.


The plan continues that Australia's humanitarian program be increased immediately to 20,000 places per annum with a minimum of 12,000 places in the refugee component of the program and that consideration be given to increasing the program to around 27,000 within five years. Furthermore, the program should be more focused on asylum-seeker flow moving from source countries into South-East Asia and 4,000 additional places should be provided to the family stream per annum to alleviate pressures caused by more applications, and specifically allocated to family of humanitarian visa holders.  The government should expand relevant regional capacity-building initiatives by doubling the current allocation from $70 million to $140 million. The Malaysia arrangements should be built on rather than be discarded or neglected and this be should achieved through high level bilateral engagement focused on strengthening protections and accountability as a positive basis for the Australian parliament's recommendations for new necessary legislation.


Indonesia is key to any program. The plan recommends that bilateral cooperation on asylum seeker issues with Indonesia be advanced as a matter of urgency. These include: allocation of an increased number of humanitarian program resettlement places for Indonesia; enhanced cooperation on joint surveillance and response patrols, law enforcement and search and rescue coordination, and changes to Australian law in relation to Indonesian minors and others crewing unlawful boat voyages from Indonesia to Australia. Cooperation and collaboration are also critical parts of the plan.


This is an integrated plan that aims to be inclusive of our region. While Australia may be a desired settlement country, this is an issue for our region and the globe. However, the obsessive desire for an election is the likely explanation for the loss of bipartisanship. Maybe we have some insight into the impasse that has existed for months and years.


On 10 December 2010, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that:


A 'key Liberal Party strategist' told a US diplomat in Canberra in November last year, that the issue of asylum seekers was 'fantastic' for the Coalition and 'the more boats that come the better'.


That 'key Liberal Party strategist' could not have been more explicit about the political game that is being played.


Rather than asking for an apology from the Prime Minister, who has bent over backwards to arrange a compromise, the coalition should be apologising for its intransigence which has lead to the current situation. But, as we know on so many policy areas, the opposition have one policy and that is all. This is to say 'no' to good government legislation and 'no' to good policy. All they are really interested in is trying to get to an election. The reality is that, when you are in opposition, you have a responsibility to this country. The responsibility in cases like this is to have cooperation and to put the welfare of the nation and refugees before the opposition's own political gain. When the government's legislation comes from the other place, we will see that the Labor government's position and the position of the coalition are like 'chalk and cheese.' 




Senator Brandis:
  You have adopted offshore processing!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis!




Senator POLLEY:
  In the long term we have the responsibility to put Australia first. We have to compromise. We have been prepared to do that. But no, those in the opposition are only interested in gaining political points that they see. They are not interested in resolving this issue, because they, for their own perverted reasons, see it as a winner for them to keep people at sea, to try to turn around these boats that are not fit to be turned around. We have heard very good one-liners from Mr Abbott, 'Yes, we have got to stop the boats.' The reality is you have come to the table, you have to compromise and you have to put other people's interests ahead of your own political gains. Senator Brandis, you can shake your head, but the people will judge you accordingly.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:45):  Can I start with Senator Polley's words about turning the boats back. Let me quote the now Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard. The Australian people must also be wondering what is going on when the Prime Minister, and people like Senator Polley, are saying today, 'You can't turn the boats back,' when in 2002, when Ms Gillard was in opposition, she said:


And we think turning boats around that are seaworthy, that can make the return journey and are in international waters, fits in with that.


Ms Gillard was saying turning the boats around, when it was safe to do so, fits in. Of course, prior to the 2007 election, the then opposition leader Mr Rudd, the politically decapitated Mr Rudd, said, 'Turn the boats back when safe to do so.' So we have got the now current Prime Minister saying that, we have got the former, politically decapitated Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, saying the same, and now we have got these people saying, 'No, you can't do that.'


This whole asylum seeker industry has become one big tragedy. Last Saturday week I was with the deputy opposition leader, the Hon. Julie Bishop, up in the New England area at Tenterfield, a great place where Henry Parkes and others sat down to help establish the Federation. It is the birthplace of Peter Allen. It was very interesting as I showed Ms Bishop around Henry Parkes's museum there. He was an interesting man—he had three wives and 18 children and obviously had quite an exciting life. What a great contribution he made to our nation. But Ms Bishop was telling us that when the Labor government was elected in 2007 there were just four people in detention centres in Australia. Just four! And then, in August 2008, the then Prime Minister Mr Rudd at the request of the previous opposition immigration minister Ms Julia Gillard said, 'We will change the rules. We will do away with the Pacific solution,' a solution that the Howard government had brought in under the careful guidance of the Hon. Mr Philip Ruddock. The coalition had a problem and found a solution. This government had the solution and you turned it into a disastrous problem. What have we seen? More than 20,000 asylum seekers have arrived since August 2008. We have seen 386 boats. At the last election—you would remember it well, Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce—the then Prime Minister Ms Gillard said, 'We will do a deal with East Timor.' She told all of Australia, 'We will do a deal with East Timor.' It was just that she did not happen to tell East Timor. So then it was, 'We will do a deal with Malaysia.' It was not a very good deal: 'You take 800 of our asylum seekers and we will take 4,000 of your refugees.' Eight hundred for 4,000—that is not a very good deal either. Of course, the High Court put an end to the so-called solution that the Gillard government had in relation to asylum seekers. It was the end of that when the High Court handed down its decision. So now we see the government, under the Houston recommendations, adopting Nauru. I do not know how many times Mr Abbott has said it. 


How many times did Mr Abbott say, 'Pick up the phone to Nauru'? Hopefully, the facility will be back in working condition soon. Hopefully, those people who traffic in human beings for money, putting their lives at risk, will be brought to a stop. Some 22,000 people have come to this country seeking asylum on boats since the introduction of this government. Some figures say four per cent of these people lose their lives. We are talking 800 to 900 people who may have drowned at sea making this dangerous journey to our country. That industry must be shut down.


I am very fortunate to live in a beautiful country town where we have refugees from Sudan who have come to our town and become established there. They are really good people. One lady came there with four children. Her husband was murdered. I think her brother was also murdered. She got a life again, a new start in a lovely country town like Inverell, where the people have made them most welcome, where they are good citizens and where their children are being educated, getting work and going off to university. That is an ideal result—looking after those in refugee camps, those who are threatened, not those who are paying their way to come here. I find it amazing when we see boatloads of people coming and seeking asylum and they are all men. The boat is full of men. What, the women and their children are not seeking asylum? What is going on here? These are the people paying to come here. The industry must be stopped. I think it is certainly good that the government has now adopted the Nauru solution. It has worked before; it will work again. I know this is embarrassing for members of the government who have resisted this in arrogance for so long. But now we are getting steps that hopefully lead to this industry being shut down—lives will be saved and we can continue our compassionate settlement of proper refugees.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (16:51):  This is a very important debate. What we have seen in the last day or so is a complete backflip by the ALP government against the policy they had when they came to office of reversing the very successful coalition measures which stopped the flow of refugees and reduced to a trickle the number of people coming to Australia by unconventional means. Those measures were the provision of temporary protection visas and, of course, the Nauru solution, under which people who came to Australia by boat were taken to Nauru, where they were offered the opportunity of assessment and, in due course, relocation to a recipient country if they proved to be genuine refugees. 


The coalition has always argued that the full suite of measures that stopped the boats, including offshore processing in Nauru and temporary protection visas, should be reimplemented if the flood of boats was to be stopped, and we are very pleased that at long last the ALP has seen the wisdom of our policies and has decided to reinstate at least the policy of relocating people to Nauru. I am quite sure that within a short period of time, if common sense prevails, we will see that temporary protection visas are also put in place. Under these, people are offered a temporary protection visa—literally—which means they can stay in Australia while there is a problem at home and, when and if that problem is resolved, they are sent back to where they have come from. That practice was used in the case of the Kosovar problem, when the Kosovar refugees came here. It was also used in the case of East Timor when a large number of East Timorese came to Darwin and, in due course, when the situation East Timor was resolved, they were sent back to East Timor.


The most important point to make about what has happened in the last 24 hours is that the Howard government's highly successful asylum seeker policy, developed over 11 long years in power, has at long last been seen by the ALP to be a reasonable and respectable policy that was in fact very effective. When the coalition left office, just four people who had arrived illegally by boat were in detention—just four people. In a joint media release by parliamentary colleagues last Thursday, Scott Morrison and Michael Keenan pointed out that the largest single boatload of illegal asylum seekers had arrived the night before. It brought to 379 the total number of boats that have come to Australia since the Labor government came to office and the total number of people to more than 22,000. Some 7,500 refugees have come to our shores on boats this year alone. That amounts to one boat a day under the ALP government. Yet, in the last five years of the Howard government, just 18 boats arrived—one boat every 101 days, not one boat a day. That is an important statistic to dwell on.


When the Pacific solution was in place, between 2001 and 2008, 1,637 boat people were processed on Nauru and Manus islands, and I am pleased that, at long last, the Gillard has seen the value of this approach—albeit belatedly and on the advice of the Houston committee. I was very surprised that the government accepted the findings and advice of the Houston committee so willingly. I suspected that they would find flaws in whatever it was that Houston recommended. I think it just shows that at last they have looked back at the Howard years, have seen how successful the Howard policies were, have decided that common sense should prevail and that policies that worked under the government of John Howard should work again so that this terrible saga of people coming across the seas from Java to Christmas and Cocos islands and to Ashmore reef—with sometimes whole boatloads of people dying when the boats sink—will come to an end.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:57):  This is a good opportunity to speak to Senator Fifield's MPI. The MPI is exactly the reason why it has been so difficult to make genuine progress in this matter. The government's decision is to work through the recommendations of the expert panel—not, as Senator Fifield has suggested, to implement the full suite of the coalition's policies. For far too long, we watched desperate people drown at sea while all sides of politics—senators and members—drew lines in the sand, dug in our toes and announced what we were not prepared to do. The intention was to be strong, but inflexibility actually weakened us and locked us into a stalemate position that, as the Prime Minister has said, has gone on long enough. 


The fact is that good leaders do get things done. We want to move forward on this difficult, complex issue. We are prepared to make compromises. And that is why we welcome the advice of the expert panel and are prepared to work through their recommendations. I would like to see Senator Fifield and his colleagues take a much more positive approach—a genuinely bipartisan approach—to this problem rather than keeping us stalled in discussion over the same old ground while they all talk about adopting the old coalition policy holus-bolus. Compromise actually involves every one of us revisiting our positions—each one of us, individually. 


My colleagues know that I have spoken quite passionately here about my personal preference for onshore processing. But I have to say that, in reading the Houston review and thinking about the issue again, I have come to see that the difference between onshore and offshore is simply symbolic. What really matters is the how not where the asylum seekers are being processed. If while they are being assessed and their application is being processed they are treated generously with regard to such things as freedom of movement, food, medical treatment and education, then it really does not matter if this happens on the mainland or offshore.


In deciding to establish processing centres on Nauru and PNG as a matter of urgency, we are actually signalling our willingness to move forward, to climb out of what has been a pretty awful political stalemate, and to take some action. As I said, good leaders get things done. Instead of looking backwards, as the opposition members have asked us to do, they need to be looking forward as well and working with us to implement the expert panel's recommendations.


So they can forget about the full suite of their policy. Senator Fifield can be assured that we certainly have no intention of sending boats back. As the expert panel make clear to everybody, that is not an option. It is not humane; it is unsafe—people smugglers sink the boats; and, in fact, the Indonesian government does not support it either. Senator Fifield can also be sure that we will not adopt their policy of indefinite detention in conditions that have caused so many Australians to speak out. Our intention is to establish processing centres that respect the asylum seekers' humanity while, at the same time, pursuing in a spirit of fairness the principle that those who come to Australia by irregular migration arrangements are not privileged above those who use regular methods.


As Anabelle Crabb reminded us in The Drum, motives are important here. We are motivated by a sense of compassion, a sense of responsibility and a sense of fairness to the people who arrive on these boats, the people who seek asylum via more regular channels and the Australian people that they want to join. We are not naive. We know that working out how to effect procedure that is both humane and fair will be difficult and will take time and that, with so many people in search of a new country of residence, the problem will be an ongoing one. That is why we welcome help in the process from experts such as the UNHCR and from the coalition, the Greens and the Independent members of the parliament who, as representatives of Australia, have a responsibility to work towards a solution to this crisis in our region.


The Houston report recommends that the humanitarian intake be increased—and I know that was not part of the opposition's policy, either. But I certainly invite Senator Fifield and his colleagues to reconsider and to support the government as it works through this and the other recommendations over the coming months. Simply declaring that 'It's my way or the highway' is irresponsible. The expert panel has endorsed some parts of the opposition's policy and some parts of the government's policy. But, frankly, it is in the interests of all Australians that the opposition should turn its focus from inaction to action and support the legislation recommended by the expert panel.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:27):  I congratulate Senator Thorp on her maiden speech. It is always of great significance to get through your maiden speech. You did it beautifully, so well done. That is perhaps the most encouraging thing I am ever going to say to you except this: welcome to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, to which I know you will make a great contribution. Without being too out of line, your speech was very passionate, very well delivered and on message but in some areas, particularly when talking about the coalition, a bit light on fact.


I say to Senator Thorp: if the Labor Party had a leader who could be trusted and who could stand up to the Greens, then perhaps the state of Tasmania would be a little better off. Clearly, most of the bad, bad policies of the Labor Policy at the present time are due to the influence of the Greens political party and none more so than this fiasco around the border protection policies of the Gillard government. How Ms Gillard manages to face the humiliation that is dealt to her day after day, as she does backflip after backflip on policies, is beyond me. 


Let me, for those who might be listening, indicate what this border protection issue is all about. People will recall that John Howard in government did have a problem with illegal arrivals, would-be asylum seekers, to such an extent that it caused one up-and-coming member of the then opposition, Ms Gillard, to famously say, 'Another boat, another policy failure.' Then she presided over a regime where the boats just kept coming and coming. For once, Ms Gillard was right: policy failure, after policy failure, after policy failure.


What disturbs me about this latest backflip is that it could have been done three, four, five years ago. Had Ms Gillard had the courage to admit she was wrong, how many lives would have been saved? How many people would not have been put through that arduous and dangerous journey to come to Australia knowing that if they got here under a Labor government the doors would be open and they would be here for life and receiving all the benefits that Australians receive? But, no, day after day Ms Gillard and every one of her ministers, including Senator Evans, told us how the Pacific solution was evil, that it could not be done, that it should never be looked at. I do not think they used these words but the connotation was there: it was Satan's work to adopt offshore processing on Pacific islands. And yet a couple of days ago, in spite of all that rhetoric, in spite of all that bluff and bluster, Ms Gillard turns around and now adopts John Howard's Pacific solution.


Regrettably, she has only adopted part of it. Whilst the coalition clearly will be supporting the part that she has belatedly agreed to, regrettably, so far as I understand it on last information, she will not be introducing the temporary protection visas and she will not be turning the boats back when it is safe to do so. Without those two elements of this policy, I do not know that it is going to make a big deal of difference. It is certainly a step in the right direction, it is one pace towards a solution which the coalition supports, but it misses the two crucial elements that would take us back to the era of John Howard when, facing the unprecedented arrival of illegal immigrants in those years, he introduced these policies and they stopped. As soon as the Labor Party got rid of those policies, they start again. Now, with one foot towards the right solution, hopefully they will reduce but, without the other two elements, I doubt it. You can turn boats around. Admiral Griggs in Senate estimates gave evidence of how he did it when he was a patrol boat captain, so it can be done. Let us hope that the Gillard government will go the final hog and introduce the other two elements of Howard's solution.

The committee over the last couple of meetings and again today has looked at ways that perhaps the work of the committee could be more recognised by members, not only in this chamber but in the other chamber as well. We are going to try a couple of initiatives to make it easier for senators and members of the House of Representatives to use the work of the committee in alerting members and senators to some elements of different pieces of legislation that do infringe upon the things that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee is charged with looking at—that is, trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties; making rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers; making rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions; inappropriately delegating legislative powers; and insufficiently subjecting the exercise of legislative powers to parliamentary scrutiny. The committee looks at all of those elements, does not take a partisan view on any of them, but draws to the attention of senators where the committee believes, on advice, that those principles have been breached. I commend the latest report and Alert Digest to senators.

We are going to try a couple of initiatives to make it easier for senators and members of the House of Representatives to use the work of the committee in alerting members and senators to some elements of different pieces of legislation that do infringe upon the things that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee is charged with looking at—that is, trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties; making rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers; making rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions; inappropriately delegating legislative powers; and insufficiently subjecting the exercise of legislative powers to parliamentary scrutiny. The committee looks at all of those elements, does not take a partisan view on any of them, but draws to the attention of senators where the committee believes, on advice, that those principles have been breached. I commend the latest report and Alert Digest to senators.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:41):  'The single most important priority in preventing people from risking their lives on dangerous maritime voyages is to recalibrate Australian policy settings to achieve an outcome that asylum seekers will not be advantaged if they pay people smugglers to attempt dangerous irregular entry into Australia instead of pursuing regular migration pathways and international protection arrangements.' So said the government's own hand-picked panel operating under the government's own self-drafted terms of reference. A hand-picked panel and self-drafted terms of reference—and the verdict? One of the most stinging critiques ever of government policy by a panel hand-picked by government with self-drafted terms of reference. 


This report explodes and exposes the government's four years of failure and falsehoods in relation to the causes of the tsunami of illegal arrivals in our country. After 22,000 illegal arrivals by boat, after over 600 deaths at sea, after a $4.7 billion cost blow-out funded by the Australian taxpayer, and after the government's own panel has told the government the exceedingly obvious, all of which fully vindicates the coalition's consistent policy position over the last decade, we have the government without even an 'if you please' let alone a full-scale apology coming into this place with a half-baked solution. The proposal which represents just one pillar of a three-pillar solution is to be welcomed, because one pillar is clearly better than none. So the coalition will support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. But let us be crystal clear: the coalition's policy prescription worked, it stopped the boats and it will work again.


The coalition has always stood for strong border protection. The bill, whilst not ideal, is moving in the right direction, so the coalition will support it. In showing our support, coalition senators will curtail their contributions to facilitate the bill's passage, albeit—and I want to make this point very, very clear—that each and every one of us on the coalition side would be fully justified to speak our full 20 minutes normally allocated to highlight the avalanche of epithets and abuse those opposite and their fellow travellers in the commentariat threw at the member for Berowra, Mr Ruddock, the former Prime Minister and, indeed, all of us who argued against Labor's ill-advised policy shift.


Not content with the fiscal and humanitarian damage they caused, those opposite engaged in a verbal rampage of vilification against the coalition on the workable solution they so wilfully scuttled. I recall the claims of the government leader in this place in answer to former Senator Ellison's questioning about Labor relaxing border protection. This was back on 13 October 2008—and I quote Senator Evans:


I do not accept that any changes to detention policy in this country have led to an increase in arrivals. First of all, there has not been an increase in arrivals and, secondly, we know that the indefinite long-term detention of arrivals did not prove to be a barrier to people continuing to make the journey.


He went on to claim on another occasion that the Pacific solution was regarded internationally as a stain on Australia's reputation. Such was the hysteria Labor tried to peddle. Today, without any apology and without any 'if you please', they are reintroducing part of the Pacific solution; specifically, Nauru.


Now, just chanting 'Nauru' is not going to be a solution. We will monitor Labor's administration of this very closely. We have form from this government in the area of pink batts, Building the Education Revolution and the National Broadband Network, just to mention a few areas where the initial headlines were exceptionally good but the underlying policy was non-existent and the administration was absolutely appalling. If Nauru is to work we need policy conviction and commitments.


A Labor senator earlier today said that indefinite detention was not on the agenda. Let us be quite clear on this: the panel made it exceedingly clear—this is Labor's hand-picked panel—that if you are going to send a message it has to be firm and clear. The panel did use diplomatic language, and I accept that. But let us analyse what they actually said. They said that the boat people should not get a better outcome by virtue of coming here by boat. What does that mean—no advantage? It means that they should not be provided an advantage over the 10 million refugees around the world awaiting resettlement. It means they should get no advantage over the 100,000 seeking resettlement in Malaysia. They should get no advantage over the 5,000 waiting in Indonesia for resettlement. So what does this mean? This panel's recommendation means that the boat people will have to join the queues, and they will need to wait in line.


As I have said in these debates before: there is no social justice in any way, shape or form in giving advantage to people who deliberately bypass safe haven after safe haven after safe haven and then destroy their documents and pay criminals to gain entry into Australia, whilst there are others who have been waiting in refugee camps for nigh on two decades and who do not have the financial wherewithal to pay criminals to get them access into Australia.


During this past break from the parliament I personally spoke with refugees on the Thai-Burma border awaiting resettlement. It is very confronting when you have such a discussion with a person who has been displaced since 1994. Do those people understand that there is a queue? Yes, they do. Do they understand the need for some order in this area? Yes, they do. Do they understand that giving precedence to the illegal arrivals delays their resettlement? Yes, they do. And might I add that apart from visiting a refugee camp in Thailand I also visited a compound in Indonesia where a would-be boat person was housed who had never set foot in a refugee camp, and who had relatives back home drip-feeding him money from his accounts that he had been able to get a relative to manage. I make no apology for saying that my sympathy lies with the person who arrived in Thailand in 1994 rather than the would-be boat person who is still able to manage his financial affairs, courtesy of relatives, back in his former country. The point I seek to make on behalf of the coalition is that the government needs to send an unambiguously clear message: if Nauru allows easier access to resettlement than for the other 10 million then Nauru will have failed.


Whilst the coalition has pursued a three-pillars approach for over a decade, with temporary protection visas, offshore processing and turning back the boats, the ALP has pursued a three-pillars approach as well—one of ideological idiocy, wilful waste and desperate denial. The coalition did not need to outsource its policymaking in this area, as the government has done with this panel. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, on over 100 occasions called on the Prime Minister to pick up the phone to Nauru, and she refused. I understand that the government now finally has. There were four wasted years because of a deliberate refusal to pick up the phone. It is four years too late, but at least it has been done.


Let me also deal with the issue of turning back the boats, something that Ms Gillard supported whilst she was in opposition and then absolutely condemned, and now she sort of talks about virtual turn-backs. But, of course, we now know that Ms Gillard is a policy void in this area because she has outsourced, as has the Labor Party, the government's approach to an expert panel. But this is what the expert panel said on page 53 of their report in relation to turn-backs. I quote from paragraph 3.77:


Turning back irregular maritime vessels carrying asylum seekers to Australia can be operationally achieved and can constitute an effective disincentive to such ventures …


It is very clear. I do accept that at the end of that sentence there is a caveat that says 'only in circumstances where a range of operational, safety of life, diplomatic and legal conditions are met'. But clearly it is something that can be operationally achieved and can constitute an effective disincentive to such ventures. So why have the Labor Party and their fellow travellers in the commentariat sought to demonise the opposition year after year after year when we have said that that is part and parcel of the proposal to stop this dangerous game of people smuggling? Make no mistake: it is Australian policy—and these are not the coalition's words but the words of the Labor government's hand-picked panel—that 'the single most important priority in preventing people from risking their lives is to recalibrate Australian policy settings', and one of them, of course, is turning back the boats.


So if there are—and I understand and accept this—genuine Australians who are concerned about the number of deaths at sea then I say: ensure you stop the boats. When the Howard government stopped the boats, guess what: the deaths at sea also stopped. When the flood of boat arrivals started again with the election of the Rudd government, the number of deaths at sea also regrettably increased. I have said on a previous occasion and I repeat that I do not blame the government for the deaths at sea. The criminal people smugglers bear that consequence on their conscience. But, if we know that our policy settings are assisting the criminals, we have a duty and an obligation to ensure that they are put out of business. Clearly, according to Labor's own expert panel, turning back the boats is one of those measures that can work. That is why the coalition remains committed to its strong, fair border protection policy; that is why we believe the government is not going all the way that it should go; and that is why, on behalf of the coalition, I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


      but the Senate:


(a) notes that the Government has accepted the Coalition's policy of offshore processing of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island; and


(b) calls upon the Government to implement the full suite of the Coalition's successful policies and calls upon the Government to immediately:


(i) restore temporary protection visas for all offshore entry persons found to be refugees;


(ii) issue new instructions to Northern Command to commence to turn back boats where it is safe to do so;


(iii) use existing law to remove the benefit of the doubt on a person's identity where there is a reasonable belief that a person has deliberately discarded their documentation; and


(iv) restore the Bali Process to once again focus on deterrence and border security.


We have had four wasted years—four years of failed policy. We have had 22,000 arrivals that have displaced others. We have had hundreds of deaths at sea. We have had a $4.7 billion blow-out that the Australian taxpayers have had to fund. The coalition will support the legislation, but we do say that the stance we have taken in the face of vile vilification from those opposite and the commentariat, and the fact that we have withstood that vilification, has now been vindicated by this report. We commend the bill to the Senate, but we also say that things could be taken a lot further to ensure that these criminals are put out of business once and for all, as they were under the Howard government.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:59):  I rise today to oppose the legislation before the Senate. I do so saying that I think it is a tragedy in Australian public life that we have got to the point where the government and the coalition are trying to outdo each other on the level of cruelty and punishment they are prepared to inflict on refugees who are seeking asylum in our country.


The fact of the matter is everybody talks about a problem. The problem will not be fixed. What is the problem? The problem that is being cited is that people are losing their lives at sea on leaky boats and we have to stop that. I could not agree more, and I will come to that in a moment, but actually that is the fig leaf. The problem that the Houston panel refers to and that is spoken about in here by the government and the coalition is deterrence. Both of the major parties in Australia want to deter asylum seekers—refugees—from coming to live in our country. The whole message is: 'We do not want you in our country. We want to deter you from coming and we want to punish you so that we give the message out there clearly to the rest of you that we do not want you in our country and we will punish you if you try to come here. What we're going to try to do is punish you by taking you to Nauru, by taking you to Manus Island, by taking you to Malaysia, by leaving you in indefinite detention. That is the punishment so the message goes out to you and your families that we do not want you here. Don't even try to come; because, if you do try to come, that's what we're going to do to you.'


Why are we putting in place this notional view of deterrence when we are talking about people who are genuine refugees? No amount of punishment that we give people is going to be worse than the situation from which they have run. Women are running from Afghanistan because of the treatment that they are getting in that country. Recently there was the killing—the murder—of a woman in Afghanistan accused of adultery. She was murdered. A video about it went out around the world, and we had people in Australia from both the government and the coalition saying: 'This is terrible, this is terrible. This is why we need to be in Afghanistan.' Yes, it is terrible. But what if that woman's friends—what if people watching—decided they had to leave Afghanistan because it could be them next? We are saying: 'Yes, you should leave Afghanistan; it is a terrible situation. But we don't want you here. Go somewhere else. Land yourself up in a camp in Malaysia. Land yourself up in a camp in Indonesia and stay there. If you attempt to come here, we will send you into indefinite detention on Nauru, on Manus Island, in Malaysia or wherever else. We'll punish you. It's not enough you've been punished once; we have to punish you again.'


What is the crime that they have to be punished for? Their crime is that they have run away. They have been persecuted and have run away, and we say, 'No, we don't want you here.' We then go into this ridiculous language of advantage and disadvantage. 'Queue jumpers'—that is an invention of the Howard government. It assumes there is some sort of orderly queue of people running away from persecution. There is not. They are in all kinds of situations in Malaysia and Indonesia. But with this idea of advantage what people fail to realise is that Australia refuses to give visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka because we already think they are too great a risk that they might want to come to our country. They are so great a risk we will not give them a visa. Without a visa they cannot travel; they cannot come through normal channels.


Let us face it: 13,750 people can come to Australia on humanitarian refugee status now. We take over 200,000 people, but not these ones. If you can get a visa, you can fly in and seek asylum when you get here, and you can get that from many other countries—but not from these countries, because we deem them to be such a risk. So they get to these camps and have no hope of getting resettlement. They get to the point where they think the only hope they have is to get on a boat and hope they can get to Australia, hope they can be assessed as refugees—many of them are already assessed as refugees in Indonesia. And we say, 'No, our priority is to deter you.'


When the Greens stand up and say, 'If you are genuinely concerned about saving lives at sea, what you need to do is give people safe pathways to Australia once they are assessed as a refugee so they don't have to get on a boat', what is wrong with that?' The answer is, 'Open borders; we couldn't possibly risk it.' Nobody is talking about open borders. What we are talking about is lifting the humanitarian intake to recognise that, when there are periods of war and persecution around the world, there is an increase in the number of people seeking asylum. Australia, the land of the fair go, the generous country, takes less than two per cent of the world's refugees, and yet we feel like we have to deter them because suddenly we are going to be overcome by this two per cent of the world's refugees.


Let me go to the issue of people dying at sea. I will not have it that Senator Abetz stands there and says there is any vindication of his policies, because there is no vindication of his policies. There is no vindication of his general policy at all. I go particularly to this claim that former Prime Minister Howard stopped the boats. Firstly, what he did was excise territory so that when boats turned up they were not counted because they were not turning up in Australia. That is why there was a change in the figures: it is how they counted them. Secondly, they brought in temporary protection visas because they said, 'If we take away the rights of asylum seekers to apply to bring their families here, that'll deter them, that'll teach them, that'll punish them.' It led to the wives and children getting on the boats because they had no other way of joining their husbands, their brothers, their fathers in Australia. They died on the SIEVX. Three hundred and fifty-three people died because of temporary protection visas. That is forever on the conscience of Prime Minister Howard, Senator Sinodinos and everyone else who worked in that office at that time and exempted themselves from telling the truth or even turning up to the Senate inquiries.


To this day we have not had a royal commission into what happened with the SIEVX. How is it that that many people drowned and disappeared? Who knew? Where were our coastal surveillance people? Why did we leave it? Which vessels turned up there and shone their searchlights onto people in the water and then sailed away? Labor made it part of their policy, in 2004, to have a royal commission into this. That was dropped by Prime Minister Rudd. I want a royal commission into the SIEVX, and I would like that extended to the loss of the other boats that have come in the intervening years because there is a terrible tension between the policy of saying, 'We want to deter people, therefore we don't want to make it look as if we're a search and rescue service'—as the coalition would have said. No, we want to leave people to the very last minute; and so the tension is between deterrence on the one hand and Australia's obligation to save lives at sea on the other. The reason we have so many people suffering post-traumatic distress in the Navy and the rescue services is they know that people are in trouble but they are not being sent immediately, because we have to balance deterrence with rescuing people.


A boat went down recently with the terrible loss of life of 90 people. We knew they were in trouble on Tuesday afternoon but we did not tell the Indonesians until Thursday afternoon that we were going into their search and rescue zone to rescue those people because they were already in the water by then and 90 of them drowned. I want to know who made the decision not to go on Tuesday afternoon. I want to know who made the decision not to say to the Indonesians, 'We are going into the search and rescue zone,' because we Australians know the Indonesians do not have the physical capacity with boats to do so. The only boat they have cannot go out in swells of more than four metres. We know they do not have the boats. We know they do not have the electronic surveillance to know where people are. We do. We know where those boats are. We knew the Indonesians could not rescue them and yet we did not go. I want to know why.


Let us get this on the record: if you want to save lives at sea it is possible. One of the good things that has happened, as I have been calling for codification on saving lives at sea, is that the Prime Minister moved, over the winter break, to help the Indonesians develop more capacity for rescue. One of the excellent things that has come out of the Houston report is a recommendation that we codify our responsibilities under Saving Lives At Sea so that everybody in the chain of command—from intelligence identifying where a boat is through to the people on the ground rescuing them—has a consistent set of instructions and knows exactly what they are supposed to do. Let us have that on the record and let us see when we start getting calls for some decent and proper recommendations for the people who are doing everything in their power to save lives. This is not a criticism of the people who are out there trying to do the rescues. All of those people are trying to do the right thing and their frustration is that they know that, in many cases, they could have gone earlier and did not. That is not their fault.


I go to the actual policy of what is being recommended—sending vulnerable people, children, offshore. This legislation says that the minister relinquishes his guardianship responsibilities—his or her, it may be a male minister—so children coming on these boats can be put into detention indefinitely. Why do we think that is fair? Why do we think that is humane? Why do want to punish children? Because we want to send a message to their families that we do not want them here?


They are not temporary protection visas but they might as well be. The government wants to change the act so that the males who come cannot seek family reunion. That is exactly the logic that led before to 353 people, mainly women and children, drowning—and we are doing it again even though we know that is the result. It will lead to people knowing the only way they have any chance of coming to Australia is to get on a boat because they are not going to be allowed to apply through the special humanitarian opportunities and will be put at the back of the queue in terms of the assessment of refugee status and family reunion status. It will be years and years—decades—before it happens and that is why they have no choice. That is what is going on here.


One thing I think the Australian community has not realised is that there has been all this talk about protecting their rights: 'Yes, we will send them to Nauru; yes, we'll send them to Manus Island; yes, we'll send them to Malaysia—but don't worry, we'll protect their rights.' Why are we having to debate this and legislate? The rights already exist in the legislation at section 198A. Those rights are there. The reason we are doing this is the High Court said that we cannot guarantee people's human rights in these other places because they are not enshrined in law in Malaysia. We cannot guarantee to a person in a camp in Malaysia that they will be treated with decency and have their human rights respected. We know that people have been beaten and sexually assaulted, that they cannot work or send their children to school. Their rights are not enshrined—but we are required by law to do that and that is why the High Court said that the Gillard government's attempt to put people in Malaysia was against the law. The law codifies our obligations under the human rights convention and the refugee convention.


This parliament is now saying, 'Well, we'll get around the High Court by removing human rights protections from Australia's law.' What this clearly says is there is nothing legally binding about what will happen in relation to this. There might be people of good intent, and so on, but there is nothing legally binding in place. So people's rights cannot be protected under what is being proposed here. 


The other issue with it is this decision to excise the whole of the Australian mainland from the Migration Act so that everyone can be punished equally. Instead, the decent thing to have done would have been to repeal the excision of Christmas Island and the rest of the territory that was excised. We should have just got rid of the excision and had the whole of Australia operating under our migration law and our human rights obligations. I feel ashamed that our parliament is stripping human rights out of the migration law. We heard today of the Labor Party's proud tradition in being part of drafting the global human rights convention and I thought how ironic it is that we have a new member of parliament for the Labor Party standing up and saying how proud they are of being part of a tradition that drafted human rights on the very day that the Labor Party is moving to strip out of law human rights that people fought so hard to get a global treaty to implement. And the coalition is standing up there, beating its chest and saying, 'Aren't we marvellous, because we have now got Labor to agree with us and we are going to the bottom of a very rotten barrel.'


In terms of other things that this set of propositions does, there is the issue of permanent, indefinite detention. It is hard to believe in a country where we think we respect the rule of law that we could be saying to people, 'We are going to send you away and you are stuck there indefinitely,' when we know that the last time this happened people ended up with quite severe mental illness as a result of the experience. Patrick McGorry said recently that after six to 12 months people have psychological disturbance from being in detention, yet we are prepared to proactively do that to people. We are saying, 'You might be okay now, but we're going to lock you up and there is a high probability you're going to end up with a mental illness and psychiatric disturbance because of this, and we don't care; that is part of your punishment.' And then what happened, of course, was when it was all found to be so appalling, the taxpayers of Australia have had to pay out compensation for the way people were treated in the Nauru detention centre—and we are doing it again! If we do not learn the lessons of history we are condemned to repeat them, and this Senate is now repeating the lesson of history, which is that Australia's global reputation is now trashed, as it was during the Howard government years.


People around the world are going to be looking at us and saying that Australia wants to be on the United Nations Security Council, it wants to get on a global security council and it has just shown that it has zero respect for the United Nations, for the treaties of the United Nations, particularly when it comes to human rights and refugees, which are central issues pertaining to security and how you respond to security crises around the world. I would be surprised if there were any other civilised countries in the world—and by that I mean countries that respect human rights—that would think it was appropriate to vote for Australia to go onto the Security Council. We have embarrassed ourselves. We have an opportunity in this century—it is the first time ever that Australia has been well located in a global context to take a leadership role. We are an Asian nation. We have so much to offer in terms of leadership, democracy, human rights, decency, a fair go, multiculturalism—all those things we have to offer. We had an opportunity to engage in the region in a leadership role in a regional framework that respects human rights, that underpins the regional framework with human rights. We could have then said, having increased our own intake, 'We will now ask other countries to assist us to take people,' but we have not. 


The government ought to be ashamed. The Greens are standing here pleading with the Senate to think about our nation. What sort of country do we want to live in and how can we have self-respect as Australians if we harden our hearts when people ask us for help?

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:19):  I rise with a heavy heart to speak on this bill. I think it will become clear as I go through my contribution why I say that. The first thing I want to say is that I listened intently to Senator Abetz, who spoke about the Pacific solution. I do not know any expert anywhere in the world who thinks there is some quick solution to the problem of refugees and asylum seekers around the world. There is no quick and easy solution. 


I want to state my deep disappointment that the bill that was before the Senate in June failed to pass. In my view, that bill was far from perfect but it provided for a better policy outcome than does this bill. In terms of the humanitarian values that I hold on this issue and the policy outcomes that I would prefer, I believe that this bill is a step backwards from the position that was before us in June. I have already indicated my disappointment with the Greens for what I believe is an immature political position that they adopted in June. As on carbon pricing, on this issue their political puritanism and their complete unwillingness to make any compromise on what they call their principles has given us this bill, which is a lesser bill in my view than that which was before us in June. For the Greens, any compromise on their part is an unconscionable backdown that cannot be tolerated. For everyone else, according to the Greens, failure to agree with them is an unconscionable sellout.


As Waleed Aly points out in the current edition of the Monthly, 'The Greens are perfectly capable of shedding crocodile tears when it comes to the human rights of asylum seekers.' When the Greens refused what may ultimately have been a disingenuous offer from the coalition to increase the refugee intake to 20,000 and limit processing times to 12 months, largely reflecting Greens policy, they knocked it back because of their humanitarian concerns about processing on Nauru. As Aly points out, 'Apparently, asylum seekers' human rights must be protected even if it kills them.' Let me just remind the Greens what the UNHCR had to say about the government's arrangement with the government of Malaysia. The UNHCR: 


 … welcomes the fact that an additional 4000 refugees from Malaysia will obtain a durable solution through resettlement to Australia. The potential to work towards safe and humane options for people other than to use dangerous sea journeys are also positive features of this Arrangement. In addition, the Malaysian Government is in discussions with UNHCR on the registration of refugees and asylum-seekers under the planned Government programme announced in June on the registration of all migrant workers.


The Arrangement and its implementing guidelines contain important protection safeguards, including respect for the principle of non-refoulement; the right to asylum; the principle of family unity and best interests of the child; humane reception conditions including protection against arbitrary detention; … and the ability to receive education, access to health care, and a right to employment.


That is what the UNHCR had to say about the Malaysian agreement—an approach that provided the basis for a truly regional approach to dealing with asylum seekers but an approach that the Greens were too pure to accept, and they rejected it. And here we are with Nauru and Manus Island staring us in the face because of what I believe was the political immaturity and the intransigence of the Greens. But, clearly, the greatest shame on this issue lies at the feet of the coalition. 


We hear much in this place about the history of political parties. As I have done on many occasions in my time here, I want to quote Robert Menzies. In a radio broadcast on 24 July 1942, Menzies had this to say about his Liberal creed:


Fear can never be a proper or useful ingredient in those mutual relations of respect and goodwill which ought to exist between the elector and the elected.


And so, as we think about it we shall find more and more how disfiguring a thing fear is in our own political and social life.


If there is ever an example about a disfiguring position in political life it is the situation that we face now with the propositions and the fear campaigns being run by coalition on the issue of refugees and asylum seekers.


The inflammatory rhetoric of the coalition is all about fear. It is totally against the Menzies creed. It is about fear and loathing for asylum seekers. The inflammatory rhetoric never misses a beat. The coalition rail against asylum seekers. The dog whistle is turned up to full volume. They cast doubt, without any evidence, on the credentials of asylum seekers. They insinuate that they might be terrorists. The claim they could bring disease to Australia. They fabricate claims of them throwing children overboard so that they might be considered unworthy of coming to this country. They claim that the very act of boarding a boat is un-Christian. The fact that the asylum seekers might actually be religious Hindus, Buddhists or Muslims matters little when the dog whistle is set at full volume. There is only one religion according to the coalition monoculturalists.


The cowardice of the coalition was on full display yesterday in the other place. In his contribution to the debate on this bill, the Leader of the Opposition could not help himself, dragging the debate straight into the gutter, as he does every single day. If anyone is responsible for the risible state of political discourse in this country, it is the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott. He lives in the political gutter. He is incapable of lifting himself out of it. 


What sort of political coward, other than Mr Abbott, would try to distance himself from the grubby remarks of a shock jock by repeating them unprompted and completely out of context in the parliament? That is what Mr Abbott did yesterday when he claimed, adopting the old coward's rhetorical trick, to not endorse the stupid and grubby remarks of Melbourne shock jock Neil Mitchell. The best way to repudiate Mitchell would have been to ignore him. By not ignoring Mitchell, Mr Abbott effectively endorsed him by giving him undeserved prominence.


While ever the likes of Mr Abbott, Mr Morrison and many of those opposite continue with the campaign of fear and loathing they have waged against asylum seekers for well over a decade, it will be difficult to crush the lies, to allay the ill-founded fears, to promote understanding and to draw on the better angels of Australians' nature that should characterise public debate on this issue. I will not shirk the task of waging the battle from the other side of the debate.


Why do refugees seek asylum in Australia? Why do they do this from all around the world? I listened to Senator Abetz, and there was not one mention of the reasons people are en masse trying to flee their native country and seek resettlement and refuge in countries around the world. The whole underpinning of the reason that people flee their own country was never mentioned. They do it because of racial persecution—something that I am sure the coalition would claim they do not support. They do it because of religious persecution—but I suppose unless you are a Christian it does not really matter! They do it because of political persecution. Some of them do it for economic reasons, because they are living in abject poverty with absolutely no hope for themselves or their family into the future. Some of them have suffered famine and they leave because there is famine and they seek refuge from famine. They seek refuge from dictatorships. They seek refuge from tyranny. They seek refuge from war. Yet these people, who are seeking refuge and support around the world, are treated to the dog whistle and the politics of fear from the coalition.


International law recognises that people at risk of persecution have a legal right to flee their country and seek refuge elsewhere. From March this year Australia adopted a complementary protection regime. This allows for protection of people who may not fit the strict definition of a refugee but who, should they be returned to their country of origin, will suffer a real risk of personal harm.


It is appropriate to look at some of the myths that abound in relation to asylum seekers. There is the myth that boat people are queue jumpers. The fact is that in Iraq and Afghanistan there are no queues for people to jump. Australia has no diplomatic representation in these countries and supports the international coalition of nations who continue to oppose these regimes and support sanctions against them. There is no standard refugee process where people wait in line to have their applications considered. Few countries between the Middle East and Australia are signatories to the 1951 Refugee Convention and, as such, asylum seekers are forced to continue to travel to another country to find protection.


That is why I find it bizarre that the Greens are still arguing that there should be no arrangements made with any country unless they actually sign off on the international conventions. I would prefer countries signed off on the international conventions, but that is not likely. So the Greens' position is that we then disenfranchise the majority of nations between here and the Middle East from playing any practical and positive role in a regional approach to dealing with refugees and asylum seekers. I think it is hypocrisy; I think it is stupidity; and I think it is ideological purity gone mad. I think we need to actually deal with some of these issues that we are faced with.


It is no secret that I opposed the proposition for this legislation in the party room. It is public knowledge. I did that because I wanted time to actually read the report, analyse the report and consult on the report with a number of my colleagues and friends, who for years have been supporters of refugees in this country. I wanted to get the view of the refugee groups and I wanted to get the views of the UNHCR. But that was not a position supported by the majority of my colleagues in the party room, and that is why the debate is on here today. And it is a debate that will continue, because there is no solution to the issue of asylum seekers fleeing. I take the view that, if you are fleeing for your life, no amount of deterrents will stop you looking for a safe haven—and I think that is what we have to understand when we try to get a regional approach to refugees put in place.


We heard Senator Abetz laud the so-called Pacific solution. I do agree with the previous speaker, who indicated that there was no solution. That is true—there was no solution. In fact, 43 per cent of the refugees who went to Nauru were ultimately resettled to Australia, some 27 per cent to New Zealand and, according to refugee groups, they believe that the others who returned to their country of origin, if they had stayed in Nauru, would have been resettled as well. So almost everyone who went to Nauru under the so-called Pacific solution ended up being genuine refugees and ended up being resettled.


The argument from the coalition that we should reintroduce temporary protection visas is, again, another spin, another lie and another deception—a deception to try to place some respect on that outrageous Pacific solution. The former Commonwealth minister for health, a Liberal, Dr Michael Wooldridge, had earlier described as 'deeply flawed and dangerous' the spurious claim that Australia should only be a temporary haven for refugees before they are sent back again when things get better, arguing that creating insecurity and uncertainty, as these views undoubtedly do, is one of the most dangerous ways to add to the harm that torturers do.


Out of the mouths of Liberals comes the truth—courageous Liberals; Liberals that were not prepared to accept the rhetoric and spin, and lies and misinformation that the coalition claim as their Pacific policy. It is clear that turn-backs will not work. It is okay for Senator Abetz to cherry-pick some aspects of the report, but the report clearly says that things have changed since the turn-back situation. Paragraph 3.78 on page 54 of the report says:


Circumstances have changed since the limited number of turn-backs of irregular vessels carrying asylum seekers in Australia over a decade ago. The legal context has changed. The attitudes of many regional governments have evolved … 


And I could go on. The argument that you can turn the boats around without legal consequences, without safety consequences and without getting agreement from the nation that you are trying to turn the boats around to is exposed and destroyed in this report. Far from endorsing turn-backs, this report says you cannot do it. And yet we still have the lies and the rhetoric and the misinformation being peddled by the coalition to try and say that you can turn boats around, when the experts clearly say you cannot do it.


In my view, it is time for the Greens to get rid of their ideological purity and to start behaving like a mature political party. It is time for the coalition to stop lying to the Australian public, to stop misrepresenting and vilifying and demonising people who are in genuine plight and who are looking for refuge in this country. It is time we lifted the standards in this country. If we had done so earlier, we may not have needed Nauru and Manus Island; we could have had a decent policy in this country. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-08-15,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (18:39):  I too rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I would like to put the debate today into context. This is a government that has performed what is now going to be recognised as one of the greatest political backflips of all time. This is a government that for the last four years has claimed to the people of Australia and to the coalition that offshore processing on Nauru will not work. This is a government that, just six short weeks ago, condemned the opposition for wanting to include Nauru as an offshore processing centre. This is a government that was prepared to do absolutely nothing at all on border protection rather than concede that Nauru should be reopened to house asylum seekers. This is a government whose then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said on 17 November 2008 in an address to the Refugee Council of Australia:




Labor committed to abolishing the Pacific Solution and this was one the first things the Rudd Labor Government did on taking office. It was also one of my greatest pleasures in politics. Neither humane nor fair, the Pacific Solution was
 also ineffective and wasteful.



The minister arrogantly reconfirmed those words yesterday in question time, in answer to a question from Senator Abetz. Jump forward to today, 15 August 2012, and what are we faced with as a parliament? What is the Australian public faced with by way of policy? After four years of Labor telling the coalition and the people of Australia that Nauru would not work, and that the Pacific solution was neither humane nor fair and that it was ineffective and wasteful, on Monday, former Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston—the man hand-picked by the current Gillard Labor government to advise them on border protection, because Labor had abrogated their policy-making responsibility in this area—said that Nauru will work.


Policy failure, denial, inconsistency and inaction had frozen the government's decision-making ability and rendered this Labor government so incapable that it had to turn to an independent panel to solve its border protection debacle. The coalition has been telling the government for years, based on the evidence, that Labor's border protection policies have failed. We have repeatedly told the government that Labor's policy has developed a business model for the criminal smugglers; that it has created opportunities for those smugglers to make huge profits by putting desperate people on boats and sending them out to sea. And indeed, Air Chief Marshal Houston's expert panel has confirmed that pull factors created by Labor's policies were significantly responsible for the resumption of the people smugglers' criminal activities after the abolition of the Howard government's policies.


Air Chief Marshal Houston's expert panel report is without a doubt the most devastating critique that has ever been made of government policy in this country. And I remind Australians that this is not a coalition report; this was not a coalition panel. This is a government report. The government asked for it, the government received it and the government now owns it. This was an expert panel that was hand-picked by Ms Gillard herself. The government—and Ms Gillard—wrote the terms of reference for the committee. The government—and Ms Gillard—then charged the committee with its inquiry. And now the government has the findings of the expert panel. The fact is, as much as those on the other side want to discount this, the findings of the expert panel substantially endorse the coalition's approach to stopping the boats.


For years now, the Labor government has been telling the people of Australia that you cannot turn back the boats. Angus Houston and the expert panel say that you can. Indeed, on page 53 of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, at paragraph 3.77, it states:


Turning back irregular maritime vessels carrying asylum seekers to Australia can be operationally achieved and can constitute an effective disincentive to such ventures …


The expert panel made a total of 22 recommendations. Those recommendations included that offshore processing in Nauru and on Manus Island at Papua New Guinea be established as soon as practicable. Offshore processing has always been the coalition's policy. The expert panel also recommended the prohibiting of family reunion through Australia's humanitarian program for people arriving by boat, instead making boat arrivals apply for family reunion through the family stream of the migration program. Again, this is in the spirit of temporary protection visas, which are coalition policy.


The expert panel also recommended turning back irregular maritime vessels in operational conditions where it can be achieved and that this can constitute an effective deterrent to these ventures. Again, this continues to be coalition policy. The expert panel also recommended that the protections for asylum seekers set out in the Malaysian people swap are inadequate. Again, this has been the coalition's consistent position on the government's Malaysian people swap deal. These findings—the findings of the government's own hand-picked expert panel—reflect what has been the coalition's consistent position on border protection in Australia.


I remind senators that it was back on 13 July 2010 that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, first said to Labor members that they should advise the Prime Minister to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru. Twenty-three times before the last election the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said that, if the government were serious about stopping the boats, the Prime Minister should pick up the phone to the President of Nauru. History now records, however, that the Prime Minister refused to do that. She refused to do that before the election. She refused to do that after the election. She refused to do it when the High Court ruled the Malaysia solution invalid. She refused to do it in January of this year after discussions between the coalition and the government. And the Prime Minister refused to do it just six weeks ago. On 106 occasions Mr Abbott has respectfully urged the Prime Minister to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru. If only she had not refused, we may have been able to save desperate people from making a potentially deadly voyage across open seas in a leaky boat.


The last four years have seen one of the greatest policy failures of this government. The reason we say that is that the Labor government, when they assumed office, were handed a solution in the form of the Howard government's border protection policies and, when elected, they deliberately and wilfully set out to dismantle those policies. The result of this deliberate and wilful dismantling of what were proven border protection policies and what had achieved the results that the government is telling the people of Australia it wants to achieve today with its border protection policies is this: the arrival of 389 boats, carrying 22,718 asylum seekers. If you want further confirmation of the extent of the policy failure that this government has wreaked upon this portfolio area, it is that the number of boats under Prime Minister Gillard alone has exceeded the number of boats and the number of people who arrived in the 11 years of the Howard government.


The Labor government and the current Prime Minister should apologise to the people of Australia for their abject failure when it comes to protecting Australia's borders. They should apologise to the people of Australia for dismantling the Howard government's proven border protection policies. They should apologise to the mums and dads of Australia for the billions of dollars they have now wasted over the last four years—to the tune of $4.7 billion of taxpayers' money in budget blow-outs because of their mismanagement of border protection policy. Australians are now paying an additional $1.1 million per day because of Labor's failure in this important area. This is not good news for the mums and dads of Australia who cannot afford to pay their electricity bills because of the impact of the carbon tax on them. The blame for this can be put squarely at the feet of an incompetent Labor government. They have failed Australians when it comes to border protection, and it is the Australian taxpayer who has to clean up Labor's mess.


The government should also apologise for offering a business model to the people smugglers, who have by their criminal actions caused untold suffering to the families of the over 1,000 people who lost their lives at sea attempting to make the dangerous journey to Australia by boat. The sad reality is that none of this waste, none of this mismanagement and none of this loss of life need ever have occurred. Why? Because we gave the Labor government the solution when they were elected in November 2007. We gave them the greatest gift that can ever be given to a political party in this country. We solved Australia's border protection problems.


The coalition is on the record as always supporting offshore processing at Nauru and at Manus Island. That was our policy and it continues to be our policy. To those on the other side who want to say that this is Nauru mark II, you are incorrect. You are adopting the coalition's policy in this regard. For those on the other side who want to say that there was razor wire on Nauru under the coalition government, that is just blatantly wrong. For those who want to say that the IOM is now involved under Labor, well, guess what? The IOM was also involved when the coalition was in power and was operating Nauru.


There is one fundamental difference though between what the coalition did and what the Labor Party, by this bill, are proposing, and that is the issue of indefinite detention. Whilst this Labor policy is supported by the coalition, we do acknowledge that asylum seekers may end up being in indefinite detention on Nauru. They were never indefinitely detained under coalition policy. Under the Houston report and under this legislation, they may well be indefinitely detained by this government.


Australians can only imagine what might have not occurred had the government not unwound the coalition government's proven border protection policies. The Labor Party could not help themselves. Even as late as 27 June this year, Minister Bowen was on the record as stating:


The Opposition says … that a detention centre on Nauru would work as a disincentive. We disagree …


Then on 28 June 2012, the minister said:


It has been a matter of record in this House that Nauru, a Christmas Island style detention centre further away, will not break the people smugglers' business model.


We have now done a full circle. An expert panel had to be commissioned by a government that lacked the political will and the political judgment to take the necessary steps and make the hard decisions in this portfolio area—decisions that the Howard government took when they were faced with a very similar situation in the early 2000s. The government now have the expert panel's report that effectively endorses the coalition's policy on border protection.


The Houston report has given the green light to Nauru and it has given the red light to Malaysia. In relation to Malaysia, the expert report panel made it clear that Malaysia, as proposed by the government, does not have sufficient protections. The Houston panel said that very, very clearly: the Malaysian people-swap protections under Labor do not measure up. It is something that the expert panel has said. It is something that the High Court has said. And it is something that the coalition have consistently said and that is why at all times we have opposed the government's Malaysian people-swap deal.


Australians have to wonder why we are debating this legislation today when we could have been debating it years ago. Australians have to wonder why the government over the last four years have consistently pretended that Nauru would not work. Why did the government invent and propagate the wild and indeed false claims that Nauru would cost billions? Why the stubbornness that has now done so much damage to Australia? Too much has been lost over the past four years and Australians are right to continue to question the disastrous judgement of a Prime Minister who continually gets it so wrong.


Today, the shadow minister for immigration has written to Minister Bowen on the costings for Nauru. We undertook to examine the costings for Nauru and our costings come in considerably lower than those of the government's. Today, we have written to the government and shown them how we believe that Nauru should be developed. We will be watching the government very, very closely as to how they spend taxpayers' money in this regard. They did not heed us in relation to what we have been saying about Nauru over the last four years and they have been proven wrong. Please do not now disregard the evidence of our costings again because of sheer stubbornness. If they can properly implement Nauru based on the Nauru costings that the coalition have, I would advocate to them to take on this advice.


The coalition's policies on border protection have been proven to work. Ms Gillard has been proven to be wrong about Nauru. She continues to be proven to be wrong when it comes to temporary protection visas and turning back the boats. In supporting this legislation, the coalition have made it very, very clear to the government that we support this legislation, but it is only one step forward under a three-pronged approach. They will not get the Howard government results if they do not fully implement the Howard government's policies. 


On the implementation, the coalition know that if the Labor Party, to appease its own left wing, turn Nauru into a perceived soft option, the people smugglers will continue to recognise Labor's lack of genuine commitment. The people smugglers' business model will not be broken and they will continue their criminal activities, and the boats will continue to arrive. In government, the coalition will ensure that the management of offshore processing on Nauru is appropriate to protect the rights of asylum seekers, but we will not allow Nauru to be seen by the people smugglers as a soft option. 


As a member of the coalition, I welcome the government's monumental backflip in relation to border protection policy and the fact that they have finally decided to agree with Nauru as an offshore processing destination and Manus Island as an offshore processing destination, and adopt what has proven to be good coalition policy. Whilst the coalition support the legislation today, I remind those on the other side that we in no way step back from our policies and our commitment to the Australian public that, if and when we are elected, we will reintroduce temporary protection visas and we will turn back the boats where it is safe to do so. These are the policies that worked under Mr Howard and these are the policies that will work again.


These proven policies were not introduced in the last six weeks; they are the result of more than 10 years of successful implementation and continual refinement under a government that took its role and responsibility in relation to border protection very seriously, and those policies will be reinstated by a future coalition government. The coalition have been consistent on border protection and the Australian public acknowledge that and they know that. They trust us when it comes to protecting Australia's borders.


The contrast they have is this: a Labor government that has held every position under the sun when it comes to protecting Australian borders. The Australian people simply cannot trust Labor. Australia is only in the mess it is in today because Labor, when it was given a solution, took deliberate and wilful steps to create a problem. History now records what has been the result of that problem, and Labor has adopted failed policy after failed policy in a pathetic attempt to clean up their tragic mess. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2012-08-15,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:59):  I am deeply saddened to be speaking today to oppose this Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 because I believe that we, the parliament of Australia, are making a grave mistake—a mistake that generations to come will find very difficult to understand. I do know that this is a tough decision and I do know that there are no easy answers. The movement of people fleeing persecution and seeking protection in foreign lands is a problem that has occurred for many centuries; it is a problem that has escalated in recent decades; and it is an issue that is far beyond the power of this parliament to resolve.


I also know that there are many good people in this place who have wrestled with their conscience, who have listened to the arguments and have formed the view that punishment is necessary because they believe it acts as a deterrent to others and, in doing so, might prevent deaths. They are wrong, but they are driven by good intentions.


I do fear, however, that there are also many others in this place who believe that punishment is necessary, not because they have ever believed that refugees have a right to seek our protection or that we as a wealthy domestic sanctuary should provide protection to these people. We have in this country a long and sometimes deeply shameful history when it comes to race and it is hard for me to escape the fact that race is one part of the equation when it comes to immigration policy. 'We decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come' has nothing to do with concern for the most vulnerable people on this planet and everything to do with the sorts of cold-hearted and sometimes racist attitudes that have driven this debate for more than a decade.


As a young doctor I learned about the Hippocratic oath, the key tenet of which is: first do no harm. This piece of legislation violates that key principle. We hear much about 'deterrence'. That has become the word around which this debate has been framed, but let us call it what it is. What we are really saying is that it is acceptable to inflict punishment, to inflict suffering, to inflict misery on one group of people in an effort to try and change the behaviour of another group of people. That violates that key principle, the principle I have always held dear: first do no harm.


If what we were being asked to do today was to turn our backs on people who need our protection, that in and of itself would be bad enough. But we are not only being asked to do that; we are being asked to actively inflict more pain and suffering on the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on this planet. Imagine at the age of 16 being on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and watching your family being removed from a bus and being shot before your eyes. Imagine returning home and being told: 'You're next.' Imagine then fleeing your culture, your traditions, your language, your friends and family, arriving in a foreign country, finding your way across the seas in a perilous journey and then being told that you will be imprisoned, detained, with no prospect of your claim being assessed and processed in a timely way and not knowing what your future holds. That is what we are being asked to vote on today with this bill. That alone is cause not to support it. But there is evidence that that sort of punishment, as severe and as harsh as it may be, will not work, will not stop people from seeking sanctuary in this country and may in fact make their suffering and the suffering of others worse.


This is a debate that has been based on assertion, not evidence. We now are in an era of post-truth politics, where if you say something often enough and for long enough it becomes the truth—and so it is with the mantra 'We stopped the boats.' There is good evidence that there were a number of factors outside of the control of the Australian government that resulted in the changes in boat arrivals to this country. In fact, we saw one of the greatest tragedies in Australian waters in our history with the sinking of the SIEVX well after many of the harshest elements of the Pacific solution were introduced. This is a case of correlation, not causality. Some people in the opposition need a lesson in the distinction between correlation and causality. Just because something happens while you are in government does not mean that you are responsible for it.


Of course, there is the question of whether the practical nature of the solution put in front of us will stop people from coming here. We have already heard accounts from people waiting in places such as Malaysia and Indonesia who have told us that this will not change their decision because the alternative is something they simply cannot contemplate. Think about that. You are fleeing a situation where you face near certain death, you are sitting in limbo where you have no access to education or health care, no prospect of seeing your family, the potential for imprisonment and the potential that already exists of dying at sea, and a change that says, 'We will process you and if that claim is successful then at some point you will be welcomed into Australia.' Why would you choose not to make that trip? 


Perhaps more concerning is the evidence that was presented to us that in fact it may make matters worse, that in some instances, in a small number of cases where people's behaviour may change, they may choose to take a riskier journey. We have heard evidence now of trips to New Zealand. We know that parts of the Tamil community are arriving in Canada. We know that simply because people do not drown in Australian waters does not diminish the fact that they drown and die elsewhere. If it results in simply an outsourcing of the misery and suffering occurring in Australian waters, then surely that is not a reason to pursue this policy.


I heard from Senator Cameron earlier about his response to the Greens' position. I will not respond in detail to his comments. I know that his words, like many others in his position, come from a place of anger. I can only imagine what it would be like to spend a good part of your life arguing against a policy, then to argue within your own party for taking some time to reflect and think about whether this is the best course of action for the nation, only to be denied and, worse still, to be forced to come to this place and defend that legislation. His anger is understandable.


Much has been spoken about compromise. I heard that quite a lot from Senator Cameron. Compromise is an interesting notion when it comes to a debate like this. It somehow implies that the truth lies between two political viewpoints, that the right thing to do lies between two political decisions. The truth is that the right thing to do, the moral thing to do, has no relationship whatsoever with the views of what one part of politics might say or what the other side of politics might say. The truth is independent of what we say in this place, and in fact in some instances compromise means no more and no less than a betrayal of the things that we believe in. So I know that that has been the mantra from some people within the Labor Party and within the opposition and, indeed, from within the media, but I say to them that compromise means nothing if it achieves an outcome that results in more pain, more suffering and more misery for some of our most vulnerable members of the community.


I too, like Senator Cameron, wanted to take some time to reflect on what other groups might have said about this position. I was fortunate enough to be in a cross-party meeting where we heard presentations from a number of people and a number of groups, groups like Amnesty International, the Human Rights Commission, academics and others. We have subsequently heard from groups like the ACTU, the Uniting Church and a number of other people working within this area of public policy. What has become clear is that they believe that we as a nation are making a grave mistake. We have heard much about the Houston report and the expert panel, but let us not forget that that panel ignored many of the submissions made by groups like Amnesty and others that recommended that we take a different path. They too are experts and I listen to what they have to say.


I have also heard a lot of talk about the notion of finding a solution to this problem. We need to ask ourselves: who is this solution for? Are we trying to solve a political problem or are we trying to solve an issue that affects the lives of refugees? What I have not heard is people asking refugees and asylum seekers themselves what is in their interest. Many of us purport to act in their interest—well, if we are doing that why not ask what is in their interest? We do not do that because the answer provides us with an uncomfortable truth. They do not want us to go down this path. The reality is that this is a solution to what is a domestic political problem and what we have got here is a political response, a political solution. 


I know that this is a tough decision for many people in this place. I understand that. But I do fear what will come as a result of the action that we are taking here today: the memories of people protesting in detention centres in far-flung places, the memories of young children scarred by their experiences in long-term detention. I fear that what we are seeing here is not a solution but in fact the creation of a terrible, terrible problem. I do understand that many people in this place are genuinely torn. I do understand that people have wrestled with their conscience. I do understand that. But we need to understand that as a rich and wealthy nation, being able to offer protection is a sign of strength and not weakness, that being able to offer a helping hand rather than turning our back, is a principle by which we should all live our lives. We should be motivated to do what is right, not what is politically expedient. And we should be motivated to compromise only when compromise brings us closer to that aim, not when it means that we can sweep a very, very difficult and genuinely discomfiting debate from the pages of the newspapers.


In closing, I believe that we as a nation are making a tremendous mistake. I think that what we must do now is everything we can to ensure that this piece of legislation is improved. It is why the Greens have an amendment that puts a time line on the time that will be spent in mandatory detention. The thought of a young 12-year-old going to Nauru and returning from that place as an adult is one that is, for me, far too difficult to contemplate. I hope that we can look at that amendment and at least make a bad piece of legislation slightly better. I do hope that we are not here again in the lead-up to another election campaign, trying to defend the indefensible.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (19:15):  I too rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I do not think that there is anybody in this place who does not react to tragic loss of life, and we certainly have seen that. I think it has affected everybody in this place and, certainly, people right across the nation. There is no doubt that this is a very, very difficult issue.


But I think what has been so concerning for the Australian people is the inability of this Labor government to do anything about it to date. That has really concerned people. People I talk to—mostly across regional areas, where I spend most of my time—have been so concerned with the government's complete inability to deal with the issue. It has affected a lot of people, and certainly they have had no confidence that the government has been able to do anything to try and deal with this issue.


Let us not forget: when we were in office this situation had all but been resolved. When the coalition left office there was a handful of people in detention. We had policies in place that had acted as a deterrent for the people smugglers, that significantly slowed down the boats and, indeed, it left us with a handful of people in detention. This is the important point that many people have not raised and which has been missed over the last few years, I think. It is the fact that the Labor government chose to change that policy. They chose to change the policy that had been working to stop the tide, to stop the flow of the boats coming to the country. We need to recognise that it was this Labor government that made that change.


We have seen in recent times a lot of focus and a lot of spotlight being put on the coalition—to date, from previous times until now—that we would not compromise and that we would not agree with what the government wanted to do, and it was all the coalition's fault that there could not be any kind of resolution to this issue when it came to things like the Malaysian solution. But if the government had never changed the policies in the first place we would not have been in that position. It was not the coalition's fault that the government's policy in this area simply was not working. We were not going to sign up to a plan with a country that was not a signatory to the international refugee conventions. We were not going to do that, and I think that was absolutely the right thing to do.


I think there was probably a lot of headshaking across the nation today and yesterday when we saw the change from the government in this policy. And we are supporting it—there is no doubt about that. It very much reflects what the coalition had in place. But the headshaking I refer to is the utter confusion and dismay from the Australian people that the Labor government and the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, were so stubborn that they refused to change the policy to a policy that was going to work simply because of their stubbornness. One of my colleagues in the other place—indeed, it was the shadow foreign minister—last night referred to the fact that the government was stupid. I think she was absolutely correct because the definition of stupidity is doing things the same way and expecting a different outcome.


That is exactly what the government has done over the last period of years. They kept doing things the same; they refused to change to the policy that had been proven to work, and now it has been put forward by the Houston report that it will work—what they see will work. I think the Australian people are absolutely dismayed that it has taken this long—this long!—for the government to bring in legislation to this place, under good advice, that will work and that will do the right thing by all those people. It will act as a deterrent, reflecting the coalition policy and what we have been asking the government to do for the last four years.


Debate interrupted.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (19:20):  I rise tonight to speak about a program at the Australian National University which offers students from Australia and indeed around the world an opportunity to come to Canberra and partake of an internship. Internships are available in the ACT Legislative Assembly, or a number of government or non-government organisations. One very popular option for students who are seeking to do an internship placement in Canberra is in this Parliament House. Members of parliament and senators are encouraged to take on interns, who are eager to learn and want to impress and work in a professional working environment.


I certainly found that to be the case with Marisa Diaz, the intern who worked in my office earlier this year. Marisa is a student of political science at the Northeastern University in Boston Massachusetts, and was interested in doing an internship that was relevant to her studies. She expressed to her university that she had an interest in doing an internship in an overseas government, and they gave her the choice of the governments of Australia, Ireland or England. Marisa was most interested in coming to Australia so her next step was to apply to the Australian National University's internship program, where she was able to say that her preference was to work for a senator or a member of parliament.


Once Marissa had been accepted into the Australian National Internship Program and began to work for me as an intern I was able to nominate a topic of my choice for her to research. Obviously, this topic became her research project. Her final grade for the internship will be determined after she is assessed for a research paper on the topic given to her, along with a complementary presentation and a follow-up reflective essay. The research project topic that was given to her was the Murray-Darling Basin. Specifically, she looked into water resource distribution amongst Murray-Darling Basin states based on their population and the governance of water in the Murray-Darling Basin.


In total Marisa worked for 11 weeks from the parliamentary office, beginning her project in late February and completing it at the end of May. Working out of the parliamentary office in Canberra meant that she was able to use the fantastic resources made available to her at Parliament House to assist her in finding the information that she needed. It is best to hear from Marisa in her own words how it felt to work out of Parliament House. She said of the experience: 'As the political base of Australia I have truly been in my element surrounded by others with my same interests. Working in Parliament House has also been an amazing opportunity. To have access to the people and resources that help to run this country has been truly amazing.'


We are currently awaiting word from Marisa regarding her final grade. The written report she was required to submit at the end of her internship is a major component of the assessment, weighing in at 80 per cent of her final grade. The research paper will be assessed by at least two academics. In some cases there is a need for a third assessor. The formal presentation component of her grade is worth the remaining 20 per cent. The spoken presentation was required to last up to 25 minutes, and in that time she had to summarise the key findings of her research report. The presentation is to complement the written research paper. At the conclusion of the formal presentation, there was a question and answer session in which the assessors asked questions relating to the report. She was marked not only for her presentation but also on how well she managed to answer the questions that she faced from the assessors. The third and final component of the internship program is a requirement for the student to produce a reflective essay at the completion of the internship. This compulsory essay is an essential yet non-marked component of the program.


From what I was able to witness of Marisa's internship it was clear to me that she was gaining invaluable experience working from an office in Parliament House. She was not the only one to gain from the experience of the internship. I was able to benefit from the information that she was producing from the research paper and I was also able to use that information to gain a better understanding of a topic that is very near and dear to any South Australian senator's heart. I believe that as senators and members of parliament we need to encourage young people to take an interest in politics. One way of doing that is certainly by continuing to support and encourage such programs as the Australian National Internships Program, which provide real life experiences to young people. Marisa's work ethic was impressive, and one of the things I found to be invaluable about the internship was that she came to the position with a fresh new perspective and was looking at the topic with a fresh set of ideas. Any program capable of producing that is worth taking on.


To be eligible, a student must be enrolled as a tertiary student in a university in Australia or overseas. Excellent written and spoken English skills are also a requirement for the applicants. Once accepted, students are then required to enrol into the ANU, where they remain enrolled for the duration of the internship. Internships are offered in semester 1 from late February to June and in semester 2 from July to October. Depending on individual circumstances and which level of study a student is currently at, students are eligible for either a part-time or a full-time placement. Students who land a part-time placement are also required to take a class at the ANU. Students are charged tuition fees. Overseas students need to discuss their fees with the relevant contacts at their universities, while Australian students pay HECS fees.


International students who secure an internship position through the ANU are able to take on paid employment during the period of their internship should they desire to do so. They can work up to 20 hours per week during school terms and have the option of increasing those hours to full time during any breaks from school. In Marisa's case she was fortunate enough to have the financial support of her parents during her internship and did not need to seek paid employment for that time. This enabled her to focus more on her internship research project and on the class she was taking at the ANU.


Marisa enjoyed her time in Canberra and she enjoyed learning about Australia's political system firsthand. She said that she was looking forward to applying her knowledge of the Australian political system to her study of the American political system when she returned home to the US. Overall, Marisa sees that internships like hers can be beneficial to both the student and the senator or MP who takes them on. She believes all senators and MPs should take an intern on at some point during the year. She said: 'It is a great opportunity both for the intern to learn about the real work that goes on in parliament, but also for the senators and MPs to receive the input of a fresh young mind at little to no cost. It is an excellent experience and a wonderful resume builder.' Marisa is eagerly anticipating the results of her internship and is hoping for a high distinction. I certainly found the whole internship process to be an interesting one in which I could see the benefits to all involved. I too, would encourage other senators and MPs to give the experience a go.
