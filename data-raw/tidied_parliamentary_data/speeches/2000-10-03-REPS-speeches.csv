"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-10-03,"—Mr Speaker, with indulgence, I would like on behalf of the government to express to Prue Tonkin and to her six children and their families our sadness at the death on Sunday of their husband and father, David, who, as members will know, was Premier of South Australia between 1979 and 1982. I formed a close friendship with David in the years that he was Premier and subsequently. He was a person who did a great deal to rebuild the Liberal Party after the difficulties of the divisions in the party through the emergence of the Liberal movement in the 1970s. His contribution to the state of South Australia was significant.
David Tonkin was a person who had a deep interest in the arts, particularly music, and it was perhaps appropriate that only a few hours before his death he had attended in the Barossa Valley a Bach concert, indulging to the end one of his great tastes. I had the opportunity also, for which I am very grateful, on behalf of the members of the Liberal Party of Australia of conferring on David a meritorious service award at the time of the annual meeting of the State Council of the Liberal Party in South Australia only a few months ago.
David Tonkin entered parliament in 1970 as the member for Bragg. He was elected leader of the state parliamentary party in 1975 and was Premier when it won government in 1979. After his defeat and subsequent retirement from parliament he served as Chairman of the State Opera Company of South Australia, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association between 1986 and 1992 and Chairman of the South Australian Film Corporation from 1994 to 1996.
David Tonkin was a person well loved and admired within the Liberal Party in South Australia. I record my personal thanks for the many kindnesses he and his family extended to me, including the hospitality of their home for a period of two or three weeks in 1985 when after major ear surgery it was desirable that I remained in Adelaide. The friendship and warmth that David and Prue extended to me on that occasion is something that I remember very well. I convey on behalf of this parliament and the Liberal Party our condolences to Prue. We record with appreciation and respect his great service to the state of South Australia and to the people of Australia generally.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Tonkin, Hon.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—Mr Speaker, if I might have indulgence on the same matter, I did meet Dr Tonkin but I cannot say I knew him with the familiarity and obviously deep affection that the Prime Minister had for him, but when a substantial political figure in this nation passes away and is acknowledged on one side of the House he or she should be acknowledged on the other side of the House as well.
Dr Tonkin was a product of what are often the kinder, gentler aspects of political life at the state level as opposed to the federal political level. There are one or two states where that is not the case, but there is often a much higher level of across-the-table cooperation and often a much higher level of shared views across the table. There was in Dr Tonkin's day a shared view on both sides of the parliament which was not necessarily shared elsewhere—for example, the view in the Labor Party that the Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs should go ahead, which ultimately it did but it was signed off by him. He also completed some legislation in relation to land rights for South Australian Aboriginals and was himself responsible for signing an agreement which gave back substantial tracts of land in the state's far north to the Pitjantjatjara people. These were views held in common in both the developmental and the human rights senses on both sides of politics in South Australia at the time.
The Prime Minister has made reference to Dr Tonkin's love of the arts and his substantial contribution to the arts in South Australia as a result of his appointments. I suspect that the not non-partisan but partisan tolerance level that he exhibited meant that he was adequately based as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in London. The opposition joins the Prime Minister and the rest of the parliament in extending our condolences to Dr Tonkin's widow, Prudence, and to their six children and five grandchildren. Our thoughts at this time are with that family. 
—As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased I invite honourable members to rise in their places.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—The Prime Minister's broken promise on fuel represents one of the most comprehensive betrayals of farmers, their families and their communities in our recent memory. We have come to expect this from a city based Prime Minister who thinks he can wash away the legitimate concerns of farmers and their families merely by donning an Akubra hat, while his city based Treasurer thrusts his greedy hands deeper into farmers' pockets to obtain more revenue for this wasteful government. We all know in this place what a serial offender the Prime Minister is when it comes to broken promises. It is only now that farmers have come to understand that, when this Prime Minister and this Treasurer make a promise, it is not worth the paper it is written on; it is simply not worth a tinker's cuss.
Agriculture is a precarious business at the best of times, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. A lot of farming activity is undertaken in country where it is increasingly difficult for a multitude of reasons to maintain agricultural productivity. Farmers have to contend with climatic variables, such as drought and flood, that can set their farming enterprises back years. They have to contend with outbreaks of diseases and pests that can have a devastating effect on production. We have only to go to Mackay in Queensland today and look at the devastation of the cane fields through orange rust, or look at the looming plague of locusts in the east and west of this great land to understand the importance of diseases and pests to agricultural productivity. Also, farmers in key industries in rural Australia—wheat, dairy, wool and sugar—are price takers. They are price takers in markets that are corrupted by the actions of national government. They have had to contend with all these factors in earning their living. And now they have to contend with the broken promises of a Liberal Prime Minister and a Liberal Treasurer who have their hands, at this point in time, deep into the pockets of farmers on fuel.
When the Prime Minister gave his solemn promise to `never ever introduce a GST', farmers took the Prime Minister at his word. They found, to their dismay, that the Prime Minister had made what he called a `non-core promise'. Even at this point, farmers and their families gave the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt. They accepted the Prime Minister's promise that they would receive compensation for the inflationary effects induced by the GST, even though many of them received low, or had negative, incomes. They accepted the Prime Minister's promise that exports from the rural sector would receive a huge boost as a result of the introduction of the GST, even though many of them were producing for the domestic market or were in industries with low levels of exports. They accepted the Treasurer's propaganda on the evils of the wholesale sales tax system and the effects of cascading taxes, even though many were exempt from paying wholesale sales tax on their inputs. 
They believed the Prime Minister's promise that the price of fuel would not rise as a result of the introduction of the GST. In all their doubts and misgivings they had about `never ever' and about `non-core promises', they clung to one promise above all others, and that was the Prime Minister's promise on fuel. Then came the sickening feeling in their stomachs when the Prime Minister changed his rhetoric. He changed it from `fuel prices will not rise' to `fuel prices need not rise'. At that point in time, farmers and their families knew that, politcally, they had been stabbed in the back by the Liberal Party and this Prime Minister. They knew at that point that this was the ultimate betrayal.
We in the opposition have been hounding the government in public debate on the issue of petrol and diesel prices, and we have been pilloried by the government for it. Here in Parliament House today there have been representatives from the National Farmers Federation, representing farmers from all over Australia. They are not only seeking relief for their constituency on the issue of the price of fuel but also wanting the government to honour the promise it made to them on fuel. Let me remind members opposite of the promise the government made to this constituency on fuel. I go to the Prime Minister's speech in Hamilton, Victoria, on 2 August 1999. This is what the Prime Minister said:
... there are a lot of benefits in that tax reform for people in rural Australia. To start with fuel is going to be dramatically cheaper.
We now know that, as a result of the introduction of the GST, fuel for farmers, especially petrol, will be dearer. Those are the mathematical and inescapable facts. Those are the facts that the government will not confront and those are the facts that give substance to the betrayal that has occurred to this constituency on fuel. The Prime Minister went on to say this:
We have decided that there will be a few principles that are going to guide the making of our decisions and one of those principles will be that we don't intend to make changes that are going in any way to erode the competitiveness of farmers or in any way hurt people who live in rural Australia.
We now know that these increases in fuel prices, deliberately concealed by the government through the GST, are impacting on costs and farmers' competitiveness. We also know that these increases in fuel prices are hurting farm families. Farmers in Australia are entering a very dangerous period where there are major cost impacts on their bottom line. We have seen the slump in the currency. Nobody will deny that there are some advantages to farmers that are exporting, but there is a dark side to the moon as far as this substantial currency devaluation is concerned. We are now seeing an increase in the cost of farm inputs—tractors and farm equipment and chemicals—of an unprecedented scale. Of course, that is feeding into the inflation rate. We have a direct impact on farm costs as a result of the introduction of the GST. The government has concealed and deliberately understated that impact.
Labor spent 13 years cutting out the inflation cancer from the Australian economy that had been left by the Liberal and National parties. It took us 13 years to cut the Liberal inflation cancer out and, in one fell swoop, the government has ramped up the inflation rate not only for the general community but for farmers as well. As any farmer knows, when the inflation rate goes up, when the spike occurs in fuel and in farm costs, what follows are increases in interest rates. You heard it from them today, Minister.
—No.
—You didn't?
 (Mr Nehl)—The member will address his remarks through the chair.
—I certainly will, Mr Deputy Speaker. You didn't meet the National Farmers Federation today? 
—No, I did not.
—Let me tell you that I did. I met the National Farmers Federation today. You would have liked to have been a fly on the wall for that particular discussion. Let me talk about interest rates. We hear a lot from the government on interest rates and the Labor Party. You are now in the business of ramping up fuel costs. You are now in the business of ramping up inflation. As day turns to night and as night turns to day, what will follow will be an increase in interest rates, and it will be the direct result of the actions of the Liberal and National parties on the issue of the GST.
For the benefit of the House, let me give an indication of the extent of the increase in fuel costs as experienced by farmers. On 17 December, the Sunday Mail reported that the cost of diesel to farmers had risen by 35c per litre over the past 12 months. Terry Sharp of Agforce is quoted as saying that, on a medium sized grain property using 100,000 litres a year, the grower is $35,000 worse off. We on this side of the House do not deny that a substantial component can be attributed to the increase in the international price of fuel. At this point you have reneged on your promise over the diesel fuel rebate—
—The chair has not reneged, member for Corio!
—And you have your hand in—
—No! The chair does not have its hand anywhere.
—How precious we are in this House today!
—If you are reflecting on the chair, you can—
—How sensitive we are in this House today on the issue of fuel! You know when the coalition is on the run, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is when we press the fuel button.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Corio is showing gross disrespect to the chair by implying that the chair is being anything but impartial in his control of the debate. I urge you to call him to order.
—I thank the minister. Before recalling the honourable member for Corio, I indicate that I took the same view. I suggest to the member that he should not continue to make such inferences.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be the last person that I would cause pain to in this House. Let me point to the most insidious impact of the increase in the price of fuel as far as farmers are concerned. On 26 September, the Livestock Transporters Association of New South Wales announced that the jump in diesel prices was forcing them to lift trucking rates by five per cent. The Queensland livestock transporters said that an increase of 10 per cent was inevitable. What we do know is that the government already has its hand in farmers' pockets to the tune of $20 million to $25 million by reneging on its promise over the diesel fuel rebate. Why doesn't the government, firstly, get its hand out of the pockets of farmers and, secondly, consider returning to them the windfall that we in the opposition know is coming to the government as a result of the GST?
We know that there is a GST impact and that it is in excess of $100 million. We know that there is a windfall from the petroleum resource rent tax somewhere in the region of $500 million. And we know that there is a higher indexation adjustment of fuel excise in the region of $50 million. Some $700 million has been identified by the Australian Automobile Association, and that impost is a windfall to the government in excess of what it said it would collect. Where have the National Party been on this? Where has the minister been on this? They made some grandiose promises at the last election. John Anderson had this to say on the Sunday program on 16 May. The reporter said:
Would you walk out of government, if the government contemplated a deal with the Democrats that cost you that fuel reduction?
Anderson said:
If the government I'm a part of did something like that then, yeah, I mean, I couldn't be a part of that. 
He said he could not be part of a policy that disadvantaged farmers. It is about time the Leader of the National Party resigned. As for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is at the table, he is trying to intimidate farmers by saying that they are already receiving benefits. Do not try to say that you did not try to intimidate them, because they are telling us that you did. The point simply is this, Minister: you went to them with grandiose promises on fuel, and you have broken them. From their vantage points in their ivory towers, the National Party—with Senator McGauran in the headquarters of the National Party in Collins Street, Melbourne, and Senator Boswell on the 36th floor of Westfield Towers or whatever it is in Brisbane—are pontificating on fuel to farmers out in the field. Farmers know that they have been betrayed, they know their families have been betrayed, and when the next elections come they are going to take to you with a political baseball bat.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2000-10-03,"— I have to say that I am amazed that the member for Corio could come into this place as a representative of the greatest fuel taxers in Australian history and criticise this government's record on fuel taxation. Labor, throughout their term in office, went from one binge of fuel taxation increases to the next. They held all the records, all the gold medals, when it came to increasing fuel taxes, and now they come into this chamber today and are critical of this government's performance on fuel taxation.
I was interested to listen to the member for Corio. He did not say one word in rebuttal of the famous statements of the member for Dickson when she was the Labor Party spokesperson on regional affairs. She said that any cuts in fuel excise are a subsidy on pollution. Labor's view is that lower fuel prices are a subsidy on pollution. The member for Corio has never distanced himself from the comments of the regional affairs spokesperson. Labor believes that lower fuel prices are a subsidy on pollution. This is the party that is coming here now and suggesting to us that it might actually be going to freeze an excise rise that might occur four months in the future. 
No-one seriously believes that Labor would ever lower taxes on fuel. They have too much form when it comes to fuel taxes. Let us remember that in their last 13 years in office Labor increased excise on fuel, as the Treasurer reported in question time today, from 6.2c a litre to 34.2c a litre. That is Labor's record. The last time they were in government, the last time they had a chance to lower fuel excise, what did they do? They increased it from 6.2c a litre to 34.2c a litre. That is their performance—a 500 per cent increase in fuel excise. That is what Labor did when they were last in office. To bring this into a little further stark capacity, Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to know that, of all the fuel excise rises that we have had in our nation's history, Labor are responsible for three times more in those 13 years than all of the rest of Australia's governments over 100 years.
—How many times?
 (Mr Nehl)—The honourable member for Riverina is not in her place and will be silent.
—Labor, in 13 years, increased fuel excise by three times more than all of the other governments in Australian history, including Labor governments. They are the ones who we are asked to believe are of a mind to lower fuel taxation. 
Let us look a little further at their record. In office they increased fuel excise by 500 per cent. It was Labor that invented fuel indexation. Labor invented it. Now they are asking us to believe that somehow or other they would change it, even though they did not change it—in fact, they made it worse—in 13 years in office. Let us also remember that it was Labor that ended the old country price fuel equalisation scheme. It was Labor that voted against the new diesel fuel rebate scheme, which provides rebates to people, particularly heavy transport users on the roads. Labor voted against that opportunity to lower taxes by 24c a litre. 
We have here the member for Corio coming into the House today criticising what the price of fuel is today. What road transport operators need to remember is that, whatever price it is today, it would be at least 24c a litre worse if Labor had got their way. If Labor had got their way, it would be 24c a litre higher than today. The Australian Livestock Transport Association, when welcoming the government's new tax package, said it could reduce costs in the transport industry by 15 per cent compared with what they otherwise would be. If Labor were in office, whatever the prices of transport might be today, they would be 15 per cent higher under Labor's WST, under Labor's denial of this diesel fuel rebate scheme. Labor voted against all of that. Labor also voted against GST rebates for fuel used in business. They were against cheaper fuel for people who buy fuel for business purposes. They voted against that. Labor also voted against the $500 million scheme to help equalise the tax paid between country and city areas. Labor voted against that $500 million worth of support for fuel prices in country areas. Who can believe them now if they tell us that they have had a conversion, that all of a sudden things are going to be different?  
This conversion has come over the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Only a couple of months ago, he went on the record in saying that Labor had `no intention of reducing fuel excise'—no intention of reducing the taxes collected on fuel. He was backing up the views of the shadow minister for regional development at the time, who thought that reductions in fuel excise were a subsidy on pollution. So that is Labor's past record: 13 consistent years of massively increasing fuel excise. And it has the hide to criticise our government's record on fuel excise.
Let us trace it through again to emphasise this point about Labor's record. In not quite 90-odd years of Australian Federation, we reached the stage where fuel excise was 6.2c a litre. After 13 years of Labor, it had gone to 34.2c a litre. Now, under five years of the coalition, it has gone to 38.1c a litre. So, on our record, we have managed to increase it less than 4c a litre; Labor managed 28c a litre during its 13 years in office. So its form is on the board. We know where it stands on the question of fuel excise.
Repeatedly we also have these claims from the opposition that it is all the GST's fault, this has all happened because of the GST—the price of fuel has gone up because of the GST. We have in Queensland the rank hypocrisy of Premier Beattie, rushing around and saying that it is all the fault of the GST. If there is any windfall going to the states, and if Mr Beattie and Mr Elder are genuinely concerned about the impact of the GST on the price of fuel and would like to rebate it to motorists in that state —and I would remind the states, including Mr Beattie, that they get all the revenue from the GST—I am quite sure that our federal Treasurer would be happy to accommodate their wishes in that regard. If the states want to give up their GST windfalls, then we will be happy to accommodate them in that regard.
In fact, if you have any doubt about where Labor stands, you have only to look at the performance of the Labor state governments on fuel excise. Look at Premier Beattie again in Queensland: he could not wait to get rid of Queensland's 8.1c a litre subsidy scheme on fuel in that state. He tried to bring in a scheme just before the end of the last financial year, trying to blame the federal government for his having to get rid of the Queensland 8c a litre subsidy—until he was finally shamed into withdrawing his plan to get rid of the subsidy. He has not got rid of it altogether; it is still there on the shelf. When the next election is over, if Queenslanders have been unfortunate enough to have a return of the Beattie government, it will be out there again, trying to get back to its old form and putting up the price of fuel. It does not care about the impact on regional Australia. All it wants is greater revenue for its new stadiums and all else that Premier Beattie wants to build in Brisbane.
But even then, even though Beattie was forced to back down on his plan to abolish the state's fuel tax rebate scheme, his department has still sent angry letters to every person who gets concessional fuel in Queensland demanding that they return to the state government any excise-free fuel. They have been told that they have to pay 8c a litre to the state government and that they must do it within a very short period of time or there will be a 100 per cent penalty and 20 per cent interest rates charged on it. This is the level of generosity we have from state Labor governments which have the capacity to provide real support to people in the rural sector who are using fuel bought with the benefit of the subsidy on roads. Those governments are demanding that this money be repaid. This is the kind of attitude that Labor has towards fuel taxes. Any way it can find to increase revenue out of fuel taxation, it will take it—you can count on it taking it. Labor's record over the years has been absolutely consistent in that regard. You cannot accuse it of inconsistency; it always puts the taxes up. There has never been an occasion where Labor in government has reduced taxes on fuel. 
But there is a contrast then with the coalition. There are demands at the present time for there to be a reduction in the taxes on fuel—and we have already delivered. On 1 July, we delivered a significant new scheme which delivers tax relief on fuel for people who are using that fuel for heavy transport on our road system. That is a major benefit for all people who live in rural and regional Australia. It is a major benefit for those who do business in country areas because the cost of getting their goods to markets in the cities, the cost of getting their inputs out to their country located factories, has been reduced as a result. In addition to that, farmers benefit from having lower costs associated with transporting their produce by road to the marketplace. They are 24c a litre better off than they would have been had Labor got its way and voted that scheme out. In addition to that, as part of these new arrangements, fuel used in the rail system is excise free, and farmers use a considerable amount of rail transport to export particularly grain products to the market. The NFF estimated that that particular measure was worth around $30 million a year alone. These are real savings, real cuts in taxes on fuel delivered to farmers—something Labor has never done and will never do.
I do not want to detract in any way from the concerns that there are in rural and regional Australia about higher fuel prices. I recognise that fuel is the lifeblood of industry and commerce in regional areas and that any increase in the price affects costs. I was in a farm organisation as a farm leader before I came into this House and I can recall complaining then about the price of fuel—complaining bitterly about Labor's massive increases in excise at the time. Those costs are real and do have an impact on the rural sector. This government will do what it possibly can to make sure that the impact of higher transport costs on regional Australia is as small as possible, and it has taken many significant initiatives in addition to the reductions in taxes on fuel. I announced last week an intention by the government to proceed with a study on the use of ethanol and the potential to use ethanol as a substitute fuel in Australia. There are a number of alternative fuel proposals around, and I think all of these are worthy of consideration.
Let me also make it clear that, when we are looking at the impact of fuel prices on farmers as distinct from other sectors of the community, farmers have significant advantages in relation to fuel price. For instance, farmers are eligible for a rebate on the excise for all of the fuel and all of the diesel that is used on farm by farmers in the production of their produce. That is a scheme that significantly reduces farm costs. It is a scheme that has been widely welcomed by farmers and certainly makes a significant difference in their cost structures.
I notice that the member for Corio suggested that farmers were being disadvantaged competitively with the fuel costs in other parts of the world. The reality is that the price farmers pay for their fuel in Australia is not out of proportion with the price paid in other parts of the world. Indeed, compared with most countries of the world, our price is actually lower; so we are not at a significant disadvantage in that regard. Having said that, I acknowledge that any increase in the price for whatever reason is unwelcome. We know the reason why there are higher fuel prices at the present time: the higher price of oil. It has gone from something like $A19 a barrel to $A58 a barrel in a period of 18 months. That is a very significant increase, and naturally that is going to flow through to all users of fuel. As a part of that, the impact of the higher oil prices has certainly been accelerated by a decline in the value of the Australian dollar. But, as the honourable member for Corio at least had the honesty to acknowledge, that has an upside for farmers as well. It does mean that our exports are worth more around the world. 
—I did acknowledge that.
—I said that. You acknowledged it. It also means that our products are more competitive on the domestic market against imports, because it is more costly for them to come into our country. There are significant advantages there. When you take those advantages and when you have a free-floating dollar, which the opposition supports and I think most people in the nation support, there are going to be ups and downs. When the dollar goes down, farm returns go up. The NFF acknowledge that the lower dollar will be worth $1 billion to farm returns this year. But it does mean there are some higher costs that farmers need to absorb. Higher fuel prices are unwelcome. This government has done more to address fuel prices in five years than Labor did in a century.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I am delighted to participate in this matter of public importance relating to fuel prices in regional Australia and their impact in particular on the farming community. If any government were to set out a deliberate strategy to cripple regional Australia and its farming community, the best way of doing so would be to ensure that fuel prices are kept at the highest possible levels, and that is precisely what this government is doing. Fuel, both diesel and petrol, is the lifeblood of almost every aspect of rural life. The Howard government has presided over the highest country fuel prices since the invention of the motor vehicle.
Unleaded fuel today in Bendigo is 99.9c per litre. In Maryborough, its 102.9c per litre. In Castlemaine, it is 99.9. In Wedderburn, it is 101.9. In Heathcote, it is 99.9. In Inglewood, it is 101c a litre. In Elmore, which used to be a National Party stronghold, it is 101.9. Swan Hill today has unleaded at 103.9, and in Mildura it is 105.9. This price regime is slowly strangling regional Australia and its farming community. We have seen the transport industry, a very important part of the farming industry, blockading oil refineries in an attempt to drive home the point that they are going broke rapidly because of this government's inaction. These people are not militant trade union activists hell-bent on destroying society as we know it, as the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business would have us believe; they are ordinary Australian small business men and women and owner-drivers who are facing ruin because this government will not listen or act to secure their future.
We even had the Treasurer on the ABC program Statewide last week trying to blame high fuel prices on an industrial dispute. We on the Labor side always know when we have the tories on the back foot—they go the union bash every time. According to the Treasurer, `It's not our GST; it's not our excise policy; it's an industrial dispute.' What rubbish! But it is precisely what we have come to expect from a Treasurer who thinks that a trip to regional Australia is a visit to the Gold Coast. It is what we have come to expect from a Treasurer whose only policy for regional Australia is to slash the wages of country workers, make it easier for employers to sack people, slug everyone with a GST and of course make them pay for petrol with their blood, sweat and tears. We could be forgiven for asking what regional Australia has done to the Prime Minister and this Treasurer to deserve this sort of treatment.
According to economists quoted in the Australian newspaper on 28 September, the government will net a windfall gain of almost half a billion dollars as a direct result of their policy. Dr Ken Ogden, an RACV policy manager, was quoted in the same newspaper as saying the government could earn some $470 million more than it expects from high fuel prices, reaping up to $1.75 billion from its resource rent tax, up from an anticipated $1.28 billion. Dr Ogden has called on the government to abandon plans to increase prices by a further 3c per litre next February in line with inflation. In a letter to its members, the RACV said:
Members would be acutely aware that the Federal Government failed to deliver on its promise that, with the introduction of the GST on 1 July, fuel excise would be reduced so that the pump price of petrol “will not rise”. 
Here it is—a Liberal Party campaign headquarters letter on petrol prices. It states:
There will be no increase in the price of petrol as a result of the GST. The reason is that the government will reduce the petrol excise by an amount equivalent to the GST. Nor will there be any increase in price differential between city and country areas.
What a joke! It continues:
In fact, petrol prices should fall and the differential should decrease as a result of the reduced cost of transporting petrol.
There it is from the Liberal Party campaign headquarters. On 13 August 1998 in an address to the nation, the Prime Minister said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
On 7 September 1998, the Treasurer said in a press release:
The Government's proposed New Tax System will not lead to any increase in petrol prices.
Again, that is a joke. Once again, the Prime Minister and Treasurer have been caught out saying one thing before an election and saying something totally different after a poll, a poll which shows that a lot of people and farming communities in regional Australia continue to support the coalition. What really happened was that, under the guise of the GST, the federal government increased its take on every litre sold from 35.8c per litre to 37.48c per litre. A further 10 per cent GST is then added at the pump. It continued:
Given that GST is a flat tax and calculated on the final pump price of fuel and imposed on top of fuel excise, this effectively became a tax on a tax. In an environment of higher oil prices, the per litre price of fuel naturally rose.
What has happened to petrol taxation is blatantly unfair, and RACV has once again approached Canberra to remove the indexation of fuel excise and to freeze excise at its current level.
     ...	     ...	    ...
RACV has long called for the abolition of indexation of fuel prices, as it is an arbitrary increase in tax. In response the Federal Government has likened indexation of petrol to indexation of pensions. This argument tries to link a revenue stream (petrol excise) to a payment stream (pension increases).
Petroleum excise goes into general revenue and is one of a number of income streams for the Commonwealth. There is no direct link between these streams of income or expenditure.
As fuel prices form a significant part of the CPI calculation, increasing the excise component in line with itself is simply using a multiplier to increase the level of excise collected. If indexation of excise is frozen, this will reduce the cost of petrol to all the community, including those on fixed incomes.
If the Government were to stop the indexation of petrol, it would forgo income of $200 million for the financial year, but on the other side of the ledger it would receive additional income estimated at $610 million as a result of higher oil and petrol prices. Most of this windfall was unbudgeted.
With petrol prices hovering at an all-time high, next February's CPI increase in the petrol excise must be prevented. All the automobile clubs are united in their call for the removal of indexation of petrol excise, and replaced with transparent taxation which only occurs during the Budget process and debated on the floor of the Parliament.
The government would have us believe that the high world price of crude oil and a fictitious industrial dispute—according to the Treasurer—are the sole reasons for the price of petrol in regional Australia. Higher crude oil prices are a contributing factor but, as the RACV has pointed out, it is within the power of the Howard government to reduce the at-pump price by almost 3c per litre immediately. February's CPI could result in another 3c per litre increase if the government refuses to give ground. Another 3c per litre petrol increase would sound the death knell for regional Australia. The high world price of crude oil is a factor in the crippling price of fuel in regional Australia, but we should never forget who introduced world parity pricing. It was the National Party member for the very marginal seat of Richmond's dear old dad, the former leader of the then National Country Party, Doug Anthony. Is it any wonder that the National Party is held in such low regard around the country?
We have seen stories in the media of nervous government backbenchers expressing absolute fear as to the results of the next election if the government does not give ground and reduce the excise by at least 3c per litre. We have seen them argue that the windfall should be spent on improving roads throughout regional Australia but, again, the argument falls on deaf ears. In fact, this government is walking away from even maintaining its existing commitment to road funding. In an answer to a question on notice referring to the status of the Calder Highway, asked by the member for Batman on 20 June 2000, the National Party Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services said: 
The Calder Highway is a state arterial and the responsibility of the Victorian Government.
The Deputy Prime Minister is wrong. The Calder Highway was proclaimed a national arterial road by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, on 3 June 1997. In fact, a sign erected a few kilometres south of Kyneton states clearly that the Calder is a road of national importance. So this Liberal-National coalition government not only is content to sit by and gather in huge windfalls of petrol dollars but refuses to increase road funding and tries to slime out of its obligations to fund current works on the Calder Highway, leaving the Victorian state government to go it alone. And what do we hear from the Prime Minister: which schools and which hospitals do we want closed if he reduces the fuel tax. This comment alone has caused the most anger that I have yet experienced from smaller regional communities. The Prime Minister should don the daggy hat—and let's not forget the Driza-Bone—and head out into regional Australia and learn first-hand just how difficult it is for these small farming communities to survive under the Howard philosophy. Regional Australia is burning while Emperor Howard fiddles.
We have all seen the Prime Minister at the Olympics. I do not dispute that the Prime Minister should have been at the Olympics—of course he should have—but did he need to be there every day for every event? What must have regional Australians thought, being crippled by fuel prices and seeing our Prime Minister partying at the Olympics? And the National Party were totally powerless in standing up to Howard and Costello. I am delighted that this policy has been implemented, not because it helps regional Australia but because it will help me get re-elected and it will help a lot of my colleagues in regional seats get re-elected. It will be down to John Howard and Peter Costello, and we will thank you very much when we are on the opposite side of the House, behind Prime Minister Kim Beazley.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Petrol Prices: Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2000-10-03,"—I thank the previous speakers for their comments. When it comes to understanding fuel prices on farms, I claim to have a little inside knowledge. We have a situation here where the Labor Party, those who sit opposite, are making claims about the price of fuel which history shows they simply do not believe. I say to the member for Bendigo: it will be a long time before you are over here, mate, because farmers are going to take a long time to forget your performance last time around. You increased the excise on fuel by 550 per cent. When you came to power, excise was 16 per cent of the price of fuel; when you were kicked out, it was 54 per cent of the price of fuel. Under the current government, it is back down to 39 per cent of the price of fuel.
The reality is that the federal government have delivered on all our promises. Every promise we made to the NFF, every promise we made to the farmers, has been delivered—except the ones that those who sit opposite stopped us delivering. I sat in the House and listened to the member for Corio speak with passion about why we should not pass the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. The people he was hurting by opposing that bill are the farmers he pretends to support today. I sat and listened to him oppose a saving which is today delivering 27c a litre to the truck drivers and farmers in my electorate—27c a litre off. Truck drivers and farmers who take their trucks on the road are paying a little over 10c a litre in excise. Of course, they do not pay the GST—and I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a bit confused for a little while during question time, because he seemed to think they do, but they do not.
The trucking industry is paying less for fuel now than it was in June, less for fuel now than it was in January and about the same for fuel as it was this time last year. For Terry Sharp's information—I happen to know Terry very well; he used to be on the board that I led for the Queensland Grain Growers Association, the same esteemed organisation that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was a member of—the price of fuel has not gone up 35c in the last 12 months; it has gone up something like 26c a litre, and it has gone up as a result of world prices, in spite of everything we have done. We have delivered every promise to the farmers, in spite of the Labor Party, in spite of opposition from members like the member for Corio, who did not want regional Australia to get savings on transport diesel. He stood in this House, and I listened to him, and he spoke against it. 
The federal government are ensuring that farmers are exempted from everything we can exempt them from. They pay no excise on the diesel they use on farm, no excise at all, and because they operate their petrol driven vehicles they get a break on that as well from the GST. That is something that they have never had before, and that is something that Ian Donges, as I remember it, when he was campaigning for changes to the taxation system in the lead-up to the last election, was strongly supporting, and we have delivered. We have delivered on the grants scheme to ensure that the differential between city and country does not blow out as a result of the changes in the tax system, and what happened? The Labor Party opposed it—a scheme worth $500 million, and they opposed it.
So, what we have here today are some opportunistic comments from the other side about what we should be doing on fuel. Let me recap on their record. When they came into power in 1983 excise was 6.1c a litre; when they left power—I should say `were chucked out'; that would be more like it—it was 34.2c a litre. If that was the worst component of their time in power that would be bad enough, but it gets worse. The member for Corio talked about interest rates. Well, I remember interest rates. I had friends who were paying 28 per cent per annum through stock and station agents to borrow money; overdraft rates and farm borrowing rates at 20 per cent or better.
So do not talk to me about what the farmers want. They know what they want: they do not want Labor returned. They still remember excise jumps of 550 per cent. They still remember when you jumped excise 5c a litre in the 1993 budget—$5.2 billion for you; you did not spend it on farmers. And the Labor Party were the ones who introduced indexation of fuel excise—yet they sit here today with sheer hypocrisy, trying to quote things that never happened under Labor that have happened under this government. When did Labor cut fuel excise? On 1 July we cut fuel excise by $2.7 billion. The people who are out there complaining about the price of fuel know that if it were not for us they would be paying a lot more today. Had you, Member for Corio, been successful in your speech in the House on the alternative fuel grants scheme then they would be paying 27c a litre more for their fuel on the road today. Do not think you have fooled them, because you have not.
I have been speaking with rural industry, and I have been speaking with the likes of Terry Sharp—although Terry was a bit confused from time to time as to where the GST actually goes. I have explained to him that it goes to the states and, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said, if Peter Beattie is so concerned about the price of fuel he has ample opportunity to refund it. In fact, he has the mechanism there already. So I do not want to hear these crocodile tears and this hypocrisy from the other side.
I commiserate with and I feel for the farmers out there who have seen real increases in fuel prices in the last 12 months. In the last 18 months it has been particularly severe. I understand what they are going through. I have been there myself. But this government have done everything we can to reduce the fuel excise burden on them. They acknowledge that. They acknowledge that the reduction in transport costs would have been greater had the world price not increased. But some of them have in fact experienced cuts in freight rates, and in other cases they have not seen freight rates increase as a direct result of what we have done. I remind the member for Corio that fuel to trucks is cheaper now than it was in June or in January. That is an undisputable fact. 
We cannot make it rain or not rain. And we, the government, cannot do anything about the commodity prices. But we are doing what we can about fuel prices. We have cut our take, as I say, by $2.7 billion, and the great beneficiaries of that are regional Australia. The great beneficiaries of that come from areas that rely on transport. I had to sit here and be subjected to some astounding assertions from the member for Corio about what we, the government, should do about fuel excise, when we have already done it. I know the Labor Party opposed it. I know they wished it had never happened, but the reality is that out there, as a result of what we have done, diesel is cheaper than it was on 30 June for trucks on the road. That is absolutely irrefutable. You cannot say it is not. I have had truck drivers bring their fuel price dockets in, and it is right, and they have admitted it. Contrary to what they may be saying in the press, they have admitted that fuel has got cheaper as a result of the policies of this government.
This government will continue to work with rural industry to do what we can about the price of fuel. We have, as I have said repeatedly, delivered substantial savings to regional Australia. I know that farmers will be grateful for that. I know that they will never forget what Labor did to them in terms of both fuel prices and interest rates, and I know that if we continue to work together we will get the result that the farmers want.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I commenced my comments on these two bills on 7 September in our last sittings and indicated that I wanted to speak primarily in my role as the chair of Labor's government service delivery committee, which has been travelling around Australia. In almost every seat that we have visited we have had raised with us the concerns that regional areas in particular have with regard to service delivery by Telstra. On 7 September I had got to the point of going into some detail about the sorts of problems that have been raised. In particular, during two of our visits to regional Victoria a very large number of issues were raised about the service standards, the access to telecommunications services, the lack of regular services and the loss of jobs in those areas. The two seats that we visited in regional Victoria were Ballarat and Bendigo. We had public meetings at the School of Mines in Ballarat, and talked with the council about the development of a local telecommunications network. The member for Bendigo has raised many concerns about Telstra and the problems with service levels, and has expressed in this parliament no fewer than nine or 10 times since he was elected to this House his growing concerns about the jobs being shed, the lack of vital emergency services, the limitation on the use of pager services and many other issues. This is, I must say, in stark contrast to the actions of the member for Ballarat, who, although he has raised these issues many times, has never failed to vote with the government for the further privatisation of Telstra, and has not been able to stand up in this House and indicate that anything has been delivered to his electorate as promised many times by him in this House.
It is interesting but perhaps not surprising that both these seats—Bendigo and Ballarat—and their broader regions have been chosen to participate in two pilot programs: the regional USO contestability trials. One of the trials will be in this region and will, I think, extend west across the South Australian border. Obviously, given the level of interest in the community when we had our public meetings and talked to people in these areas, there are a number of concerns. It is an appropriate area to choose as a pilot area, because the service delivery being received at the moment is not appropriate. We can understand that, but I do not think it is sufficient for those communities that we just have a trial in this area; we must also ensure that there is a proper evaluation at the end of that trial and that a full review is conducted before any further competitive tendering is undertaken in these areas. 
The member for Perth, our shadow spokesperson for telecommunications, has taken on board the views expressed widely amongst the community in developing Labor's position in this area and the amendments that he will propose during this debate. It is for these reasons that we will specifically propose amendments that call on the government to ensure that no further competitive tendering decisions are made prior to a comprehensive evaluation of the results of the two pilot projects. We urge the government to accept those amendments.
When we went to northern New South Wales and Queensland these same issues were raised with us, particularly in the seat of Paterson. The member for Paterson has worked very hard on the issue of telecommunications. He had an enormous number of signatories to a petition that his office distributed amongst the community about the lack of services and the privatisation of Telstra. He has had raised with him the issues that we will raise in our amendments: the need to ensure that the standards of service will not decline—in fact, that they will improve—and that the universal service obligation will deliver minimum communications services to rural and regional Australia. In the seat of Paterson we met with the community of Raymond Terrace and were made aware of the problems experienced by smaller communities, such as Gloucester, where there are only a few thousand users. Smaller communities often are not regarded as being big enough for some of the technology upgrades that are required to deliver appropriate services to this area. There are problems on the Pacific Highway with the absence of mobile phone coverage. 
In the seat of Oxley, which takes in some of the outer suburbs of Brisbane, we found that it is not just regional areas outside the metropolitan capitals that are suffering some of these problems; some of the fringe suburban areas, like those found in the seat of Oxley, are still having problems with service delivery. We were told that fixing a particular communication problem sometimes takes up to two weeks. We met with a number of very concerned ex-Telstra workers who gave us quite a worrying account of the service problems that they had dealt with while they were still in the employ of Telstra. Those problems have not been dealt with adequately since those jobs were lost and not replaced within Telstra. 
We also went to the seat of Richmond. Although we did not specifically call a public meeting on the issue of Telstra, it was one of the issues that it was impossible for us not to discuss almost everywhere we turned. The seat of Richmond is not that far from the seat of the Deputy Speaker, Mr Causley. I am sure he would be aware that a large number of people in his community are very concerned about the level of services that are currently delivered. I did an interview on Lismore radio about the public meeting, and we were absolutely inundated with calls expressing concerns about Telstra. We had public meetings in Tweed Heads, and again people wanted to discuss this issue. The member for Richmond is the Minister for Community Services. I have checked the records and it appears that the minister has spoken on this issue of telecommunications only once in this House, that is, on 2 February 1998. At that time the minister said he wanted to speak about:
... the considerable benefits to the nation, and particularly to the people of the far north coast of New South Wales, which will derive benefit from further privatisation of Telstra.
At that time he asserted that the coalition had fixed many of the area's telecommunications problems but conceded:
... my constituents naturally still have some concerns which I will address shortly.
And he went on to talk about the introduction of the USO and customer service guarantees. It is interesting that he said this over two years ago, because he has not been in the House to speak about this again. He has not in any way, as far as I can detect on the public record, `addressed shortly' the concerns that are being raised by the constituents. When we visited on 5 May this year, his constituents more than two years later are still waiting for answers from him. This was the issue that we received the most contact and discussion about. It is legitimate for his constituents to be asking: what exactly has the minister been doing on this issue? We find when we check the records that all he has been doing is voting for further privatisation and further deregulation. We have to ask whether this will address the issues that his constituents have raised with him and also with us. 
I must note that the areas covered by the member for Page, who is in the chair, and by the member for Longman would also have constituents that raised these concerns. They make up the second area which is going to be covered by a pilot program to test out whether there is a better way to deliver services to this region. I am sure that all members, if they are doing their jobs properly, will be out making sure that their constituents know about this pilot and will no doubt be supporting our amendments to say that the trial must be fully run and evaluated before any further steps are taken, because it may cause some detriment to their constituents if the trial is not undertaken properly and reviewed fully.
We also went to the electorate of Kalgoorlie and had a public meeting on this particular issue. There was a lot of interest in the town of Kalgoorlie, and again it is in contrast with the comments that have been made in this House by the current member for Kalgoorlie who has also spoken on this issue only once in this House—on 24 June 1999 and not since—and he is not even listed to speak in the debate on the issues that are before the House at the moment. At that time he was expressing the views about the benefit to his electorate from the sale of Telstra. He said:
This sale of Telstra will allow an injection of funds to provide state-of-the-art technology and perhaps provide for satellite communications which will not be limited by local weather conditions.  
           ...          	  ...	      ...
Without this sale, we do not have the funds to provide brand new, cutting edge technology that is so necessary in the remote areas of my electorate.
These perhaps would be noble sentiments from a local member but, sadly, I do have to note for the House that since that time the member for Kalgoorlie has not seen fit to notify either the House or his constituents, as far as I can tell, of any of that funding being delivered to his electorate or of any state-of-the-art technology investments being delivered to his electorate. Again, the community raised with us their ongoing concerns on these issues. If the member for Kalgoorlie has to come in and say that he was wrong, it is probably about time that he did so because no doubt others will be making those comments in the lead-up to the next election. He has asked a number of questions on Telstra, but again this was before he gave his only speech on this issue.
I would like to compare some of these fairly lame contributions made by members opposite with those of some of my colleagues on this side of the House who have persistently raised this issue and have persistently fought for the constituents of their electorates. I gave the example earlier of the member for Bendigo, who was elected at the same time as me—it is actually our second anniversary here today. He has raised this issue no fewer than nine times since he has been here, tirelessly raising the concerns of his electorate. I know the member for Braddon has also constantly raised this as an issue of concern and obviously so has the member for Perth, who is our spokesperson on this issue.
We have also recently visited the seat of McEwen and had public meetings there, which gave us an opportunity to discuss this issue with a large number of people. The member for McEwen opposite has spoken a number of times on these issues and raised her concerns about the standard of services delivered to regional areas and her hopes and expectations that the changes that were being debated at that time in early 1998 and late 1998, would deliver some of the promises that had been made by the government or at least held out as a hope for the privatisation of Telstra and what they would deliver to these communities. She spoke then of the frustration of mobile phones dropping out and of poor TV reception. 
But we do have to ask what her government has done, with her support, to improve the situation for the residents of McEwen because, through our consultations, it seems that not much has changed. In fact, Labor's candidate for the seat, Andrew MacLeod, has had to launch a black spot campaign where residents are being encouraged to contact Mr MacLeod—through his address at PO Box 285 Diamond Creek or via fax—to identify TV, radio and phone black spots in the electorate. Already identified are some major gaps between St Andrews and Kinglake, Yea and Seymour, Healesville and Eildon, Kilmore and Broadford. A resident of Wallan, only 40 kilometres from the Melbourne CBD, had her house burn down with her pets trapped and dying in the fire because she could not call any emergency services from her mobile phone. So it seems that the member for McEwen has not been able to deliver on her hopes. Perhaps she needs to be working a bit harder to convince the government to accept some of the amendments that Labor is proposing in this debate to ensure that all of the community, no matter where they live, can have equitable access to basic communications services. Basic communications services these days extend well beyond just phone access. In this new age of the telecommunications revolution, basic services also include Internet access and mobile phone access. We have also been to Rockhampton, Longreach, Barcaldine, Aramac and Moranbah. Again, one of the issues raised with us was great concern about access to basic telecommunications services. 
I wanted to go through this in detail because it shows the quiet work that the committee has been doing. We have had a lot of members of the public talk to us and raise their concerns, and often there is some cynicism that those concerns do not get passed on in the process. They have been passed on. Our shadow spokesperson for communications has taken on board their views. The amendments that are going to be moved in his name deal with many of the issues that have been raised by those communities, which can be happy that they have participated in our policy process and that we have listened to their concerns. I hope that the members opposite, especially those I have mentioned in this debate, will support our amendments and will actually go and start delivering to their electorates on this issue.  ",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2000-10-03,"—The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 has the potential to revolutionise the current state of regional and rural telecommunications and Internet usage. While I lament that the bill does nothing to directly improve many of the services in my electorate, I feel I must support this bill because I believe the bill may offer a substantial opportunity to bridge the gap between those with access to standard telecommunications and those without. It is my hope that it may be a step towards greater equality between rural and urban Australians. The bill opens up and allows the opportunity for the universal service obligation and the digital data services obligation to include more telecommunication providers. Hopefully this bill will do more than provide rural and regional people access to standard telephone services, payphones and prescribed carriage services. Perhaps the bill will go towards offering rural and regional consumers a choice. 
My cautious support for the benefits of this bill is subject to the successful completion of the pilot programs. However, it is vital that this bill is passed before these programs can commence and be successful. Anyone who knows me would be clearly aware that I am not a proponent of national competition policy. However, rural Australians deserve better than they currently enjoy in telecommunications. It is for this reason that I reservedly support this amendment. The Riverina Regional Development Board said in its submission to the drafting of the national competition policy:
Deregulation of the telecommunications industry and the partial sale of Telstra has provided the impetus for significant changes. By design this has led to increased competition in service provision in major populated areas but has led to little or no change in rural and remote areas. 
Through the opening of the universal service obligation to other companies, it is my sincere hope that rural people will be able to receive the advantages offered to urban Australians at this time. Telstra are demonstrating a lack of incentive to improve services and telecommunications access. At present I do not believe Telstra feel any pressure to provide a top quality telecommunications service to my constituents in the Riverina. As statistics from the National Farmers Federation have shown, the rectification of faults in rural areas has only marginally improved over the last 12 months and customers have a one in four chance of not having their services repaired within the customer service guarantee time frame. 
In my electorate of the Riverina I am inundated with complaints over all aspects of telecommunications. Telstra's delivery of the universal service obligation has not improved the problem and somehow may have led to a negative impact on rural communications. Response time to faults is slow. Regional Australia has already suffered employment losses from the closure or reduced sizes of Telstra's depots and Telstra has shown less commitment to the provision of adequate services—in particular, mobile phone coverage and Internet access. While the recent Australian Communications Authority reported a steady improvement in Telstra's service, little improvement has been seen or witnessed in my electorate. 
One example which highlights the need for dramatic improvements in the delivery of service comes from my electorate, where a small central school is unable to secure regular Internet access. While Telstra have a contract to place all schools on an ISDN line, they failed to include the school in the installation. The school has experienced tremendous difficulty in having this problem rectified. In the last three weeks prior to them contacting me, students at this school have made 56 attempts to gain access to educational material on the Internet with only 19 attempts being successful. Such a poor connection impacts poorly on senior students studying for the HSC. These students rely on the Internet to complete assessment tasks. Through poor telecommunications we are not only allowing inequities to exist between country and city telephone users but also disadvantaging the education of our rural children. As the students themselves wrote, `We know that we are a small school but we are still important.' And yes, indeed, they are important. They are very important to me and they are very important to the future of the Riverina no matter how small their central school is.  
This new bill should allow in the long term improvements in the digital data service obligation area and thus allow students fairer access to education no matter what their location may be. I believe it is important that Telstra, as the current USO provider, is made to stand by its policy statement and marketing plan. I will be vigilant in ensuring that its standard telephone service in regional, rural and remote areas, as approved by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, is realised. I will ensure that Telstra aims to repair unworkable first standard telephone services within one full day after the fault has been reported in areas of a population of 10,000 or more, as it states in the approved agreement with the minister for communications, and in rural areas within two full working days after being notified of a fault. I will attempt to ensure that Telstra lives up to its $285 million promise to provide customers with higher quality service and increased capacity for high speed data and ISDN services to support applications including facsimile and Internet access, even though it appears to date that it has already let down one central school in my electorate—and maybe there are others and maybe they have not contacted me. 
Telstra should live up to their claim that their remote Australia telecommunications enhancement programs will give Australia one of the best remote communications systems in the world. However, I feel we are far from having one of the best in the world when my office receives complaints of the most outrageous nature. We will have one of the best communication systems in the world only when my constituent in Junee no longer has to wait three weeks, make 15 phone calls and visit Telstra twice just to tell them where to dig the trench for a new line. 
—How many?
—Member for Farrer, my constituent had to make 15 phone calls and visit Telstra twice just to tell them where to dig the trench for a new line. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I remind the member for Farrer that he is out of his position.
—We will have the best communications system in the world only when another of my constituents no longer has to wait 10 weeks for Telstra to upgrade her street cable so that the phone can be connected. We will have the best communications system in the world only when I have resolved the issues of a constituent in Griffith who writes:
I write to you, out of growing frustration with the inability of Telstra to provide cabling in our area.
As you are aware, Griffith is a rapidly growing Regional City and the demand for the new services is high. During the last five years we have noted an appalling slide in the ability of Telstra to provide cabling for new developments and new premises.
The local line depot has seen staff and services slashed even though the demands are constantly increasing for cabling. We consider this to be a damning indicator of Telstra's commitment to regional Australia.
My constituent further writes: 
Telstra has informed me that there are no current phone services, despite being in a zoned industrial area. It is worthy to note that we are located within 300m of the Griffith Telstra line depot and less than 1 km from the Griffith exchange. 
When we protested Telstra offered us one line and no guarantee when the other 5 (including lines for fax e-mail etc) would be forth coming. This puts us in a worse situation in comparison to what we are currently dealing with.
The lack of communication lines will place a severe strain on our viability and would make it difficult if not impossible to operate in our new premises.
To their credit, on my contacting them Telstra have gone to an enormous amount of trouble to help rectify my constituent's problem. However, the fact is that this should never have been a problem in the first place.  
We will have the best communications system in the world only when the problem of decent communications in my electorate no longer impacts on the delivery of rural health initiatives. If telecommunications are ever going to be improved, we need a distance neutral pricing policy for rural and regional people in the areas of health and education. Rural and regional Australia need pricing to acknowledge the necessity of their high volume usage because of the tyranny of distance to access. Rural and regional Australia need a roll-out of cheaper alternatives—to the bush first and foremost; they do not need it rolled out in urban Sydney, Melbourne and other major cities prior to it being rolled out in rural and regional areas.
Regional and rural Australians are suffering from an inequitable pricing policy on distance based ISDN. For example, hourly ISDN charges at 384 kilobytes are under $20 in Sydney, whilst between Wagga Wagga and Griffith they are paying $110 per hour to have the same service delivered. Between Wagga Wagga and Junee, a distance of 30 kilometres or perhaps less, it is around $55 per hour. Imagine what reaction you would get if ISDN charges between Chatswood and St Leonards were $55 per hour. I hesitate to guess at the type of uproar it would create if that were the case.
I do not believe for a second that the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 can solve all of the problems that my constituents are currently going through, but I do believe it is a start. The current delivery of the universal service obligation by Telstra has not improved services in rural Australia. With this bill, I hope the rural communications market will attract telecommunication companies that will decidedly deliver the entitlements that rural and regional Australians deserve and should have.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—The opposition's position on the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 is reflected by the amendment to the motion for the second reading, which has been circulated in my name, and before I conclude my remarks I will go through the detail of that amendment. That bill and its cognate bill, the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 2000, introduce competitive tendering into the universal service obligation. The Labor Party in government introduced competition into the telecommunications market generally and, as a consequence, we are happy to explore competitive tendering of the universal service obligation on a local, regional or niche basis. We are happy to do that in a careful and thoughtful way provided Telstra remains in the relevant marketplace as the safety net provider of last resort. 
The mistake that the government has made in respect of this particular public policy issue and the legislation has been to try to trump up the notion that competitive tendering of the universal service obligation is the be-all and end-all of all the service difficulties in rural and regional Australia. In addition to trumping up the suggested public policy solution as the be-all and end-all of those service delivery difficulties, the legislation is drawn too widely, provides too much ministerial discretion and enables the government of the day to go much further than the pilot projects that are envisaged prior to an evaluation of the outcome of those results. These follow upon a fundamental mistake which the government made in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, which we dealt with earlier this year. That sets some of the platform for the introduction of competitive tendering of the universal service obligation but also expressly provides for the $150 million for the competitive tendering of the extension of the local call zones in remote areas or the extended outer area.
The fundamental mistake which the government has made in that respect is that, whilst it has required and will require through this legislation Telstra to remain in the marketplace for the pilot project areas for the competitive tendering of the universal service obligation, it is not requiring Telstra to remain in the marketplace as the provider of last resort for the $150 million outer extended zone. In other words, the winner of the $150 million tender for the extension of local calls to the outer extended zone automatically becomes the universal service obligation provider for that area, and the contrast could not be starker. On this map, the remote area or the outer extended area is shown by the black on the landmass. That is the area that Telstra would have the option of removing itself from commercially. The black areas on this other map are the two pilot project areas. The government has never fully or properly explained to the parliament or the community why it has such a qualitative public policy difference between requiring Telstra to remain in the marketplace as a provider of last resort for the universal service obligation competitive tendering pilot project areas and opening up the possibility of Telstra removing itself from 80 per cent of the Australian landmass if Telstra is not the winner of the $150 million tender for the extension of local call zones to the outer areas. 
The philosophical basis of the universal service obligation is of course the equitable provision of a universal service, and Telstra is the current designated national universal service obligation provider. With the passage of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 through this House and the Senate, members may recall that here and in the Senate the opposition moved to require Telstra to remain in the marketplace as a provider of last resort, whether or not it was the winner of the $150 million tender. I simply indicate that we will again move in the Senate, through the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000—the bill currently before the House—to effect that. I am hopeful that the Democrats, who opposed our amendment on the previous occasion, will be more enlightened on this occasion. I call upon the government to ensure that that tender is not closed or awarded prior to the Senate having the opportunity to visit that issue again.
In this bill, the government envisages two pilot projects, which, according to the public statements of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, are envisaged to operate for a number of years, and Telstra is required to remain in the marketplace as a provider of last resort. The legislation also provides for the universal service obligation to be extended from carriers to ISPs. The opposition has no difficulty with that extension to carriage service providers as well as to carriers. The government's approach to some of these matters is well found in a memo dated 2 August from a senior Telstra officer providing advice to the CEO of Telstra, Dr Switkowski, and others. In the course of that memo, in respect of competitive tendering of the USO, the senior Telstra officer referred to:
... the increasing evidence that the Government feels it needs to shoe-horn competitors into rural Australia within a timeframe that is sequenced with the lead up to the next election.
The memo goes on to say:
USO legislative package No. 2, which sets up a highly flexible framework for introducing portable subsidies and USO contestability in a range of areas (not necessarily the 2 limited trials originally contemplated).
Those two points go to the heart of the opposition's concern in respect of one aspect of these bills: that is, the legislation is drawn much too widely and does not require a comprehensive evaluation of the results of the two pilot project areas prior to contestability being extended into other areas. It makes very clearly the point that, whilst this is an area that should be dealt with in an orderly and sensible manner, there is no doubt that the government is seeking to use this to trump up an argument that this will be the solution to service difficulties that telecommunication customers in rural, regional and remote Australia have experienced since the partial privatisation of Telstra.
Some of the details of this bill—some of which build on the No. 1 amendment bill—which the opposition either support or do not oppose go to the setting of the cost of the universal service obligation in advance. That is a sensible proposition which is not objected to by the opposition. But we make the point that, in the course of setting or fixing the cost of the universal service obligation in advance—a point that we made in respect of the No. 1 bill—too much discretion is given to the minister and not enough of a requirement is there to act on the advice of the Australian Communications Authority, the relevant regulator in this area. The $150 million competitive tender for the extension of the local call zones to the outer extended area is not opposed per se. What is objected to strongly is the qualitative difference between the requirement of this legislation and the tender which would see Telstra commercially remove itself from that area—that is, 80 per cent of the Australian landmass. That point is made in the memo that I referred to earlier. The officer said: 
i) The fact is that investment in the CAN—
customer access network—
and in uneconomic services in rural Australia cannot be assumed. The new USO arrangements have increased the capital risk of investment in USO areas and Telstra needs to explore ways of reducing this risk.
ii) Assisted competitor entry ... obligations are not competitively neutral.
This makes the point—and it makes the point earlier in this memo that I have referred to—that Telstra will proceed to make commercial decisions if it is not required to be operating in the marketplace as a national universal service obligation provider.
Our amendment to the motion for the second reading details our key areas of concern, but I indicate to the House that, in the Senate, we propose to move detailed amendments which reflect the general concerns expressed by the second reading amendment but which draw upon the concerns expressed in the Labor senators' minority report on this legislation. The areas highlighted by the second reading amendment include the point I made earlier about the $150 million tender, a requirement for comprehensive evaluation of the pilot projects before the parliament moves to further consideration of competitive tendering of the USO, and a requirement that Telstra be required to be the public universal service obligation provider without that being able to be undermined without express parliamentary agreement.
The Labor senators' minority report on this bill was tabled in the other place in August this year. I quickly indicate some of the main recommendations of that report which reflect the opposition's position. The report reads:
... Labor Senators support the trial and proper evaluation of USO contestability on a local, regional or niche basis.
They were making the point that the opposition is only too happy to contemplate the universal service obligation competitive tendering, but subject to trial and proper evaluation. The Labor senators went on to make the point that the No. 2 bill should be amended to:
provide for a public and independent review of the two trials and subsequent report to Parliament, that review to take place before further Universal Service Obligation contestability decisions are considered ...
Amendments will be moved in the other place to reflect that view. A further recommendation from the Labor senators' minority report was that this bill be amended to retain Telstra as the national universal service provider and to remove the provisions allowing a carrier other than Telstra to become a universal service provider, making the point that the parliament of the day, not the government of the day, should make that fundamental threshold decision. Labor senators also made the point, as I have, regarding the $150 million tender for the extension of local calls to the outer zones, that Telstra ought to continue as the universal service obligation provider for that 80 per cent of the Australian landmass and, as I have indicated, Labor will move accordingly in the Senate. A range of other detailed amendments are made in the course of the Labor senators' minority report which we will pursue in detail in the Senate.
Before the parliament rose prior to the Olympics, the government circulated a range of amendments which, at first inspection, either are technical or seek to bring the No. 2 bill into line with changes made in the Senate to the No. 1 bill. Whilst we reserve our rights, our first assessment is that none of those amendments cause any great difficulty. I indicated that an amendment to the motion for the second reading had been circulated in my name and I now move:  
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House, recognising the fundamental importance of high quality and reliable telecommunications services to all Australians now and in the future:
(1)	condemns the Government for its continuing push towards the full privatisation of Telstra which will inevitably lead to a decline in services to rural and regional Australia;
(2)	recognises the importance of the Universal Service Obligation to the delivery of minimum communications services to rural and regional Australia;
(3)	notes that while the Government is holding up competitive tendering as the solution to rural and regional service delivery difficulties and as a justification of the full privatisation of Telstra;
(a)	its plan is limited to two pilot projects the results of which will not be known for a number of years; and
(b)	its decision to require Telstra to remain as a safety net provider of last resort in the areas to be covered by the pilot projects acknowledges the unique role of Telstra in the delivery of services to rural and regional Australia and the folly of pursuing full privatisation;
(4)	calls on the Government to ensure that no further competitive tendering decisions are made prior to a comprehensive evaluation of the results of the two pilot projects;
(5)	notes with concern that Telstra will be excluded as the Primary Universal Service Provider and will only provide service on a `commercial' basis to 80 percent of Australia if it is unsuccessful in its  bid for the Government's $150 million tender for untimed local call access in remote areas; and
(6)	calls on the Government to ensure that the $150 million tender proceeds on the same basis as the two pilot projects, namely with Telstra as the provider of last resort; and
(7)	notes the wide Ministerial discretion given with respect of the calculation of the cost of the Universal Service Obligation, and the need for this to be on the basis of Australian Communications Authority advice”.
Our second reading amendment indicates to the House our key areas of concern with the government's legislation. I have indicated those areas where it is proposed that we would move detailed amendments in the Senate. I conclude my remarks by making the point that you have a qualitative difference of approach between the $150 million tender for the extension of local call zones to the remote areas, or to the outer extended zone—that if Telstra is not the successful recipient of that tender it can be in a position to make a commercial decision as to whether to remove itself from 80 per cent of the Australian landmass—contrasted with the requirement by the government that Telstra remain in the marketplace for the two pilot project areas as a safety net provider of last resort whilst the pilot projects are under way and, presumably, some evaluation of those projects is made. There is a qualitative difference in approach, which has never been fully or properly explained by the government, which would leave prospectively 80 per cent of the Australian landmass at risk of not being serviced in any way by Telstra on the basis of Telstra making a commercial decision to remove itself from those remote, rural and regional areas. 
 (Mr Mossfield)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2000-10-03,"—The No. 1 bill in this sequence was introduced in May this year, enabling the minister to determine universal service providers' net universal service costs for up to three years in advance and to detail the universal service regime that would apply after the awarding of the tender to extend untimed local calls in remote Australia. That bill drew concerns from non-government quarters about the extent of ministerial discretion and compulsory information requirements placed on unsuccessful universal service providers. Amendments were made in the Senate and the government is moving relevant amendments to this Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 to ensure that it remains consistent with the No. 1 bill with regard to those issues. 
It is one thing to legislate a universal service obligation; it is another to ensure its conditions are met. In those remote areas where the cost of delivery of modern telecommunications is not attractive to any player in the marketplace, subsidies will need to be delivered indefinitely by the government, whoever wins that subsidised tender. In that regard the Australian telecommunications market is not, as the minister would have it, a competitive market. It is competitive only in those areas of the market where there is critical subscriber mass, where there is a buck to be made. One does not need to get too remote to find areas that are not attractive to the players in today's telecommunications market, and that includes Telstra. I have had enough cases in the electorate of Calare to suggest that anything beyond 30 kilometres outside a major regional centre is remote for telecommunications providers and consumers. In fact, the member for Riverina a few minutes back suggested 300 metres from Wagga Wagga telephone exchange is remote for some of her constituents.
What is the sense of selling off Telstra to obtain the funds to subsidise players in a so-called competitive market to provide services that can be funded only by selling off that silverware? Pray, what do we do to fund that subsidy when Telstra is sold off? Do we use normal revenue from some other source, presumably taxation? We sell off a $1 billion or $2 billion revenue stream that can do the job and subsidise privateers, including a private Telstra, to do the job under the sort of universal service areas determined by this legislation. Private shareholders reap the benefits then, while their supposedly free market companies soak up public subsidies to provide essential services. So much for the marketplace delivering services through competition! 
The Australian people, especially in the bush, will not fall for that one. The private shareholders and the private operators in the market would be licking their lips at the prospect of picking up a generous government subsidy to do a job that we could and should be doing ourselves, because as sure as night follows day those service standards to non-profitable parts of the network will deteriorate. Ten or 20 years down the track there may very well be no tenders for the inevitable new technology that needs to be installed. What happens then? Perhaps then the government of the day will need to set up a new government telco to do the job. Why, ask most Australians not obsessed with short-term share gains aided by obscenely generous capital gains tax arrangements, do we not hold on to the only guarantee of universal service, the only long-term guarantee of a level playing field of equal city-country telecommunications into the distant future—and that is to retain ownership?
Indeed, the bill's explanatory memorandum says any repeal of the USO legislation and a total reliance on the market forces are not a realistic option. The memorandum says:
... there is general acceptance that the provision of universal service in telecommunications needs to be underpinned by a regulatory framework that provides for the provision and subsidisation of loss-making services. 
That is self-evident. Under the regime proposed in this bill, the net universal service cost—that is, the cost incurred by Telstra in fulfilling its USO—will be replaced in proposed section 16 by a universal service subsidy. Each universal service area will have a subsidy determined by the minister and payable only to those PUSPs, primary universal service providers, or CUSPs, competing universal service providers, who have taken all reasonable steps to fulfil their service obligations. Given the unattractiveness of the USO and the risk of default, even under a regulatory regime, why not ensure a consistent provision of that obligation through the existing carrier? After all, a monopoly on unprofitable services is no real monopoly at all; it is a community service responsibility that rightly belongs with the government of the day and not the market. We have such a discrepancy between what Telstra regards as the cost of the USO, $1.8 billion, and what the other major carriers cost it at, about $200 million, that the public outside major urban and regional centres have every reason to be vehemently opposed to any sacrifice of the means of ensuring the USO is delivered to all—that is, the retention in public ownership of the controlling interest in Telstra. 
As the Bills Digest suggests, there is a strong possibility that competition will actually increase the cost of the USO and therefore ultimately the cost of services to consumers. So much for the competitive market driving down cost for the consumer. So much too for the competitive market driving down costs of phone services. We have seen in recent days increases in Telstra call rates which have been described by, among others, the central Macquarie business group in Dubbo as disgraceful. The increase from 9.9c to 12c a minute for 50-kilometre to 85-kilometre calls will especially hurt rural and regional areas, and these concerns have been well documented by various groups, including the New South Wales Farmers Association. All this was done before the results of Telstra's own call zone inquiry were known. New South Wales Farmers chief executive, Jon McKeown, says increases in STD call charges fly in the face of commitments by the head of Telstra Countrywide, Doug Campbell, to improve telecommunications services for rural people. As he says, the price hikes will hit rural people who do not have access to their local business centres at local call rates, unlike the millions in Sydney who can call untimed from, say, Cronulla to Asquith and beyond for business or personal purposes.
On top of this Telstra now plans to rationalise its call centres, with one in danger of shutdown being the one in Bathurst described just 18 months ago as the most productive in the country, its workers the best in Telstra's employ. This centre can be given no guarantee by Mr Campbell—in a letter to me last week—that it will survive. Bathurst call centre will go not for any economic reasons or for any lack of quality amongst its staff, given awards a little over 12 months ago for their input into that organisation's profitability; it will go because of interference by the government to make sure Telstra's so-called megacentres are located in areas that will derive maximum political advantage. How could Bega or Cooma in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro better meet the work force requirements of Telstra than Bathurst and its established staff and their families? Yet that is a likely scenario: uprooting families, rationalising staff and concentrating numbers where the government dictates. So much for market driven solutions.
I will return to the specifics of the bill. Optus is one operator to openly doubt the viability of the proposed competitive framework, going so far as to tell the Senate committee:
... no carrier will tender in contestable areas because the contestable model does not encourage competition, and the total USO cost will increase as contestability is introduced.
I believe that the model for competitive delivery of the universal service obligation is flawed, and even Telstra's competitors in the marketplace agree. I notice that the minister's representative in the House recently trumpeted the improvements in Telstra's customer service guarantee with the release of the ACA report on Telstra's performance between June 1999 and June 2000. In major rural areas, he says, the report indicates a 27 per cent improved performance so that 83 per cent of cases are meeting the CSG. He says that this proves that legislative powers are far more important than ownership. I suggest it is largely because of that ownership and the ability of MPs to represent those owners, the public, that Telstra has improved its customer service guarantee performance—if that is, indeed, what has occurred.
But if you looked behind those figures the story might be quite different. I contend—and I said this to the recent Besley inquiry—that to properly gauge what is happening with Telstra's service levels in regional areas like Calare not only Mr Besley's committee but also the Australian Communications Authority should obtain for each relevant service area Telstra's internal yearly records for such measurements as the amount of cable laid above ground for each area, the faults per hundred services per annum, man hours required per new service connection, man hours required to fix each reported fault, spending on maintenance per annum, spending on staff and apprenticeships per annum, and average industry experience of technicians. Only these figures—not performance against customer service guarantee—give a true picture of Telstra's performance. We heard the member for Riverina not so long ago detailing some of that lack of performance. 
It cannot be denied that recent entrants into the Australian telecommunications sector have cherry-picked the market, providing services in profitable areas but ignoring areas where it is simply uneconomic to operate. They may have met their original licence conditions in servicing the majority of the market, but this certainly is nowhere near the majority of the geography—and therein lies the problem with the competitive market model as it applies to telecommunications delivery across Australia.
There is justifiable excitement in many regional areas, such as Orange and Bathurst, about the potential for private telco operations to provide upgraded services. In my own electorate, the Orantel organisation, with strong corporate backing, is investigating the feasibility of a localised telecommunications system to service the major population centres. But, whereas the major population centres will benefit if there is indeed sufficient critical customer mass to make the thing profitable, it has no relevance to people living outside the regional centres. They will not benefit. They may as well be as remote as Coolabah or the black stump. They simply do not figure on the corporate radar.
Glib assurances that any successful bidder for the USO would be required to provide better services than those currently offered are no guarantee that those services will actually be delivered. Indeed, those bidding for the USO will be required to provide a basic telephone service, fax and 64-bit Internet access. The most creative bid will probably win the job—and the $150 million subsidy that goes with it. But what happens down the track? What guarantees are there that the next generation of telecommunications advances can ever be guaranteed to the non-profitable parts of the market?
It is interesting to quote from the infamous Telstra internal memo, issued at the completion of the Besley inquiry, to get a flavour of the real commitment to rural and regional Australia from the only still publicly owned telco. Telstra expects, according to that memo, that Mr Besley will report—and I understand that report is now with the government—that:
... our customers have soaring expectations, not just in terms of service levels, but also in relation to mobile coverage, internet access and advanced services.
Today's advanced services are tomorrow's basic services. In the memo the author, Deena Shiff, states:
There remains a risk that some additional measure of service achievement needs to be flagged, that enables a sale to be triggered.
In other words, despite the obvious shortfall in service delivery with something like 15,000 jobs backlogged in central and southern New South Wales a few months ago according to my sources, Telstra is admitting its nervousness at the probable requirement that it will be required to promote its service achievements beyond the reality in order to meet the political imperatives of the government, no doubt, in the lead-up to the next election. Just wait for the propaganda blitz; it has already begun. But country people know that they need more than Countrywide. They need not more chiefs but Indians on the ground to get the job done—to build the infrastructure, to provide that data line on reasonable demand.
In my electorate there are many areas requiring significant upgrading before new services can be put on. I would argue, despite the TV ads depicting upgrades in my area, that a matter of years, not months, are needed to get the network up to that standard. I will not be satisfied—nor should any members in rural areas, or anywhere else for that matter, be satisfied—that things are improving, until the service guarantee is met consistently in all areas of the electorate. I would cite the example of the business in Oberon—not a remote area by any means—which in early September was still waiting for a fax line ordered in April, or another customer east of Bathurst who ordered a basic phone line in March. 
It is interesting to note the comments in the Telstra internal memo to senior executives about this bill. Miss Shiff, who wrote it, says that she believes the USO contestability in the proposed legislation establishes terms of entry which are `potentially competitively balanced against Telstra'. The memo goes on:
The incoming Universal Service Provider may be required to provide a lesser range of services to Telstra, and can choose its customers. Telstra must service all, with, in all probability, a reduced USO contribution.
The memo continues:
The implications of this are worrying, if the Besley Report picks up these themes and dedicates future Networking the Nation type funds for assisting non-Telstra entry into rural Australia.
This very informative memo outlines how the complaints or expectations of telephone subscribers in the bush are investment driven. That has been my argument and that of other rural Australians all along. I have highlighted all that in the hundreds of cases I have documented, cases which most other rural representatives in this chamber have deliberately ignored or cases in which they have chosen to accept the `political sell at whatever cost' philosophy of their masters. Those facts have been out there in all electorates. Telstra admits in the memo:
Facilitating service based competitive entry ... via demand aggregation schemes or for that matter portable subsidies ... does nothing to solve the problem.
Telstra says that the sort of strategy inherent in this bill does nothing to solve the problem. It also suggests a lobbying tactic to reinforce the view that setting community service guarantees is not a political winner. It certainly is not. A CSG payment of $12 a day for individuals or $20 a day for business is certainly no compensation when you depend on the phone. Telstra admits in the memo:
Investment in uneconomic services in Australia cannot be assumed.
That is an honest admission indeed and exactly the point I and others who care have been making about the impossibility of the market delivering those sorts of services to rural and remote areas of Australia on any other basis than by continuing public subsidy. We should not flog off Telstra, which would then join those other private operators who will continue correctly to argue that provision of USO services to the remote and not so remote areas is uneconomic. In the cynical final paragraph to the memo, Telstra management suggests:
We need to offer up some additional services safeguards which are politically saleable.
As the Sydney Morning Herald reported it, `Telstra's secret plan: a little bit of service for a lot of privatisation'. The Telstra memo says:
Regrettably although Besley is committed to market-based solutions, the rural constituencies are not.
People in rural and remote Australia are not committed for one simple reason: they know Telstra admits in this document that the market will not deliver services where it is uneconomic to do so. The problem is that a subsidised market is not a free market and it will take a heavily subsidised market to deliver the USO to rural and regional Australia. The USO can be funded into the distant future only by retaining ownership in public hands and deriving the extra revenue stream benefits to the Australian people that Telstra will generate. The Bills Digest argues:
The difficulty of determining the net effect of competition on the cost of providing the USO provides strong justification for limiting the introduction of contestability to two trial areas.
While they are trials, the bill sets up the framework for the contestable regime to be expanded to other areas without further consideration of the trials by parliament. It is a rather complex piece of legislation, but basically it is attempting to force the market to provide a solution to telecommunications service problems in areas that the market itself has deemed uneconomic. The risk is that the imposition of such an artificial economy will actually produce the very inefficiencies the market based solutions are meant to reduce.
There are some other problems in the bill as well, and several are picked up by the opposition's second reading amendment. Internet service providers are also objecting to provisions that will likely make them liable for paying the USO levy when in fact they are already paying for access to the carriers. I am pleased to see some tightening of ministerial accountability in some of the government's amendments, but I have grave doubts that the purposes of this bill are achievable for the reasons I have outlined, and I believe it is more about setting up the veneer of service guarantee in a pre-election climate than it is about truly looking after the needs of rural telephone subscribers.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I rise this evening to make my contribution to the debate on the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 and the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 2000. I congratulate the member for Calare for his very erudite presentation to the parliament just a moment ago, because he touched on many of the issues that are dear to my heart and indeed to the hearts of those who sit on this side of the chamber. The basic purpose of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 is to improve the operation of the universal service regime and the associated funding arrangements and to enable the competitive selection of universal service providers. The Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 2000 relates to the funding of the former legislation and amends the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1997. The universal service obligation, USO, exists to ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live or manage their businesses, have equitable access to telephone services, payphones and prescribed carriage services. A digital data service obligation, DDSO, also exists to guarantee that all Australians have high speed access to the Internet via a digital data service with data delivery capacity of 64 kilobytes per second. At present, Telstra has exclusive responsibility for fulfilling the USO and the DDSO.
I particularly want to discuss the USO contestability trials, trials that consider the introduction of competition in the provision of the USO on a local, regional or niche basis. I generally support the introduction of competition and also the idea that industry costs may be reduced, but I do have a number of concerns. I am very concerned that at some future time the government might use these trials to justify the sale of the remainder of Telstra. We all know that the government is hell-bent on privatising Telstra. Something that Senator Alston said in the lead-up to the Olympic Games also comes to mind. He said that it would be criminally negligent if ministers like him did not accept hospitality from Telstra and the like at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Going through my mind when I was preparing for this speech was what hospitality he and other members of the government may have accepted from Telstra to go to the Olympic Games. One wonders whether they accepted 100 per cent hospitality or whether they just accepted 49 per cent hospitality with a 51 per cent hospitality add-on to come with the full sale of Telstra. It would be very interesting to know which representatives of the government and Telstra were in the Telstra hospitality box during the Olympic Games at the Sydney stadium.
For months and months in the lead-up to the Olympic Games, we had to endure the government's criticism of the administration of the Olympic Games. Day in and day out, in this House and in the media, Bob Carr was bagged, Michael Knight was bagged, the New South Wales government was bagged and SOCOG was bagged, yet members of the government were very quick to embrace the bosom of Olympic hospitality and to be seen at the Olympic Games—and no doubt some government representatives were in the Telstra box.
I see the Minister for Finance and Administration at the table and I am aware that he would have accepted taxpayer funded hospitality at the Olympic Games. I have no criticism of that, because the member for Macarthur is also a former Premier of New South Wales, and he made a very great contribution to Sydney securing the Olympic Games. I hope he was not in the Telstra box because, as a member of cabinet, he will have a very critical role if the government do decide to fully privatise Telstra. It would be very interesting to know the members—particularly those who sit on the front bench—who were there accepting the hospitality of Telstra when the government are obviously going to fully privatise Telstra at the first opportunity. 
Under this legislation, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts may determine that a service obligation in a universal service area is a contestable service obligation. This means that a carrier or a carriage service provider can apply to the Australian Communications Authority, ACA, for approval as a competing universal service provider, or CUSP. The ACA is allowed to approve the applicant as a CUSP only if it is satisfied that the applicant is appropriate—having (1) relevant technical competence and experience; (2) commercial competence and financial standing; and (3) an approved policy statement and marketing plans. The CUSP is able to provide an alternative telecommunications services marketing plan, which must satisfy the ACA that it fulfils the relevant service obligation. Under this legislation, if a CUSP intends to cease performing the contestable service obligation, the ACA may instruct it to comply with further requirements. This may mean the CUSP has to extend the service until the appointment of a new CUSP or until the transition of customers to the primary universal service provider, PUSP, is complete.
I am supportive of the USO trials in that they are about considering ways to provide better services. I therefore call for an independent public review of the two trials and a subsequent report to parliament before any further USO contestability decisions are made. I note the government's approach on this issue has been more about pushing through this legislation to allow tender arrangements for providing untimed local calls in the outer extended zones. If Telstra loses that tender, under the legislation it may not be required to continue as the carrier of last resort, or the PUSP. Instead, it will be able to make a commercial decision whether it will continue to serve 80 per cent of the landmass. This will be a cause for concern if Telstra fails to win the proposed $150 million tender for the provision of local calls in remote areas.
I believe it is integral to the public interest to ensure that Telstra is kept as the PUSP for the whole of Australia, particularly in the 80 per cent of the Australian landmass which falls in the extended outer zones, and that the provisions in this legislation which permit another carrier to become the PUSP are removed. My main concern—a concern shared by many of my constituents in Lowe—is that the government will use the two trials as a justification to fully privatise Telstra. I have no doubt that it will. I was elected on a platform to oppose the further privatisation of Telstra, and I strongly support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the shadow minister for communications, Stephen Smith.
There are a number of reasons that Telstra must remain in public hands, including—first and foremost—the fact that the ownership of telecommunications infrastruc-ture is a public good, particularly because of the massive distances between population centres, which make telecommunications so important to Australia's social fabric. The Australian share market is too small to effectively support a one-off share float of 51 per cent of Telstra, meaning undesirable long-term consequences for the Australian economy if such a large float occurred in one hit. Telstra provides considerable revenue to the government. It is in the public interest for the government to hold on to a company that provides our nation with significant dividends. If it were to sell the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra, it might cause a deficit in future Commonwealth budgets. Further to this, telecommunications is a major growth industry in our economy. We should maintain our current interest in Telstra for the economic good of the country.
Majority government ownership means that Telstra will not fall into the hands of foreign interests. If Telstra is sold, future Australian governments may be put under pressure to abolish restrictions on foreign ownership as part of trade liberalisation. The government has the ability to supply rural and regional Australia with better infrastructure without privatising the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra. This can be done by allocating the annual dividends paid by Telstra to invest in Telstra's regional infrastructure. USO levies paid by private carriers, such as Optus, may also be diverted to regional infrastructure investment where it would not otherwise be a commercial proposition to undertake such investments. Finally, if Telstra is to remain in public hands, it will continue to facilitate the cross-subsidisation of services which are important to our society. In other words, services which are socially desirable may be profitable and Telstra, if fully privatised, could dispense with these nonprofit services. 
This is another example of the utilitarian approach of the Howard government. I have raised this in relation to many issues that have come before the House. While the government continues to hold 51 per cent of Telstra, cross-subsidisation will continue to take place and this is in the public interest. Put simply, the majority public ownership of Telstra gives the government a more effective capacity to implement public interest policies than if it were a fully private telecommunications carrier. If Telstra is to remain in public hands until 2007, it is expected that Telstra will pay the government dividends of around $1 billion a year. What is wrong with that? One billion dollars is a lot of lolly.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Prior to being politely interrupted for the dinner adjournment I was talking about the importance of keeping that 51 per cent of Telstra in public hands and expressing my concern on behalf of my constituents in Lowe about the government's desire to fully privatise Telstra. I was talking about the potential dividends—in the order of $1 billion—which would be derived to the long-suffering taxpayer over the next seven years were the 51 per cent of Telstra to remain owned by us the taxpayers. It is also important in this debate to remember that the initial one-third sale of Telstra was a disaster. The government gave it away for approximately half of its true value, with a consequent loss of about $14 billion. I have spoken before in this House about this disgraceful plundering of the public interest.
What guarantees will the government give the Australian people that further privatisation will not further devalue Telstra? This is yet another argument for why we should not sell the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra. The government will not give Australians any guarantees. There will be no guarantees to those rural and regional people who are isolated from major cities and are dependent on telecommunications now provided by Telstra. There will be no guarantees to my constituents in Strathfield, Drummoyne and Concord. If Telstra were to be further privatised, I would be gravely concerned about the future of telecommunications in this country.
I noted earlier this afternoon, when I was listening to the debate, that the member for Riverina came into the chamber and talked about the disadvantages faced by schools and also several of her constituents from Junee and Griffith. The member for Riverina discussed how Telstra is not providing the services required to provide access to Internet services and mobile phones. I agree. As someone who was born and raised in a little country town called Dunedoo in New South Wales, I am aware that problems similar to those being experienced by the constituents of the member for Riverina are being experienced in that part of rural Australia. How can the member get up and say how Telstra is failing her community when she supported the sale and further sale of Telstra—the reason for poor telecommunications in rural and regional areas? I hope that the member for Riverina will continue to keep her constituents in mind when the government pushes, as it undoubtedly will, for the further sale of Telstra.
It is supreme hypocrisy for the member for Riverina to come in here and purport to stand up on behalf of her constituents and talk about the deficiencies in communications in that part of Australia when she herself supported the 49 per cent privatisation and will no doubt support the full privatisation when the government are in a position to push that legislation. I happen to quite like the member for Riverina—she is a very nice person—but I think it is appalling when members of the government come in here and start crying on behalf of their electorate when they themselves are selling their own constituents down the drain. I think that is disgraceful. I hope the member for Riverina, like other members who have participated in this debate—and I am not just singling her out; I just happened to hear her contribution to this debate—bears this in mind when decisions are taken by the coalition to fully privatise Telstra. And I hope that she stands up in her party room and speaks for her constituents in the same manner in which she expressed concerns about communications in her area here this afternoon. I hope she will make good on her strong words and reject the further sale to ensure the services to the Riverina are not further eroded. 
I would like to turn momentarily to the issue of the universal service subsidy, where under this bill the minister may set a determination for the universal service providers subsidy entitlement for up to three years in advance. I support this approach on the proviso that the minister ought to receive advice from the ACA before setting the level of USO subsidy. I would also mention that any charges imposed by universal service providers are subject to price control determinations and that to increase charges the carrier may have to get consent from the minister or the ACCC. So I generally support the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 2000, which implements the measures incidental to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 to allow the government to make carriage service providers jointly liable in proportion to their revenue to the USO levy. That part of the legislation is okay.
I would like to reiterate that I strongly support the opposition amendment and the statements made by the shadow minister for communications, Stephen Smith, earlier today in this House that Telstra should remain in public hands and continue to properly service the outer extended zones, which cover 80 per cent of Australia's landmass. The government has a responsibility to the public interest to ensure that cross-subsidisation takes place and that the USO is fulfilled for those in rural and remote areas.
In conclusion, I support the amendment of the shadow minister. I condemn the government for pushing the full privatisation of Telstra. Is the vast amount of revenue which is being derived from the GST—and, more recently, the record revenue which is flowing into the coffers of the Treasury from the increases in oil prices—not enough? Why is there a need to fully privatise Telstra? There is plenty of revenue, and the government knows that. That was raised here in question time this afternoon. Any other member of the government who intends to participate in this debate should put their hands up for their own constituencies, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, and oppose the full privatisation of Telstra. Obviously, that is not in the public interest and is looking after only those people who are interested in making a quick buck by buying shares and hoping to make a quick return. I will be interested to hear the member for Capricornia, who will shortly follow my comments on this bill, because she represents a constituency in Queensland where there would be major problems with the full privatisation of Telstra.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I thank the member for Lowe for the introduction. He has hit the nail right on the head, because there are a lot of problems with the continued push by the government to seek the further privatisation of Telstra. That has a lot of negatives for my electorate, which I will go into. Like most of the initiatives of this government on telecommunications, the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 2000 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 are more about the ongoing push by this government to sell off the rest of Telstra than about ensuring improved or even adequate levels of telecommunications infrastructure and service in regional and rural Australia. The sell-off of Telstra over the last four years fits very neatly into the Howard government's overall theme of ignoring the needs and opportunities of regional Australia. The Howard government either does not see or does not care that the future of regional Australia—any hope of making the most of our opportunities or even achieving a decent standard of living—depends on access to world class telecommunications infrastructure and the technical support on the ground to put that in place and keep it operating. 
With the privatisation so far of half of Telstra we are going backwards on both of those measures in regional Australia—that is, on infrastructure and service. The story so far in my electorate of Capricornia in Central and western Queensland has not been a happy one. We have seen a reduction of services to Central Queensland, particularly in rural areas. But you do not have to go far, even around Rockhampton, to hear about the delays in Telstra services. The employees are just not there anymore to do the work that is needed. For example, not so long ago I had a discussion with members of the Kalapa branch of the Country Women's Association who were trying to get a phone connected in their hall. Telstra had run the cable up to the building but a private contractor then had the job of completing the connection. When the CWA ladies asked the contractor what was going on and why this phone had not yet been installed they were told that no electrician would do the job for the price the contractor was paying. So these ladies, who do an awful lot of work for their community, got the total run-around for weeks just to get a single phone installed. This is in Kalapa, which is only half an hour from Rockhampton, so I do not think the partial privatisation of Telstra is a big hit out there.
—You are not much of a local member.
—It has been fixed now, don't worry. Of course the further out you go in my electorate the worse it gets. It is the western parts of my electorate—places like Jericho, Aramac and Winton—that will suffer the most from Telstra's lack of interest in the bush in the name of profits and privatisation. Poor service standards are only part of the story. The further privatisation of Telstra that this government is insisting on will mean more job losses in Central Queensland. Very recently in my electorate I was contacted by a former employee of Telstra who had taken a redundancy and started work for one of the contractors, Kilpatrick Green. He and 18 of his fellow employees are now not working—they have not worked for some time—because Telstra, obviously with one eye on the budget coming up to the end of the financial year, has cut back on work around our area. These blokes are now sitting on their tool boxes waiting to get the call-out for more work. So that is 19 people that this fellow has told me about not working as a result of that decision by Kilpatrick Green in response to Telstra's withdrawal.
—Righto, I'll check it out.
—You can check this out, because I really want an answer on this: what is going to happen with the call centre jobs in Rockhampton? Telstra announced earlier that we are looking at thousands of job losses in call centres around Australia.
—The announcement last week by Telstra did not specify where these call centre jobs were going. They did say that they would be consulting with the government on where those jobs were going to be taken from and where they were going to be put into. As the minister seems very interested in what is going on, I would like a guarantee that the call centre employees in Rockhampton will keep their jobs. Thank you very much, Minister—good of you to take that up.
Of course we have seen other techs being made redundant from Telstra in our area in the last four years. The effect that this has is quite major in Capricornia, because a reduction of the permanent work force in towns like Longreach and Barcaldine—even in Rockhampton—really has a big impact. Contractors are not going to live in places like Longreach and Barcaldine. They will come in and out to do the jobs and the projects that they have to do; they will not be staying around and contributing to the viability of those towns. So there is nothing in privatising Telstra for our part of Queensland, and the feedback that I get as I travel around the electorate is that people know that all too well. That leaves the Howard government in a tough position because they are determined to sell off the rest of Telstra. Despite the falling service levels and despite the record profits that could be coming back to the government through dividends for years into the future, we keep seeing the government try to build a rhetorical case for the further privatisation of Telstra. But the rhetoric has a big job ahead of it to overcome the facts of the downside of privatisation that abound in rural Australia. 
Part of the rhetoric the government has relied on to dress up its push for privatisation is the Besley inquiry, but it seems that that inquiry is heading the way of the Prime Minister's `never ever' promise on the GST. Before the last election the federal government promised to hold an independent, legislated inquiry to ascertain that service levels were adequate in rural and regional Australia before proceeding with further privatisation. What we have ended up with is an inquiry whose terms of reference never came back to the parliament and whose make-up and proceedings were less than credible from the start. Most recently, we saw the memo from Telstra that they certainly did not want the opposition to know about. That memo spelled out what everyone suspected about the inquiry; that is, that the report will say what it needs to say to provide cover for the government to flog off the rest of Telstra. This legislation is another part of the government's rhetoric to try to counterbalance the realities of what is happening out in the bush. The government is basically saying: `Yes, service levels have been dropping in regional Australia since the partial privatisation, but here is the answer'—the next rhetorical answer from the government—`competitive tendering of the universal service obligation.' This bill, the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000, provides the legislative framework for the two trials of universal service obligation contestability that the government announced earlier this year. As the shadow minister has explained in proposing his amendment to the government's bill, the Labor Party has no fundamental objection to exploring the potential for other carriers to take on the universal service obligation where such a move can be shown to be capable of delivering better telecommunication services to a particular regional community. My concern is that this proposal for competitive tendering of the USO comes at a time when the government is looking for justification to sell off the remainder of Telstra. There is a real danger of this pilot exercise going the way of the Besley inquiry and coming up with the results that suit the government's privatisation agenda rather than it being a dispassionate evaluation of what is potentially in it for regional Australia.
In its rush to privatise Telstra, the government is holding this pilot project up—no matter what the outcome may be—as the answer to service shortfalls in rural Australia. If we have a look at what is proposed in the government's USO tendering process, there are two pilot projects. The universal service obligation to provide standard telephone services will be put up for tender in the regions of south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia as one region, and the second region will include north-east New South Wales and parts of south-east Queensland. The interesting thing to note is that Telstra will be required to remain as the primary universal service provider or the carrier of last resort in those two pilot regions, so it is a bit odd that, in trying to set up a shining example to justify the privatisation of Telstra, the government has highlighted to everyone in rural and regional Australia just how crucial the role of Telstra is in providing telecommunication services to everyone in Australia no matter where they live. That is not telling the people in my electorate anything. They are against the privatisation of Telstra in places like Muttaburra and Alpha because they know the reality is that private companies just are not going to be falling over themselves to provide services in those rural and remote areas. They need Telstra—and a Telstra in government hands—to have any hope of receiving decent service levels and keeping in touch with the technological developments in major centres. If other service providers want to take the opportunity to pick up work in those rural areas and increase competition and consumer choice, that is fine. But Telstra has to maintain its investment in and its commitment to rural Australia so that there is some guarantee to people in the bush that the telecommunication service will be there if and when the profits are not. That is one aspect of this proposal and this bill that should ring a big alarm bell in rural Australia. Competitive tendering of the USO is worth a look, but only if Telstra is in there as the provider of last resort. 
The second aspect of the pilot project that I cannot help but notice and mention is the location. I cannot claim to be an expert on south-west Victoria, but my guess is that we are talking about an area three to four hours from Melbourne. As for the area in northern New South Wales, there are a number of major centres in that part of the state. There is no immediate comparison, as far as I can understand, between those areas and the western parts of my electorate in terms of the distance from major towns and even the distances between small communities and properties there. I would say there would need to be very careful analysis of the results of trials in those pilot areas before one could have any confidence about the success or even viability of a tendering process for the universal service obligation in those remote parts of Central and Western Queensland. That is the essence of the ALP's reservations about this bill. There is nothing wrong with giving competitive tendering a try, but the evaluation has to be rigorous and any expansion of the universal service obligation contestability should also incorporate the safety net of Telstra, just as is being put in place with this trial.
I note that this bill would permit the government to go beyond the current trials and move to contestability of the universal service obligation with reference back to parliament through disallowance of the key decisions. I have grave concerns about those assumptions being made about the application of USO contestability before there is a chance for a proper and independent review of the outcome of the two trials about to get under way. The people in my electorate have already been sold a pup by this government when it comes to the GST. When it comes to something as vital to our future as telecommunications, I want to know exactly what competitive tendering of the USO has achieved in those trial regions and what potential pitfalls or advantages there may be for Central Queensland. If the government were honest they would know that such an evaluation cannot occur in the time between now and the election next year. Will that stop them using this process to shore up support for another sell off? I will be doing my best to make sure that rural voters in my electorate are awake to this con job by the government. I want to see some results before I see another multimillion dollar advertising campaign from this government before the next election, selling voters in Central Queensland on the supposed benefits of privatising Telstra on the basis that competitive tendering of the USO will solve all our service problems. I live in hope! I would feel much better taking part in this debate if I thought that the government was fair dinkum about the issues. It would be more satisfying if I thought that the government had introduced these bills to find a way to provide better telecommunication services to people living in Central Queensland and other parts of rural and regional Australia. But I fear that it is not. Instead, it is the latest attempt by the government to sugar-coat its determination to privatise Telstra.
I support all the recommendations in the shadow minister's amendment, but there is one in particular that I would like to address. A major concern with the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is the failure of the government to require Telstra to continue as a universal service provider if it fails to win the $150 million tender for the provision of untimed local calls in the extended outer zones. According to Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, the winner of the tender for untimed local calls automatically becomes the primary universal service provider for that area. This is in contrast to the contestability trials proposed in the bill we are debating tonight which keep Telstra on as a provider of last resort. The problem is that the extended outer zones make up about 80 per cent of Australia and a fair whack of the western part of my electorate. If Telstra does not win that work it will be free to withdraw its services from those areas. I therefore support the shadow minister's call for the government to amend the current bill to include Telstra as the provider of last resort regardless of the outcome of the tendering process for untimed local calls. 
I repeat the question that I asked at the beginning of my speech: does the government not know how things are in rural and regional Australia or does it just not care? If the Prime Minister would come to Central Queensland, he would see that the privatisation of Telstra just does not help us in any way. Our future growth and success relies heavily on world-class telecommunications just like the rest of Australia. But if the Prime Minister believes that the way for us to obtain that quality infrastructure is to privatise Telstra, then he really is living in a dream world. 
We have seen too many times in my electorate in Central Queensland what happens when our standard of infrastructure and services is left totally to market forces and to private enterprise. We have seen it with banks; we have seen it with petrol companies. The banks, with an eye to their bottom line, have shut down branches in our area and are providing a lower level of service to residents, particularly in smaller towns like Winton, Aramac and Jericho. It is the same thing with petrol. It does not suit the petrol companies to provide our fuel at the same price as the major metropolitan centres. There is no level playing field when it comes to Central Queensland—or rural and regional Australia generally—compared with the metropolitan areas. To assume that somehow telecommunications companies are going to go against the trend that we see from petrol companies and banks seems to be fairly misguided optimism.
It is not just our economic development opportunities that are going to rely on telecommunications services in the future. Increasingly, our most basic services in the fields of health, education and other government services are being provided through the use of telecommunications technology, which makes sense because it is cost-efficient. But the government and other service providers cannot on the one hand withdraw their services from small rural towns and regional areas with the promise that that will be taken up with telecommunications technology without also recognising that we need to have a very high level of telecommunications infrastructure and also technical support for maintenance of that infrastructure and those services.
In closing, it is time that we saw our future telecommunications needs in terms of infrastructure and service in regional Australia being determined by a government with strategic vision rather than just being left to market forces and the bottom line of private companies. I am supporting the two bills tonight and also supporting the recommendations moved in the form of a second reading amendment by the shadow minister as a way of making this process a real, comprehensive look at how we provide better services to rural and regional Australia rather than just provide the government with one more excuse to peddle out in rural and regional Australia to cover up for the further privatisation of Telstra, which they seem intent on pursuing.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2000-10-03,"—in reply—I was prepared to give the member for Capricornia the benefit of the doubt with regard to her sincerity and genuineness in representing the interests of her constituents and not just dismiss her contribution as being tired, worn and utterly predictable CPSU claims, as is the case with almost every opposition member's contribution. But when she said that the discussion within the government regarding the full privatisation of Telstra was the same con as the GST, I am afraid I had to lump her in the same category of oppositionists as her colleagues are. We know that from 1 July 2000 the Labor Party supports the GST. The best people can hope for from the Labor Party is that there will be a roll-back of parts of the GST. So the member for Capricornia borders on the point of hypocrisy when she attacks the GST. 
—Of course she walks out. She stands there, going around the world attacking the government on banks and petrol prices and then walks out when an attempt to answer her criticisms is made. It is typical of the Labor Party. We are never going to hear about roll-back on GST. It makes you think it is never going to happen, otherwise the Leader of the Opposition would have the courage of his convictions to give some depth and analysis to 18 months of commitment to roll-back. It is like the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. As we heard at question time today, the shadow minister for health has issued 30 press releases condemning, attacking and damning the private health insurance rebate and now suddenly the opposition supports it.  
—The minister should come to the point of the bill.
—I will come to the point of the debate. If any Labor supporter or potential Labor voter thinks that the Labor Party will hold true to any principled or ideological opposition to the privatisation of Telstra, they should look at their track record. Just as they said they would die in a ditch over the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, sure enough it happened—as it did to Qantas and a whole range of government business enterprises. The Labor Party have no credibility whatsoever on this issue of privatisation of Telstra.
I wish to thank the members of the government for their considered contributions to the second reading debate on Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 and cognate bill. The opposition speakers raised a number of issues in relation to the bills. Some of them were minor technical matters but there were a number of substantive points that require a direct reply, because they deliberately confuse and distort the debate over this very important legislation. The member for Swan made a number of fanciful claims without foundation or evidence or backing about the government's handling of the partial sale of Telstra. We certainly do not accept the claims that the Telstra privatisation has been anything less than a success. With regard to service levels, we had the members for McMillan and Calare amongst others on the opposition benches making a number of references to Telstra service levels. Of course you could always find examples of less than adequate services by any large service provider, Telstra included. The member for Groom brought some factual perspective to the debate by raising the Australian Communications Authority's most recent report on service levels.
From the way the member for Capricornia was talking you would think there had been a golden age of telecommunications—installation, maintenance, repair and expansion—under the old Telecom or the old PMG. In what period of the full privatisation of Telstra was it when all of your rural constituents and mine had instant connections, perfect service, no breakdowns and the latest technology? I would like to know in what period of Telecom's history, when it was in full government ownership, that that occurred. It never occurred. You speak of Telstra nostalgically as if it had always been the most perfect of all businesses. The member for Groom was right to inject a note of reality and fact into this debate by pointing to the ACA's the independent umpires legislative assessment of Telstra's service level performance. 
On 22 September this year the ACA announced a significant improvement in Telstra's performance over the last 12 months in connecting new services in regional areas within the time frames specified by the Telecommunications (Customer Service Guarantee) Standard 1997, the service guarantee standard that we brought in. Labor, when it had Telecom as its prized business enterprise, never introduced a customer service guarantee in this way—answerable to this parliament and to an independent statutory authority such as the ACA. Instead, the Labor Party was happy with Telecom. It thought Telecom was doing a great job. Really! Remember the 60 Minutes programs and the continual letters to the editor all through the 1980s and 1990s about Telecom's inefficiencies, Telecom's monopoly and Telecom's offhand arrogance? The member for Perth has graced us with his presence. Why doesn't he tell us when this golden age, this era of infallibility and perfection, of Telecom was? That is what I would really be interested in.  
Under this legislative performance, Telstra has never been more accountable in providing for rural as well as urban subscribers in every way. Under the ACA report, Telstra's performance rose by 27 percentage points to 83 per cent when compared to the June 1999 quarter. This improvement has not been made at the expense of the other areas of Telstra's customer service guarantee performance. In addition, the improvement builds on Telstra's performance in the previous quarter, which saw an improvement against most reporting parameters when compared to the same period last year. Would the member for Perth like to join the members for Groom and Riverina in congratulating Telstra for its improved performance, particularly when the introduction of USO contestability holds the promise of further improving service levels in the bush? I really do think the member for Perth should have the good grace, objectivity and impartiality to congratulate Telstra. 
The member for Swan complained that the USO reform is just a `crafty attempt' to further privatise Telstra. The ownership of Telstra is irrelevant to the standards of service all carriers are required to provide to customers. And the government and the community know that the USO can and will be fulfilled regardless of the ownership status of Telstra. Why is such a complex public policy and plain commercial point lost on the opposition? Why has no-one, from the member for Perth to the member for Capricornia and all speakers between, been able to explain why that is such an offensive argument with regard to the further privatisation of Telstra? The simple fact is that public ownership of Telstra does not guarantee a level of service. It is the legislative requirements imposed by a government that is the true test of holding carriers to standards of service that the community rightly expects and demands. 
The members for Swan and Calare also seem to operate under the misconception that Telstra delivers and funds the USO—a simple misunderstanding which renders their contributions quite incredible. They believe Telstra should deliver and fund the USO because it alone can afford to do so. The USO is industry funded and has been since 1991. The member for Groom again came to the rescue of ill-informed or deliberately misleading opposition members, and he explained that the USO is about funding unprofitable services regardless of who delivers them. The USO is a regulatory tool; it does not exist because of the ongoing ownership of Telstra. The same applies to the customer service guarantee introduced by the government, as I have stressed. 
The opposition is wrong when it says the government is portraying the USO tendering and the USO contestability as some kind of magical formula for improving telecommunications in regional Australia. We do see them as key initiatives with much to offer, but we are pursuing a multipronged strategy that also involves, firstly, promoting commercial service delivery through our pro-competitive legislation; secondly, targeting programs such as those under Networking the Nation and the Telstra social bonus; thirdly, providing strategic and practical government leadership, particularly in the areas of electronic commerce and government online, through the National Office for the Information Economy and the Office of Government Online; and, fourthly, where appropriate, other regulatory measures such as the customer service guarantee and the digital data service obligation. 
I have to say without hesitation that we welcome the support of the member for Perth for a thoughtful implementation of USO contestability. The opposition's main concern, it seems to me, revolves around the view that Telstra should be forever and a day the primary universal service provider. We in the government do not subscribe to this view. The government's view is that the carrier best suited for the role of primary universal service provider in a particular area should fulfil that role. What could be more commonsense than that? Under the government's reform strategy, Telstra will automatically be the primary universal service provider for the vast majority of USO customers—that is, those in the more populous 20 per cent of the country outside the extended zones. This is because in these regions Telstra, for historical reasons, is best suited to fulfil that role at present. Ensuring that Telstra is the primary universal service provider in the first instance will enable these customers to have the choice to stay with Telstra or to move to a new universal service provider. 
I do not want to labour a point already made, but I again make the point that Telstra's position as primary universal service provider does not require government ownership. They are separate issues. That does not mean that the primary universal service provider may not change in the future if someone better qualified emerges. But that is a matter for the future and one which would require the sanction of parliament as, under proposed section 12A, determination of another carrier as the primary universal service provider is disallowable. There is no inconsistency between having Telstra as a primary universal service provider and allowing competitors into the market. Telstra's role of primary universal service provider in the standard zones is simply recognition of the fact that it is currently the primary access provider and its service should continue to be available to customers. Consumers will receive additional benefits from the choice of offerings by competing universal service providers.
In a competitive market it is necessary to provide all players with equal opportunity to provide services and earn subsidies. The government does not anticipate the wider distribution of subsidies leading to wasteful duplication of infrastructure. The most likely outcome is for competing universal service providers to offer services based on alternative platforms, such as satellite or wireless mobile systems, thereby extending the benefits of these platforms into regional Australia. 
As the member for Perth colourfully, graphically and even dramatically illustrated with the maps he was waving around—in a poor imitation of the member for Hotham's teddy bear outfit of a few weeks ago on the GST—there is some point of difference between the government and the opposition as to who is best placed to fulfil the role of primary universal service provider in the extended zones. For some reason, the member for Perth thinks it is Telstra's inherent right or duty. The government simply is not convinced it is. Amongst other things, other carriers have made credible claims. What about the other carriers?
—Order! The member for Perth has had his opportunity and will have an opportunity in the future.
—I wonder if the member for Perth would make some claim about the capacity of other carriers in this regard. In any event, the government believes the question of who the primary universal service provider should be in the extended zones should be put to the test, and that is effectively what the extended zones tender will do. In the area covered by the extended zones tender, the existing infrastructure is generally not on a par with the rest of Australia. This is manifested, for example, in the absence of untimed local calls and restricted Internet access. There is a need to upgrade these services and the supporting infrastructure, and the parliament has made $150 million available from the T2 sale to do this.
The issue then becomes to whom the $150 million should be allocated to provide those services and upgrade the infrastructure. The expenditure of such a considerable sum provides a great opportunity to leverage a significant advance in telecommunications service levels for remote Australia. In spending that sum, it is the responsibility of government to achieve the best value for the community. That is the purpose of the tender. In a competitive environment, the government could not simply give the money to Telstra, yet that seems to be what the opposition as a logical extension of their claims are seriously proposing. It is the successful tenderer who will be funded to provide new services that are absent in the country areas and will have the upgraded infrastructure capable of doing it. It follows that this carrier is best positioned to provide services in the extended zones into the future—that is, to be the primary universal service provider. The tender process will be scrupulously fair. Telstra will have exactly the same opportunity as other bidders. For the government, the important issue is determining who the best provider of services to regional and rural Australian is. 
We are not playing policy roulette, as the member for Canning attempted to say by likening the government's approach to the contestability pilots and the tender in the extended zones to a roulette wheel. It is ridiculous to assert that the government will not take a careful and considered approach to the assessment of the pilots before expanding the scheme. It is inherent in the projects being pilots that they will be evaluated and the results considered before any extension is initiated. 
—The bill does not require that. Which provision provides that?
—A comprehensive administrative monitoring and evaluation framework for the pilots is being put in place at this moment, and I am sure the member for Perth would welcome a briefing on this at the appropriate time. With regard to the member for Perth's concern, the government's proposed amendments require the minister to seek the advice of the ACA prior to setting USO subsidies and to provide a public statement of reasons if he diverges from the ACA's advice. That should satisfy the member for Perth if he is at all fair and balanced in this debate. In conclusion, I reiterate that the bills provide for significant enhancement over time of the delivery of the USO while protecting the interests of all consumers of USO services. The opposition's proposed amendment to the motion for the second reading is ill conceived and should be rejected. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Stephen Smith's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—The first part of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 deals with political parties' receipt of the electoral roll and the second part deals with the registration of political parties. The Labor Party are in general terms in agreement with the government over the bill. We agree that there is a need to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act as it applies to political parties' receipt of the electoral roll. The government has assured us that it needs to legislate in this way based upon advice from the Solicitor-General. We are, however, disappointed that the government has not provided this advice to us, and we urge the government again to do so. Nevertheless, we trust that after the Electoral Commission got its fingers burnt releasing the rolls unlawfully to the Australian Taxation Office for John Howard's direct mail letter for his GST campaign, it now has chosen to return to a slightly more prudent management of the electoral rolls.
The first part of this bill is intended to give the Electoral Commission the authority to provide federally registered political parties with the same range of information made available prior to the Howard letter fiasco. We support that intention, but we are concerned about one element of it. Currently, only parties that are organised on the basis of a particular state or territory can get the roll for that area. The bill proposes to allow parties that are organised in five states to get the roll for the sixth state and to provide the roll for all states to parties that have five senators or members. The rolls that parties receive are supplemented with a lot of data that is designed to help local members with constituent and other electoral work. The basis of giving parties the roll for certain states is that the party in question has members, an organisational base and/or some connection to the community in that state. Giving a party the roll for a state where it has no base would undermine the legitimate reason for giving parties the roll. It is no surprise that the party that will benefit from this change is the National Party. The opposition will move in the Senate to delete this outrageous little rort from this part of the bill.
The second part of the bill deals with the registration of political parties. Again, we are broadly supportive of the government's intentions in this matter. The two infamous Davids, David Oldfield and David Ettridge, state in the constitution of their new No GST Party that they want to:
... conduct a low maintenance party devoid of traditional costs associated with administering large memberships and conducting unnecessary meetings of those members.
This is outrageously antidemocratic. They also state:
As a single issue party, it is recognised that the need for intellectual involvement by members is limited as the required intellectual contributions and substance of the party will be sought from appropriately qualified taxation and accounting professionals.
The two antidemocratic Davids may scorn the input of party members and broad debate, but the Commonwealth Electoral Act should reflect the necessity for any political institution to have a democratic basis.
However, we do have some concerns with the government proposals, and I would like to outline the areas in which the opposition will be moving amendments in the Senate. First, unlike the government, we feel that a person who has become a federal parliamentarian should have the right to register one party. However, we agree with the government that state and territory MPs should not be able to register parties at the federal level as of right. Second, we believe that two or more parties should not be able to rely upon the same member for registration purposes. Without this provision, entrepreneurial types such as Messrs Oldfield and Ettridge would be able to relabel a group of 500 members dozens of times to register dozens of political parties. It is not enough to set the base membership level at 500. To the extent that the Electoral Commission can check such things, we need to ensure that those 500 members are in fact genuine. We believe the AEC is more than capable of managing the simple membership checking processes that this would require. We are also confident that it would be able to ensure the privacy of that information. 
Third, we strongly feel that there should be a registration fee for parties. Currently, it costs the AEC—and thereby the taxpayer—at least $8,000 to handle the registration for each and every aspirant political party. The main part of that cost is soaked up in advertising, yet surprisingly there is no charge for parties applying for registration. Ordinary citizens have to pay registration fees for their pets, cars, clubs and many other administrative processes organised by the government, so why shouldn't political parties have to pay such a fee? The opposition believe that aspirant parties should have to pay a one-off fee and it should be set at a level that recovers a fair proportion of the Electoral Commission's cost. We also believe there should be a lower fee for parties who want to change their registered name.
There is a genuine desire on the part of the Labor Party—and I believe in this case the Liberal Party—to clear these matters up. No doubt there will be further robust discussion on how these matters can be resolved, but they will be, because Australians cannot afford to allow our electoral system to be preyed upon by the unscrupulous using glib slogans to harvest votes for preferences and, in this instance, clearly for dollars. This matter needs to be dealt with quickly by the parliament. The Labor Party will continue to work cooperatively with the government and the minor parties to ensure that these reforms to the Commonwealth Electoral Act are fair and equitable.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-10-03,"—The member for Melbourne is 100 per cent correct: the people of Australia cannot allow our electoral system to be preyed upon by the unscrupulous—those who have their glib slogans and those who seek to manipulate the existing processes in order to try and pervert the natural course of democracy. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is all about helping those who are active participants in the democratic process to continue to participate. It is all about accountability. It is all about the importance of the integrity of what is at the heart of the electoral process, and that is the list of voters, the people who are entitled to cast one vote according to their conscience, their judgment and their understanding of the issues in elections.
It is all part of the process in this country that makes us stand out from so many others in the world—a nation where the democratic process celebrates 100 years in just a few months time, on 1 January. This is a process of fair, transparent—in other words, honest—and frequent elections. Changes of government have occurred from time to time because of the honest judgment of the people wishing to cast those votes. It is a process which perhaps a lot of Australians have become blase about, taken a little for granted, but there are nations not too far from ours who do not understand this fair, honest and frequent election process. There are nations that were behind the Iron Curtain in the Eastern bloc of Europe—Ceausescu's Romania and Milosevic's nation as well, the former Yugoslavia—where there are those who, in power, manipulate the system to try to stay in power, to try to prevent people from casting their vote in a fair, honest and open way and, equally, try to prevent their votes being counted in a fair and honest way.
The bill before us is at the heart of the integrity that each of us as a member of parliament must seek to uphold at every juncture. Each of us must know in our heart that we stand here to represent our constituents, following a legitimate election process. Each of us has received, under our preferential system, over 50 per cent of the support of the people in our electorate, and once elected—regardless of those who voted for us or otherwise—we represent everybody in our electorate. I know this would seem very simplistic civics to other members in this chamber, and in a lot of ways it is. The member for Melbourne has outlined the quite dreadful circumstance in which the two Davids of the One Nation fiasco have attempted to try and pervert the natural intention of electoral laws in this country by registering a party with a glib slogan against the goods and services tax simply for the purposes of making money. They banked a lot of money out of One Nation, and we saw the former member for Oxley face the prospect of jail because she too was part of the process. As Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen once said, if you fly with the crows, you tend to get shot with them. We should all be directly alarmed at the development of this no GST party concept. 
That is not what this is about directly, but it does look at the integrity of those who put themselves forward to the voters. One would hope that everybody involved in the political process is serious in their efforts to offer an agenda—an alternate government, an alternate manifesto of possibilities for running the country, the state, the council or whatever level of government is being contested at the time. I welcome the development of cleaning up a couple of anomalies that have existed as a result of the electronic version of the electoral roll. These are in essence process matters, things that have been occurring with other agencies for a long time. Matters that have been occurring with legitimate political parties for a long time were highlighted a few months ago. A political motivation was behind why they were highlighted; nevertheless, they highlighted the fact that there may have needed to be a change to the law to process the legitimate conduct of the political process.
Against this background it is worth noting my concern about what is happening in my state of Queensland. Today is the first day of the Shepherdson inquiry into allegations regarding electoral fraud in the state of Queensland. The inquiry is hearing evidence from a number of people—in particular from Karen Ehrmann, an Australian Labor Party identity and one-time state candidate who has been sentenced to jail for her part in electoral fraud. In her affidavit at sentencing she said that she witnessed people forging electoral forms for the Mundingburra by-election in February 1996. That is a very serious allegation and, quite rightly, an inquiry has been formed under the stewardship of Tom Shepherdson, QC. I am sure that there will be a full and thorough investigation into this whole matter.
But what has happened today I think is worth noting in the parliament, because it involves directly some people in my own electorate and raises in my mind some grave concerns about how the integrity of the electoral roll—and, therefore, the integrity of the processes that have led to each of us being elected—is in fact under great question. It may well be just a Queensland phenomenon, where details about the age of the voter have been known for years, although the matters before us will make it possible for that information to be known right around Australia. Of course, such information is of great advantage to those who seek to try to pervert the natural course of the electoral process.
It is disturbing for me to know that today Ehrmann said in evidence at the Shepherdson inquiry that she had witnessed in the office of Tony Mooney—he is the Labor Mayor of Townsville, and he was then Labor candidate in Mundingburra—a Lee Bermingham and a Craig Wallace, an ex-staffer of one of the state government ministers in Queensland, Merri Rose, forging in pencil electoral claim forms. Ehrmann said that they had wanted her to witness these documents but she refused. It is worth noting that staffers are leaving the Beattie government in Queensland in droves, in part because of their involvement in some of these rorts. That is certainly the allegation, and we are all wondering just how many will be left.
Ehrmann further alleged that Wallace enrolled himself at a Townsville campaign worker's home even though he lived elsewhere, in the south-east corner of Queensland. He joked that because he had crashed at this place once perhaps he was justified. Another person mentioned today in evidence was a Warwick Powell who made a number of jokes about their ability to rort the process. Apparently, this group of three was part of a process of ringing around the state of Queensland looking for people who agreed to have their names put forward as enrolled in Mundingburra for the purpose of the poll. This, it is suggested, was a standard practice for the Labor Party to marshal more votes where and when they needed them.
Suggestions also included that there was an insider in the Electoral Commission who tipped off the ALP when postal votes were despatched and a Keystone Cops type approach was adopted, where they raced around letterboxes to retrieve certain rorted postal vote ballot papers so a bogus vote could be cast. If this was Labor's practice, as is suggested in the evidence today, then it is a matter that should be of grave concern to us. In 1996 the Australian Electoral Commission resisted the use of PO boxes only, without any residential addresses, as a legitimate enrolment. So the Australian Labor Party apparently had to amend their earlier—and far more convenient—practice of rorting postal votes through PO boxes. I guess this explains a lot. The sad part is it perverts the legitimate voters—the people in my electorate, for instance—who legitimately make a judgment based on their own personal values and their own priorities as to how they are going to vote. 
What is particularly sad today is that in the Queensland state parliament the opposition attempted to ask a number of questions of the government about the matter of electoral irregularities and three times they were stopped by the Speaker of that place, who had said that matters canvassed by a CJC inquiry could be sub judice and therefore out of bounds. That is what occurred today. In fact, according to the ABC online report, Speaker Hollis said:
I just warn Opposition members if you're going to continue to try to run the inquiry in this place I will then warn you, I will then warn you.
Opposition leader Borbidge said that that did not happen during the CJC inquiry into the coalition's memorandum of understanding into the police union. I think Rob Borbidge is right to point out the double standards being displayed by the Queensland government and their parliament. Rob Borbidge, of course, was Premier in a previous government, and his government was subjected to questions from the current Premier, Mr Beattie, but Mr Beattie will not open himself up to the same sort of scrutiny in the Queensland parliament—and it is pretty obvious to me why: because they have a lot to hide. It is quite sad to think that Speaker Hollis should in fact put several opposition MPs on notice that they will be sin-binned if they keep asking questions. I would remind the Speaker of the Queensland parliament, again in a basic civics lesson, that when members of parliament ask questions in parliament they are doing so on behalf of the people. Parliament is the meeting place for the people. It is the place where there are opportunities for the people to be heard and to be able to question the executive, and perverting the role of parliament in this process makes this a very sad day indeed for Queensland.
As I said earlier, a number of these personalities are constituents of mine: Mr Lee Bermingham and Mr Warwick Powell. It is alleged on the first day of the Shepherdson inquiry that they were two key figures in the ongoing rorting of voting by the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, and that means that in my own electorate I have reason to have some great concerns about what has been occurring. So I decided to check on my electronic roll the enrolment of both Mr Bermingham and Mr Powell. Mr Bermingham lives at Annerley with three other people of various ages in the one house, so there are four people enrolled there. Mr Powell also lives at Annerley and also has three other people living with him, and only one other person has the same surname as him. So there is an interesting possibility that they might in fact be very much practising their broad style in my own electorate at their own addresses.
A look around the suburb of Annerley is in itself very interesting, because there are many places there which are small homes and units and it is surprising how many units seem to have four and five people living in what basically are one- and two-bedroom flats. I think the record goes to one house where there are nine people of different names all living in the one house. I look forward to the process that is being undertaken in the Shepherdson inquiry, and I also look forward to the Australian Electoral Commission getting serious about playing an even more outstanding role in assisting in making sure that the roll—in my electorate in particular—is without any doubt fully above board.
Why is it that the Australian Labor Party in Queensland will not allow questions to be asked of them in the parliament? Why is it that one vote, one value does not exist in the minds of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland? Why is it that media junkie, the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie says it is his great shame that his party is being subjected to this sort of nonsense and that he is having to account for these sorts of matters? It is simply not good enough; it is not good enough for the tens of thousands of people in my electorate who do the right thing—who make a judgment and vote once. It is not good enough that the Australian Labor Party think, in some sort of born-to-rule approach, they can rort the rules to try and pervert the natural course of the electoral process. It is undemocratic in the extreme. It is the sort of thing we saw behind the Iron Curtain and in nations struggling to come to terms with democracy, and it is being practised here in Queensland. It is an absolute outrage in the extreme. 
I think back to half a dozen years ago when I travelled to Ohio in the United States of America—years before I was a member of parliament. I witnessed the primary election taking place in that state in May 1994. I understood their electoral process to be far above the sort of standard we have in this country. In the land of the free and the home of the brave they are not afraid of asking those who participate in the electoral process—the voters—to sign for a ballot paper. In fact in the state of Ohio the original card filled in by a voter is taken to the polling booth nominated by that voter as being the place where they are going to vote. That form is then shown to the voter, and another form is signed in the presence of an electoral worker and the signatures compared to prove that the person who applied for the vote and the person who claimed the vote are the same person before the vote is cast.
So there are systems involving greater demand on identification and of greater integrity as far as the roll is concerned in existence around the world. I would be optimistic that out of the mess being exposed by the Shepherdson inquiry—and I am sure there is much more to come—we will see a reform to our electoral process here. I am sure that honest Australians will not be afraid of having to go through the process of proving who they are before they claim their vote. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I both know that on voting day, when we walk up and talk to the polling booth worker and they say, `Have you voted anywhere else today,' that is the only check before a line is ruled through a name on a piece of paper. That is why the electoral roll in an electronic form perhaps holds part of the key to what is to come.
We need to ensure that when the vote is cast and put in the ballot box the person legitimately seeking that vote claims that vote. We also need to make sure that circumstances such as those I have outlined in my electorate, where three or four people in one- and two-bedroom flats and nine people in one house are enrolled to vote, are fully investigated by the Electoral Commission. What concerns me currently in terms of the Electoral Commission's process is that they write a letter to each of those people to verify that they actually exist—that they are there. All that we heard in the Shepherdson inquiry today suggests that the Labor Party may have an insider in the Electoral Commission, or at the very least are very wise in knowing exactly who has been enrolled in what particular place, and that they have somebody to grab any correspondence from the Electoral Commission. So any letter that the AEC or the Queensland Electoral Commission sends off to anybody is going to be intercepted by those involved in the rort anyway.
I think the matter before us tonight is at the heart of our democracy. It is at the heart of our integrity as a nation. I think the facts that are coming out in the Shepherdson inquiry should be a matter of great shame to all Australians, especially against the background of the Olympics where the cheats were sent home. Why isn't Mr Beattie acting and dealing with people in his own government in the same way that the Olympic Committee acted with regard to cheats in the Olympics? The cheats in the Australian Labor Party are going to be exposed by the Shepherdson inquiry, and I cannot wait for the day that occurs. The tens of thousands of honest voters in my electorate and millions across Australia deserve that day of reckoning.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—We have just heard a speech which compares individual developments in Queensland with the so-called electoral system in the former Soviet Union. I think such exaggerations disparage serious charges that individuals are facing in Queensland. Those issues ought to be addressed on their merits and not with gross exaggerations which diminish both issues. 
The government's amendments on this bill and Labor's proposals for the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 are broadly in agreement. I particularly want to deal with the second part of the government's amendments designed to deal with the prospect of multiple front-parties, the No GST Party and No Nuclear Waste Party, floated by the dodgy Davids: David Ettridge and the New South Wales Upper House MP David Oldfield. As the Sydney Morning Herald editorialised recently:
... the new Ettridge-Oldfield parties are artificial, unrepresentative front organisations which, if registered, would be used to siphon preferences from single-issue voters back to One Nation or—in the light of current brawling within the Pauline Hanson party—to each other or elsewhere. This might be undesirable but it certainly is not unprecedented in Australia's preferential voting system. A more serious concern is that a few unscrupulous individuals could make a lot of money by manipulating the system. Apart from the cost to the taxpayer of registering a party (at least $8,000), registered political parties that win more than 4 per cent of the primary vote in a Federal election are eligible for $1.62 in public funding for every vote.
`To each other or elsewhere' and $1.62 per vote are issues that I wish to return to.
We know that One Nation, or a company that Hanson, Ettridge and Oldfield constructed, received $3,061,502 of public money at the last federal election as the result of the 1998 election and the $1.62 per vote formulation. This is the same political party which was found to have fraudulently received Queensland taxpayers' money, did not have the 500 members which the party claimed to have and for which Ms Hanson has been forced to pay back over half a million dollars to the Queensland Electoral Commission.
—She hasn't paid it back yet, has she?
—That is the point. This has not been the end of that matter. Following further recent fratricide in One Nation, it was revealed that Ms Hanson has failed to pass on more than $200,000 in donations to repay the Queensland Electoral Commission for electoral expenses after the Queensland Supreme Court found One Nation's registration had been fraudulently induced. Ms Hanson said the fund had received $430,000 in donations and that, after handing over $250,000 of the $502,000 debt to the commission last month, plus $3,500 for its legal expenses, there was $125,000 remaining in the fund. Ms Hanson did not explain what happened to the balance of $51,500. Having raised public money from donations for such purposes, it is even more appalling that they have not, apparently, been passed on to the Electoral Commission for the purpose for which they were intended. Labor has suggested some amendments to the second part of this bill, similar to those made in New South Wales last year, which would increase the number of members needed for registration on a sliding scale by state or territory—in New South Wales it would rise from 500 to 1,000; prevent two or more parties relying on the same MP for registration; allow only federal MPs or senators to sponsor party representation; charge a fee for registration; and force existing parties to comply with membership thresholds and pay registration.
In the wake of the recent applications from the former One Nation David duo to register the No GST Party and the No Nuclear Waste Party, the opposition has urged the government to close the loophole regarding registration of new political parties which the government has aptly labelled `phantom' parties. The application for both these phantom parties relies on David Oldfield's membership of the New South Wales upper house. The opposition believes that this is a blatant attempt to manipulate the electoral system. It is unacceptable and the loophole which allows such applications must be closed. The government has moved an amendment which would require all new political parties to have at least 500 members regardless of parliamentary representation. Senator Ellison said:
Genuine political parties will have no problems in complying with these registration requirements, which will protect and strengthen the integrity of the electoral system.
While the government's amendments are a step in the right direction, the opposition still has concerns. I would like to explain the basis for some of our amendments a little further. As the member for Melbourne has already said, the opposition believes that, while a federal member of parliament should have the right to register a political party, it is not appropriate that state or territory members of parliament have the right to register parties at the federal level. The opposition also believes that the same member of parliament should not be able to register two or more parties. Even with the government's amendment, which would require a new party to provide a list of 500 members, it would not be hard for opportunists to re-present the same list of members under a different party name. Therefore, there also needs to be some safeguard which will ensure that the same names are not used to register more than one party; in other words, some sort of safeguard that will ensure that the members used to register a new political party are genuine, while at the same time safeguarding the privacy of individuals. The opposition also believes that new parties should be required to pay a registration fee—and why shouldn't they? As Senator Ellison has stated, the estimated cost to the taxpayer of registering a new political party is from $8,000 to $10,000. Ordinary citizens have to pay annual registration for their cars, cats, dogs, et cetera, yet there is no charge for those applying to register a new political party. Surely it is not unreasonable that aspirant political parties should be required to pay a one-off fee that would enable the AEC—in other words, the taxpayer—to recover a fair amount of the cost that goes into advertising these new applications. We also believe that there should be a lower one-off fee for parties which apply to have their name changed. It should be pointed out that the amendments are designed to prevent entrepreneurs in the electoral system that I have described abusing that system. 
In the eyes of both the opposition and the government, the applications of the David duo are perfect examples of what can only be described as opportunistic abuse of the system. New South Wales upper house MP David Oldfield, elected on the One Nation ticket, and David Ettridge, the other architect of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, have, as I explained, sought to register two new parties. Ettridge is listed as the secretary and sole member of each party. Official documents to the AEC include a party constitution that lists as its main aim:
To conduct a low maintenance political party devoid of the traditional costs associated with administering large memberships and conducting unnecessary meetings of those members.
A somewhat undemocratic approach, I would have thought. In his letter to the AEC, Mr Ettridge is quite frank about what he would like to do with the two parties officially recognised:
The party wishes to receive electoral funding.
That is, the $1.62 per head public funding for every vote that a registered political party receives if it obtains more than four per cent of the primary vote. It all sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it? A rejection of democratic control with funds and policies controlled from the centre: that was how the two Davids and Pauline ran One Nation, wasn't it? And it is not only One Nation's deregistration because of fraud that forced it to take its membership seriously; those members are now voluntarily paying the $500,000 of Queensland taxpayers' money that One Nation improperly obtained after the last state election. As I suggested earlier, those members should be asking why only $250,000 of the $470,000 that has been raised has been paid back to the commission. Perhaps the most important issue, in my view, is to look at it from the point of view of the motivations of the two Davids in this: is it really politics or is there something else to it?
I think in that area it is instructive to look at Mr Ettridge's past record. I am particularly indebted to an article called `Bad Company' that appeared in the Australia/Israel Review and from which I wish to quote extensively. This article suggests that, for several years, David Ettridge had an intimate involvement with a secret offshore company in Vanuatu with substantial sums of money paid into it from earnings of Mr Ettridge in Australia. The article says:
At the headquarters of the Vanuatu Financial Service Commission we learned that in September 1993 a company had been registered as Global Communications Limited with its head office in Freshwater, Port Vila. 
The company was established as an International Company under Vanuatu's complex web of company provisions, which make the tiny island state one of the most impenetrable tax havens in the world. Global Communications is exempt from stamp duty and has few government fees. It was registered in several hours, according to the staff at the Financial Services Commission. Julian Ala, Commissioner of the FSC, confirmed to the Review that the company is not required by the Government of Vanuatu to “pay income tax, capital gains tax, withholding tax or state duty”. Nor are there any exchange duties, foreign currency regulations or reporting requirements attached to it. Ala also confirmed ... that the company is guaranteed strict secrecy by Vanuatu legislation (Ala stated that under Vanuatu law, if he revealed further details of the company to us he could face a lengthy prison sentence) and requires only ... the payment of an annual registration fee of $450.
The article goes on: 
... in 1993 at the request of Ettridge, Ross Borland established Global Communications for Ettridge's use in Vanuatu. Borland ... was the local agent in Vanuatu for the company and his house in Freshwater was the registered head office. He also explained that he established the company at the request of David Ettridge.  
“I don't know why he wanted me to set up the company for him,” Ross said. “I supposed at the time that it was related to his World Vision work. I think that he gathered money from his World Vision work and it went through Global Communications here in Vanuatu.  
“The company was for David's purposes. I was just the agent, we never financially benefited from it ... The beneficiary of the company was David,” said Ross, who also said that substantial sums had gone through Global Communications. 
Ettridge denies this, claiming that he was only paid by Global Communications which is not his company. 
...		...		...
World Vision was contacted, where Ettridge had formerly worked as a consultant to help understand Borland's claims. 
Ian Curtis, head of government and corporate relations, said that Ettridge had been “engaged by World Vision as a consultant assigned to specific fundraising work on World Vision's behalf”.  
...		...		...
... Ettridge had a consultancy arrangement with World Vision, which saw him paid a commission of 12.5% on the funds raised from the supermarket promotion scheme. During the period that World Vision operated the program some $1.2 million was raised from the venture with approximately $150,000 paid by World Vision to Ettridge in commissions. 
John Winkett, Corporate Partnership Manager with World Vision, confirmed that David Ettridge had acted as a consultant intermittently “for approximately three years, until April this year [1997]. I think he had other forms of employment and income as well”. Winkett said that the fees paid to Ettridge by World Vision were consultancy fees, and were “paid to his company Global Communications, in Vanuatu. ...
Winkett also confirmed that the cheques for the consultancy fees were made out to Global Communications and that, in accordance with usual practice for consultants, the amount billed by Ettridge for his work was paid in full—no tax was taken out by World Vision. 
According to David Grechian of the International Tax Division of the Australian Tax Office, “Vanuatu is colloquially known as a tax haven along with other countries like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or the Bahamas”. 
He said that Ettridge's business activities appear abusive and the tax office does not take kindly to it, adding that the ATO would be very concerned about the circumstances surrounding Ettridge's Global Communications company. 
It is my contention that the registering of these two political parties has little to do with politics. In the 1960s, Mel Brooks produced a great film called The Producers. In the film The Producers, the star Zero Mostel, the shonky Broadway producer, came across an ingenious scheme together with his accountant who was played by Gene Wilder, another well-known Hollywood actor. The two of them concocted a scheme where they would sell several thousand per cent of a play which had to bomb when it was shown on Broadway. They sold several thousand per cent to elderly people, to people who were vulnerable, and they hoped that the play would bomb on the first night. They therefore had to pick out the worst play that they could possibly find, the play would close immediately, and they would rake in all of the profits from that failed play.
It is my contention that the David duo is like the cast of The Producers and the registration of these two political parties is a crooked scheme to take Australian taxpayers' money and use it principally for the purposes of the two Davids. We have seen the enormous row that has grown up within One Nation as a result of the registration of these two political parties. It is quite possible that preferences might not even be delivered to One Nation. They might be delivered from one party to the other for the purposes of getting them ahead of the four per cent margin in order for those two political parties to receive the $1.62 per vote that they would then be entitled to.  
Australian taxpayers remember a similar kind of shonky operation where the members of the so-called One Nation Party had no access or right to access the $3 million of this very bizarre company set up by Ettridge, Oldfield and Hanson. They were able to do that at the last federal election in 1998, and this latest scheme, in my view, is simply an extrapolation of that idea. Having fallen out with Pauline Hanson, the two Davids want to construct another scheme where they are able to farm Australian taxpayers' money via this registration of political parties. 
It is to the credit of this House that members on both sides have moved speedily on this matter. The advice from the Australian Electoral Commission is appreciated to prevent Australian taxpayers' money being stolen by people who have fraudulently used the names of political parties, seen loopholes in the electoral legislation and sought to take Australian taxpayers' money for their own ends. I commend Labor's amendments. I hope that the amendment moved by the government in the second part of this legislation is enough to deal with these two political parties. 
I thought it was important to read into the public record at least one of the lesser known activities of one of the major constructors of this scheme to farm Australian taxpayers' money. And I think that that more than anything, more than politics, is behind this sudden registration of the No GST Party and the No Nuclear Waste Party. These are attempts to use two popular causes for cynical ends by people who are seeking to benefit privately from public money.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2000-10-03,"—I also rise tonight to speak to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. Maintaining the integrity of our electoral system is vital if we are to retain public confidence in our electoral system and our democracy. Fortunately, the guidelines surrounding Australia's electoral roll are stringent and historically have provided a fair election as well as privacy for our citizens. We only need to look at the recent elections in the Balkans, and many other countries, to highlight the necessity for strict electoral processes. 
The amendments in this bill alter the 1918 Commonwealth Electoral Act so that members, senators and federally registered parties may access a wider range of information from the electoral roll. Most importantly, the amendments allow for the provision of age range extracts from the electoral roll for use in certain approved medical research and public health screening programs. As a member of the health committee, I am highly aware of the importance of such national campaigns to help fight health concerns such as diabetes, cancer and many other health programs. If the amendments before us today help to alert Australians to the importance of screenings and other preventative measures, then they are highly significant and they should be supported by all of my colleagues. Preventative measures such as screening have proven to be effective in identifying illnesses and allowing intervention at a very early stage. 
Whilst the Australian Electoral Commission has been providing information for this use since 1993, it is only recent legal advice that has shown that the Australian Electoral Commission requires specific authority to provide age range information for those medical purposes. Tonight the amendments will facilitate the provision of a minimum age range covering two years and allowing the Australian Electoral Commission to continue providing information for medical screening programs. This information will also be used to assist with immunisation campaigns by helping to ascertain determining factors and other information. 
I would also like to make the point that researchers must be approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council as well as their ethics committees, and public health facilities must also be approved by the department. But these amendments allow for members, senators and federally registered parties to have access to a wide range of information from the roll including name, address, date of birth, gender, title, enrolment status and electorate. This information has been freely available in Queensland for some years but not so in other states. In the case of members, this information will be available for their own electorates while senators will have access to the states they represent, and federally registered parties with more than five representatives or who are organised in more than five states or territories may also have access to this wide range of information. 
Further amendments contained in this bill will limit the registration of a political party so that an eligible party must have 500 members. As we have heard from previous members tonight, particularly in the case of the No GST Party and the No Nuclear Waste Party, this is clearly an advantage in ensuring that there is absolute integrity. I have seen petitions being gathered over a number of months for the No GST Party and am quite amazed at where the names and addresses of people who are registered end up. I am sure that it is mailing list fodder somewhere but those people need to be protected and we need to ensure that those parties are formed with the highest integrity. It was very interesting to hear the member for Melbourne speak earlier about the activities of David Ettridge, particularly with regard to offshore companies in Vanuatu. I found it quite fascinating.
—Nefarious activities.
—Various activities—he certainly was involved in a wide range of consultancy before he entered the political arena. Having said that, there must be integrity, particularly in the formation of parties. People need to know that they are joining a registered and reputable political party with kudos, that is run democratically and that is not some front for some shoddy organisation that is only interested in gathering funds and using those funds in a non-political manner or that is run as a business. Clearly that needs to be remedied and the controls tightened. The particular system of electoral rolls and fraudulent activity is not something new. I remember travelling around the polling booths, as we all do on election day, when I first was elected in 1996 and seeing several people that I had come across at various booths showing up again to cast yet another vote. When I confronted one of these individuals he feigned mental insanity.
—Voting early and often.
—As the member for Fisher states, it does occur quite regularly. The previous member also spoke about the fact that the electoral roll showed a considerable number of people living in one house or in a small unit in his electorate. I think we need to ensure that the Electoral Commission is able to obtain the correct information and is able to check on the integrity of the roll. 
Previously, parties could be registered on a parliamentary party basis. I think everyone would reasonably agree that a party should be able to demonstrate a following of at least 500 members. For a period of six months parties already registered in this way will have an opportunity to meet the new criteria. As I have mentioned previously, integrity and careful monitoring of the electoral roll are essential in a strong democracy. One vote should be just that: it should count for one vote. I know in recent months, specifically in Queensland, that the integrity of the Commonwealth roll is currently being examined. A previous member spoke about the inquiry, referring to the Australian context in Queensland and to the proceedings today and particularly to the Shepherdson inquiry. The inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll is very important. It is important to be able to detect fraudulent enrolment as well as incidents of fraudulent enrolment and there is a need for legislative reform. In my home state, the Criminal Justice Commission is also examining specific issues relating to integrity of the roll. I know that we look forward eagerly to the results of this particular inquiry.
—Did you see the AAP today? It was amazing.
—I am sure they will be very illuminating, as the member for Fisher again interjects. This is a very important inquiry. The outcome will be eagerly awaited and I know that— 
—We should have one in Toowong as well. 
 (Mr Nehl)—The member for Bowman will cease interjecting.
—The member for Bowman interjects about another electorate, but I think there is much to discover in Queensland at the moment. The cornerstone of a stable democracy is a fair and honest electoral system. I commend to the House the amendments that are before us today.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—I am very pleased to be speaking on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 tonight because I think it is an important and significant bill for every federal member of this parliament and also for state members and local councillors. It is important because there is no more important interaction for any elected member of parliament than those interactions with their constituents. The fundamental basis of that interaction for any elected member is access to the electoral roll. Without an electoral roll that is full and complete and has up-to-date information and a wide range of information of increasing depth and broad range, it is very difficult for a member to adequately service his constituents and provide the kind of assistance they need in a quick and speedy way. It is also difficult for them to fully comprehend the nature of the electorate that they serve.
I have been at this game now officially since 2 January 1985 in my former employ with the former member for Blaxland running his electorate office until I was elected on 15 June 1996 as the member for Blaxland. Throughout that time, I have seen a progression in the information provided by the Australian Electoral Commission to members' offices. I have seen the benefit of having an electronic roll directly available to members. In fact, in years gone by, we did not have an electronic roll, and when they finally provided it to us, the updates month by month were provided, as you would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, on great reams of computer paper. I well remember one particular time when I was organising a mail-out to new electors. I had to manually take 4,000 people off the electronic roll that we had and then manually enter 6,000 new electors—their full name, their full address, individually for each one of those. It is no surprise that I ended up with RSI because of that and the other series of updates that happened. It was therefore a great joy to me when the AEC moved forward technologically to give us updates on floppy disks. It was an even greater step when the AEC moved forward to providing the information on CD because when they did so the full electronic version available to members gave us quick and easy access to our whole electorate in a format that was concise and easy to use. 
That step was important not only for members and their staff but for the constituents themselves, and I will give a practical example of that. Every member has an approach from members of the public like this. They have a problem. They do not know who to go to see. They are not sure whether it is a council, state or federal issue. They approach a member's office, and it is important quickly for that member to say that it is a council problem, a state problem or a federal problem and, if it is a council or state problem, to direct them to their ward alderman at council level or to their state member of parliament. One of the things that this bill seeks to redress in version 46 of the information system alliance is the current lack of information about what state district or council ward an elector is in. If you know the electorate well enough and you can look at the map and say, `You're in the North Ward' or, `You're in the seat of the member for East Hills' or `You're in the seat of the member for Auburn,' that is okay, but it is sometimes important to go straight into the database so you can be absolutely specific when people are on the borders and so on and you can direct those people to where they can get ready help. 
Currently, no federal member of parliament has that information available to them. Why is that the case and why do we have this Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 before us today? It arose from the situation of the Prime Minister wanting to send a personalised letter with GST information out to all households. The Australian Taxation Office bought a copy of the Commonwealth electoral roll with name, address and gender information organised by family grouping. They then proceeded to organise the Prime Minister's letter and were about to mail that out to eight million families in Australia. However, legal advice came through from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General that the past practice, particularly since 1993, that the Australian Electoral Commission had relied upon—where section 83, I think, of the act said that what was available to federal members and also other Commonwealth bodies was the first name, the second name, the gender of the person on the roll as well as other prescribed information—was questionable. The Solicitor-General advised in fact that they were not capable of doing it because the act was not specific enough—that is, it was not written down what specific information could be provided. It is one of those cases where the Electoral Commission had provided information to members and to other Commonwealth bodies with the best will in the world and in good faith, but there came a point in time where what seemed to be right was in fact brought into great question. So this bill has generated out of that change in perspective because of the different legal opinion that was given. 
These amendments to the act go to restore the past practice, and it is only very recent past practice for federal parliamentarians because not that long ago all that we had were name and address, and gender and a title if you were lucky. In Queensland for many decades, there was age information on the roll, but I think from about 1984 that was proscribed at the federal level. From 1993 on, that started to become a possibility, and in fact only very recently—I think in about update 43 or 44—were we able to get age specific information.
Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I think it is enormously important that not only do we have a sound, full and complete roll but also people understand that the electoral roll is a very dynamic document, as you would understand from your experience in your electorate, and certainly as I understand from my experience in the electorate of Blaxland. Between one election and the next—and this is almost impossible for people to believe—there can be a change of almost one-third of the electorate. In a relatively stable society, why is that so? One of the reasons that it happens is that people move within the electorate. They move from one suburb to another. For example, in the electorate of Blaxland they may move from Punchbowl to Georges Hall. Or people may move from an outside electorate into the electorate of Blaxland. It also happens that new people come onto the roll because they come of age at 18—they are pre-enrolled at 17. And people get married, and therefore change their names, and that is an amendment to the roll. Currently, without these changes in this bill, that information is not provided to me, and it is not provided to other members. I think in order to do my job properly, and in order for other members to do their jobs properly, we actually need that information.
I will go specifically to some of the other pieces that I think are very important; the lack of them actually impedes federal members in trying to service their electorates properly. Date of birth information is very important. Every federal member will know, except for Queenslanders who had this information before them, that, if you really want to assist people of pensionable age within your electorate, no matter how good your relationships are with pensioner groups, no matter how forthcoming they may be in telling you who their members are—and it is always a bit difficult to get membership lists and so on—it is important to identify those people and then to attempt to assist them by providing information, for instance about the Commonwealth programs in relation to the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals. It has been an increasing  problem for many years that aged people have vast cupboards full of old medications. There is not enough appropriate advice from doctors or from nursing people. In a society swamped with information, there is not enough targeted advice. The age information assists a member to draw to the attention of aged people in the community issues such as that and to direct them to pensioner groups or appropriate information services provided by Commonwealth departments or local doctors to enable them to manage their own health care more appropriately. It is not something that might readily spring to minds of others, but to federal members it is important to be able to provide specific information to people who will be most helped by it. 
One of the other elements that are involved here—the census district—has been available to Australia Post. It has been available of course to the Commonwealth Statistician, and its availability to federal members is of great significance, because you can break the electorate down to the census district level. You can use corollary information from the actual census itself to better understand the framework and the make-up of your own electorate, and therefore understand more deeply those people—their financial backgrounds, their ethnicity, languages used at home, the number of single-parent families or the simple spread of age ranges within the community. It is only when you have a full range of information that you can get a better picture of just what you are dealing with, and you can then therefore better represent your community, rather than simply relying upon what other people tell you about what is happening within it. So that is a vital piece of information that is currently not there. On both sides of this parliament there is general agreement that this information is important and useful not only to members but also for members to be able to serve their constituents better.
One of the other details refers to general postal voters. Every member of parliament, particularly those who have a high proportion of aged people in their community, knows and understands that at election time the electoral process can be traumatic for people who are aged and infirm. If they are not preregistered and they are not on a general postal voter list, it can be very difficult for them. They can struggle to get to the election booth on the day, or they can attempt to go through the postal voting process from the beginning, which can be very difficult for people struggling to manage their affairs as readily as they used to be able to. The provision of general postal voter information does two things: it alerts members to those people who have already signed up to that service from the Australian Electoral Commission, and, importantly, it says that those 300 or 500 people are adequately catered for. But there are more people in the community that the member can speak to—in retirement homes and nursing homes and, more broadly, through the organisations in a community— to inform them that, under the specific provisions allowed for in the act, if they are infirm, disabled or have impossible difficulties in getting to booths to exercise their right to vote, they are able to sign up as general postal voters. It is important to know who has applied for a postal vote and to explain the advantages of a postal vote to those who are eligible; it can save them a great deal of angst.
The next couple of measures actually deal with a person enrolling for the first time or a person's previous enrolment details. They are very important in terms of people moving within an electorate or moving into or out of an electorate, because electorates are dynamic. The roll is a dynamic entity; electorates are dynamic entities; you cannot just take a shot in time. And that is what we had prior to the provision of the roll electronically. We had one roll at election time. If you were lucky in those days you would get a roll per electoral booth. So, at the general election in 1983, we had 29 of those, but that was it. We did not have information that was full or up to date, apart from that.
Being in a situation now where we are provided with a full electronic roll, where there is a full amount of information available to us and it is specific, we can direct people to their ward alderman to help them to sort out their problems at local council level and we can direct them to their member of parliament. In my seat of Blaxland I have five state electorates. It is important that people go to the correct state member of parliament to deal with state matters. We have before us a set of specific proposals to amend the act—to make it what we thought it was before the Prime Minister attempted to send out a letter through the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Electoral Commission thought that all of this information could be rightfully and properly provided to members of parliament for the service of their electors, but that was not the case. The point and purpose of this legislation, under item 5 in the explanatory memorandum, is to give these basic building blocks back to members legally so that they can fully carry out their functions as members, so they can understand their electorates better and represent them as well as they can. 
I commend the bill to the House. As a federal member of parliament, I think it is significant legislation. I know, from long experience, how important it is to fully understand the fabric and nature of one's electorate and to fully understand how dynamic the roll and the electorate are. I know how important it is to stay up to date with the changing fabric of the electorate. To do this, it is important that the major political parties in Australia, based across the Commonwealth and with a long tradition of serving their constituents, are not hampered by the one issue parties that members have spoken about. By becoming registered as political parties they gain access to all of that deep information that is available on the electoral roll and they can misuse it. Every member of a registered political party has a great and full responsibility to use this roll properly and within the guidelines that have been provided by the AEC. Where that is traduced it needs to be stomped on extremely hard.
There has been a great proliferation of small issue parties. There are about 70 all up at the moment. It is expected that if the Labor amendments are accepted the number will probably be chopped in half. If the government chooses to accept Labor's amendments, we would not have a political situation where organisations without any real basis or following and with very small numbers, or trumped up numbers, can get a guernsey. I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration to the fact that what Labor's scheme runs to in terms of its amendments is a sliding scale based on a determination of how many people there are in a territory or state. For instance, in the ACT and Tasmania, we are looking at a smaller number of people being involved in a registered political party, whereas for New South Wales the number will be much greater. I point out to the minister and the parliamentary secretary that we propose that there should be 100 members when there are 200,000 or fewer enrolled voters.
—Those amendments have not been circulated.
—I understood that they had. I apologise, Parliamentary Secretary. As I understand it, we are foreshadowing the amendments in this place and are seeking to move them in the Senate—so you will have some foreknowledge of them. We suggest there should be 250 members in a state or territory when there are between 200,000 and 500,000 enrolled voters—such as in the ACT and Tasmania—and we propose that 1,000 members should be in a registered political party when the state has more than 500,000 voters. There will be a sliding scale relating to the number of electors and a sliding scale relating to the coverage of political parties. It is our contention that, properly considered, this will help to safeguard the democratic political process in this country. This measure, combined with the measures that both sides of the parliament support—to put back in place what the Australian Electoral Commission and parliamentarians thought was prescribed within the bill—will allow ongoing political parties with a real representative force and their members to represent their electorates as best as they can and to maintain the dynamism within electorates and within the roll.
Debate (on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly) adjourned.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2000-10-03,"—Tonight I wish to raise an issue concerning the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the closing of bank branches in my electorate. Two weeks ago I was advised by the Commonwealth Bank that they were closing the Bexley North branch in my electorate. They sent two men around to see me to tell me how sorry they were to see this happen, but business was business—so they said. This was just one of a number of Commonwealth Bank branches that they have closed in my electorate in recent times. Indeed, there was some trouble last year when they closed the Penshurst branch. No doubt there will be other branches that they will close. They have closed a number of branches in suburbs surrounding my electorate. As they are in the electorate of my colleague the member for Grayndler, I probably should not mention them. There are at least two or three branches there that they have closed. When you consider, Mr Speaker, that the Commonwealth Bank's slogan is `Making it easy for you,' they certainly do not seem to be doing too much to make things easier for people who were their customers. 
—You privatised them.
—It just goes to show, doesn't it, that you should never trust the private sector. That is your problem, my friend, when you decide to privatise Telstra. Very dumb idea. Take heed of what has happened to the Commonwealth Bank, because that is what happens when you privatise government operations. 
The Commonwealth Bank says it is making it easier for you. One of my constituents who was one of their customers came in to see me last week—an old lady called Mary Hill. Mary Hill lives at 12 Fowler Avenue, Bexley North. She is at the tender age of 94 years. She has been a Commonwealth Bank customer for probably 85 years. She first got her Commonwealth Bank membership at Lithgow when she was a very young girl. She has been a faithful Commonwealth Bank customer all that time. What they have told her now is that, if she wants to access her accounts in the normal way, she can go down to the Kingsgrove branch. They tell her that Kingsgrove is only 1.3 kilometres from where she lives. But the trouble Mary Hill has is that, being 94 years of age, even though she is very spritely and very active, stairs seem to be a bit of a problem. The railway stations at Bexley North and Kingsgrove have very, very long flights of steps. One might say she could drive. She does not drive, and at 94 years of age that is probably sensible. She could probably walk, because she is a very fit lady, but to walk a kilometre there and a kilometre back would probably be a bit much to ask as well.
As far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, Mary Hill is probably just another one of those long-suffering customers who unfortunately has got in the way of business. But to me, Mary Hill is the human face of what happens when banks like the Commonwealth Bank decide that for their own bottom line purposes they are going to willy-nilly close branches. They were kind enough to send me a map that showed me that there were seven branches of the Commonwealth Bank in my electorate. But there used to be nine. I suppose in a few years time there will be five, and then there will be three, and then, if you decide to use one of these phone banks or the ATM, you will be lucky. But, as Mary Hill said to me, at 94 she thinks queuing up at an ATM where someone might mug her is just a bit much for the Commonwealth Bank to ask.
I think that Mary Hill and all those other people who have been disadvantaged by the Commonwealth Bank ought to look at the campaign that is being run by the financial sector union to take a message to the Commonwealth Bank at their next AGM so that the Commonwealth Bank gets to understand that it is not just the shareholders but also the customers who are important in an organisation like this. I would have thought a customer like Mary Hill, 94 years of age, who has had a Commonwealth Bank account for about 85 years, is a customer you should take into account and listen to. If you want to make life easier for Mary Hill, you leave the Bexley North branch of the Commonwealth Bank alone.
