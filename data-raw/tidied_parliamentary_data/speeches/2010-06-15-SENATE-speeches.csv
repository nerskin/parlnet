"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-15,"—As the opposition well knows, there were a range of recommendations in the Henry review, and the Treasurer has outlined the government’s response on some of those and has made clear that some of those recommendations are matters which need to be considered more broadly and over a period of time by the nation. The fact is that the RSPT that the government is proposing is tax reform that is about strengthening the Australian economy. It is about building Australia’s prosperity, something those opposite may have forgotten about. But we on this side understand the importance of ensuring a stronger economy that delivers for Australian working families. I would remind those opposite that this tax reform does a range of things which they may like to gloss over, including reducing taxation rates for small business, reducing red tape for small business and cutting tax for other sectors of the economy through reductions in the corporate tax rate. I would have thought there was—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The minister is more than halfway through her answer. She was asked specifically why a particular recommendation was rejected. She has not gone anywhere near the question that was asked of her. No part of her answer is directly relevant to the question. You should bring her to the question.
—I draw the minister’s attention to the question. There are 53 seconds remaining to address the question.
—The opposition are asking about the RSPT. That is the nature of the question. That is the tax reform that they are responding to. I can understand why the opposition are embarrassed about being reminded of their opposition to a reduction in the company tax rate and their opposition to increased superannuation for working Australians. We know that side have always had an issue with the fact that superannuation reforms put in place by Labor governments ensured that working Australians for the first time could share in the retirement savings which had previously been the preserve of wealthy Australians. This is a tax reform that is about a stronger economy and a fairer share for working Australians. We have also made clear in relation to the detail of the superprofits tax— (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-15,"—The government has released a range of figures in relation to the impact of the tax. The reality is those figures are a far cry from the sorts of exaggerated claims championed by those opposite. In fact the government has released figures by Econtech which demonstrate that the introduction of this tax reform will increase long-run GDP by 0.7 per cent, increase long-run investment by 2.1 per cent, increase real wages by 1.1 per cent and expand the resources sector.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Once again, more than halfway through the answer the minister has not come close to the question. She was asked whether one particular matter was considered and she was asked what the figure was across the forward estimates. She has addressed neither of those things. No part of her answer is directly relevant to the question asked.
—Mr President, on the point of order: the minister has been responding directly to the question. The minister was asked about—
—She was asked for a figure.
—Excuse me! The minister was asked about the resource super profits tax and its effect. The minister has been responding to that in the answer that she has provided, and she continues that with another 28 seconds to go. At this point in time I submit that there is no point of order.
—Minister, I draw your attention to the question and the fact that you have 28 seconds remaining to answer the question.
—I am again referring to the figures that the government has released across the economy: an increase in long-run GDP of 0.7 per cent, an increase in long-run investment by 2.1 per cent and an increase in real wages by 1.1 per cent.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-06-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators Cash and Williams today relating to the proposed new tax on resources.
When the Australian people elected Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister 2½ years ago, they were promised an economic conservative and after 2½ years they have woken up to the fact that they have an economic vandal, an economic wrecker, a man whom Mr Forrest, one of Australia’s leading miners, described only last week as an economic moron. There must be very few people left in this country who have not worked out by now that Mr Rudd is less than he seemed to be when he was elected Prime Minister. He is a Prime Minister who stands for nothing, leading a government which is incapable of doing anything. And that is seen nowhere more so than in the public policy catastrophe which is the mining supertax.
Do not take it from me. Mary Kissel, one of the region’s most respected journalists, wrote in the Wall Street Journal Asia last month:
This economic thinking—
referring to the mining tax—
runs counter to everything that made Australia rich over three decades—namely: the embrace of competition and capitalism, which rewards high risk and high returns.
She went on to wonder at the idiocy of making Australia one of the most burdensome places to mine in the world. She said:
The increased tax burden would reduce profitability, discourage future investment and restrict companies’ ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends.
There is so much to be said against the mining supertax, but let us start with one proposition: the concept that a rate of return on capital at anything above the Commonwealth bond rate of six per cent is a superprofit. Mr Deputy President you know, and anybody listening to this broadcast today knows, that if you want the most conservative investment available you put your money in the bank or buy a Commonwealth bond and get the Commonwealth bond rate. It is the most conservative investment you can have and, as a result, it generates the lowest rate of return on capital because there is no element of risk.
To regard the bond rate as the benchmark for a superproft and then apply that to the mining industry, which depends upon long-term decisions in a highly risky sector of the economy, is the quintessence of economic idiocy. In fact, the average rate of return of Australia’s thousand largest companies over the last five years has been more than double the bond rate. The average rate of return over the last five years for Australia’s thousand largest companies has been 13.3 per cent. But do you know what the average rate of return for the companies listed on the Australian stock exchange in the mining sector has been over the last five years? It has been 6.6 per cent.
So you have an industry characterised by very high risks and investment decisions requiring very long-term commitment of vast amounts of capital in a highly competitive, highly mobile global industry which yields an average rate of return less than half the average rate of return of Australia’s major companies. And the Rudd government, in a fit of economic genius, decided that any return companies received above the most conservative investment available—that is, an investment in Commonwealth bonds—should be deemed a superproft, and the rate of tax paid by those companies should be increased effectively from 42 per cent to 57 per cent! What economic idiocy is this? No wonder then that the mining sector of the Australian stock market has collapsed, communities are at risk and superannuation funds are threatened by this idiotic decision of the Rudd government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-06-15,"—It is very hard to believe that Senator Brandis is serious about this issue. What Senator Brandis fails to look at is the benefits for all Australians that are going to flow from this superprofits tax. The government are all about creating a fairer Australia. We intend to create a fairer Australia by introducing this new supertax regime on superprofits that are made as a result of the resources boom.
—How is anything above the Commonwealth bond rate a superprofit?
—If you are happy to listen to me, Senator Brandis, I am happy to explain the benefits.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Just listen. I sat very quietly, Senator Brandis, while you got stuck into this tax. I would appreciate the same courtesy from you while I explain to you how all Australians, including those people who have superannuation funds, will benefit.
I can remember a time when the only people in Australia who were the beneficiaries of superannuation were men—predominantly in managerial positions—who worked a lifetime for their particular employer. One of the great achievements of the Hawke-Keating government, as you will recall, Mr Deputy President, was the introduction of compulsory industry based superannuation. We started that program. We started it at three per cent—in fact Australian workers had to give up a wage rise in return for getting that three per cent—and over time built it up to nine per cent. I can recall when John Howard promised to continue to lift that figure. He broke that promise as he did so many other promises that he made. That nine per cent was to benefit all Australians so they could have a decent income in retirement.
How is the current Labor government—another reforming Labor government of the ilk of the Hawke-Keating government—going to extend and continue the reforms that were made by the previous Labor government? We are going to do it by trying to share fairly for all Australians the benefit we get from our resources industry. Rather than holding the rate at nine per cent, which to be perfectly frank is not sufficient to get a fair return in your retirement years after a lifetime of employment, we are proposing to lift that amount from nine per cent—the figure that it was left at when Paul Keating was defeated as Prime Minister—to 12 per cent. We are not going to do it overnight; we are going to do it gradually in the way that would have happened had Paul Keating not been defeated in 1996.
Through our reforms in the late eighties and early nineties we introduced compulsory superannuation. We started the process of expanding superannuation so that all working Australians would benefit. Now we are going to complete the job. We are going to complete the job by lifting that rate another 33 per cent: from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Of course, that is not all we are going to do with this new tax. It is not only working families that are going to benefit from this new tax but companies.
—Nonsense!
—No. Companies will benefit, Senator Abetz. Again, please give me the courtesy of listening to me. We are going to reduce company tax, which the Howard government left at 30 per cent, to 29 per cent. We are going to do that from financial year 2013-14. And we will not stop there. We are going to reduce it further to 28 per cent in financial year 2014-15. So it is not just working families that will benefit from this new tax. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-06-15,"—Last week, the Western Australian people showed their anger towards the Rudd government’s proposed resource super profits tax at a huge demonstration in Langley Park across from the Hyatt hotel, where Kevin Rudd was speaking at the Perth Press Club.
—Order! Refer to the Prime Minister by his proper title.
—Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, if that is needed.
—Or Mr Rudd!
—Or Mr Rudd. Prime Minister Mr Kevin Rudd. He will never be Sir Kevin. Resentment towards this flawed tax is no doubt more palpable in Western Australia than anywhere else in the country because we in the west have a greater understanding of the link between a healthy mining sector and a healthy economy for the wider population. Although Senator Farrell, after what he has just said, may not agree with that, I think he would find that a healthy mining sector means healthier superannuation and bigger benefits for the average man in the street.
The Labor government maintains the line that they are looking to negotiate with industry to obtain a mutually beneficial outcome. However, after listening to Labor ministers referring to those in the mining sector as arrogant liars, it leaves me wondering what exactly consultation and cooperation mean to this Labor government. It is much more likely, it seems to me, that the time for negotiation has passed and Australians are left with no other option than to flatly reject this tax proposal to protect the economic health of our nation.
Since being announced on 2 May, the Rudd government’s proposed resource super profits tax has faced considerable criticism, but it has not come just from the resources sector. In fact, condemnation of the RSPT has come from many different interest groups in our country. Mum and dad investors who have had their superannuation accounts decimated, international investors who now see Australia’s sovereign risk as higher than that of Indonesia—as someone said quite recently at an Indonesian Australian Business Council breakfast which I attended—small and medium businesses who rely on the mining industry, not to mention workers from all over Australia who are dependent on the resource industry both directly and indirectly for continued employment are condemning this tax.
Some of the wider effects of the new tax include: a loss of jobs in the resource industry as well as occupations reliant on the mining sector; decreased value of superannuation; higher electricity prices, which will have a flow-on effect of increasing the price of supermarket items; and higher material prices, which will similarly be passed on in the form of higher costs of construction.
Unfortunately, already as a result of the proposed tax we have witnessed mines restricting investment. For example, Xstrata immediately suspended a $568 million investment in coal and copper mines in Queensland. BHP is reviewing the expansion of the massive $20 billion Olympic Dam mine in South Australia. International agreement between financiers that the Australian resources sector has become a much less attractive place in which to invest is now acknowledged around the world. This tax will destroy the Australian economy. The only way to stop this tax is to change the government, and that is what I think the Australian people will be doing when the next election occurs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-06-15,"—The Rudd Labor government has announced the implementation of the resource super profits tax, the RSPT, to ensure that we get a fair share from our non-renewable national resources. During the mining boom as mining profits have increased we have seen the share of profits returned to the Australian people decrease. Before the last mining boom, Australians received $1 in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and charges. However, now that return has shrunk to $1 in every $7. In fact, profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000 but governments only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. We need to deliver a fair share of these resource profits for the Australian people, because a fair share will mean higher retirement savings, more roads, rail and ports and less company tax, especially for small business.
Between the mining industry and those opposite we have seen plenty of extraordinary claims during this intensive scare campaign. Whilst there has been plenty of mud-slinging from those opposite on behalf of their mining friends, the fact remains—which has been highlighted by a number of ministers, including the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—that these minerals belong to Australia and Australians. They are owned by Australians and we need to make sure that Australians get a fairer share of resource profits. These are non-renewable resources and we need to ensure that Australia capitalises on the next resources boom. The government is currently consulting with the mining industry on the RSPT and will continue to do so. The Rudd Labor government is committed to investing the RSPT in infrastructure, in superannuation and in reducing company tax.
Unlike those opposite, we do not want to squander the benefits from a resources boom; we want to invest for the future for all Australians. This is in stark contrast to the opposition, who wasted the previous resources boom on handouts and playing short-term populist politics. We will ensure that we take advantage of the revenue generated from the resource super profits tax to help generate more superannuation savings for working families, lower tax for all companies, especially small businesses, and invest in our future infrastructure needs, particularly for mining states.
We will not make the same mistakes as those opposite, who for over a decade rode high on the mining boom but failed to get value for resources owned by the Australian people. While they were busy riding on this boom time they failed to invest in vital infrastructure and productivity needed to help drive the Australian economy forward into the future. As part of our tax plan for the future, the extra revenue gained from the resource tax will help to deliver a resource state infrastructure fund which will make infrastructure spending a part of Commonwealth and state budgets. The fund will be an investment of $6 billion over the next decade, particularly for mining states to build the infrastructure they need for the future. The Prime Minister has highlighted that the recently announced $400 million of funds will allow projects that address infrastructure needs to proceed immediately rather than having to wait for the revenue generated from the RSPT to flow through. The infrastructure funds generated from the RSPT will be directed towards supporting infrastructure and the communities in mining areas. This will mean that vital infrastructure projects in rail, roads and ports will go where they are needed most.
As part of our tax reform measures, the tax plan for the future will help all sectors of the economy grow together so that everyone can share in the prosperity of our strong economy. By reducing company tax, we will create new jobs and grow the Australian economy. It will ultimately be of benefit to all Australians. But we are not just implementing the RSPT as part of our tax plan for the future; we are also committing to gradually increasing the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. As well, around 3.5 million lower paid Australians will receive a concession on their superannuation guarantee for the first time. We will deliver a cut in company tax, reducing the rate to 28 per cent, to help Australian businesses remain competitive. Small businesses will reap the benefits as well. (Time expired)

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-06-15,"—It is really concerning to note that despite the growing resistance and despair amongst the Australian public—and even amongst those backbenchers who sit behind Senator Wong—she has yet again failed to address any of the numerous concerns in relation to the resource super profits tax. Wouldn’t you have just loved to have been a fly on the wall in this morning’s caucus meeting to hear those backbenchers telling them what is actually happening on the ground and to open their eyes to what is happening?
Senator Wong today mentioned that the RSPT would strengthen the Australian economy, increase productivity and increase mining output. Senator Farrell suggested that it was a fairer tax that would benefit working families. What planet do these people live on and come from? Only a few hours ago, Wesfarmers joined the mining industry’s cause of opposition to the proposed RSPT, saying it would raise sovereign risk and could threaten dividends. The chairman, Bob Every, said that the consultation process with miners should be restarted and the tax completely revamped.
This government are not listening to anyone. To put it in Mr Every’s words:
Any threat to earnings is clearly a threat to the level of dividend we can pay … our shareholders.
Only last month, BHP Billiton made a similar warning that dividend payments could be hit by the proposed tax. Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody listening? I think we on this side of the chamber know the answer to that, and the answer is clearly no. Notwithstanding that, the government clearly appreciate that there must be a problem and have invested in a $38½ million advertising blitz to address what they have a termed ‘a campaign of disinformation’ about this tax. A campaign of disinformation: how Orwellian can we get?
I suggest to Senator Wong and the kitchen cabinet that they perhaps listen to their backbenchers, go back to their electorate offices, pick up the phone and listen to what their constituents actually have to say. Only two weeks ago I visited some self-funded retirees in Blackburn, which is hardly what one would call a salubrious suburb. It is certainly no millionaires’ row. Those retirees had just sought and got their recent superannuation statements. They found that in only the last three weeks—and this is a modest superannuation fund—their funds had dropped $44,000 in value. Senator Farrell referred to this being beneficial to working families. Here is a couple who have both worked all their lives and were looking forward to retirement. They do not have any options to redress the drop in value of their superannuation funds. They do not have any options to do that because they are now in retirement and have no option to go back into the workforce. So they cannot address the drop in value. Instead, they can only watch the continued decline in the superannuation value that their statements clearly show.
This new tax is a blight on all working families, and to suggest that it is anything otherwise is total denial by this government. It is a knee-jerk measure that will affect many people and many trades all over Australia. We have seen in the electorate of Deakin, where we have a brickworks, that it is affecting their supply chain and it is ultimately affecting those who are purchasing those bricks. So it does affect the extraction industries; it does affect the quarries. And this government fails to recognise the extraordinary detrimental effect it will have. Anyone who does not believe that it will have a negative impact on any of these industries, with significant flow-on effects, has got their head in the sand, and I would suggest that is what this government has.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-06-15,"—The Australian Conservation Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Index was released this morning. It provides an insightful and quite alarming snapshot of the comparative performance of Australia’s largest cities. It contains 15 different indicators which cover key social, economic and environmental factors. It shows the ability of each city to sustain its population within its environmental means and within overall parameters of amenability and liveability. I suppose the first thing to take away is that this is not simply a list of environmental indicators. This is the footprint and the impact that our cities are having on the biosphere that sustains and supports them. It goes into quite a bit of detail across 15 different indicators.
It deals with environmental performance and looks at indicators around air quality, ecological footprint and so on, and water consumption, quite critically. It looks at quality-of-life indicators using things including proxies for health, transport, unemployment, subjective wellbeing and so on. So it is quite broadly framed. A third category of indicators are around resilience—a key word which I suspect we will hear much more of: climate change steps as identified by the Cities for Climate Protection five milestone process, which we might talk about more later if there is time, public participation rate, education, local food production and so on. So it is a very well rounded set of indicators. It is by no means definitive or exhaustive, but it is to my knowledge the first time that this has ever been tried—to come up with a set of indicators of overall sustainability of our largest settlements and then try to rate Australian cities relative to each other to see how we are collectively doing.
It is based on the best datasets that are available, and in some cases I think some of the important takeaway messages are the gaps in data and information that we do not have or that the Australian Conservation Foundation and its partners did not have when they were collating the material to put this report together. I think some of the more important flow-on impacts might be taking a good look at what information we need to be collecting and doing better at.
Not a single Australian city scored well on the index. All cities are hovering in the middle range and, effectively, what we are measuring here is relative degrees of quite average performance. This is not abstract; this is not something that is academic that means that we just need to do a little bit better next year. This measures the ability of settlements in Australia to survive the challenges, the non-negotiable challenges, of the 21st century. No longer distant challenges, these are issues that are upon us right now and we are sleepwalking into them. One of the most important takeaway findings from this report is that Australian cities, despite 20 or 30 years of the kinds of debates that we have been having in here, are not ready across a very wide range of indicators.
Darwin ranked first with a score of 119. We may hear more from senators from the Territory about that. Zero was given to be the best performance. So even Darwin, which for a variety of reasons performed the best against the kind of metrics that the ACF were measuring, only scored reasonable. Not a single Australian city was good—a world leader. Three Queensland cities came next, with the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane and Townsville being placed second, third and fourth respectively. It starts to show and give credit to some of the extraordinarily good work that is being done. Not just in these cities that ranked very high but also right around Australia there have been initiatives that have been piecemeal but incredibly valuable, and we have to thank those that came from state, local and federal governments and those that came from the community sector, from the non-government sector and from the business community. These initiatives have been piecemeal and uncoordinated, but at least they have saved us from being much worse than we are.
Perth, my own hometown, came last. It came 19th out of 20 cities—because two were ranked equal 14th. That is an alarming outcome for a city that prides itself on its clean, green image and I think, when you get into the nuts and bolts of the detail, it does give credit to the extremely good work that has been done in a couple of areas. It shows overall that the capital of Western Australia is quite simply unprepared for the challenges that it faces. I will go into a little more detail. Perth scored very well on education and on employment, but it had the worst possible score on ecological footprint, which is in itself an amalgam of different indicators, and on transport and on water. We still have among the lowest mode share for public transport of any major Australian community. Despite the fact that we have a world-class heavy rail network, we are missing a vitally important link. Of course, the Australian Greens believe that that could be filled by light rail.
The ecological footprint for Perth, according to the report, is a little over seven hectares per person per year. The EPA State of the Environment report calculated it, using a slightly different methodology, at 14½ hectares per person per year. People say that if the entire world was trying to live the way we do in Australia we would need another three or four planets. That is where that kind of statistic comes from. If we took the global availability of resources—water and so on—per capita, according to some kind of principle of global justice which says every human being on this planet deserves access to the same resources, we would need to be living on less than two hectares per person. Perth, scoring the very worst on this indicator, is somewhere between seven and 14. That is just how far we have to go. That is one of the reasons that we are at the bottom of the list.
We got one of the lowest possible scores for transport. Again, this may be in part an artefact of the data that was used and it gives us some signs that we probably need to collect it better. We do have the highest rate of vehicle ownership in Australia. Australian cities are amongst the least dense and most car dependent of any on the planet. We have been getting away with it because of a long period of cheap oil, quite frankly. We had a huge fright and a near miss a couple of years back when oil prices spiked, and that seems to have been forgotten. When you ask the Commonwealth government, ‘Who is the lead agency on oil depletion and our unique oil vulnerability in Australia?’ nobody seems to know. We are still flying blind.
Western Australia also scores very poorly in water consumption because we seem to have this dependence or institutional reliance on groundwater mining projects and extremely energy intensive water desalination, and there has been very little thought given in WA—apart from some extremely good research over the last few years—to decentralising water infrastructure.
Waste and recycling is not included in this indicator, although it would be incorporated by proxy in the ecological footprint. Again, it points to initiatives like container deposit legislation, which the NT has and which South Australia led with years and years ago, but the Commonwealth government is still baulking and studying to death while a good idea goes begging.
There are ideas that we could be implementing right now so that next year we see not just that the cities change order and we are comparing each other in slightly different ways but that all Australian communities move further up the scale. This is not in order to get some gold star. This is in order to survive the very real imperatives of the 21st century—climate change, oil depletion, water depletion, food and basic expectations of quality of life. At the moment I think we are simply coasting along assuming that things are going to stay the same as they have. That is why we are still seeing budgets brought down at a state and federal level that would have served us very, very well for the 1950s and 1960s but that are grossly mismatched for the challenges that we face today.
One of the things that I would like to conclude with is the Rudd government’s promises of infrastructure spending. For the first time in a generation, we are seeing the Commonwealth getting, in a tentative way, back into the business of urban public transport. This is a subject that is very dear to my heart. But we are still seeing an overwhelming reliance on road funding, on building more roads to get more traffic onto those roads, while continuing to underfund public transport or just assuming that one day the states will get their act together and that there will be something to fund. The Commonwealth can play a role. We are hearing some of the right language but it is not being reflected in the actions, because in the last Commonwealth budget handed down here a couple of weeks ago there was not a single additional dollar for public transport spending anywhere in the country.
What we are seeing instead is this sense of infrastructure being something that mining companies ask for and get. Infrastructure is: ‘Let’s make north-west ports larger. Let’s provide railway infrastructure and expansions for coal companies.’ That is not what the Greens mean when we talk about infrastructure. When we talk about infrastructure we mean survivability, resilience and thriving into the 21st century. In the mining communities in particular that I represent in the north-west of WA, when we are talking infrastructure those communities are actually not demanding larger ports or more expensive housing. They are demanding basic health care, education, transport and telecommunications systems. These are economies that have been stretched to the brink. We are flying in and flying out people to clean schools in Karratha at the moment, and that simply cannot be maintained.
I think people need to be very aware that when the Rudd government uses the word ‘infrastructure’ it appears to mean something very different. When the Greens use that word we mean the infrastructure of sustainability, whether it be light rail in our major cities, whether it be renewable energy infrastructure and smart grids or whether it be basic community health care and education services, which people in our wealthy inner cities certainly take for granted but which the mining centres in Western Australia and other regional communities across the country simply do not take for granted. It is about time everybody were given access to the same opportunities. I commend ACF on producing this report and look forward to seeing how we do next year.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-06-15,"—I would like to say that I am delighted but not at all surprised, as you would understand, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, that Darwin was at the top of the list in terms of air quality, biodiversity and a subjective wellbeing index. If you told most of the people in the pub that they had come top of the subjective wellbeing index they probably would not allow you to participate in the next shout and would help drive you home. It is something that generally describes just how wonderful it is to live in Darwin—a fantastic city in the fantastic Northern Territory. But, sadly, this is where the good news ends.
The comments by Peter Verwer, the Chief Executive of the Property Council of Australia, about Sydney having an antiplanning culture are probably far more applicable to Darwin. In fact, Darwin was ranked not first but second last out of Australia’s capital cities in a KPMG discussion paper that looked at the performance of city planning systems. Planning is an absolutely essential element of staying at the top of the sustainable cities index. It appears that we are far behind in forward planning issues, which include discussions on infrastructure, land release and encouraging investment for the same. It should come as no surprise to Territorians that the people responsible for this completely abysmal performance are in fact the Northern Territory Labor government.
Darwin is the only capital city in Australia that does not have a population growth planning target. It beggars belief. Someone more cynical than I could say that the fact that we cannot even measure how the government is performing in managing and planning for population growth is perhaps why they do not have a target. I quote the KPMG report:
There is substantial reform to be undertaken. For example, there is the need to develop a land supply program and an infrastructure plan, the need to address national policy issues and the establishment of better implementation arrangements across government and with local government.
That sort of advice has been around for some time. How long have these guys been in power? Since 2001. You would reckon that after 10 years in power they would have worked that out by now. But instead there is still no land supply program. There is no plan for infrastructure and there is no plan for population growth. So what have we been doing all this time? If you were having a conversation there would be a long wait before somebody filled that gap.
The report also talks about the gap between the aspirations we have for our cities and the implementation and achievement of targets and outcomes contained in those plans. It would help if we had a plan in Darwin. The Northern Territory government ranked last when it came to actually providing funding for its stated strategic planning objectives, and this reflects the fact that there is no strategic planning framework in place. Over the last five years we have also seen the largest deterioration in housing affordability in Darwin, and I know all those in this place and across parliament are concerned with housing affordability. It is so closely attached to being able to gauge population growth and ensure that we are releasing the right sort of land, as much as anything else. In many of the places that have a lot of tightness in housing affordability, which is particularly the case in the Northern Territory, it is a consequence of poor planning or, in this case, absolutely no planning at all.
To return to the senator’s MPI, whilst congestion is not really a problem in Darwin, at this stage I would agree with Senator Ludlam that greener transport infrastructure is likely to attract people to use public transport more. But before you can fund greener infrastructure you have to have a government that actually plans for population growth and land supply. If those fundamentals are not there then you are never going to get to the final objectives.
It was the federal coalition government that instigated and led the inquiry into the state of our cities so we could better develop into sustainable cities. We did a number of inquiries, and that inquiry into the state our cities and a whole range of subsequent consultancy reports found that a crucial missing element is a clear sustainable cities vision, a coherent framework and concerted action. This government does not appear to give priority to sustainable cities. It is evident that sustainability has not been incorporated across government and more sustainable cities do not appear to be a policy priority or a shared purpose of this government.
In an example of the government’s haphazard approach, Peter Garrett gave away insulation to homes and rental properties whilst Julia Gillard built ‘schools for the 21st century’. One in 10 of these schools does not utilise building insulation, one in four fails to use energy efficient lighting and more than half ignore energy efficient glazing. So the proof is in the pudding. Next year low-income and disadvantaged households will be able to apply for ‘Green Start’ funding to improve the energy and water efficiency of their homes, yet the new buildings constructed through the National Rental Affordability Scheme are not required to feature sustainability attributes. There have been plenty of opportunities and this government has simply squandered them. There has been short-term investment in infrastructure but the government has simply emptied the bank.
By contrast, the coalition have recognised the great sustainable cities public policy challenges and we have responded with a clear embrace of the constructive, collaborative and positive role that the Commonwealth can play. This was backed up in a very practical sense by the appointment of a cross-portfolio and whole-of-government shadow minister for sustainable cities, my esteemed colleague Bruce Billson. Population and sustainability are separate sides of the same strategic policy coin. Viewing it in this way will promote mature debate and increase accountability.
Cities are the overwhelmingly dominant characteristic of population settlement in Australia and, as Senator Ludlam indicated, this really needs to be a particular focus of our attention. The Australian government, I believe, has a crucial role to play in securing more sustainable cities because it determines policy settings that actually have a major impact on our cities. It also has the resources and points of leverage that can better align support for more sustainable cities, and that is why the coalition has embraced a cross-portfolio approach led by my esteemed colleague Bruce Billson. The Northern Territory and federal Labor governments need to take note: those who fail to plan, plan to fail.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-06-15,"—I welcome this debate, because our communities and cities are the places where the climate rubber hits the road. Community action on climate change, as the ACF report shows, can save energy, save time and save money. More sustainable cities can enhance the Australian way of life. Sustainable cities mean less travelling time and more time with families. They mean reduced energy costs and reduced water bills. They ease the strain on family finances. They mean more pleasant, efficient and convenient environments to live, work, learn and play in.
As the ACF’s report shows, there is a significant amount of work being done by many cities across Australia to reduce their carbon footprint. There are indicators related to air quality, green buildings, water and climate change, and the ACF’s report shows many cities are indeed doing their bit to make their local communities more sustainable. But the report also shows that there is still a great deal of work to do across Australia in the area of climate change and energy efficiency. As ACF head Don Henry said this morning:
… our cities can do a lot better to be more sustainable.
From my point of view, this means things like using less water and energy in schools, workplaces and homes. It means relying more on public transport. It means walking and cycling rather than getting into your car.
The Australian government remains committed to taking action on climate change and to making Australia more energy efficient. The implementation of the enhanced renewable energy target will provide greater certainty for large-scale renewable energy developers as well as households who want to take action to reduce their emissions. Legislation to implement the enhanced renewable energy target will be debated in the parliament this fortnight. The RET will see nearly $19 billion worth of investment in clean energy in this nation by 2030.
We also have a commitment of $650 million to the Renewable Energy Future Fund. This funding will provide additional support for the development and deployment of large- and small-scale renewable energy projects and enhance the take-up of industrial, commercial and residential energy efficiency. These projects are going to have a major impact on Australia’s cities. The Rudd government has also established the Australian Carbon Trust and is supporting its work to help businesses to take action to improve their energy efficiency. Earlier this month, the government also announced the first commercial-scale smart grid, which will be based in Newcastle, New South Wales. It is a demonstration project that will lead Australia in advances in energy management. It is about modernising the electricity network, helping people to save energy and connecting renewables into the grid. It is about engaging the community to take action on climate change.
So you can see here that we are implementing an integrated range of policies aimed at improving energy efficiency of homes, appliances, equipment and lighting. It is about giving families more confidence in the purchasing decisions that they are making. The government is also implementing a national program to improve the energy efficiency of Australia’s largest office buildings through providing better information and funding leading-edge green buildings.
I welcome the ACF’s sustainable city index as a vital contribution to the ongoing national discussion about taking action on the state of Australia’s cities. I do not agree with the all the report’s findings, and I think this is in part because there are some gaps in the data. Nevertheless, it is important that we look at and debate the questions that this report raises. And, yes, it is even more important that we act with a sense of urgency on the enormous challenges that confront Australians who live, learn and work in our cities, and indeed on the biodiversity challenges that exist within Australia’s urban landscapes.
It is important to note that the ACF’s document is not only about our environmental footprint and the natural environment but also about a range of other important factors. It is about our quality of life and our communities’ resilience. For each of these performance indicators, data has been collected on a range of important subissues. So, to highlight, for example, community resilience, the ACF has brought together some pretty important issues such as our capacity to adapt to climate change, public participation, education, food production and household repayments.
So when you look at Perth’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change combined with the high levels of household debt attached to our booming property market, our high levels of food imports and the busy lifestyles so common in Perth, you can easily see how Perth has a low rating, when compared to others, on a resilience score. While I am not sure this rating is entirely fair, as there is a lot being done to address these issues in my home city, it is, nevertheless, great to see this index fostering a healthy rivalry between cities—a rivalry that encourages all our cities to lift their performance on sustainability. I know that the people of Perth will see this report as providing renewed impetus to get in there and get things done and to put the city on a more sustainable footing.
Many people have been working hard now over many years to get Perth to look at its sustainability issues. The former Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, and now federal candidate for Canning, has done a great deal of work on this front. The Gallop-Carpenter governments built the Mandurah rail line and have worked very hard to promote nodes of development along existing transport hubs. This was about increasing urban density in places where there are existing services, and that was something that Alannah MacTiernan led the way on.
The work of the Labor government was directed at undoing the legacy of many years of poor planning. It aimed to reverse the negative trends of the past by putting transit oriented development at the forefront. This means locating moderate- to high-intensity commercial, mixed use, community and residential development close to train stations and/or high-frequency bus routes to encourage public transport use over private vehicles. There are many benefits to this approach and they include: improving the attractiveness of and access to public transport, cycling and walking; providing communities with interesting and vibrant places for people to interact in and to visit; reducing the impact of transport on the environment; reducing household travelling expenses; and providing more housing diversity and affordable housing options.
Since the 1950s, Perth’s urban sprawl has become more dependent on the private motor vehicle than most other cities around the world. Perth therefore generates more CO2 compared to cities with a more compact urban development pattern. So it is easy to see how, on some of the indicators highlighted by the ACF, Perth might score badly. But it is a challenge that the previous Labor government in Western Australia was working very hard to address.
Transit oriented development helps address the issues of climate change by providing people with choices of lifestyles and personal travel that directly or indirectly reduce the use of fossil fuels and thus the emission of CO2. In the coming years, the world’s declining oil reserves will significantly impact on many aspects of Perth’s social and economic structures, in particular its dependence on vehicles. Already, the days of cheap conventional oil are in the past, and it is expected that the demand for oil will eventually outstrip supply. In Perth it is vital that we provide walking and cycling options and a more efficient public transport system across the city to reduce the impact of declining oil reserves. So, concepts such as activity centres and higher residential densities along high-frequency public transport routes are vital ways for our city to reduce vehicle dependence.
There are complex and interrelated issues that impact on the sustainability of Australian cities. These were considered in some depth in the government’s State of Australian cities 2010 report released by Infrastructure Australia, in March this year. This report was produced in recognition of the paucity of national information on economic, environmental, social and demographic indicators relating to our cities. The systematic data collection on which the report is based reveals key trends in the development of our cities and provides a platform of knowledge to facilitate the development and implementation of future urban policies.
This report makes clear that effective action on the challenges facing our major cities will require the cooperation of the community, of business and of all levels of government—local, state and federal. It identifies a wide array of challenges. Given the scope of the challenges facing our cities, there is a vital role for the federal government. We must provide leadership, coordination and funding for large-scale projects that can make a real difference to the sustainability, productivity and liveability of our cities. It is a role that our predecessors—those opposite—were reluctant to take up. In government they avoided this challenge, as they did so many other challenges.
The state of the cities report signals that the Rudd government is willing to tackle this challenge, as it has done on many other hard issues The report sets the scope and context for the Rudd government’s renewed commitment to urban policy and planning, particularly in relation to the need for new infrastructure. For too long, myriad government departments have been involved in these issues with no plan for action, no plan to make our cities more sustainable and more liveable. With the election of the Rudd government, that changed. We do have a plan for green infrastructure and we are taking urgent action. We are, for the first time in the nation’s history, making record investment in public transport and green energy infrastructure. In fact, the Rudd government has committed to the first significant federal investment in urban public transport in the nation’s history. Our Nation Building Program provides some $4.5 billion in funding for metropolitan rail projects in our major cities. That warrants repeating: for the first time ever we have a record national investment in public transport, including rail. The Rudd government takes the sustainability of our cities and the quality of life of urban Australians very seriously. Our Major Cities Unit and our energy and infrastructure investment mean that we are, for the first time in the Australia’s history, tackling the very issues raised by the ACF in its index report. We are making just the kinds of investment in green energy infrastructure necessary to get us on a sustainable footing. Yes, it is important to act and, yes, it is urgent.
Again, I welcome the ACF’s constructive contribution to this issue. Federal, state and local governments; communities and community groups and businesses and individuals must all get on with making our cities more sustainable. Hand in hand with making them more sustainable, they will be better places to live, learn, work and play. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to contribute to this debate today.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-06-15,"—My colleagues in the Senate will forgive me if I express in this matter of public importance debate a little pride in the results of the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Index survey. Townsville and Darwin, two of Australia’s northernmost cities, have come in first and third overall in this assessment. They lead the way in many areas. I think that indicates that, as in other areas, Northern Australia leads the way and should be recognised as such across the board of government influence. I also say with some pride that the capital city of my state, Brisbane, has featured very well, as has another significant city in the state of Queensland, the Sunshine Coast. There is a common theme running through these successful cities, and that is they have good governance at local, state and federal level. For example, Townsville’s results are in no small way a credit to the mayor, Councillor Les Tyrell, and the deputy mayor, Councillor David Crisafulli—who, I mention in passing with some pride, just happened to work for me once upon a time. Brisbane has done well because of the work of Can-do Campbell Newman, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane—another Liberal, I might add. Sunshine Coast has a great leader in Councillor Bob Abbot. Of course, all of the federal seats in that area are held by good positive members—Warren Truss, Alex Somlyay and Peter Slipper—and the other seat in that area, Longman, will shortly be represented by an up-and-coming, very able young fellow by the name of Wyatt Roy. I will come back to that later. All of the state members on the Sunshine Coast are members of the Liberal National Party. There is a common theme there.
I will look quickly at some of the individual rankings. Darwin was ranked first on employment opportunities. Why would that be? Because of two factors mainly. The huge resource of mining makes employment in Darwin so positive, but what is the Rudd government going to do about that? It is going to destroy the mining industry with this great big new tax and that, in future surveys, will have an impact on Darwin. The other thing for Darwin is that it is the location of a military enterprise. A lot of the employment opportunities in Darwin rotate off the defence commitment in that area. Darwin also ranked high in household payments. Why? Because a lot of the income of the Northern Territory, and Darwin in particular, comes from the mining industry; an industry that Mr Rudd seems determined to destroy in Australia. Darwin ranked sixth in food production. This is because the people of the Northern Territory—indeed, the people of Northern Australia—understand that more can be done to supply fresh food from the north of Australia because of our abundant supply of water.
Townsville did very well in biodiversity, and that I think is principally because of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which was set up by the Fraser Liberal government, and the green zones on the Barrier Reef, which were an initiative of the Howard Liberal government. Townsville ranked well in employment. For what reason? Three mine-processing activities—zinc, copper and nickel—are located in Townsville, and these again are supported by an industry that Mr Rudd wants to destroy with his great big new tax on mining.
Another reason Townsville did well was because of the Solar Cities program. That was a program initiated by the Howard government and fought for by Peter Lindsay, the Liberal member for the seat of Herbert. His good work there will be carried on by Ewen Jones, who I think everyone expects will become the next member for Herbert. Again Townsville ranked well with household repayments. Why? It is because of the fly-in fly-out from Townsville, supported by the mining industry which Mr Rudd wants to destroy with his great big new tax on mining. Townsville also benefits because it is the site of Australia’s largest defence establishment.
The Sunshine Coast did well on the subject of wellbeing. I can well understand that. One of the reasons it ranked well in food production is that fortuitously the Liberal-National Party in Queensland led the charge against the establishment of the Traveston Crossing dam against the Labor government, who were returned to office with support of the Greens political party. Wyatt Roy, who I mentioned before, comes from a family that has been involved in horticulture in that Sunshine Coast hinterland. It is that sort of access to fresh food that has seen the Sunshine Coast do so well there.
In Brisbane a lot of their high ranking in the biodiversity area is the responsibility of the Brisbane City Council. I might mention that Councillor Jane Prentice, who will be coming to Canberra hopefully as the member for Ryan, had a significant role to play in establishing Brisbane as the green city it is.
On a negative note, and time is escaping me, I did want to mention the other significant North Queensland city of Cairns. It has been taken down in the overall rankings because its employment is so atrocious under the Rudd government. It was the Rudd government that destroyed a very viable shipbuilding industry in Cairns, causing huge unemployment. It was the Rudd government that introduced the passenger movement charges that have had a lot to do with making things difficult in the tourism industry. For those reasons, unfortunately Cairns rated poorly overall. But all in all, it is a good result for Queensland and a great result for Northern Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-06-15,"—I would like to start my contribution by thanking the Australian Conservation Foundation for the excellent work they do in producing the sustainable cities index. It is important to note that the index is not just a measure of environmental sustainability, not that I wish to diminish the importance of measuring environmental outcomes, but also a measure of the quality of life and resilience of cities. It provides a holistic overview of the health of our cities and how smart our cities are in meeting the challenges of the 21st century. It is a useful tool to measure how we are tracking not only at all three levels of government—federal, state and local government—but as a community and society in continuing to make our cities livable into the future.
I am personally pleased that the capital city of my home state of Tasmania, Hobart, has been placed a respectable sixth amongst the 20 cities whose sustainability was assessed by the ACF. However, I do not think anyone in this place would disagree that there is much more we can do to improve the sustainability of our cities. As ACF head Don Henry said this morning, our cities can do a lot better to be more sustainable. This could include measures such as using less water and less energy and relying more on public transport than cars.
In regard to the MPI today, it is easy for Senator Ludlam and his colleagues in the Australian Greens to take the high moral ground on this issue, as they do with so many other issues. It is easy for them to preach as if they are the messiahs of the environment and to pretend they possess the only social conscience within this parliament. It is easy from a place where you are not governing, nor offering a real prospect of being the alternative government, to say that something is a priority and more needs to be done. It is easy when you do not have to prepare a budget, you do not have to juggle spending priorities and you do not have to be accountable for the outcomes of the decisions you make. That is what the government is about. The Rudd Labor government takes the issues of the health, resilience and environmental sustainability of our cities very seriously.
I would like to mention some of the social indicators measured by the index before addressing the issue of environmental sustainability. One measure I would particularly like to mention is employment. If there is one thing we know about the unemployment rate, it is that it would be much higher had the federal opposition had their way. Let us not forget that, had it not been for the economic stimulus package opposed by those opposite, hundreds of thousands of Australians who are employed now would either have lost their jobs or not found employment. The sustainability of Australian cities in terms of employment could have been much worse had the Rudd government not taken decisive action in dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis.
The Rudd government is working hard on initiatives that address a number of other social indicators measured by the ACF’s sustainable cities index. On public participation, we are addressing this through our Volunteer Grants Program, which contributes to the cost of training courses, equipment and fuel for volunteers. This program helps support our hardworking volunteers and builds social inclusion and community participation throughout Australian communities, including our sustainable cities. In education we are boosting year 12 completion rates by building trade training centres across Australia which will help address skill shortages in traditional trades and emerging industries—unlike those opposite, who want to stop the building of the trade training centres. This will help boost employment.
In transport we are rolling out billions of dollars in road and rail infrastructure which will help reduce congestion and therefore have the added environmental benefit of reducing Australia’s carbon emissions. A great example of this is in my home state of Tasmania, the Kingston bypass, which coincidentally happens to be about halfway between my office and my home, so it is a road that I will be travelling every day and it is a road I now travel every day with some congestion on it. The Kingston bypass is jointly funded by the Tasmanian and Australian governments. It is a great project and it will be featuring bike lanes and a park-and-ride facility to encourage alternatives to vehicular transport to the city. In Australia’s fastest-growing local government area, these are very important initiatives.
There are a number of programs being progressed by the Rudd government that address the environmental sustainability of our cities. The Australian government’s Solar Cities program is designed to trial new sustainable models for electricity supply and use, and it is being implemented in seven separate electricity grid-connected areas around Australia. It is administered by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in partnership with local and state governments, industry, business and local communities. Australia’s solar cities are Adelaide, Alice Springs, Blacktown, Central Victoria, Moreland, Perth and Townsville. Each solar city integrates a unique combination of energy options, such as energy efficiency measures for homes and businesses, the use of solar technologies, cost reflective pricing trials to reward people who use energy wisely, and community education about better energy usage in an increasingly energy reliant world.
The Rudd government has committed $650 million to the Renewable Energy Future Fund, which will provide additional support for the development and deployment of large- and small-scale renewable energy projects and enhance take-up of industrial, commercial and residential energy efficiency. We are also establishing the Australian Carbon Trust and supporting its work to help businesses take action to improve their energy efficiency. Earlier this month Senator Wong, the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, announced that the first commercial-scale smart grid will be based in Newcastle, New South Wales. This demonstration project will lead to Australia-wide advances in energy management. It will modernise the electricity network, help people save energy, connect renewables to the grid and engage the community in action on climate change.
The Rudd government has also developed an integrated range of policies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of homes, appliances, equipment and lighting to allow householders to give families more confidence about the purchasing decisions that they are making. And we are implementing a national program to improve the energy efficiency of Australia’s largest office buildings, through providing better information and funding leading-edge green buildings. These examples are just a snapshot of the initiatives that the Rudd government has delivered or will be delivering to help make our cities more sustainable.
While government programs are important, we could make substantial progress by putting in place market mechanisms that encourage the businesses and households within our cities to operate more sustainably. The Rudd government has proposed two market based schemes to help make this happen: the Enhanced Renewable Energy Target, or the enhanced RET, and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, commonly known as the CPRS. The implementation of the enhanced RET will provide greater certainty for large-scale renewable energy developers as well as households wanting to take action to reduce emissions. The RET will help drive nearly $19 billion of investment in clean renewable energy by 2030. As for the CPRS, we have unfortunately been forced into a situation where we have no choice but to delay the introduction of the scheme because of the intransigence of some members of the Senate.
By voting down the CPRS, the federal opposition and the Australian Greens have voted to guarantee that Australia will fail to meet its international obligations in addressing the serious threat of climate change. If Senator Ludlum were serious about helping to reduce the carbon footprint of our cities—if he were serious about helping our cities to become more sustainable and contribute to tackling climate change—then he would urge his colleagues in the Australian Greens to pass the CPRS at the earliest opportunity. The CPRS is the most economically efficient means that Australia has of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the government’s proposed greenhouse gas reduction targets. It is hypocritical of the Greens to talk about sustainable cities and yet act to delay meaningful action on climate change. Their action places them in the same camp on this issue as the climate change sceptics and the climate change deniers in the federal opposition.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-06-15,"—It gives me great pleasure to speak on this matter of public importance today. Cities that are lauded for their sustainability contain a number of characteristics, such as economic prosperity, social energy, the robust use of resources, lifestyle opportunities and appealing and functional urban habitats. In my home state of Victoria, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which produced the sustainable cities index, have ranked 20 of Australia’s biggest cities and towns. Those in Victoria ranked seventh, which was the CBD of Melbourne; 10th, Bendigo; equal 14th, Ballarat; and 18th, Geelong. Melbourne and Bendigo were considered mid-table performers in the index, and Ballarat and Geelong were poor performers. Their low rankings were attributed to lower density, transport and employment, which placed Ballarat in the lowest-quality-of-life basket. Geelong rated poorly in health, as approximately 5.3 per cent of the population of Geelong is registered as having type 2 diabetes. This highlights the lack of emphasis that the state Labor government have on investing in sustainable living in Victoria. The same could also be said of the Rudd Labor government, and it was interesting to note in the announcement of the recent federal health reforms that the number of new beds in Victoria is barely adequate to cover the existing shortfall and we will need 187 new beds in hospitals in Victoria to cope with rising population.
Unlike the coalition, the Rudd Labor government has failed to create a portfolio position for sustainable cities, whereas my esteemed colleague Mr Bruce Billson from the other place is the shadow minister for sustainable cities. Therefore, we can only imagine that Prime Minister Rudd attaches no priority to sustainable cities. In fact, what he has done is indulge in reckless spending which has emptied the bank and failed to position Australia and our cities for a more sustainable future. The environment portfolio was giving away insulation to homeowners and rental properties, while the education portfolio, which is supposed to be building schools for the 21st century, is building schools where, as my colleague Senator Scullion remarked, one in 10 do not utilise building insulation, one in four do not use energy efficient lighting and more than half ignore energy efficient glazing.
I noticed in today’s Australian that Mr Rudd lists the key achievements of his first term as the education revolution and the remake of the hospitals and health system. What a failure they have been! Sustainability is not on the radar for this government, nor is it a policy priority. But it is not just Prime Minister Rudd who has an apparent disregard for this; the Brumby Labor government in Victoria has a similar disdain. There are great opportunities in Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. They are wonderful cities and they deserve to be served better so that people find them a desirable place to live and work.
In Melbourne, where I live, traffic congestion—and if Senator Bilyk thinks she has traffic congestion in Hobart she should see it in Melbourne—low water levels and storage deficiencies, energy demand pressures, sprawling suburbs, underperforming and overcrowded public transport and work and family life dislocation are adversely affecting the sustainability of the city, relegating it to seventh on the list. Let us take, for instance, underperforming and overcrowded public transport. We have a cartoon from some four or five years ago on the wall in my office which shows railway commuters clinging to railway carriages, some of them travelling on the roof. This cartoon is yellowed and faded, but exactly the same thing still operates. At the station where I get on the train, on occasions you are lucky to force your way into the train. It is a bit like the way travelling on Japanese transport has been portrayed. The myki ticketing system, which was due to come out some 18 months ago at a cost of $400 million, is now well over the $1 billion mark and still heading skywards. In the meantime we have seen very few tickets.
The forecast population explosion will only make these matters worse. If Australia gets a population of 35 million people by 2050 we are going to be looking at these problems yet again. For instance, when my esteemed former colleague Jeff Kennett was Premier of Victoria there was a considerable amount of criticism directed towards his government for alienating 2,000 hectares of green wedge land for urban development. Since 2002 the Bracks-Brumby Labor government has alienated 55,000 hectares of green wedge land around Melbourne for urban development, a great deal more.
Innovative thinking is required by industry, local government, unions, community organisations and state and federal governments, and I would like to give a good example of what can be done. In my home state of Victoria in 2000 Mr Terry White met with representatives of the North Central Catchment Management Authority, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment and La Trobe University at Bendigo to create the first greenhouse alliance organisation in Victoria. The Central Victorian Greenhouse Alliance, CVGA, is an incorporated organisation that includes councils, governments, local community groups and local businesses, covering 20 per cent of Victoria. They are the ones who take full responsibility for their contributions to climate change and lead their communities by example, and they make this transition in a way that is profitable and practical. I can only hope that an incoming Baillieu government in Victoria will lead the way in encouraging grassroots examples of this sort, which will make our nation sustainable and green in a way which it has not been up till now.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-06-15,"—I rise to make a few brief comments on the sustainable cities index and the need for government to consider it in a good deal of detail. The problem we have here is the interface between state and federal legislation and responsibilities and local government responsibilities and the interface between the imperatives of the 21st century for sustainability and resilience and the old-fashioned ways of thinking about infrastructure and development. If you approach this in an old-fashioned way and just talk about wanting more people, cities growing, therefore putting in more infrastructure, doing things the way we have always done them—with roads, with petrol engine vehicles, with private versus public transport—you are going to end up with completely unsustainable cities.
Let us assume for a moment that petrol and oil were $200 a barrel tomorrow. Are our cities resilient? Are they sustainable? The answer is no. The Rudd government continue to apply pressure to free up cheap land, supposedly, at the edge of cities, without putting in place the public transport infrastructure to service it. In places like Western Sydney there is still no public transport.
What about climate change? When there are extreme heat conditions, as we have experienced in summers of recent years—and this year could well be the hottest on record—public transport goes out because of, in some cases, buckling of railway tracks. There are also power outages. Equally, cities rush to put in place temporary morgues. In Adelaide they had to put in place a temporary morgue, as they did in Victoria. That was because of the heatwave conditions and the extreme stress it put particularly on the elderly and vulnerable in our communities. So we are not prepared for this.
In Tasmania we do not have a planning system that is adequate to integrate all the different areas, for example, in the south of the state. Whilst there is now a move to have a southern integrated transport plan and a southern regional planning initiative, they are still in draft form. We still do not have the shape of the city in the future. If you do not have that shape then you cannot plan the transport infrastructure or the water infrastructure you need.
In Tasmania one of the biggest problems is a lack of energy efficiency in terms of our built environment. This is a major problem and it was identified in the assessment of Hobart. Green building was very low on the list because of it. That has been the case because the Housing Industry Association and the Master Builders Association have resisted higher standards. Tasmania is one of the states holding back the whole nation when it comes to standards for new housing and new commercial buildings in terms of energy efficiency. What we need is a much greater commitment to recognising the challenges of climate change and peak oil, recognising that planning has to be integrated between local, state and federal government and recognising that the infrastructure of the future has to address those imperatives, not some imperative that economists have declared as being the ones we need to look at in terms of growth. We need to look at sustainability in terms of the environment.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-06-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I rise to speak on the ministerial statement by the Special Minister of State ‘Administration: Approval of exemption to guidelines on information and campaign advertising by Australian government departments and agencies’. Over the last month we have seen unsurpassed grubbiness by this government in relation to government advertising. I am referring to the exemption given by Senator Ludwig to the Treasurer in relation to the advertising on the great big mining tax and all the implications of that.
I want to take the chamber through some comments that were made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election and put those into context. In October 2007, prior to the federal election, the Prime Minister said that government advertising was:
… a sick cancer within our system. It’s a cancer on democracy.
The complete and utter hollowness of those words will become clearly obvious in due course. I will go through some of the ALP’s platform in 2007 under item 54. It said:
54. Labor will not support the use of government advertising for political purposes. Labor will introduce legislation to ensure:
government advertising campaigns only occur after government policy has been legislated for by parliament;
What advertisements are running today, and were running yesterday, on national television in relation to the NBN? Has the NBN been legislated? No, it has not. That is a broken core promise from this Prime Minister. It goes on:
all government advertising and information campaigns provide objective, factual and explanatory information, free from partisan promotion of government policy and political argument ...
all advertising campaigns in excess of $250,000 are examined by the Public Service Commissioner—
which has subsequently changed to the Auditor-General. These promises were broken. Further, in November 2007 the Prime Minister, at a doorstop, said:
I can guarantee that we will have a process in place, run by the Auditor General ... In terms of establishing the office of the Auditor General with clear cut guidelines to whom every television campaign is submitted for approval before that television campaign is implemented, you have my 100% guarantee that that will occur ... and each one of you here can hold me accountable for that.
In July 2008 the government introduced new guidelines for government advertising. The Special Minister of State’s press release said:
In 2007, Kevin Rudd made an election promise that campaigns over $250,000 would be scrutinised by the Auditor-General.
This election commitment is now met.
That is what the press release said.
The Auditor-General will provide a “health check” on the final product of a campaign before it is communicated.
What have we seen since? We have seen broken promise after broken promise after broken promise. This duplicitous government went to the election with weasel words from the Prime Minister, weasel words from the then opposition in relation to accountability, in relation to what the Auditor-General would be required to do and in relation to their commitment to changing the rules in relation to government advertising.
Not just two weeks ago in Senate estimates we saw the most disgraceful display from this government in relation to their complete and utter contempt for the Australian people. Under the new guidelines the Auditor-General has gone and there is a so-called independent committee, the ICC, which is meant to scrutinise government advertising. Auditor-General out and three people on two-year terms brought in to substitute for the Auditor-General. Three people, one of them getting the equivalent of $350,000 over two years, I might say.
Guess what? The minister has given himself an extended exemption to take this matter out of the hands of the so-called independent committee. The Auditor-General was subject to some guidelines in relation to this but this minister and this Prime Minister, who has broken his word in relation to this matter, put in some new words, some catch-all words, namely ‘compelling reasons’. How long is a piece of string? This takes it from a matter of urgency to compelling under this new committee. We sat in Senate estimates, we discussed exemptions and the department gave evidence. I will read it:
Mr Grant—I might add that, where an exemption is granted, the minister formally records and reports the exemption to parliament.
Senator RONALDSON—When is that tabled?
Mr Grant—Historically it has been tabled as soon as the exemption has been granted, within a day or two.
When was this exemption letter signed? It was signed on Monday, 24 May, the day that Senate estimates started. Indeed the issue of government advertising was put across until the Thursday to enable some proper discussion of it. So on Monday this letter was signed having been told that historically, and I will read it again, ‘When an exemption has been granted, it is within a day or two that it is tabled.’
We had a ridiculous interjection from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy this afternoon when he said, ‘You didn’t ask the question’. We did not ask the question whether you were breaking the rules and whether you were trying to mislead the Senate. Sorry, next time we will ask the obvious question: were you misleading us or is there something you are not telling us? What a stupid and idiotic interjection from the minister for communications.
What is the basis on which this exemption has been given? Interestingly, and honourable senators might not be aware of this—guess what?—this independent committee had actually considered this government advertising in relation to the mining tax on 21 April before the release of the Henry review. They probably got the papers on 19 April. The cabinet group met on 20 April to tick off on this. I asked the specific question in the economics committee: was the ICC given any indication at all that an exception might be required? The answer was no, they were not. The independent committee had had this since, at the minimum, 21 April. Henry was released on 2 May. The letter was written by the Treasurer to get exemption on 10 May.
What was the urgent or compelling reason for this? Two advertisements in the West Australian on the Friday and Saturday saying no more and no less than the mining industry was paying its fair share of tax. That was the basis on which this was done. It was done on the basis that they hit the panic button in relation to this tax. They realised that they had made a dreadful mistake and they wanted to get in early. They have breached their own rules and I will refer to the Treasurer’s letter to Minister Ludwig which is quite remarkable. It says:
… the benefit of the exemption from the guidelines will be to ensure that advertising is able to go to air much more quickly—
Much more quickly, okay—
This means issues and misinformation currently being aired in the media can be addressed …
Two advertisements.
—Entirely accurate.
—Two entirely accurate advertisements in relation to this big new tax on mining—that was the sole airing of concern in relation to this matter in a public sense. This is a complete and utter stitch up and this is absolutely indicative of a government that has lost the right to govern.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-06-15,"—I rise to also take note of ministerial statement. I support Senator Ronaldson in his comments and will focus my comments on yet another disgraceful display in relation to rules on advertising that are being flouted. This refers to the false and deceptive advertising in relation to the health reform or the grand health plan. What I would like to do is take the Senate through some very pertinent points that have been raised in relation to this through estimates—most importantly on the parameters of the authorisation for this campaign. It does not appear that the campaign that is currently being run actually meets the guidelines that were approved by the ICC. So, Senator Ronaldson, what happens is that, even when the ICC gets involved and gives approval, this government is not even capable of following the guidelines to the letter.
Let me show you why. In relation to the health reform, let me take the Senate back. At estimates we were told that there was a series of meetings that occurred before COAG. Ministerial approval was given on 19 March to develop an advertising campaign. On that same day, four agencies were invited to tender. Indeed, in only 11 days an agency was appointed. How can you go through a process of appointing an agency within 11 days if you are going to follow even your own rules? This was the evidence that was given by Ms Palmer in community affairs estimates on 2 June. There was a process where they engaged a research company, focus groups were run, benchmark researching was undertaken and—voila!—after 11 days we suddenly got an agency appointed.
Then, of course, the minister decides to get approval, so then you have this process where they do go to the ICC. In the middle of all this, COAG happens, which completely reverses and changes the Prime Minister’s original plans, which he had outlined at the National Press Club, where he told everybody:
For the first time, Local Hospitals Networks, run by local health, financial and managerial professionals, rather than state or, for that matter, federal bureaucrats, will be put in charge of running the hospital system.
That was the grand plan and the grand promise: that these local hospital networks would be run locally and funded federally. But, of course, that bears absolutely no resemblance to the agreement that was finally set out with the states.
So what do we have? We have the correspondence in which approval was given to this campaign by the Independent Communications Committee. They refer to five meetings. The department was told that it needed to check that the inconsistency in the website on which it was called to action in the materials has been fixed. I do not know what that is about. But, interestingly enough, this campaign was approved with no materials reviewed: no television commercial, no radio advertisement, no print advertisement and no digital advertisement. Why was none reviewed? Because the attachment to that letter says: ‘Final campaign advertising material reviewed: none. Not applicable.’ So this ICC approved a campaign without even looking at this material. It is absolutely appalling.
Then, of course, suddenly approval is given. It is little wonder that there is absolutely no scrutiny, because the other appalling part of all this is that Jane Halton, the secretary of the department, signed off and certified on behalf of the government for this campaign. This is supposed to be advertising for the implementation of a cabinet decision ‘which is intended to be implemented during the current parliament’. But, of course, we know that this has not been approved by cabinet. Despite my questioning of the department, they were not able to tell me who finally approved this. Indeed, Ms Palmer told me that it was by ministerial approval; it was not by cabinet approval. Therefore, how can you certify that this is a campaign where there has been a cabinet decision which is intended to be implemented during the current parliament? During the current parliament, for goodness sake! The legislation has not even come here and they are talking about spending money for something that has not even been implemented yet. But, of course, the Australian Financial Review of 9 June tells us that the hospital and health package is another one of those kitchen cabinet decisions by Mr Tanner, Mr Swan, Ms Gillard and the Prime Minister. So I do not understand. I would like clarification as to why this document was certified when there does not appear to be a cabinet decision.
Indeed, it specifies in this document that the campaign materials that have been presented are fact and those facts are accurate and verifiable. Of course they are not accurate. In fact, our two-day hearing on health reform shows just how inaccurate and deceptive this whole campaign is. Indeed, so much evidence was given during the inquiry which goes to show that this agreement, which was entered into by the Commonwealth with the states after this campaign appears to have been approved, basically says that the local hospital networks will be appointed by the states and that the premise is that the doctors in these local hospital networks will come from areas ‘external to the local hospital network wherever practical’. So all this drivel that exists in these advertisements that talk about it being ‘run locally’ is absolutely deceptive and misleading, using taxpayers’ money for what was supposed to be a campaign about fact. I call on the government to withdraw these ads and tell the Australian people what the facts really are. The facts are that this network will not be run locally. It is in black and white in this agreement that the doctors in these local hospital networks will not come from that local area. You cannot get more deceptive than that.
Then they talk about there being more aged-care beds. They are raiding the budget. They are raiding $276 million from the aged-care budget destined for residential high-care beds, shunting it off to failed state and territory hospitals so that we can keep people who should be in aged-care facilities in hospitals longer. In 2007, this government promised a new direction for frail and aged Australians. ‘We are going to get them out of hospital and into aged-care facilities.’ They are doing the exact opposite. They are keeping 2,000 more in hospitals. In any given night in this country there are 3,000 people who should be better cared for in aged-care facilities but who are in our hospitals. This government is breaking another promise. It promised to help our frail and aged and make the transition out of hospital into aged care better. Instead they are doing the direct opposite, just like they are deceiving the Australian public in relation to these advertisements.
I call for some facts in relation to this misleading and deceptive advertising. Even when they get approval through the ICC they cannot even follow the guidelines. The guidelines and the certifications are not even worth the paper they are written on, because they too do not follow the ICC. And how can you approve a campaign when you do not actually see the material? How can the ICC have approved this campaign? It is little wonder that what has come out at the other end with the ad campaigns in radio, television and print media bears no resemblance to the actual facts of what is contained in this agreement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-15,"—I will be brief in my remarks. I think it is fair to say that when the coalition was in power they spent an enormous amount of money on government advertising and they did so before legislation was actually passed. I think that was the wrong thing to do, but they did not promise to reform the system.
—At least legislation was drafted.
—I do not think that is the point. I know that in my time in state parliament there was concern expressed in broad terms by the then South Australian Auditor-General, Ken MacPherson, who was concerned about government advertising of a policy when the legislation was not yet passed by the parliament. I know that the constitutionality of that was dealt with in the context of the High Court’s decision in Combet v Commonwealth, when Mr Combet took on the then government about advertising with respect to the Work Choices campaign. The High Court found that, so long as there was an appropriation for that funding, it was legal, notwithstanding that the legislation had not been passed.
The difficulty for the government here is that they promised the people at the last election that they would clean this up and that they would have a new regime in place. I think it would be fair to say that the government has monumentally failed to deliver this. The new process we have seen through the ICC is, with respect, too cute by half. That is why I think there is considerable public disquiet about what the government has done. I know that Senator Ronaldson and Senator Fierravanti-Wells have outlined their concerns about this, and I share a number of those concerns. This is not the right way to go about things. The rules have been changed by taking this away from the Auditor-General as the independent watchdog to deal with these matters, and I think there are very real concerns about that.
I believe that the government has fundamentally done the wrong thing here. What they have done is try to cloak this in process, to say that they have somehow managed to fix this problem up with process, but the government has been too cute by half by doing so. My concern is that we do not have a system in place that is robust, accountable and transparent in dealing with government advertising. I think the government’s argument is, ‘We’re spending less than the last mob,’ to put it colloquially, but the fact is that this government came to power on the basis that they would fix this up and what they have done is the opposite. That is why they are taking public opprobrium; they have fundamentally done the wrong thing. They have done the wrong thing by taxpayers. What we are seeing is a cheap way of doing the party’s ads using taxpayer funds, and that is fundamentally wrong. It is an even more serious issue when you consider that this legislation has not even passed the parliament. We have not even seen the drafting of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-06-15,"—I also rise to contribute to the debate on the ministerial statement. Not only is that money being wasted on advertising for the great big new tax on mining, not only has it been wasted on the so-called ‘health reforms’—if ever there were something wrongly labelled, it was the so-called ‘health reforms’—but we have also found out today that the government is going to spend another $16 million of taxpayers’ money in Labor Party advertisements supporting their failed and continually failing national broadband proposal. It is incredible that this government, which labelled that sort of advertising as—what was it?—a ‘cancer on democracy’ is now, in three short weeks, spending over $50 million of taxpayers’ money on what are effectively campaign advertisements for the Australian Labor Party in advance of the election which will be coming up some time in August or September.
On the weekend up in North Queensland a bloke came up to me and said, ‘I am a member of a union. I get very, very angry when the union uses my union fees—the fees I pay to the unions to look after my workplace arrangements—to campaign for the Australian Labor Party. I do not have much choice about it. I pay my fees and the money goes in campaigning for the ALP. That is bad enough, but what happens now is as a taxpayer I am also funding the ALP’s election advertising in the form of this advertising for the great big new tax on mining, the so-called health reforms and the broadband.’
Everyone is at times accused of doing this, as Senator Xenophon said. I do not necessarily agree with Senator Xenophon that the previous government did that, but where I do agree with Senator Xenophon is that Mr Rudd made a virtue out of indicating that he would not be embarking upon this sort of conduct. It is the same with everything Mr Rudd has touched. Before the election were all the promises, all the pious pronouncements, all the blah, blah, blah; but when in power as a government in some political difficulty, Mr Rudd pays no regard at all to the promises he made and the rules he said he would make. This whole series shows a government in trouble. It is the sort of action that totalitarian governments take when they are in real trouble. Governments that cannot make it on their own but think they can dip their hands into the taxpayers’ money to advertise for their political party are the sort of thing we do not expect in Australia. Totalitarian regimes around the world have been doing this for years. To me it is a regret that our own Australian government is now following the lead of those totalitarian regimes.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-15,"—This issue is an absolute disgrace. The Prime Minister of Australia said that he would stop the rorts that happened with political advertising and advertising around election times and yet here is the Prime Minister with his hand in the cookie jar spending taxpayers’ money on propaganda for the Rudd government. It is wrong and the Prime Minister should not be allowed to get away with it. Here he is exempting the ads for the Rudd government from the guidelines that he set up.
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot go to the Australian public and say, ‘I am going to put a stop to the rort of using taxpayers’ money on advertising for the government of the day.’ It is wrong, and if the Labor Party want to continue down this track of advertising a mining tax they should do it out of their own expenditure—Labor Party money—and not at the taxpayers’ expense. I hope that with the budget this chamber can move a request that means that no taxpayers’ money will be spent on the mining tax, the RSPT. This is clearly a breach of their own guidelines and it is wrong. They cannot have it both ways. The Prime Minister has to be held to account and the Senate should do that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the Senate take note of the report.
The fourth interim report of the Select Committee on the National Broadband Network was tabled out of session and today marks the first day that we are able to comment on that report. As chairman of the committee, first of all I pay regard and express thanks to the committee secretariat for the work it did to produce the report, particularly Mr Stephen Palethorpe who was the secretary during the time of this fourth report, and Ms Fiona Roughley who was a member of the committee. We were particularly fortunate to have Ms Roughley on this secretariat. She is a very talented lawyer and her expertise in the communications area was particularly valuable to the committee. I also want to thank officers of the Parliamentary Library and all the Hansard operators who travelled around the country to support the work of the committee in delivering this report.
The committee looked at a number of issues in this fourth interim report. The committee has been going for quite some time. One of the reasons is that the government keeps changing its mind on the National Broadband Network. Quite clearly the government and the minister had little comprehension of broadcasting, broadband, communications and telecommunications issues, and they have been bumbling through it since they first became the government.
The committee started work looking at iteration 1 of the National Broadband Network. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the government found that their initial proposal was as stupid as we all told them it would be. After spending some $20 million on a request for tender process they just cancelled it and started again. Twenty million dollars—the words just flow off my tongue. That is $20 million of taxpayers’ money just wasted, just thrown away. We have just been talking about the money wasted on Labor Party advertisements that the taxpayers are paying for. Money means nothing to the Labor Party. Most of them, with respect—they are all lovely people, I have to say—have not had any experience in business in their life. Very few of them have ever worked for themselves or in an area where, if you do not get out and do the work, you do not get paid at the end of the week. Most of them have worked for the unions or for the Labor Party or as staffers for some other politician and they just do not understand the value of money. Sure, go ahead, spend $20 million on a system and then just throw it away. That is why this committee has now issued four interim reports—because the government keeps changing its mind or it cannot come to a conclusion or it brings in legislation that is clearly unworkable and wants to get some help in finding out what is correct.
The committee, in its fourth interim report—and what we thought would be the last—looked at things like the implementation study, which, at the time the hearings were held, had not been released publicly. The committee made some comments about the fact that the government had had the implementation study for more than three months but would not release it to the parliament and to the public. The government paid $25 million of taxpayers’ money to get the implementation study done, but when it was given to them they would not make it available to the people who paid for it—the taxpayers of Australia. The committee had a bit of a look at that. We looked at the exposure draft and made some comments. We looked at the business progress. We looked at some progress on wireless and satellite. We also looked at Tasmania.
We think that the implementation study was done very well by McKinsey-KPMG. It should have been done well—after all, we paid them $25 million for it. I think it was probably worth that money. It should have been made available to everybody, not just to the government. Despite repeated calls for the release of that report, it was not released until 6 May 2010, having been handed to the government several months before that. The implementation study itself made it very clear. The implementation study says that it does not:
Evaluate Government’s policy objectives;
Evaluate the decision to implement the NBN via the establishment of NBN Co;
and, most importantly:
Undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the macro-economic and social benefits that would result from the implementation of a superfast broadband network.
Because the implementation study did not evaluate the merit of the government’s policy objective—because they were told not to—it provides no analysis of whether the NBN is good policy for Australia. It simply does not address the fact of whether or not the NBN should even proceed. The implementation study made it clear it was not a cost-benefit analysis. For all of those reasons and several others, the committee’s first recommendation was that the government should abandon the National Broadband Network project.
The committee made several other recommendations to try to assist the government if they were pig-headed enough to go ahead with a scheme which I think everybody accepts will not be a commercial operation. This report of the committee looked very carefully at a lot of the issues. Mr Rudd’s original comments were that this was going to be done in partnership with private enterprise, that there would be private equity and private involvement in the NBN network. Even McKinsey-KPMG acknowledged in the end result that, if it is ever privatised, it will be well down the track—10, 15, even 30 years down the track.
In the couple of minutes left to me tonight I want to highlight that, in speaking to NBN Co. and NBN Co. Tasmania in the last couple of months, the committee kept saying to them, ‘Are you going to start in Tasmania on 1 July?’ ‘Yes, we are.’ ‘Tell us what you are doing. Tell us what prices you are going to charge.’ How can anyone possibly sign up when we do not know what the price is going to be? I only mention this today because Senator Conroy was prattling on about this in question time. Good luck to the Tasmanians—I hope they get something out of it; it should be good for them. We found out at estimates that NBN Co., this commercial operation that Mr Rudd said was going to make a profit, is giving the NBN network to the three retail service providers. The three retail service providers are all doing a great job competing but they do not have to bother in their costings for what they are paying the NBN Co., who is providing the network for them. It is incredible. In estimates we were told that all that the people who were signing up would have to pay is $300 to get the box in. But that is not a payment to NBN Co. for what has been provided by the taxpayers at the cost of millions and millions of dollars. They are getting that all free. Why wouldn’t someone sign up to this in Tasmania when you are getting it for free? I think, as a colleague of mine from Tasmania pointed out, they are connecting up as they go past or they are being connected as they go past, but that does not mean to say they are actually going to buy the service. Senator Conroy’s statistics, as always, are completely dodgy and bodgy, and I think his efforts in question time today demonstrate that.
How can we treat the government with any credibility at all when they keep telling us how successful this is in Tasmania but they are not going to charge the RSPs for the provision of the network? Again, it has all the hallmarks of a third-rate government in trouble, thinking they are living in a third-rate country with a third-rate political and legal system. I think Mr Rudd is about to find out that Australia is not like that. In Australia we expect things to be done properly and we expect them to be done in a way that does not cost the taxpayers money. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

After spending some $20 million on a request for tender process they just cancelled it and started again. Twenty million dollars—the words just flow off my tongue. That is $20 million of taxpayers’ money just wasted, just thrown away. We have just been talking about the money wasted on Labor Party advertisements that the taxpayers are paying for. Money means nothing to the Labor Party. Most of them, with respect—they are all lovely people, I have to say—have not had any experience in business in their life. Very few of them have ever worked for themselves or in an area where, if you do not get out and do the work, you do not get paid at the end of the week. Most of them have worked for the unions or for the Labor Party or as staffers for some other politician and they just do not understand the value of money. Sure, go ahead, spend $20 million on a system and then just throw it away. That is why this committee has now issued four interim reports—because the government keeps changing its mind or it cannot come to a conclusion or it brings in legislation that is clearly unworkable and wants to get some help in finding out what is correct.
The committee, in its fourth interim report—and what we thought would be the last—looked at things like the implementation study, which, at the time the hearings were held, had not been released publicly. The committee made some comments about the fact that the government had had the implementation study for more than three months but would not release it to the parliament and to the public. The government paid $25 million of taxpayers’ money to get the implementation study done, but when it was given to them they would not make it available to the people who paid for it—the taxpayers of Australia. The committee had a bit of a look at that. We looked at the exposure draft and made some comments. We looked at the business progress. We looked at some progress on wireless and satellite. We also looked at Tasmania.
We think that the implementation study was done very well by McKinsey-KPMG. It should have been done well—after all, we paid them $25 million for it. I think it was probably worth that money. It should have been made available to everybody, not just to the government. Despite repeated calls for the release of that report, it was not released until 6 May 2010, having been handed to the government several months before that. The implementation study itself made it very clear. The implementation study says that it does not:
Evaluate Government’s policy objectives;
Evaluate the decision to implement the NBN via the establishment of NBN Co;
and, most importantly:
Undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the macro-economic and social benefits that would result from the implementation of a superfast broadband network.
Because the implementation study did not evaluate the merit of the government’s policy objective—because they were told not to—it provides no analysis of whether the NBN is good policy for Australia. It simply does not address the fact of whether or not the NBN should even proceed. The implementation study made it clear it was not a cost-benefit analysis. For all of those reasons and several others, the committee’s first recommendation was that the government should abandon the National Broadband Network project.
The committee made several other recommendations to try to assist the government if they were pig-headed enough to go ahead with a scheme which I think everybody accepts will not be a commercial operation. This report of the committee looked very carefully at a lot of the issues. Mr Rudd’s original comments were that this was going to be done in partnership with private enterprise, that there would be private equity and private involvement in the NBN network. Even McKinsey-KPMG acknowledged in the end result that, if it is ever privatised, it will be well down the track—10, 15, even 30 years down the track.
In the couple of minutes left to me tonight I want to highlight that, in speaking to NBN Co. and NBN Co. Tasmania in the last couple of months, the committee kept saying to them, ‘Are you going to start in Tasmania on 1 July?’ ‘Yes, we are.’ ‘Tell us what you are doing. Tell us what prices you are going to charge.’ How can anyone possibly sign up when we do not know what the price is going to be? I only mention this today because Senator Conroy was prattling on about this in question time. Good luck to the Tasmanians—I hope they get something out of it; it should be good for them. We found out at estimates that NBN Co., this commercial operation that Mr Rudd said was going to make a profit, is giving the NBN network to the three retail service providers. The three retail service providers are all doing a great job competing but they do not have to bother in their costings for what they are paying the NBN Co., who is providing the network for them. It is incredible. In estimates we were told that all that the people who were signing up would have to pay is $300 to get the box in. But that is not a payment to NBN Co. for what has been provided by the taxpayers at the cost of millions and millions of dollars. They are getting that all free. Why wouldn’t someone sign up to this in Tasmania when you are getting it for free? I think, as a colleague of mine from Tasmania pointed out, they are connecting up as they go past or they are being connected as they go past, but that does not mean to say they are actually going to buy the service. Senator Conroy’s statistics, as always, are completely dodgy and bodgy, and I think his efforts in question time today demonstrate that.
How can we treat the government with any credibility at all when they keep telling us how successful this is in Tasmania but they are not going to charge the RSPs for the provision of the network? Again, it has all the hallmarks of a third-rate government in trouble, thinking they are living in a third-rate country with a third-rate political and legal system. I think Mr Rudd is about to find out that Australia is not like that. In Australia we expect things to be done properly and we expect them to be done in a way that does not cost the taxpayers money.

I will be brief in my remarks, given the time and the time constraints in relation to this, but I want to make it clear that there is one aspect of this report that needs to be clarified. My colleagues know that this relates to a bill that I introduced in relation, effectively, to creeping acquisitions.
There is one aspect of this report that needs to be clarified. During the inquiry, Associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the University of New South Wales gave evidence that the ACCC approves around 97 per cent of mergers that the ACCC considers. This figure was calculated from information provided in the ACCC’s annual reports. Associate Professor Zumbo’s reference to this 97 per cent is factually correct and an accurate representation of the ACCC’s own statistics. I direct my colleagues to consider how the ACCC has looked at these figures.
The suggestion that this claim is misleading needs to be taken in the context of the ACCC’s report, and I think it is important that the record reflects that Professor Zumbo provided the information that he did and the evidence that he did, based on the ACCC’s report. I do not believe that it is a fair characterisation to say that it is misleading, in the circumstances. I think that ought to be acknowledged. I think we should also acknowledge the enormous amount of work that Professor Zumbo does in terms of advancing the debate on competition law in this country.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-06-15,"—Just picking up where I left off before question time, allowing the government to drop small business right into paid parental leave obligations and duties simply sets up the machinery to fit up small business to pay the cost of fixing the shortcomings of Labor’s flawed scheme. While not impeding the introduction of the government’s scheme, the coalition will move substantive amendments to extend the role of the Family Assistance Office in administering the scheme indefinitely. I acknowledge here the ceaseless advocacy in this area by Mr Billson, the shadow minister for small business, and also the small business champion in this chamber, Senator Boswell. This measure will make ongoing use of the taxpayer investment in the establishment of the necessary payment and operating systems beyond the initial six months. The government is urged to embrace the coalition’s amendment to avoid the imposition of unnecessary and unjustified cost, regulatory burden and compliance risks to the small business community.
Labor’s second-rate scheme does not sufficiently recognise that parents have different patterns of family responsibilities and paid work. It fails to recognise the current economic circumstances Australian families are facing, from increasing interest rates to the housing affordability crisis to increased costs of living and the proposal of another great big new tax on everything. More and more families are now requiring two incomes just to make ends meet. In Australia today parental leave is available to parents through both private enterprise and the Public Service. Conditions such as the length of the scheme vary from very short periods to 18 weeks, yet few schemes provide the ideal leave period of six months. Mums working casual jobs who do not have accrued leave will lose out under the government’s scheme. Labor’s 18-week scheme was recommended by the Productivity Commission as a result of an expectation that an employer would effectively provide a top-up to the leave to reach 26 weeks, thus delivering the internationally recognised standard of six months. But of course casual workers will not have accrued leave and therefore it is unlikely that they would get the top-up.
The coalition has put forward its proposed scheme, which is in stark contrast to the Labor second-rate scheme. The coalition’s scheme is a wage replacement scheme that would provide primary carers, predominantly mothers, with 26 weeks paid parental leave at full replacement pay up to a maximum salary of $150,000 per annum or the federal minimum wage, whichever is greater. The coalition scheme would be available to all employees including full-time, part-time and casual workers, contractors and the self-employed who meet the eligibility test. It would include superannuation contributions at the mandatory rate of nine per cent and it would facilitate an easier transition in and out of the workforce for Australian women during their childbearing years. It would signal to the community that taking time out of the workforce to care for children is a normal part of the work-life cycle for parents. The coalition scheme would promote an increased female workforce participation, leading to productivity gains as it would create a financial incentive for women to be engaged in paid work prior to childbirth and to return to the workforce after their period of leave. The coalition scheme would provide paid parental leave for a period of 26 weeks to afford all mothers the opportunity to breastfeed their infant for the minimum six-month period recommended by the World Health Organisation. Labor’s scheme does not. The coalition scheme would provide women with a replacement wage to a cap or minimum wage, whichever is greater, to adequately support working families when they are at their most financially vulnerable. Again, Labor’s scheme does not.
The scheme Labor is proposing also fails to ensure that all Australian families, regardless of whether a mother is at home or in the paid workforce, are afforded the flexibility to choose what is right for their specific individual family circumstances.. Labor’s scheme is far from perfect but ultimately on balance having a second-rate scheme is better than not having a scheme at all. The coalition has a second reading amendment that further details our concerns with this legislation and our alternative approach. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
affirms its commitment to supporting all Australian families and supports policies which give choice and flexibility to parents to enable them to choose what is right for their individual circumstances, whether they are at home or in the paid workforce;
recognises that parents have different patterns of family responsibilities and paid work over their life cycle;
recognises that due to rising costs of living and a housing affordability crisis, the majority of families require two incomes to make ends meet;
notes that Australia remains only one of two OECD countries that does not provide a paid parental leave scheme and that introducing a paid parental scheme is critical to the needs of working families and our national productivity more broadly;
rejects the Government’s representation of a paid parental leave scheme as a social security measure and instead affirms that it is a valid workplace entitlement that must come with a superannuation component to arrest the gross inadequacy of female retirement incomes;
notes the Government’s proposed paid parental leave scheme is inadequate in its current form and should be amended to better reflect the requirements of Australian working mothers, and families more generally;
supports the ability of casual, part-time and full-time women to access
paid parental leave provided that they have met the qualifying criteria;
recognises that a paid parental leave scheme is only one part of government’s important role in supporting families as they raise the next generation of Australians;
acknowledges that the bill does not:
provide paid parental leave for a period of 26 weeks to afford all mothers the opportunity to breastfeed their infant for the minimum six month period recommended by the World Health Organisation, or
provide women with a replacement wage, to a cap or minimum wage (whichever is greater), and so does not adequately support working families when they are at their most financially vulnerable;
acknowledges that the bill places a totally unnecessary impost on Australian businesses by requiring employers to act as paymasters for eligible employees; and
calls on the Government to make such amendments to the bill as would rectify these flaws”.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-06-15,"—I rise to add my contribution to the debate on the government’s Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. This is a historic day in this chamber: all three of the major players in this place are committed to some form of paid parental leave and are also committed to seeing that some scheme is up and running by the end of this year. I say this, however, with some disappointment that the legislation as it is before us does not provide enough support for parents and is not the best possible scheme that, if we had been able to work together, we would have been able to put in place from the word go.
While I have stated on the record before that the Greens will not be blocking the government’s attempt to introduce a statutory paid parental leave scheme, it is incredibly disheartening that this legislation is anything but a true reflection of what paid parental leave should be—that is, of course, a workplace entitlement. I am not the first person to voice concern over the direction the government has taken with its paid parental leave scheme and, sadly, I do not think that I will be the last. For more than three decades, men and women around this country have been lobbying governments of all persuasions to provide a paid parental leave scheme as a basic workplace entitlement, and I must say that the recent debate around this particular issue has been an interesting one.
Arguments such as, ‘This legislation is only a starting point and we can lobby the government to improve it once it becomes law’ have perplexed me, because we have waited 30 years already. It is 30 years since the unpaid provisions were given as entitlements to women for maternity leave. Thirty years on, we are now talking about the need for the true support of providing a paid parental leave scheme. I would hate to think that we would have to wait another 30 years in order to improve it when we could be doing that right here today in this place. We now have commitment from all sides that a government funded paid parental leave scheme is something that this parliament must deliver. It is surely the best opportunity that we have had, with all sides now saying that this is something that we should do and that this is something that we are committed to. Well, let us deliver it.
We should be able to improve and fix some of the most fundamental flaws within this legislation so that when it does pass we will be able to say that we did our very best to provide a good scheme. Of course this can be built upon in the future, but let us use the opportunity we have today to make sure that we get the best legislation that we can now. Why, after decades of inaction, would mums and dads out there not want us to come together and ensure that we get the best possible scheme in place simply because the Prime Minister has said today that the Senate should just get out of the way? Frankly, the Senate should not just get out of the way. The Senate is here to work with the government of the day to ensure that we improve pieces of legislation and that we make sure that any law enacted is in the best interests of all Australians. And, as the Senate committee process has shown, there are flaws in this legislation that must be fixed.
While I will come to some of the major concerns over the implications of this legislation in a few moments, one thing I would like state upfront is that 18 weeks is simply not enough. It is not enough when you compare it to international standards and it is not enough for all of those people and organisations, trade unions included, who have been fighting for this for decades. Eighteen weeks is nowhere near where comparable countries are at, when you consider that Sweden offers 47 weeks, New Zealand offers 28 weeks, Finland offers 32 weeks and even the UK offers 39 weeks. The fact is that Australia is still behind the eight ball, as we are not only introducing a scheme only now but introducing a scheme that is far behind those of our international counterparts and is not giving that basic support that families deserve.
The Greens have not been a lone voice in our push for six months paid parental leave. We believe that six months should be the minimum. It is the minimum set down by the World Health Organisation. There is strong support throughout the community for the introduction of a 26-week, six-month scheme. The National Foundation for Australian Women, Save the Children, the YWCA, the Commission for Children and Young People, the World Health Organisation, the Public Health Association, the Australian Breastfeeding Association, Unions NSW and the Community and Public Sector Union are all advocates for a six-month, government funded, paid parental leave scheme—and that is what we should be passing here this week in this place.
Given that women around Australia have been fighting for paid parental leave to be enshrined as a workplace entitlement for decades, this hard work must not be in vain when it comes to ensuring that the best possible support is provided for Australian mums and dads. Let us not use this as an opportunity to simply whack each other over the head politically. Let us use this as an opportunity to work together and get the best possible scheme. It is simply a cop-out for anybody to suggest that the will is not here, because the will certainly is here in this place, and that is what I think is so exciting about this debate tonight. It is also such an opportunity that we should be taking it with both hands and using it rather than squandering it simply because the Prime Minister’s comments this morning reflected that the Senate should simply roll over and not do its job.
I am sure that many in this chamber recognise that the idea of paid parental leave is not a new concept in this place. My South Australian colleague former Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, a staunch advocate on this issue, introduced Australia’s first paid maternity leave scheme back in 2002, and I introduced the first paid parental leave scheme last year. It was a 26-week, six-month scheme plus superannuation at the minimum wage. That was the best compromise that I could come up with then and it is the best compromise that I believe we could come up with here in this place this week to ensure that parents get the support they need, that we enshrine this as a workplace entitlement and that we give the support that new mums and dads should be entitled to, of course ensuring that women have a connection to the workforce and are not discriminated against or disadvantaged simply because they have ovaries yet are also workers. Let us ensure that the legislation that we pass here this week is one that offers six months leave plus superannuation and that it is a workplace entitlement.
Both of the pieces of legislation that have been before this place already, introduced by Natasha Stott Despoja and by the Greens—with the third being the government’s—recognised that taking time off from work to have a baby should be seen as a basic workplace entitlement and that, just as when on long service leave or sick leave, employees should continue to accumulate superannuation payments. That is a stark difference between the two previous bills introduced into this chamber and the government’s scheme as laid before us today—superannuation is not included in it. Surely, after all the independent studies, Senate inquiries and the recent Productivity Commission report into the feasibility of implementing a paid parental leave scheme, there is enough evidence out there supporting paid parental leave enshrined as a workplace entitlement rather than simply being a welfare handout. That is type of scheme that we should deliver.
Unfortunately, despite all the rhetoric from the government about supporting women to maintain their connection with the workforce and boost workforce participation—the exact words used by the government—this piece of legislation fails to accurately provide any entitlement to take leave and is a slap in the face for all those who have been advocating for a paid parental leave scheme to be viewed as a workplace entitlement. You can say it as much as you want. The reality is that this stand-alone bill does not provide a leave entitlement. It does not amend the Fair Work Act. It is not a workplace entitlement. Only in name is it a paid parental leave scheme not in reality.
This is the first fundamental flaw within this bill and the fact that it is not a paid parental leave scheme in the true sense of the term is concerning. Regardless of the spin, regardless of the fact that we want something through and we want to provide support to parents, it is very difficult to see how this scheme will be expanded or improved upon if we do not get the fundamentals right at the beginning.
Nowhere in this bill does it guarantee an eligible employee an entitlement to take leave, or the guarantee to even get their job back at the end of that leave period. Although the government may be spruiking this legislation as a historic recognition of the importance of maintaining women’s workplace attachment—an important aspect to any genuine paid parental leave scheme, and one of the key reasons advocates around the country have fought so long for some type of scheme—we know that this particular bill is nothing more than a dressed up version of the baby bonus.
This was my concern from the start. I said it 12 months ago when the government first announced this scheme and, unfortunately, it still stands. A true paid parental leave scheme would have been administered through the Fair Work Act, not simply through the Family Assistance Office. What I cannot work out is this: if unpaid parental leave provisions are contained within the Fair Work Act and if this Labor government truly recognises paid parental leave as a workplace entitlement, why would you create an entirely new act to contain only pay provisions and not leave provisions? This concern was articulated by Professor Andrew Stewart during the course of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. He said:
I think there is no question; it is a social security entitlement. In fact it would be better titled the ‘parental leave pay bill’ rather than ‘paid parental leave’. That may seem a matter of semantics but I think it is fair to say that most people in the community would understand the concept of paid leave to mean you have a right to leave your job and come back to it.
This flaw still remains within this piece of legislation, which is why it is important that the Senate is able to fix it and amend it. It is important for the government to accept that as well, and important for the opposition to accept that. It is all very well and good to have the opposition say, ‘When Tony Abbott gets elected’—if he does and they are in government. It is all very well and good for them to say, ‘When we are in government we will put in a bigger, better scheme.’ The reality is that here tonight we have the Labor Party, the coalition and the Greens all saying: ‘We want paid parental leave. We want a good scheme. Let’s get it up.’ The opposition should be supporting our amendments to ensure that it becomes a leave entitlement and a six-month scheme, including superannuation—as of course should the government. If that is a scheme that the opposition wants then it should be supporting the amendments that we have circulated.
The issue of leave entitlement is just one of the many problems that the government has created for itself by drafting this bill. It fails to take into account the key concept of any paid parental leave scheme. The fact is that the legislation before us is nothing more than a parental payment. As to the credence of the argument that it discriminates against stay-at-home mums: what a ludicrous argument that somehow stay-at-home mums should get a workplace entitlement. Of course they should not. If they are not at work then they do not get the entitlement. They get another form of support. And that of course is through the baby bonus. But because the government has drafted this so poorly and not ensured that this is a workplace entitlement, it leaves that door open for criticism from those people who do not want to accept that women need to be supported—working women in particular—and not be discriminated or disadvantaged simply because they are in the workforce and are the people who have babies. They need that time off; they need to recover from childbirth and spend time with their newborns recovering and bonding. That is why a paid parental leave scheme that is a workplace entitlement is so important. There are other ways that we can support stay-at-home mums. There is the baby bonus—the system that we have. Maybe some things need to be fixed with that, but this is not the place to talk about that. This bill is meant to be about a workplace entitlement. The problem for the government is that, actually, it is not. That is why there is this criticism.
Another concern that was raised throughout the committee process was how this proposed scheme would interact with existing entitlements that an employee might already have. A number of witnesses expressed concern that the bill in its current form does not explicitly state that the government’s paid parental leave payment is an addition to any existing employer funded scheme. The government are saying: ‘This is a top-up scheme. We know it is not enough. We know it is only 18 weeks. We know it is only at the minimum wage for 18 weeks. We know it does not include superannuation. But it is all going to be okay because this is on top of what other scheme you may be entitled to.’ But it does not say that in this piece of legislation. It does not say that at all and that needs to be addressed.
Again, it is important for the Senate to work through these issues, fix the legislation and ensure that these issues are dealt with. The fact that Minister Macklin’s second reading speech said that she believed that this would be seen as a top-up, yet it is not in the legislation, indicates that it was an oversight or that the government does not want to see that in legislation. Either way, it will be interesting to see how the government responds to our amendments to ensure that this is seen and acknowledged as an addition to existing payments and not one that replaces or is simply absorbed by existing schemes.
Another ramification of not ensuring that paid parental leave is a basic workplace entitlement is that it would fail to ensure that, just like with long service leave or sick leave, employees would continue to accumulate superannuation payments. This is a really important aspect of any workplace entitlement and a really important aspect of dealing with the retirement income gap between men and women. We know that one of the biggest factors contributing to that gap is women taking time out from the workforce to have babies and raise their kids; and, in order to address that, any type of paid parental leave scheme should include superannuation. There is clear evidence that women struggle to ensure sufficient superannuation for their retirement, and this would be a clear, simple, good place to try to address that.
This comes from a government who have said that they are committed to better superannuation savings and a stronger culture towards supporting superannuation. Let us see that work for mums as well as for everybody else; because, under this scheme, it is not included. Superannuation must be included in any type of paid parental leave scheme. It should not be the case that superannuation is good for everyone else—but bad luck if you are a mum.
The Greens will be seeking to remedy this situation in the committee stage. We have an amendment relating to superannuation entitlements and requiring that superannuation is paid. While I do not necessarily expect the government to support that amendment—they clearly could have put it into their own legislation—I do expect that the opposition, who have said that they support superannuation, will support this amendment. Not only do I think that women should not wait another 30 years for an increased and better scheme; I also do not think we should wait for never-never when Tony Abbott is possibly one day elected as Prime Minister. We have the opportunity today to make this scheme a better one. Let’s make it happen. I say to the opposition: if you believe that superannuation should be included, make sure you back the Greens amendment. I would, of course, like the government to do the same. If their rhetoric is anything to go by, there is no reason why they would not back it.
On a final point, we need a review into this legislation. Whatever form it is in when it eventually passes, it needs to be subject to a review. We need to be able to analyse what impact it has on families, what impact it has on existing entitlements in workplaces and what impact it has on the retirement savings of individuals. While the government have said that they expect to run a review within two years of the scheme being up and running, let’s see that legislated for. Based on the past promises of this government, I am not prepared to take what the minister has said as gospel. If we are fair dinkum about making sure we have a good scheme, and if we are fair dinkum about making sure that we can improve it, then we need to know where we can do that and where the pros and the cons in the scheme are so that we can tweak it. That means that a review must be part of the legislation that we pass; so, of course, the Greens will be moving amendments to that as well.
In conclusion, I want to reiterate the Greens’ utmost support for a paid parental leave scheme that offers support to working families and to mums around the country who have waited too long. For those who, 30 years ago, fought for paid maternity leave provisions, to now see their daughters and their granddaughters being able to take advantage of a scheme like this would be such a wonderful thing. But let us make sure we use the best opportunity that we have before us to make sure that it is a scheme that is worth it and that we are not waiting another 30 years to try and fix it. Let us get it in place now and let us ensure that it is the best possible scheme it can be and use the opportunity of tripartisan support.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-06-15,"—The Rudd government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme is a historic reform for Australia and it demonstrates Labor’s ongoing commitment to supporting working families. As I go along, I will deal with some of the relatively glib criticisms that have been raised to date in this debate, and in the public debate as well, but we need to paint some background history to these proposals.
The government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme was announced in last year’s budget and is fully costed and fully funded into the future—unlike the opposition’s plan, which has no detail, no costings and no time frame. It was cheap politicking by a new opposition leader. The government’s scheme is based on recommendations from the Productivity Commission, which undertook an extensive, year-long inquiry to get the scheme right. Compare this with Mr Abbott’s thought bubble, which has created massive uncertainty for Australian families and businesses—more evidence of him talking first and thinking later, as the opposition’s scheme has evolved.
The government had extensive discussions with employers, unions and family groups about the implementation of this significant reform. The Productivity Commission found that Labor’s scheme would increase the amount of time new parents would have to spend at home with their newborn baby—around six months of exclusive parental care on top of existing entitlements. Under Labor’s Paid Parental Leave scheme, women on low incomes will have greater financial security when planning to have a baby. Around 30,000 working families with incomes less than $50,000 are expected to benefit.
The Productivity Commission found that industries which are female dominated and highly casualised, such as retail and hospitality, have the lowest levels of access to paid parental leave. In 2008, only 17 per cent of women on very low wages had access to paid parental leave, compared with 70 per cent of women on high wages, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is simply time to act. Mr Abbott’s proposal, on the other hand, is for a paid parental leave scheme funded by a great big new tax on employers. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop, has said that the great big new tax is only temporary and will be replaced by taxpayers funding their proposals.
Under Mr Abbott’s plan, people earning up to $150,000 a year will have their parental leave paid at the full rate at taxpayers’ expense. Ordinary working families getting by on one-third of that amount or less will be forced to pay more tax or higher prices to fund these higher earners. The opposition’s scheme is targeted to high-income families. It does little to help the majority of families on low to middle incomes. This is perhaps why the polls that have been taken in response to these policies show that 40 per cent of respondents still favoured Labor’s government funded scheme, compared with 24 per cent who supported the coalition’s proposal. This is where the opposition has, in my view, been playing politics with serious policy proposals. You did not see serious proposals put to the Productivity Commission by the now opposition. All we have seen is relatively glib criticisms and a limited understanding of the policy debate.
Last week I attended Diversity Council Australia’s debate on paid parental leave, which was coined ‘Not if, but how’ and explored the government and the opposition’s paid parental leave policies and what they mean for women, families, business and the Australian economy. As I described to the audience, the paid parental leave debate is not about ‘if’ or ‘how’ but ‘at last’. Finally we have action which cannot be compromised by cheap politicking or glib criticism as we have heard to date.
When I first came into parliament in 1995, the contribution I made on the Keating government’s introduction of maternity allowance comes to my mind. This allowance was designed to meet half of our international obligation towards providing minimum income support for a mother taking leave following the birth of her child. The intention of the Keating government at the time, if re-elected—which it was not—was to then fund the other half of our international obligation through about 13 to 14 weeks of minimum income support, rather than the minimum wage, for mothers taking leave around the birth of the child. Many years later, the Howard government had introduced the baby bonus, which improved the level of income support available but still did not get anywhere near meeting our international obligations.
Much of the public discussion has centred on issues such as whether stay-at-home mothers will be worse off. The government, in dealing with our amendments in relation to the legislation and the Senate committee report, will touch in part on this issue. The clear objective of this legislation is to improve the circumstances of women and their workforce engagement when they have babies. It is not a debate about women choosing to stay at home or return to work; it is about improving the outcomes for women who remain engaged with the workforce.
I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time—when I do so I will address in detail some more of those issues.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-06-15,"—I rise tonight to speak on the life and achievements of a great friend of mine, Philip Noel Eastick, who died at the Royal Adelaide Hospital on 11 February 2010. I think it was the American essayist, Ralph Emerson, who said, ‘The years teach much which the days never knew’. It is true that we learn things that only the experience of years can teach us. There are joys to be drawn from the passing of the years but there is also sadness too. Chief amongst the sadness is saying goodbye to good friends who pass away before us.
My friend, Phil Eastick, died at the relatively young age of 55. Still, in those short years Phil achieved more than many and his achievements will benefit his fellow South Australians into the future. They were achievements he was scarcely known for at the time and achievements that he did not seek to attribute to himself. My hope is that this speech this evening will place Phil’s achievements on the public record in the nation’s Hansard.
Philip Noel Eastick was born in the Hutchinson Hospital in Gawler, South Australia on 8 August 1954. Phil’s father is Dr Bruce Eastick, a veterinary surgeon who also served in the South Australian parliament for many years as the leader of the Liberal opposition. His mother was Mary Dawn Marsh. Phil attended Gawler Primary School, Gawler High School and Adelaide University, where he studied law. It was here that I first met Phil and we formed a lifelong friendship that lasted until his recent death.
It was during his time at Adelaide University that the spotlight came up on the music industry for Phil and his law studies faded to black. Phil left university before graduating—I suspect much to the distress of his parents. Phil quickly earned a reputation for hard work, initiative and for being the sort of person you could rely on to get the show on the road. His reputation led him to being engaged by many of the leading bands of the day—and you will remember some of these, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore—Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, Hush, MacKenzie Theory, the La De Das and Sebastian Hardie, to name just a few.

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—Senator Evans remembers some of them as well. His work with Jands Concert Productions and his emerging interest in big stage concert lighting gave him the opportunity to tour with international acts such as AC/DC, Linda Ronstadt, The Beach Boys—again, to name just a few, and you will recall many of those.
In the early 1980s Phil signed up with the band The Angels and he wound up touring with them through the United States. When The Angels returned to Australia, Phil stayed on in the United States and in 1982 he met his wife and lifelong partner, Robin Sharee, in California. They married shortly after and their daughter, Sarah, was born in 1986, also in California.
Phil’s initiative and entrepreneurial drive led him to form Quick Cargo in 1985, a freight logistics business specialising in moving band and production freight all around the world. His company had offices in London, New York and Los Angeles, and some of his clients included the biggest names in the business: Jimmy Buffet, Alice Cooper—we were planning to go and see the Alice Cooper concert last August, until Phil got sick—and Robert Cray, Kenny G, Icehouse, Jefferson Starship, AC/DC, Willie Nelson, Guns and Roses, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Metallica. Phil was awarded a number of platinum records for his work with these acts.
In 1992 Phil’s kidneys failed and he returned to his home in South Australia to avail himself of the groundbreaking and excellent work being done by the renal unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Shortly after arriving home, Phil received the first of two kidney transplants. After his first transplant, Phil was back at work as soon as he could be—this time reinventing himself as an ICT/multimedia strategic consultant. In those days the internet and digital communications technology were at a fairly embryonic stage but Phil had the intelligence and foresight to see what lay ahead.
In 1995 Phil became involved in Ngapartji Multimedia Centre, which was born of the Keating government’s Creative Nation initiative. It was Phil who brought together many diverse stakeholders, including a consortium of state government departments, universities, local ICT firms, Telstra and Microsoft. It was said that Phil was the father of Ngapartji, an organisation which played a crucial role in the development of the multimedia industry in Adelaide in the 1990s. It was while there that Phil developed the famous definition of the ICT industry as consisting of ‘ferals, techno-terrorists and exploiters’.
When sold in 2008, Hostworks was the largest internet hosting company in Australia and it grew out of the back room upstairs at Ngapartji that Phil and Marty Gauvin shared as an office. They were working together in late 1996 as there was an opportunity to bring the Microsoft internet data centre for Australia to Adelaide. Phil’s leading role ensured the success of this project thereby shifting the centre of the internet in Australia to South Australia, where it remains.
Phil also assisted in the framing of the government’s outsourcing contracts with EDS. This was the first time that any government had outsourced the entirety of its IT needs. The EDS contract also led to the formation of the Playford centre as an industry development initiative. In later years Phil assisted the Playford centre to become a cornerstone of ICT seed and venture capital in South Australia. Phil’s achievements in the ICT industry were many and varied, and they have contributed significantly to South Australia becoming an internationally recognised hub for information and communications technology.
To the amusement of his friends and family, Phil often said his job involved him ‘drinking coffee for the government’. In drinking coffee for the government, among other things Phil drove the creation of the report Information economy 2002: delivering the future. He led the formation of the IT Council, an amalgam of 11 IT industry bodies in the state to form a new peak body, and he served as the founding member of the 2002 World Congress on Information Technology executive committee, an event which largely put Adelaide on the IT map along with cities like Austin in the United States and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.
From 2000 Phil had many private clients whom he assisted in their engagement with government and with their business and technology strategies. South Australian state governments also continued to seek his advice. He was a renowned pedant and his attention to detail improved hundreds of government reports.
Phil did all of this while maintaining—and I quote—that ‘he didn’t do geek’. Rather, Phil saw the application of technology with a unique clarity and had the unique ability to translate a vision for the future into something that could be digested by everyone. Phil’s first kidney transplant failed after about eight years, and for many years before his second transplant, in early 2009, Phil endured daily dialysis as well as procedures, minor and major, to correct this and that.
Over the last 12 to 15 years, Phil, John Schumann and I had lunch together once a month or so. We watched at firsthand Phil’s courageous struggle with his health—a struggle which lesser men would have shrunk from. John and I would often wonder to each other just how Phil kept going. When we asked him he would smile quietly and say, ‘Boys, it is what it is, and it’s all part of life’s rich tapestry.’
Phil is survived by his wife, Robin, and their daughter, Sarah. Phil Eastick was a courageous, intelligent and loyal husband, father and friend. He contributed much and sought little for himself. Our world is a poorer place without him.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Phillip Noel Eastwick</title>,Adjournment,48,1,speech
