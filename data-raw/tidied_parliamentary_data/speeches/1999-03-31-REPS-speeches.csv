"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The process leading to this debate quite frankly has been a disgrace. The government quite deliberately delayed the introduction of these new tax bills until last Wednesday, giving the opposition minimal time to examine them and generally treating the parliament with contempt, something we will not continue to tolerate. It is not as if the government could not have brought these forward earlier. These should have been brought in last December. There are still more parts of the tax package legislation outstanding, including new fuel and tobacco legislation and fringe benefits tax legislation. This should have been in the parliament today. We have not yet seen any of the anti-avoidance legislation that was also announced as part of this government's great new tax reformation of the century.
The Treasurer rails against supposed obstruction by us, but we have met the timetable the government has laid down. It is Mr Costello who has been the delayer. Today's debate is an example of how he leaves until the last minute the scrutiny by this House of those bills. Little wonder more time has to be spent in another place undertaking what should be done here.
These are not technical taxation bills but essentially states grants bills which should have been introduced last December with the main GST legislation. It leads to the situation where we have insufficient time. It also 
 severely limits the ability of the Senate GST legislation inquiry to properly examine it. Unfortunately, this simply continues the trend of the Treasurer—hide and conceal everything to do with the GST for as long as possible in the hope that the people will not find out. Despite his attempts, people are finding out and we will continue to highlight the deficiencies of the government's plans.
The bills before us today are proposing something truly historic, that in fact we look backwards on ourselves. These are not history making bills in a forward looking sense but rather looking back in history. I would like to be here today debating proposals which are bold and visionary reforms and which are appropriate for the next century, something that Labor could embrace and support. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to do it. I move a second reading amendment to these bills:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	 notes that the rate of GST has increased in almost every OECD nation with a GST and the same will inevitably occur in Australia;
(2)	 notes that the proposed lock-in mechanism is totally ineffectual and will not prevent future Commonwealth Parliaments from increasing the GST rate or removing exemptions;
(3)	 notes that the GST will be more unfair as the rate increases, as international experience is generally that no compensation is paid when the rate of GST is increased with or without the agreement of the states or territories;
(4)	 notes that the GST revenue is only forecast to increase by 2.7% in 2002-03 which is less than under the current financial assistance arrangements, suggesting that the GST rate will need to be increased in order to finance the needs of the states;
(5)	 condemns the Government for the funding model in the Bill as it will inevitably limit the ability of the Commonwealth to ensure minimum national standards apply for basic community services, and will therefore lead to a more unfair and uneven delivery of public services to Australians;
(6)	 condemns the Government for the funding model which, over time, will force the Commonwealth to restrict the specific assistance granted to states in respect of health, 
 education and other community services thereby leading inevitably to the contraction of Medicare and other vital services;
(7)	 condemns the Government for the lack of equality of opportunity that will inevitably result from the removal of significant national involvement and national standard setting in the delivery of basic community services;
(8)	 condemns the Government for the New Tax System package which, far from reducing, actually worsens, vertical fiscal imbalance, thereby increasing the reliance of the states and territories on Commonwealth revenue sources;
(9)	 condemns the Government for the proposal which seeks to replace the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation, based on an independent assessment conducted by the Commonwealth Grants Commission—which operates to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to enjoy equal levels of services wherever they live—with a system under which the Federal Treasurer will have the absolute right to determine the future general purpose funding levels of each state and territory and the apportionment of relativities under it without their agreement"".
Unfortunately, we are debating proposals which are truly awful, which seek to permanently diminish the role of the national government and to inexorably turn Australia from a cohesive nation back to merely a collection of states and territories. Make no mistake, the proposals contained in these bills are designed to and will lead over time to the cessation of national standards for service delivery and equality of opportunity for all Australians. In this plan are the seeds of the Commonwealth being forced to withdraw from Medicare, withdraw from education, withdraw from providing housing and other community services. The mechanism through which this withdrawal will be done is the granting of the GST revenue to the states proposed in these bills.
The philosophy is clearly atavistic. This model of financing government does not consider national goals and national outcomes as desirable. It is based on the past rather than on the future. We will continue to oppose the heart of this proposal, the GST, until we succeed in defeating it and, with it, the associated plan to dismantle the activities of the Commonwealth. We are not weakening in 
 our resolve to oppose the GST. We will use every argument and every tactic to defeat it.
The underlying justification for this proposal to alter Commonwealth-state financial arrangements is the so-called problem of vertical fiscal imbalance. I say `so-called' because this complex sounding term merely describes the situation where the revenue collections of the Commonwealth exceed its direct spending responsibilities and, by extension, the own source revenue of the states falls short of their direct spending responsibilities. But is vertical fiscal imbalance really a problem? The answer is no. There are actually considerable benefits which flow from Australia's VFI system. First, by definition, it means a more uniform national taxation system than would occur with more state based taxes. As well as lower compliance costs for businesses and taxpayers arising from a more common national tax regime, there are also significant economies of scale in having a centralised national tax administration.
Critics argue that VFI then supposedly leads to the situation where the states are not really accountable for their level of spending because they do not have to wear the political odium of raising their own revenue. This is simply wrong in practice. When states wish to make additional discretionary expenditure—for example, in their state budgets—the additional revenue has to be financed by the state. They are totally accountable for that financing task. In practice, the lack of accountability argument under significant VFI is wrong. The Federation has operated under this supposed handicap for many decades. What has it achieved? Relative to the rest of the developed world, it has delivered a low tax, low public debt country with high levels of public services. The great Australian nation we enjoy today was built under this system.
VFI is not a serious problem. It is simply an excuse for those who advocate a lesser role for the Commonwealth. VFI simply requires a sound system of general revenue funding for the states from the Commonwealth. Such a system is already in place. It involves the Commonwealth annually providing a real per capita increase in the total level of general 
 purpose funding to the states. This system gives certainty to the states by allowing proper budgetary planning and adequate resources. The first full year growth in GST revenue in year three of this package is only 2.7 per cent, less than the level of real growth and much lower than the alternative under the current system of real per capita growth of around 3.5 per cent. The states are being dudded.
The advantage of the current system to the states is that in periods of economic downturn when revenue collections fall considerably state budgets are largely insulated from the fall in revenue due to the Commonwealth maintaining its grants. Quite literally, the Commonwealth budget takes the hit and the states face less pressure to cut their services than they would if they copped the full loss of revenue. So is there a pressing need to fix VFI on economic or other grounds? We say no. However, even if one considered VFI a problem, this legislation does not fix it. It actually makes it significantly worse because the Commonwealth will be collecting more of the states' revenue than it currently does.
The states are not actually obtaining a new tax base under the GST. They are actually giving up some of their existing tax bases, such as stamp duties, and thereby becoming more reliant on the Commonwealth budget. VFI will be getting significantly worse under this plan despite the fraud of the Commonwealth classifying the GST revenue, and the safety net revenue for that matter, as state own source revenue. It is not; it is Commonwealth revenue.
The states have no guarantees that the revenue from the GST will flow to them. That risk is a dual one. First, at any time in the future the Commonwealth parliament can amend this legislation to limit or remove the appropriation of moneys to the states. It only takes a four-page bill to do this—essentially, four bills but four lines in each of them. First of all, it can create a situation that repeals section 10 of the amendment to A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Act—a single line repeal bill that says `repeal the section'. Similarly, in schedule 1 of A New Tax System (Goods and 
 Services Tax Imposition-General) Act, an amendment to section 4 could omit 10 per cent and substitute 15 per cent. There could be a similar amendment to the other two bills that are before us in this chamber. In other words, four bills of one line each—four lines—repeal the lock-in and increase the rate.
Secondly, even the bill as drafted does not provide any real guarantee to the states in respect of revenue flows. The reason for that is simple: in the end, the Commonwealth Treasurer retains complete control over how much GST money the states will be allocated. Clause 17 of the main bill reads:
. . . financial assistance payable to a state under this act is to be paid in such amounts and at such times as the Treasurer determines in writing.
So states only get the money if the Treasurer says so. So much for the greater independence of the states. This is really making them become vassals. The Treasurer is also empowered under the legislation to determine what the per capita relativities are that will apply to each state. There is no mention of the acknowledged expert independent arbiter, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in the legislation at all. The fate of the residents of the smaller states is quite literally in the Treasurer's hands. And I ask them: would you buy a used car from that man?
What are the Treasurer's obligations concerning the derivation of these various relativities under this legislation? The answer is under subclause 9(2). The only check on the Treasurer's powers is that simply before making the relativities factor determination `the Treasurer must consult each state'—that is, a phone call telling them how they have been dudded. What will happen is that he will simply tell the states what they are getting after he has made the decision. In addition, the position of the states is made even more precarious by the need for annual determinations to be made by the Commissioner of Taxation before 15 June in respect of the amount of GST revenue to be paid. What is the situation if such a determination is not made? It appears that no GST revenue would flow to the states. To argue, as the Treasurer has done, that these new arrangements will mean that the states will have greater inde 
 pendence from Commonwealth funding is completely wrong. Indeed, it would be naive to believe so given the track record of this government.
During the recession and the budgetary problems that entailed, Labor honoured in full its general revenue commitment to the states. On the contrary, the Howard government reneged on its pre-1996 election commitment not to cut state grants at its first possible opportunity, the 1996 Premiers Conference. We all remember the dog day afternoon on 12 June 1996 when the Commonwealth ripped $1.5 billion off the states. In the end, the Treasurer was humiliated and excluded from the final meetings. The Prime Minister had to conduct the final negotiations on his own.
In the last election we saw the unseemly blackmail of the Prime Minister in not freeing up funding to the states but forcing Tasmanians to sell their Hydro if they were to get debt relief. Labor made the same commitment without requiring the sale. For the states to accept on trust the Treasurer's word on this issue is naive. Labor argues that this is not a good deal for the states for revenue security.
As well as being risky for the states in revenue security terms, the government's package is also a bad deal in terms of actual revenue returns. We have the Treasurer's claim that `a key feature of the new tax system is the Commonwealth's offer to the states and territories of a stable and growing source of revenue'—that is, he is saying that these new arrangements will be a fiscal bonanza for the states.
Let us look at the truth. In fact, this system does not even give the states the same amount of revenue as the current system provides for at least the first three years, either individually or in aggregate. Pages 35 and 155 of the ANTS document detail that the Commonwealth has to provide a grant of almost $1 billion in 2001-02, a third of a billion dollars in 2000-03 and an interest free loan in 2000-01. So even the government admits that there is no additional revenue to the states in aggregate for the first three years. Furthermore, some individual states are expected to be in deficit from this package for years beyond the first three. But of course these 
 figures actually understate the true revenue losses to the states.
The real position is hidden by the fiscal fiddles which are included in the package to make the states' position look better. There are two of these: a growth dividend which yields $200 million a year in year one and supposedly grows to $400 million in year three, and a reduction of costs of $540 million in year one rising to $600 million by year three. So these add to an additional $1 billion of revenue shortfall per year that the states are simply assumed to pick up. How convenient. Some growth tax! In year three, it is 2.7 per cent—below the real rate of growth in the budget papers. The only way to make it a growth tax is to lift the GST rate, and that is what they will do when they get it in. The states are being conned.
One state in particular is being singled out for particularly savage and unfair treatment, and that is Queensland. This discriminatory treatment is meted out through the so-called transitional provisions. In fact, these provisions are specifically designed to rip off Queensland taxpayers. These proposals are a $465 million heist on Queensland taxpayers.
—Don't believe what Peter Beattie says.
—We will believe what Alex Somlyay says, my friend, because he admits this.
Mr Truss interjecting—
—He did say it. You lead with your chin and you'll get it! This led to the Queensland government quite properly rejecting the Commonwealth's offer and refusing to sign the Premiers Conference agreement.
Queenslanders are currently enjoying low tax in that state. They will have to pay more indirect tax than they currently do, and they are not going to get their fair share of the new unfair GST. In effect, they are going to be forced to pay for the repeal of higher levels of indirect tax in other states. They are being penalised for running a tighter ship than other states. The government's claim that the Queensland government will be no worse off is a fraud. The point is that Queensland taxpayers will be worse off.
Understandably, Queenslanders totally reject this discriminatory treatment. This has led to an unprecedented campaign by Queensland business leaders in the form of an open letter to the Prime Minister from Queensland business leaders calling for a fair deal for Queensland. Even the member for Fairfax has been reported in the Sunshine Coast Sunday paper:
""He agreed with the Qld Labor Treasurer's . . . assessment that the state could draw the short straw of GST revenue"" and ""he could find no fault with the state government's submission on GST funding.""
To add insult to injury, the government does not even know how long the transitional period is going to be. This an extraordinary botch-up.
Clause 1 of schedule 1 of the bill defines the transitional period as `the first three GST years and'—wait for it—`other years that are prescribed'. So the government is giving itself a blank cheque to extend the transitional period for as long as it likes beyond three years, and it can be extended by regulation without even having to come through this parliament. Why would the Treasurer be trying to give himself the power to permanently rip off Queensland unless he wants to make use of it? This is extraordinary treatment, and it graphically illustrates that, as well as the tax package being unfair, it simply does not add up.
But it does not end there. There are many other problems with the GST for state budgets that require further compensation. Just a few of these involve: additional public housing costs of hundreds of millions of dollars a year under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, the cash flow costs with the new financial arrangements, the states' costs of complying with the GST, the loss of state imposed wholesale sales tax equivalents revenue and attribution to state budgets of the claimed embedded savings to local government. So this proposal is basically a shambles.
 But all of these problems pale when we consider the greatest con in this GST debate—the so-called lock-in mechanism. The lock-in mechanism is a completely cynical strategy engaged in by the government to 
 attempt to deal with the undeniable reality that the rate of the GST will increase. Everyone knows the international facts. All 26 OECD countries with a GST have now increased the rate, with the exception of Canada, the most recent country to introduce one, and probably with the exception of Japan, and Japan has put theirs up.
The latest country to increase its GST is Switzerland on 1 January 1999. No doubt it is just a matter of time in Canada as well. Some famous examples are the UK from 10 per cent to 17½ per cent, New Zealand from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent and Denmark from 10 per cent to a whopping 25 per cent. So the government's claim that a 10 per cent rate is high enough to stop it going up is shown to be completely baseless. Put simply, if the GST comes in, the GST will go up. And, as it goes up, it gets even more unfair than it will be at 10 per cent.
Remember that the estimate is only for the GST revenue to grow in year three by 2.7 per cent, below the real rate of growth in the budget papers. The lock-in mechanism is a fraud, and any future Commonwealth parliament can remove it with an ordinary, very short act of parliament, and I demonstrated that before. Similarly, it can amend the rate of the GST just as easily: a bill to repeal the 10 per cent, a bill to take it up to 15 per cent—simple one-line bills. The public relations stunt is a transparent fraud and it is symptomatic of the misleading campaign the government has run in promoting its GST.
This legislation also seeks to repeal the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act by bringing to an end a 25-year history of Commonwealth-local government partnership. Who was it that introduced local government financial assistance? It was Labor. We introduced those direct payments because of our long held commitment to local government. Commonwealth funding is a way of recognising the roles of councils in our community and of building their capacity to provide the facilities, services and infrastructure that every community needs.
When the Whitlam government introduced the local government grants bill in 1974, its purpose was clear. That purpose was set out 
 by the then Special Minister for State, Lionel Bowen, in his second reading speech when he said:
The government recognises that many councils are faced with financial problems in providing a full range of municipal services of proper standards. The government believes that these grants will go a long way towards alleviating these deficiencies.
There can be no doubt that Commonwealth funding has been essential to the development and improvement of local government services over the past 25 years. The Australian community benefits from competent local government participating as a partner with the Commonwealth and the states. The Commonwealth currently provides untied financial assistance to local government consisting of financial assistance grants and identified local road grants. The grants are distributed to the states on a per capita basis for passing on to local government.
In 1997 these general purpose grants amounted to in excess of $1.2 billion. The Local Government National Report for 1997 lists the purposes, and they are important: the financial capacity of local governing bodies; the capacity of local governing bodies to provide their residents with an equitable level of services; the certainty of funding; the efficiency and effectiveness of local governing bodies; and the provision by local governing bodies of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. These are important principles and ones that the Commonwealth should not be walking away from.
Around two-thirds of the grants currently go to rural and regional councils, with over half to rural councils. But the National Party is voting to disadvantage these rural communities because it believes that local government is simply a creature of the states.
This is a government that has cut local government out of the picture at every step of the way. It has shown utter contempt for local government, and this bill is simply another example. As a final insult, the government seeks to hand local government over to the states on the basis of an agreement with the premiers—an agreement that local government is not a party to.
Local government has strongly objected to this proposition. That opposition has been voiced by the Australian Local Government Association. The government has consistently ignored local government's serious reservations about the GST package. Quite simply, local government has been excluded. At the general assembly of local government last year attended by some 700 local government representatives, a very detailed resolution was carried.
But the entire package of legislation that is before the House today ignores every aspect of the motion that was carried by those 700 delegates representing local government. Not one part of this request made by 700 local government representatives has been met by this government. So much for the commitment to regional services. This legislation is further evidence that the Howard government has abandoned the regions. The legislation before us now has significant long-term ramifications for local government, especially in regional communities.
Local government is fundamental on a number of levels. Local government touches the life of every Australian—providing vital infrastructure, local roads, sporting facilities, rubbish collection, recycling, footpaths, and in some states sewage and water and public transport. In addition, it delivers an enormous range of services to families and communities, to the elderly and to people with disabilities.
Why does the coalition want to belittle and ignore local government? Indeed, why did the coalition, led by Peter Reith, disgracefully oppose the constitutional recognition of local government proposed by Labor? It is because the coalition does not understand the benefits of working in partnership to achieve national goals. The coalition is good at tearing things down, but it does not know how to build for the common good.
Labor will not let the regions down. We will support and champion regional development. It is fundamental to our future. Regions must be supported and further empowered. Labor is totally opposed to cutting local government adrift. We will move amendments later in the debate to defeat this proposal. We will oppose the provisions of this legislation 
 that seek to hand over local government funding to the states. We will move consequential amendments to reduce the amount of GST revenue to the states by the amount of the local government financing to enable the moneys to be granted to local government. The coalition has comprehensively dudded local government, and the Labor Party will not stand by and watch 25 years of history destroyed.
I have shown in this debate that the proposals in these bills do not deliver what the government claims. They treat the people and government in the state of Queensland with contempt. If implemented, the funding model is designed to limit future specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth. Inexplicably, they also involve ridiculous proposals to terminate a successful quarter century partnership with local government. Finally, they will not stop the GST rate from inevitably rising over time. These bills are part of a plan—the GST plan. It is the wrong plan, and it should be defeated. (Time expired)
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak at a later time.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—I rise to speak to the GST bills, not to the amendment. I look forward to the minister at the table debating that issue if he wishes. It is very clear from listening to the member for Hotham how much the Labor Party are into retropolitics. It is about justifying their fifties look in this House. They are not concerned about providing the states with a stable source of income, a growing source of income which all states and territories around this great country have been asking for for decades. It is clear that the member for Hotham has not been listening to the various premiers as they outline the problems that they face with vertical fiscal imbalance and the regressive range of taxes that are available. Those taxes will be abolished as a result of this particular piece of legislation. Nine taxes will be abolished, and in their place will be a much more efficient regime. The whole of the GST will be allocated to the states.
Whether it is a Labor state or a coalition held state, there is no difference in the response from the various premiers and from 
 the treasurers in each state and territory. The reality is that each of the premiers in the states agrees that this is the way to go, this is the way to remove the inequities, this is the way to remove the vertical fiscal imbalance, this is the way to remove regressive taxation right throughout this country. It will put the states in line with a tax system which is going to grow over time and which will meet their various infrastructure requirements for hospitals, schools, roads, bridges and a whole range of services, including police services and social welfare services, that each state is required to provide throughout this country.
Those involved in state governments are aware of how inept and regressive the taxes are at the state level. If you go to any taxation seminar, you will be told very early that the taxes available to each of the states are regressive and are often invisible to the consumer. Yet they provide different levels of regressive taxation. For example, with stamp duty, as you develop an apartment block, each level requires a stamp duty payment. So the overall cumulative cost of the taxation continues to increase. It is, by any count, a very regressive regime of taxes that is available. I am sure many in the business area would like to see the payroll tax included. That was not possible because of the restriction of the rate of taxation to 10 per cent, but there is no doubt that this is the most significant change in the federal-state taxation arrangements since Federation.
Because of that, the Treasurer and the government should be congratulated on introducing these bills into the House. The first bill provides the 30 per cent concession in private medical funding to make it more affordable. The second bill will remove the wholesale sales tax and will provide $13 billion worth of tax cuts. At the same time, it will make our industries more efficient because many of the taxes that currently burden it will be removed, such as the wholesale sales tax. The requirement of taxation will be removed when businesses move into the international marketplace. There are some $4.5 billion worth of tax cuts in the manufacturing and the mineral sectors when they move into the international scene.
This piece of legislation improves the relationship between the state governments and the federal government. The first reason why this legislation needs to be supported is that it removes nine very inefficient taxes. It provides a stable source of revenue for the states and provides them with a growing source of revenue. That is very significant.
Secondly, the states will no longer have to rely on an inefficient range of taxes. They will no longer have to rely on the general purpose grants which they need to line up for every year. There is the great charade of the Premiers Conference when all the state premiers come together and make various demands about the needs of their particular state. The formula for the allocation of grants is based on fiscal equalisation. It will be set out in the formula. There will be three years of transition in putting that formula in place. They will be guaranteed the revenue that they otherwise would have had through the existing system, but it will remove that whole charade we have each year of lining up for the general purpose grants. Instead, we will have a much more efficient system. The whole basis of the GST is efficiency, clarity of understanding and lack of regressive taxes in the tax mix overall.
It is also important to recognise that this tax was not imposed on the state and territory governments but one voluntarily and willingly embraced. At the meeting held last November between the Prime Minister, the chief ministers and the premiers, they agreed to these proposals. While there may be some differences at the edges, there is no doubt that premiers, whether in coalition states or Labor states, very much embraced this. For example, the Premier of New South Wales has been silent on this issue. He would know what a bonanza this is for the state of New South Wales. Premier Beattie would know that this is going to provide him with a growth tax to provide all those roads, hospital requirements, policing requirements and maintenance requirements of government facilities that have been so long needed.
This is about a revolution in taxation arrangements. On this side of the House we are confronting the taxation issues that have 
 been a great challenge for the states for the past 99 years since Federation. They have been grappling with these issues and this government has faced up to these issues and come out with a sensible tax arrangement which is embraced by all the heads of states and territories.
The states can use their grants for any purpose, which of course allows them flexibility. The member for Hotham's claim that, if any change is going to be made, all that is required is a simple one-liner piece of legislation ignores the fact that this legislation requires the agreement of the heads of the states and territories for any change in the GST arrangements. Secondly, it needs to go through the upper house. So you would have an agreement of all the states and territories to any change and an agreement of both houses of parliament. So this whole nonsense that it requires in the late night hours a one-line piece of legislation and all will be changed, ignores the reality of this piece of legislation.
There is no doubt about what this bill provides. It provides for the repeal of nine inefficient state and territory indirect taxes, the assumption by the states and territories of responsibility for the funding of local government and the operation of the First Home Owners Scheme by the states and territories. All this is sensible and appropriate legislation.
 It is also important to recognise that, when this legislation comes through, bed taxes around Australia will be removed. This has been one of the principal reasons why we have seen a lot of our international visitors shift out of Sydney and go to other parts of Australia. This legislation will remove those bed taxes not only in Cairns but also in the Northern Territory and Sydney and provide a great incentive to international visitors.
It will remove the FID—the financial institutions duty; the debits tax; and the stamp duties on marketable securities, business conveyances, lease mortgages, debentures, bonds and other loans security. In other words, it is a wide ranging reform, removing a whole raft of regressive taxation measures that apply in the various states. What we are going to have is a sensible, appropriate, 
 equitable system of taxation around Australia, providing a growth tax to all of the states which will ensure that the infrastructure that they require for the provision of services will continue on a strong basis. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999  purports to lock in the proposed 10 per cent rate for the GST and to give the entire GST revenue to the states. It also in effect gives the Treasurer the unfettered power to determine what the distribution of that revenue is as between the states rather than with reference to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as has always been the case in the past. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved a second reading amendment which I support, which outlines in some detail the concerns that Labor has with this legislation.
I turn first to the question of the lock-in proposal. This is in effect an entirely fraudulent proposition, by seeking to suggest that in some way this parliament can bind future parliaments not to amend legislation without the consent of the states. That is an absolute nonsense. It is simply not constitutionally possible. The government knows it; every commentator in the country knows it. It is ludicrous that this should be put into legislation, because it is quite clear that any future Commonwealth parliament may choose to amend this legislation or the other GST bills without reference to the states even though this provision purports to say otherwise.
In virtually every OECD jurisdiction where a GST or an equivalent tax has been introduced it has been subsequently increased, and the threat of that occurring is still very real, irrespective of what this government puts in this piece of legislation. It is important to point out that the more a tax of this nature increases, the more unfair in relative terms it becomes and the more likely that compensation for the impact of the GST will erode further over time. It is worth pointing out in parenthesis that, of course, a substantial proportion of that compensation is already effectively a phantom compensation, particularly for pensioners who are guaranteed a rise 
 of 3½ per cent under the provisions of minimum pension increases relevant to the rate of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. So there is a massive double counting going on here anyway. The compensation is already grossly inadequate on a number of fronts and, if the GST does increase in the future, it will be further eroded in value.
The second theme that it is important to acknowledge—and perhaps in some respects from a longer term point of view it is just as important—is the question of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. In this regard, this legislation is doubly deficient. First, because it increases the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance by increasing the extent to which the states are reliant upon the Commonwealth to raise their revenue.
At the moment, the states raise roughly 57 per cent of their own revenue—the balance, of course, comes primarily from the Commonwealth. Under the proposals being put to this parliament as part of the total tax package of this government, that figure will drop to roughly 42½ per cent. In other words, the existing problem—which has been the subject of many commentaries in recent times—will actually be exacerbated, and the states' responsibility for raising their own tax revenues will actually diminish quite substantially.
The reason why this is doubly bad legislation is that it reduces the Commonwealth parliament's power to set a national agenda to develop uniform national standards to ensure that across this country there is some degree of minimum access to resources in areas like health and education. What will almost inevitably occur as a result of this tax system will be that specific purpose payments to the states—which at the moment are only slightly less in total than the financial assistance grants—will be squeezed because over time the GST revenue will rise and the federal government, particularly if it is a coalition government, will be forced to reduce the specific purpose payments in respect of health, education and the like. So we end up with the worst of all worlds—less state responsibility for revenue raising and less Commonwealth responsibility for setting national standards to ensure minimum equal 
 access to resources across the country in areas like health and education.
It is also noteworthy that as part of this process, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the direct federal financing to local government will finish and this will now all notionally occur through the states. As we have such well-known friends of local government in charge as the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, I am sure that local government is trembling at this prospect.
Currently, in the 1998-99 fiscal year, financial assistance grants to the states total $16.9 billion and specific purpose payments total about $15 billion. Some 46 per cent of the total Commonwealth payments to the states are specific purpose payments, and 68 per cent of those are for health and education. It is easy to see what is going to happen in the longer term as a result of the introduction of the new tax system. The traditional role of the Commonwealth as a setter of standards and an equaliser of resource provision across the country will be eroded. That is no accident; it is a deliberate strategy of this government to reduce the role of the Commonwealth in areas like health and education and to allow the deficiencies that tend to occur in particular state governments to flourish.
According to government figures, the initial shortfall from the GST for which the states will be compensated occurs over the next three years or so and then, from 2003-04, the equation goes into surplus. According to their figures, it will be $370 million extra in 2003-04, building up to $1.25 billion extra over 2004-05. New South Wales challenges those figures but, even under its figuring, clearly it goes into the positive for the states after about five years.
The impacts of this will be variable in different states. In particular, Queensland is entitled to be aggrieved at what this government is doing. Queensland has a lower tax base—which is a matter, ultimately, of political choice for the people of Queensland—and hence it has a tax advantage in terms of business competition. Being a Victorian, I may not like this and we may well debate the merits of it, but it should not be attacked by stealth. If there is to be a debate about this 
 issue and if there is to be change, it should ultimately be as a result of decisions taken by the people of Queensland and should not be done by stealth by this government.
Queensland also suffers because it has a lower per capita income than any mainland state. In fact, in 1995-96 the per capita income of Queensland was $18,910 compared with the national average of $21,103. This means that the already regressive impact of the GST will be substantially more regressive for Queenslanders because they have a lower per capita income. Queensland suffers in addition because it is a more services dominated economy, it has less manufacturing; therefore it stands to benefit less from things like the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the shift in emphasis to taxation of services.
There is a double straitjacket in this legislation for future governments at state and Commonwealth level. Individual states will have less autonomy because less of their tax resources will be coming from within their own revenue raising capabilities and more will be coming from the Commonwealth, and they will not be able to make the decisions by themselves to change that level of tax revenue—either down, as Queensland has chosen to do, or up, as other states may wish to do.
Equally, the Commonwealth is restricted in its access to indirect taxation for the future because it has effectively handed over its indirect taxing power to the states, without the responsibility that goes with it, and it will be unable to provide the vital national leadership that the Commonwealth parliament needs to provide in areas like a national curriculum in education or sorting out the mess in the health system so that one body is ultimately responsible for ensuring that people get decent universal access to a proper public health system and the like.
These things are going to go backwards as a result of this legislation. We need a national presence in health and education. We need national standards. We need a Commonwealth parliament that actually ensures that people are not subject to the vicissitudes of particular state governments making decisions that will disadvantage their state or parts of their state 
 on these issues. Over the medium to long term, this tax system will diminish substantially the capacity of the federal parliament to do this.
It also ensures that the Grants Commission is sidelined. In the past we have had a transparent, albeit rather complicated, process for carving up funding to the states on a fair basis. On page 84 of the tax package it is stated that the Grants Commission will develop new allocation processes to:
. . . reflect the capacities and needs of each State as it currently does, as well as the fact that not all States currently levy the whole range of taxes to be eliminated.
That last bit again has some dangers for Queensland. There was a suggestion that not only was the Grants Commission going to be involved but the formula was going to be changed to reflect the actual taxing behaviour of individual states. However, in this bill the Treasurer is aggregating to himself the entire power to determine the distribution of the tax revenue between the states. He may choose to ask the Grants Commission in the future. Who knows. Clearly, this should be spelt out in the legislation. Once again, particularly Queensland but also New South Wales and Tasmania—states that have Labor governments—are entitled to be nervous about the intention behind this particular provision.
The tax package statement contemplates that new component in the carve-up process. Where is it? What is the approach going to be? We do not see it in this legislation. There are reasons for concern about that proposal. We now see that the Treasurer seems to have dumped it and is simply taking the approach of saying, `I will just do it. I will get out there with the ruler and the set square and say that you can have this bit and you can have that bit, and away we go.' Sadly, I do not think any of the states can trust the Treasurer as the independent arbiter of who should get what resources.
In conclusion, I support the second reading amendment that has been moved by the shadow Treasurer. This bill is an attempt to fraudulently persuade people that the states can lock in a rate on a GST when actually any future Commonwealth parliament can 
 change the legislation without reference to the states. It reduces the role of the national government to set the agenda and to set national standards in health and education. It increases vertical fiscal imbalance and it removes, in effect, the protection that the states have from the Grants Commission that ensures that the national cake is carved up in a way that looks after all of the states and the people within them.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—Members on this side would acknowledge that the member for Melbourne is one of the more thoughtful, reflective and erudite members of the opposition. As a consequence, he is one person on the other side to whom I listen carefully whenever he makes a contribution in this place. But I have to say that that last contribution was the most half-hearted, limp-wristed, incoherent, faint and unconvincing performance I have ever heard him deliver. There is a simple reason for that: he does not believe it. He has been saddled with the difficult task of walking into this place, sent in by the leadership team, to argue a position in which he has absolutely no confidence or conviction.
We as members are often called into this place to speak on one piece of legislation or another which is essentially a housekeeping measure, an administrative change, a finetuning—some necessary but nonetheless uninspired legislative intervention. Very occasionally—perhaps once or twice a decade—we come into the chamber to speak to a piece of legislation which genuinely touches on a moment in Australia's history, which touches on a step forward, a break with the past—a truly innovative, creative, exciting development in Australia's public life. The A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999 is legislation which I would put into that category.
I would have loved to have been in this place in December 1983 when the former government, to its very great credit, legislated for the floating of the Australian dollar. There was a moment at which the Australian nation turned away from its inward preoccupations and looked out to the rest of the world and set off on a path from which it knew it could 
 never return, and thank goodness it did. As a consequence, we saw the inevitable deregulation of the financial industry in Australia; we saw the breaking down of centralised wage arbitration, which simply could not survive once that initial moment in history had taken place.
Today we stand on the brink, on the verge, of a reform which has been a running sore in the life of this nation since the time of Federation. What we have seen is the gradual erosion in the autonomy, the dignity and the self-reliance of the states and a weakening of the spirit of federalism. That has been concentrated on an attack on the ability of the states to raise their own revenue. The member for Cook preceded me by saying that this bill represents the most significant change in federal-state financial relations since Federation, and he is absolutely correct about that position.
It was M.K. Ghandi who said that the greatest expression of power is to give it away. This bill is in that tradition. It is the Commonwealth saying to the states after decades—in fact, four generations—of taking power from the states and centralising power in Canberra, `Today, in a gesture of peace, in a gesture of justice, in a gesture of faithfulness to the spirit of the Constitution, we hand back so much of that which we have abrogated unto ourselves.'
In a few moments time I want to touch on a couple of the remarks made by both the member for Hotham and the member for Melbourne, but first I wish to develop the question of vertical fiscal imbalance. This is one of the terms about which perhaps some of my constituents in Parramatta would say, `This is government jargon which reflects how out of touch all of you people in Canberra are.' Vertical fiscal imbalance is just talking about the extent of the discrepancy in the ability of one level of government to raise the revenues it requires to fund its own expenditure. Where you get an increasing imbalance or dichotomy or divergence between the capacity of local government, state government or federal government to raise the revenue it requires to deliver its own services 
 all manner of inefficiencies and abuses come into play.
In Australia we have seen a further exacerbation of this imbalance with the High Court's decision in 1997 in relation to the state tobacco franchise taxes, which were struck down as unconstitutional. That happened because when the Commonwealth took exclusive responsibility for the raising of income tax in 1942 during the Second World War and never gave it back, the states were forced to get increasingly ingenious at raising revenue through indirect means and often with a questionable constitutional warrant for those fiscal adventures. We saw that again in the decision to strike down the state tobacco tax in 1997.
The member for Melbourne was correct in saying that Australia has a very substantial problem with vertical fiscal imbalance. In fact, it has the worst problem of any federation in the world as far as vertical fiscal imbalance goes. I would like to quote a paragraph from a paper by Denis James, of the parliament's own research service, entitled `Federal and state taxation: a comparison of Australian, German and Canadian systems' of November 1997. Mr James says:
Australia is characterised by the largest degree of VFI—
vertical fiscal imbalance—
between its tiers of government of any federal nation. In 1996-7 the Commonwealth raised $130.7 billion in revenue, representing 76% of total Cth and State general government revenues. On the other hand, Cth outlays for its own purposes were only 58% of total general government outlays. As a result, in the same year the Cth provided the states with grants amounting to $34.6 billion. . . Overall in 1995-6 Cth assistance comprised 45.8% of state and territory revenues.
The results of that imbalance are several, one of which is cost shifting whereby the states, because they do not have the revenue base to fund their own expenditure, look for ways to push more and more of their constitutional responsibilities underneath the fiscal branch of the Commonwealth. So, for example, in the roads area you will have, in some instances, a deliberate neglect by the states of funding for key arterial roads in the hope that the Commonwealth will then reach out and 
 classify that stretch of road as a federal road—as a national highway—and thereby the states avoid having to reach into their own revenue to fund that expenditure.
I recollect a former life, as I follow today the member for Cook, and there is a certain closing of the circle, if you like. As a humble minion on his staff when he was one of Australia's most effective and successful ministers for roads, I remember the frustration he experienced in trying to map out the forward projections on expenditure for the RTA. Funding a major piece of road infrastructure required a forward capital program of three, four or five years if you wanted to get good rates from the contractors. But the problem was that the Commonwealth was funding roads on an annual budget cycle, so you simply never knew from year to year how much funding was going to be available. The result was that the contractors always fleeced the governments because we could only ever contract short stretches of road and we could never make strategic planning decisions. This piece of legislation today again takes this revolutionary step forward to hand back to the states certainty of funding.
In health you get cost shifting. The states have responsibility for public hospitals and the Commonwealth has responsibility for Medicare, so you get the public hospital administrators trying to find the most ingenious ways to push their costs under the umbrella of Medicare. This bill touches on the question of local government funding. You have situations where local governments, in order to generate further revenues, will approve residential housing zonings in areas which are flood affected, and then they will go to the Commonwealth and seek for the Commonwealth to provide funding to mitigate the damage caused by the flooding.
All of these kinds of inefficiencies flow from uncertainty of funding and from vertical fiscal imbalance. Aside from cost shifting we have a culture of blame shifting, and this is perhaps even more damaging. So what you see at each year's annual Premiers Conference and meetings of the Council of Australian Governments where the Commonwealth comes together with the states is that, instead 
 of having a paternal or family spirit, they degenerate into a slanging match, an undignified spectacle of name calling, finger pointing and, for want of a more decorous expression, `arse covering'—
—Dear, oh dear.
—where nobody wants to take responsibility for their decisions. The people who suffer are political leaders as a class because the public get so cynical and they say, `When are these guys going to take responsibility for their own actions instead of, constantly, the states blaming the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth blaming the states?'
The member for Melbourne again raised the chestnut about the certainty of the 10 per cent rate. I just want to give you four reasons for which the people of Australia can be guaranteed it will stay at 10 per cent: (1) this act provides that there can be no lifting of that rate without the unanimous agreement of states, territories and the Commonwealth; (2) it will be supported by the Commonwealth-state intergovernmental agreement; (3) it would be political suicide for the Commonwealth or for any individual state to advocate a rise in the tax; (4) and this is the most critical, the Commonwealth does not get the revenue. It all goes to the states, and that is why this is such a dramatic and historic step forward. This is a measure I strongly, wholeheartedly and with passionate conviction commend to the House, and I urge other honourable members to do likewise.
—Order! Before calling the next speaker, I caution the member for Parramatta to in future be a little more decorous about the word he was searching for. Whilst I was not willing to intervene on this occasion, I caution him to be more careful.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—The A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999  and the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements—Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999 are about more than an efficient and equitable tax system, critical though this is. The implementation of these bills will lead to a stronger 
 Australian federation and a stronger Australian democracy, for real democracy depends on the dispersal of legislative powers as well as administrative authority that only the federal system can provide. A true federal system automatically provides checks on the power of central government, introduces healthy competition in government decision making and caters for diverse regional and local issues. A strong federation is dynamic, flexible and responsive.
We have before us the first real prospect for many years of enabling the states to fulfil the responsibilities that the Constitution lays upon them, by reducing vertical fiscal imbalance. It is not equitable that the decision of the High Court in 1997 abolishing state franchise fees left our second tier of government with control of just over 50 per cent of their revenue. It is a recipe for less accountable, less efficient government when the states can raise little more than half of their necessary revenue and must rely on regressive taxes like the financial institutions duty and the debits tax. State governments will support a national tax system that is efficient and equitable and which promotes the international competitiveness of Australian industry. The current regime does not satisfy these criteria. Many of the worst taxes that fall heavily on the business community are presently state taxes.
Genuine reform, as we have before us, must include abolishing the worst state taxes. This cannot be done without addressing the financial relationship between the states and the Commonwealth. The states cannot give up even their most inefficient taxes without access to an alternative tax base. It is true that vertical fiscal imbalance has been present in Australia to some degree since Federation. Over the century the states' dependence on the Commonwealth has, however, increased markedly.
We should all remember that the Australian people have never voted to transfer full income tax powers to the Commonwealth. It was a decision of the High Court. The uniform tax case was taken, significantly, in the first half of 1942 when Australia was in its time of greatest peril and, subsequently, it has been a political impossibility for the states to 
 re-enter the income tax field. The people were not asked. Indeed, in December 1984 a majority of Australians in every state, including over 55 per cent of Western Australians, rejected a referendum proposal to allow the interchange of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. On the surface such a proposal might appear to facilitate cooperative federalism. But the electors knew that, with control of the purse strings, real transfer of powers could only move in a centralised direction, a direction to which they had never assented. In fact, in most comparable federations the regional provincial governments raise half or more of their revenue from income tax.
So we must never fall into the trap of thinking that fiscal centralism is inevitable, if not desirable, in a federal system. We must, rather, keep reminding ourselves that other federations avoid vertical fiscal imbalance or succeed in limiting it. We can surely learn from Germany and Canada, and from the United States, in particular, where the 50 states have access to more than enough revenue for their needs, where federalism is an unchallenged principle and where solid economic growth is achieved in the absence of vertical fiscal imbalance.
Australians have the right to elect state governments in the expectation that they will be able to implement policies and to stand accountable for them. This requires a stronger and more certain revenue base—the foundation laid by this bill. It also requires the firmness and flexibility needed to negotiate an established intergovernmental agreement for reform of Commonwealth-state finances. True federalism in Australia is about balancing the principle of fiscal autonomy with that of fiscal equalisation—the compensation of the less advantaged states. It is fair that there is some cross-subsidisation so that fellow Australians are not left in a national poverty trap, but equalisation and sacrifice on the part of the better performing states is a fact that needs to be better understood.
I will take my home state of Western Australia as an example. According to a Western Australian Treasury analysis, in 1996-97, Western Australia contributed $15 
 billion in revenue, a calculated share of the deficit of $515 million and received $13 billion in outlays. This amounts to a subsidy of over $2 billion, or $1,417 per head—the highest of any state second only to the ACT with its higher income and lower dependency levels. I do not state this fact by way of complaint but in order that our contribution be recognised so that economic success is not automatically penalised in reforming fiscal arrangements. It is hardly in the national interest to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
Western Australia has gone from being a recipient to a donor, and the cumulative subsidy provided by Western Australia reflects the strong growth in Western Australia's economy over the decade. We have been only too glad to forfeit our status as a recipient, but the strength of our economy must be balanced against the cost of providing services and infrastructure across a vast geographical area. In revenue terms and per head, we have increased our contribution to the federation steadily since 1990-91. Our contribution per capita has risen from $923 in 1993-94 to $1,417 in 1996-97. The reduction in the per capita share of financial assistance grants to Western Australia over four years to 1997-98 amounts to $543 million. I acknowledge that the distribution of Commonwealth grants is only one element in the complex web of redistributional impacts arising from the totality of Commonwealth tax and expenditure policies.
Access to a broad based tax will, in time, give the elected state governments an improved revenue base. It presents an historic opportunity for the states to access a GST so that state revenues more closely match growth in the economy and the demand for state services. It is equally important to ensure that in transition arrangements fiscal equalisation is decided with justice so that economic growth and the fiscal responsibility of, for example, the Court coalition government do not further reduce its share of the Commonwealth revenue. All states and territories stand to benefit in significant and substantial ways from the introduction of these bills as part and 
 parcel of the federal government's entire package, A New Tax System.
The rate of GST can be altered only by a unanimous request of all states. If the opposition were ever in a position to do so, it could seek to legislate to remove this requirement but, even if it passed the Senate, such a government would likely seal its own fate. The impossibility of either side of politics simultaneously holding government in every state, together with the electoral cycles of state politics, will ensure that no state government will be far enough removed from an election to incur the backlash of agreeing to raise the GST above 10 per cent. It is noteworthy that the checks and balances of federalism can be put to such a constructive use.
Those who support our federal system of government will welcome the statement that, from July 2000, responsibility for the financial assistance to local governments will be transferred to the states and territories. This is getting back to a great truth of the Constitution that local government is foremost the responsibility of state parliaments, a responsibility that should neither be usurped nor discarded. In 1974, 53 per cent of Australian voters and 59 per cent of Western Australian electors rejected a constitutional amendment that would have recognised local government as a third tier of government. In 1988, a similar proposal was rejected by a two to one national no vote—in Western Australia the no vote exceeded 70 per cent.
Australians do not undervalue local government, but they do not want to see it used as a centralist lever by the Commonwealth. My seat of Curtin has more separate local authorities than any other metropolitan division in Western Australia—seven wholly within its boundaries and parts of three others. Many dedicated people serve as unpaid councillors or work as professional staff. I am equally gratified that this legislation will ensure that there is no funding loss for an essential component of our free society.
There will be real and positive impacts on the Australian community because of our new tax system. The greater economic stimulus from the GST-free treatment of exports, reduced fuel taxes and the improved incen 
 tives to work, save and invest, together with the restructuring of the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements, will be of enormous benefit to our federation. This is, indeed, a history making bill. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The member for Curtin was talking about vertical fiscal imbalance. Let me say to the House that those who worry about vertical fiscal imbalance are generally states using this as part of their ambit claim in terms of bargaining for extra money or ideologues who want to reduce the role of the Commonwealth. There has been vertical fiscal imbalance for decades; it has served this nation, frankly, quite well. We have very good standards of service. We have low rates of taxation. We have a very successful economy.
The extraordinary thing about the member for Curtin's concerns about vertical fiscal imbalance is that in fact the GST package exacerbates that very problem. If you are worried about vertical fiscal imbalance, this makes it worse: the Commonwealth is collecting all the revenue in the shape of GST and then handing it all over to the states for them to spend. It was an extraordinary series of comments by the member for Curtin, and she should really wake up and understand exactly what is going on with this GST package.
In the brief time that we have available to speak on this important GST legislation, I essentially want to speak to the opposition's second reading amendment, which talks about our concern that the proposed lock-in mechanism is absolutely ineffectual and will not prevent future Commonwealth parliaments from increasing the GST rate or removing exemptions. I also want to pick up the part of our amendment which notes that the GST will become more unfair as the rate increases and the part of our amendment which condemns the government for the new tax system package.
The lock-in mechanism is a completely cynical exercise. This government knows perfectly well that no parliament can bind a successor parliament. All it will take for a GST to rise is for a successor parliament to come in here and introduce legislation to 
 undo this legislation. In virtually every country in which a GST has been introduced we have seen a subsequent increase in its rate. The latest of those was Switzerland, on 1 January.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—The minister interjects concerning Canada. I always enjoy discussion about Canada. As I recall, Canada was the country where a conservative government introduced a GST and then lost of the order of 160 seats and was reduced to two.
—Then why don't you just let us introduce it? You should support us.
—On political grounds that would be a temptation, but in the public interest we reject it. It is all very well for the member for North Sydney to be interested in this. If his side of politics were reduced to two his might be one of the two surviving seats. In every country that has introduced a GST we have seen the rate of GST rise: in the UK from 10 to 12½ per cent; in New Zealand from 10 to 12½ per cent; and in Denmark from 10 to a whopping 25 per cent. So the idea that this legislation is going to lock in the GST is absolute nonsense.
The other place where a GST has come in is New Zealand. I was intrigued recently to see the minister announcing a range of measures designed to stop New Zealanders from coming to Australia. The report of this suggested that New Zealand's plunging economy had brought almost 20,000 Kiwis to settle in Australia last year. So much for the impact of the GST on New Zealand.
The government, and perhaps some other people, think that the Labor Party should be giving it away and suing for concessions in the Senate and elsewhere. Why would we do a fool thing like that? It would be a fraud on the voters, to whom we as Labor Party candidates and representatives went at the last election and said, `If you vote for us, we will oppose a GST: we will oppose a GST in the House; we will oppose a GST in the Senate.' This government might be happy to break its election promises but this opposition is not and we will continue to oppose the GST.
What is the evidence concerning the GST and its impact post-election to emerge through the Senate's inquiry processes? We have seen evidence that the compensation package as it impacts on pensioners will be absolutely worthless. All the evidence is that the rise in pension rates to occur over the next few years with a GST is absolutely the same as the rise which would occur in the absence of a GST. So the effective value of the government's compensation package for pensioners is zero. That is the first thing to come out of the Senate inquiry.
The second thing to come out of the Senate inquiry is the GST's impact on jobs. I talked in the House last week about the modelling of Professor Peter Dixon from the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University which indicates that if workers were to endeavour to achieve compensation for some of the price rises which will come from a GST we would see a scenario in which up to 120,000 jobs would be lost, many of those jobs in regional Australia: 16,000 in regional New South Wales, 11,000 in regional Victoria, 12,000 in regional Queensland, 2,500 in regional South Australia, 1,600 in regional Western Australia and 2,200 in Tasmania. So the GST will have a severe impact on people in regional Australia—and this from a government which claims to have an interest in their wellbeing. Similarly, the GST will have severe impacts in health, education, tourism, forestry and fishing, food, drink and tobacco, and textiles, clothing and footwear. So there will be some real problems from the GST package in the employment area.
We have also seen from the Senate inquiry the impact of the GST on local government. Prior to the election the government claimed that the non-commercial activities of local government would be outside the scope of a GST so that, if a service was provided for a nominal charge, GST would not apply. Senator Ian Macdonald subsequently told the relevant Senate committee that a GST will apply to all local government services, even those with a nominal charge. So the swimming pools, the sporting fields, the community halls, the equipment hire, the nurseries, the publications, recycling charges and waste 
 charges—all those sorts of things—will be GSTable, and ratepayers will face either diminished services or increased rates as a result.
The other area where we have heard alarming evidence in the Senate inquiry concerns the impact of the GST on charities and fund-raising efforts. St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, Yooralla and the Helping Hand Association for the Intellectually Disabled—all those sorts of organisations—have come before the Senate and produced evidence that, notwithstanding what the Treasurer claims, they will be worse off as a result of the GST. To try to put them on a level footing with a business is fundamentally unfair. Unlike a business, the profit from their activities is not a private profit; it is used to provide more services for people who need it most. To burden them with the paperwork and the membership fees and all the other things that will come with a GST is totally unfair.
Similarly, the evidence is that a GST will have a catastrophic effect on the fund-raising efforts of bodies such as schools. I went along to the Coburg West Primary School fete recently. The kids were being charged $2 for a go on the mini-golf. What we will see with a GST is a charge of not $2 but $2.20 and, much more seriously, a requirement that each  transaction be reported. That sort of red tape would completely throttle the efforts of schools and any other organisations which engage in charitable and fund-raising activities to raise money for these important services. As a result, the GST will threaten school fetes and have a catastrophic effect on them.
The other part about the GST which has become clearer with time is that it amounts to a redistribution of wealth in reverse—a transfer from the poor to the rich. I received, and others may have received, a letter recently from Brian Clarke of Guildford in which he put forward two alternatives to the GST. He said `increase income tax from 20 to 60 per cent for all taxpayers earning less than $15,000' and then give half of the money raised as tax deductions to the top 20 per cent of income earners while the other half goes as 
 deductions to the 50 per cent who are middle income earners.
So this package is about a massive transfer of wealth—something like $6 billion—with over 50 per cent of the income tax cuts going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. As a result, we are opposing the GST package. We are not opposing the legislation before the House, but we are moving amendments which specify our concerns and I urge the House to accept those amendments.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—Labor opposes the GST for reasons that are self-serving and small-minded. These measures to share power and sources of revenue more equitably between the states and the Commonwealth bring two of these reasons into sharp relief. The issues are the transparency and simplicity of the GST system and Labor's continuing agenda to centralise power in Canberra for the benefit of its union mates. The member for Wills was a walking, talking example of that. In 13 years in office, Labor relied on the murky recesses of the old tax system to hide its dealings and its deals. It did not want to support the states or share power with them, and it did not want to be accountable.
I am sure that people would want to believe that if there was a realistic alternative to the government's tax reform package it would reside over there with the opposition. It is therefore instructive to consider their proposal, which is to maintain the current system, and their track record of operating the current system when they were in power. In 1985, for example, the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, abolished tax sharing agreements and introduced financial assistance grants. He then promised there would be a two per cent real increase in financial assistance grants for each of the next two years. He then reneged. The treatment of FAGs by the Commonwealth over the following three years was completely arbitrary. Funding was actually cut in 1988-89 by 2.8 per cent, in 1989-90 by 2.9 per cent and in 1990-91 by 3.7 per cent. There was also a series of so-called technical adjustments, but all of them were negative.
Labor relied on a compliant and often sycophantic media to force the states to toe 
 the line and to further its agenda for centralised power in Canberra for its own purposes. Labor cannot live with a GST. If ever they were in government, they could not stand the open public scrutiny that would be applied through a system with one tax rate and a transparent administrative structure. State government will be reinvigorated. No wonder Labor shrink from the idea. You would think they had seen a few cloves of garlic or a silver bullet. With these changes, their agenda of centralising power, of abolishing the states and running the country like a giant soup kitchen, a la Paul Keating will be further away than ever.
Members would recall that Labor's agenda for centralisation was thrown into the open during Bob Hawke's last few weeks in power. After systematically ripping off the states year after year and trying his darnedest to diminish their budgetary strength, he finally offered them a whole new contract. It was futile of course. The Keating mates plunged in their knives and Hawke's offer of a new deal, which had been greeted with a shout of acclamation Australia-wide, was never seen or heard of again. In power, Paul Keating set about developing his vision of a nation on welfare, and just about succeeded. Sure, he offered states a three-year rolling allocation of those financial assistance grants, but the states often found themselves facing cuts to general purpose payments. For example, in 1994-95, the states received guaranteed payments, but general purpose capital funds worth $330 million were abolished. That is the way Labor played the game. It is a far cry from the new deal now being offered in the government's tax reform package.
I do not think it is overstating the situation to say, quite clearly, that the GST will save the states. It will save them from irrelevance. It will save Australians from Labor's plan to centralise all power in Canberra. It will save us the continuing embarrassment of state based services being duplicated ad nauseam, and heaven help us from future Labor budgets following the Labor pattern and growing out of control like Paul Keating's piggery. Ask the average Australian where the old concept of trust between Australians and their parlia 
 mentary representatives went wrong and they will name Paul Keating faster than you can write it down.
In my book, the legislation we are reviewing today does more to re-establish a meaningful relationship between parliaments and the people than any amount of huffing and puffing about parliamentary standards of debate. The way to a better relationship, a better representation of democracy, comes by providing parliament with resources adequate to prepare, present and implement a long-term strategy to manage the future. We are talking about the competent management of services, welfare, economic growth and social development in our community by Commonwealth, state and local governments working effectively together. That is precisely what we have not got today.
The GST is a growth tax. The Commonwealth will provide this money direct to the states. They will receive $27 billion in 2000-01, $32 billion in 2001-02 and $33 billion the following year. I believe those amounts are conservative, but what is important is the trend in the amounts provided to the states under this system. They actually increase. That is a revolution in the financial management of the states. For decades, Australian states have managed their affairs based on a system that provided them with less revenue each year—especially under the paternal policies of the former Labor government. Each year, they were more and more reliant on the FAGs and other Commonwealth payments allocated from the Commonwealth soup kitchen. Now I am sure members can go to their state budgets and find, year after year, steady increases in state revenue funding a steady increase in state services.
But that is not the point. The real scandal of public financial administration in this country over the last few years have been the lengths to which state governments have been driven in their efforts to prop up their failing sources of revenue. We have seen speed cameras, tobacco taxes, gaming taxes, toll roads and rules that forbid expenditure on infrastructure that does not generate revenue. We have seen asset sales appear out of the blue. We have seen corporatisation. We have 
 seen the otherwise sensible policies of economic rationalism taken to absurd lengths. These seemingly increasingly crazy short-term and desperate measures have popped up unheralded on budget nights from one end of the country to the other. States starved of a meaningful growth tax have been beating themselves and their residents over the head with downright stupid schemes. They say and do anything just to fill the many new holes in revenue every year. States have hospital construction and road building programs that stretch for years into the future without any current means of paying for them. Without the change that is so long overdue, the only certainty in state planning is the trend to absurd impromptu decision making will accelerate.
We will see more crazy schemes designed just to boost revenue. In Queensland, for example, we have just seen our speed limits lowered to 50 kilometres an hour. Why? I am sure it has nothing to do with road safety and everything to do with the coming state budget. We have the on again off again sale of the Queensland TAB and the stinking absurdity of retrospective state gaming legislation that is so transparently contrived to increase the value of the TAB when it is sold. We have the spiralling state tobacco taxes, and today they remain under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and still used to prop up the states' failing finances.
State bureaucrats Australia wide still share the desperate hope that no matter how high those tobacco tax rates are lifted people will keep smoking. It is a joke to present these taxes as a health measure. They raise revenue and nothing else. If it was otherwise and the motivation had anything to do with health, the rates of the tobacco franchise fee would be 10 times its current level. The fact is that traditionally increases in the tobacco tax rate are just enough to maximise the return to state governments. In their own best interests, states have worked to ensure that the number actually giving up smoking is kept to the bare minimum. I am sorry if I sound overly cynical, but it is no wonder that people are cynical with politics and no wonder that for a while people were prepared to grab the 
 dangerous and inept policies espoused by my main opponent in the October election in the federal seat of Blair.
We owe it to our constituents to establish a system of taxation that provides for the present and future needs of Australians without resorting to the cockeyed opportunism that is now trotted out by the states. Sure, year after year they eventually find enough to make ends meet but in the process they regularly insult their residents, local authorities and industries with a whole range of new injustices. I am not surprised people are fed up. I should say that under the current system the Commonwealth is often similarly afflicted. The important difference between the government's proposals and the existing system is the sanity and certainty we will restore to intergovernmental relations in this country. In the future, people sold a 10-year hospital rebuilding program should be able to see at the outset where the money for such an ambitious scheme will come from. If a $1 billion water infrastructure scheme is proposed, the same principle should apply.
The big question today should be to the states: on what will they spend the billions of extra dollars they will receive as the GST grows and the discriminatory pre-emptive state taxes of the past are phased out? The defence minister, the member for Ryan, made this point very well in August last year. Because of the strength of the GST revenue stream, he said that states will be in a position a few years down the track to completely eliminate payroll tax. In Queensland's case, that represents something like 26 per cent of current state revenue which is now being gained through an unfair discriminatory tax on jobs.
The Victorian Premier, quoted by AAP, in response to the member for Ryan stated the date by which states could be weaned off payroll tax. He said that, assuming a five per cent GST revenue growth rate, payroll tax in Victoria could be history by 2006. That is just six years to supplant a major discrimatory tax that is a huge disincentive to employment Australia wide. That is not the only option. Roads, schools, hospitals, seniors' entitlements—all these options—can be finally 
 addressed by states utilising the GST. They can choose where they will spend the dividend. Councils are another option particularly deserving of greater financial support. Fat chance for any of this unless the GST is endorsed.
I pity those, if the GST does not proceed, who will have to put up with the lame excuses and downright lies that will continue to characterise budgetary planning, particularly at the state level. It is a simple choice. It is future planning versus guesswork. It is accountability versus responsibility. It is transparency versus mud.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The GST is bad for the nation, but it is especially bad for Queensland. So I was astonished to hear the member for Blair failing, yet again, to stick up for Queensland in the face of the impact that the GST will have on our state. Queensland did not agree at the Premiers Conference in November to the arrangements that were proposed by the Treasurer. That did not stop the Treasurer standing up here in the parliament at question time asserting baldly that Queensland did agree to those arrangements. I checked as late as this morning to confirm that Queensland did not agree. The member for Cook asserted in this debate that Queensland agreed to these arrangements. That is completely untrue. It does no service to this parliament to have government members of the parliament asserting something as truth which in fact is completely untrue. Evidence was given to the Senate GST inquiry by the Queensland Treasury that they did not agree at all to the arrangements that were proposed last November.
The impact of the GST arrangements on the state budget in Queensland will be to reduce state government revenue effectively by some $465 million. Earlier this week 32 leading businessmen and women in Queensland wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister pointing this fact out and imploring him to look after the interests of Queensland, but I am afraid that has fallen on deaf ears. Authors of the letter included representatives of the Bank of Queensland, Morgan Stockbroking, BHP Coal, Queensland Investment Corporation, the 
 Canegrowers Association, Sir Frank Moore, Bell Morgan Securities, Southern Pacific Petroleum, Ariadne Australia and MIM Holdings. The letter said in part:
Dear Mr Howard
Queensland's business community urges you to treat Queensland with equity and justice when implementing the Commonwealth's tax reform package.
Under the current proposal, Queensland will lose $465 million of revenue generated by the Goods and Services tax during the new tax system's transition period. This revenue will effectively be used to subsidise the removal of taxes and charges in high-tax States such as New South Wales and Victoria.
Because Queensland is a low tax jurisdiction, the implementation of the GST will lead to overall higher per capita taxes being paid in this State. This is because the State taxes that the GST is to replace are considerably lower in Queensland than elsewhere, but all Australians will pay a uniform rate of GST.
The letter goes on. Queensland is the low tax state and therefore will be disadvantaged by these arrangements. In addition, amongst the mainland states, as the member for Melbourne has pointed out, Queensland has the lowest per capita incomes. Therefore, the regressive impacts of the GST will be felt more severely in Queensland than in any other state.
That is not the end of the story, however. Queensland will again be especially hard hit by the impact of the GST on jobs. Even the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy, has quantified an impact on Queensland five times greater than on any other state of Australia. The Prime Minister's preferred modeller is indicating that Queensland will be especially disadvantaged by the GST. Professor Dixon was commissioned from Monash University to do work on the employment impacts of the GST. He has found that in Queensland job losses of up to 22,680 can be contemplated. In Brisbane alone, there is the prospect for almost 11,000 job losses. The entire GST package is ill-conceived. As I say, in the context of the nation as a whole, Queensland is the big loser from the GST package.
The arrangements that are being debated here today in the legislation also put into grave doubt the future of the Federation. The 
 reason I say that is this: by effectively allocating the $32 billion of revenue from the GST to the states whilst removing the financial assistance grants, what will happen in the future is that when advocates legitimately arguing for increased expenditure in health, education and family services come to the doors of Canberra ministers, Canberra ministers will say, `No. The states have got the GST. Go and see them.'
The pressure will be on the states to deal with these things and in very much a non-uniform way. The pressure that ultimately will come to bear will be a pressure to increase the rate of the GST. As advocates for increased spending on health, education, Medicare and family services approach the states, they will then be saying, `Well, if you don't have enough revenue, maybe we have to increase the GST rate.' That underlines the point that the lock-in mechanism being debated here today is nothing but a sham. We have seen the reality of what happens in nations that introduce a GST. In 22 out of 23 countries with a GST, the rate has been increased.
What about the impact on local government? In my own area, the Logan City Council has had an analysis done by accounting firm KPMG with the Local Government Association of Queensland which indicates that more than 40 per cent of Logan City Council's charges will, or may, bear the GST. Again, local government is going to be disadvantaged by the GST arrangements.
If this is such a great tax, why is the Prime Minister so reluctant to mention those three little letters—GST? I have done a bit of analysis of the Prime Minister's responses to a vast array of questions that have been asked of him in questions without notice in this parliament since the beginning of this year. In response to those questions without notice, the Prime Minister has spoken almost 4,000 words. It may interest this parliament to know how many times he has mentioned `GST'. The answer is that he has let the word `GST' slip just six times. He had a very bad day on 9 March when he mentioned it four times. It is quite clear that his pollster has told him not to talk about the GST and to use the euphe 
 mism of `tax reform'. He did have a very bad day in the parliament in letting it slip, but it is quite clear that the Prime Minister is avoiding the use of the word `GST' because he knows what we know—that is, it is a tax that is bad for the nation. If it is such a good tax, why is he so reluctant to even mention the word?
It reminds me of the episode of Fawlty Towers when Basil Fawlty was told, `For goodness sake, don't mention the war.' After a tragic set of events in the restaurant, he came back at the end of that particular episode and said, `I only mentioned the war once, but I think I got away with it.' That is what our Prime Minister is doing. He only mentioned the GST once, but he thinks he may have got away with it. In fact, he has not got away with it at all.
This is the last day of sitting before the Senate GST inquiry is due to report. I would like to briefly review the evidence that has come forward to the inquiry. Firstly, in relation to the adequacy of revenue under the current arrangements, we hear that the wholesale sales tax is incapable of contributing to generating the revenue needs of Australia's future. In relation to the wholesale sales tax, analysis performed by Access Economics shows that the base of revenue is eroding by only $100 million a year. So we have a $32 billion tax to deal with an erosion of $100 million a year. Indeed, Professor Peter Dixon of Monash University has shown that the revenue projections from the existing system are as healthy as those from the proposed GST arrangements. That completely exposes the myth that we must have a GST to deal with Australia's future revenue needs.
In relation to the economic impacts, there has been a litany of evidence about the adverse economic impacts of the GST. Again, the Prime Minister's preferred modeller has shown that in the most optimistic circumstances the GST will contribute just 65c a week per family—that is, in the absolutely most optimistic situation of no short-term job losses, a full passing through of indirect tax reductions and, in addition, that there would be absolutely no GST paperwork burden. We have heard from Arthur Andersen and other 
 accounting firms that the GST legislation of some 200 pages is far more complex than the New Zealand legislation which is 75 pages. They summarise it as being an administrative nightmare.
We know therefore that the GST fails the test on revenue and fails the test on economic impacts. There will be large-scale job losses from the GST. It is an incredibly complex tax and is difficult to administer. Most of all, it is a very unfair tax. We heard from ACOSS and various church groups yesterday about the unfairness and the unacceptability of the tax package. There is no doubt that this is one of the most unfair proposals ever put before the Australian people. I can assure you that the Labor Party will continue to do everything it can to stop the GST proceeding.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—This legislation introduces the most far-reaching reforms to Commonwealth-state financial relations since Federation. This legislation is an integral part of a much larger plan for reform of Australia's taxation system—a taxation system that rewards effort with incentive, provides a secure source of revenue for Australia's states and territories, establishes a taxation system that is fair and consistent and simplifies taxation obligations for Australian business by harmonising taxation payment dates and reducing their frequency.
Since Federation, states and territories have battled with the problem of having to budget without a secure revenue base. This has resulted in an inconsistent system of indirect taxes levied by the states and territories and financial assistance grants provided by the Commonwealth. This inadequate financial relationship between the states and the Commonwealth has resulted in a range of inefficiencies and inconsistent taxes between different state and territories. Under this legislation, the Commonwealth will transfer the entire GST revenue to the states and territories and, in return, the states will abolish nine of their current taxes and accept greater financial responsibility for their affairs.
The introduction of the GST will fund the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and nine separate state taxes. This will reduce the tax 
 burden on Australian business by just on $10 billion each year from 2001-02. With access to the entire GST revenue, states and territories will have a secure and growing source revenue. This will give the states and territories greater autonomy in their own financial affairs and greater financial independence from the Commonwealth, providing certainty in revenue and eliminating debate over the general purpose grants at the annual Premiers Conference.
An important area of reform covered in this legislation is the assumption of responsibility for the funding of local government by the states and territories. The states and territories currently have legislative responsibility for local government, and it is only appropriate they assume financial responsibility for local government as well. Under the measures contained in this legislation, responsibility for local government financial assistance grants will be transferred to the states and territories from 1 July 2000. The reforms to Commonwealth-state financial relations contained in this legislation will provide the states and territories with a strong, growing tax base that will improve their financial position. In return, the states and territories will forgo the current financial assistance grants and a range of inefficient taxes and assume additional expenditure responsibilities such as funding for local government.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—I am going to take this brief opportunity prior to a vote to point out that the government will not be accepting the proposed second reading amendment put forward by the member for Hotham.
Mr Crean interjecting—
—Oh, what a great surprise! Here we see the member for Hotham again going back to the future, as he did last night in an address in Sydney when he talked about the vague, esoteric principles of the new, modern Labor approach to economic reality.
I am here to inform the House that the bunch of proposals put forward in the amendment by the member for Hotham will be rejected because they are inaccurate and because they will not apply, because we have 
 put forward a package which sets out that the GST will be 10 per cent, and that the states will receive all of the GST revenue.
The package replaces nine taxes. Importantly, of those nine taxes, three relate to financial services. They are: financial institutions duty, debits tax and stamp duty on the transfer of shares. If you ever wanted for a moment to be reminded of the insidiousness of some of those taxes, particularly debits tax, then I remind people that, if you have a chequebook attached to your bank account, every time you make a deduction from that bank account you pay debits tax because you have a chequebook attached. That is 30c per withdrawal less than $100. If you have two bank accounts—a chequebook account and a normal savings account—on each withdrawal from your chequebook account you will have to pay debits tax. On each withdrawal from your normal savings account, you do not have to pay debits tax. So there is an incentive not to have two bank accounts, but to have one bank account.
This insidious tax, which so few people know they are paying, raises $1 billion a year. The great irony about this tax is that, during the debate about referral of debits tax from the Commonwealth to the states in the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990, the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, said:
This Bill will facilitate transfer of responsibility for debits tax from the Commonwealth to States and Territories. It does this by amending the Debits Tax Act to terminate imposition of the tax by the Commonwealth. The transfer of the tax base to the States has the potential to rationalise the taxation of financial services and provides the states with an additional revenue source.
In 1990, debits tax raised $390 million. In 2001, it will raise over $1 billion. Who was the minister that referred it at the time? Who was the minister in Hansard ? The current member for Hotham. What a surprise!
The current member for Hotham is giving us this gratuitous lecture about the tax base, about revenue stream, about growth taxes. He knows what a growth tax is because he was responsible for the transfer of a so-called `narrowing base tax' from the Commonwealth to the states back in 1990.
	 The interesting thing is that the states continue to deliver the hospitals, the schools, the police and most of the roads, yet they have a revenue base that is in effect deteriorating overall. That is why the states have started to increase the amount of gambling allowed in individual jurisdictions; that is why they have been searching for new revenue sources to plug the holes of their existing revenue base. That is why we have seen enormous growth in the number of casinos and poker machines in Australia. It is because the states are desperately searching for a revenue base that will support their existing continuing-to-grow expenditure items, such as hospitals, schools, roads and police.
As a result of this, the government is replacing nine taxes with one. We are replacing a narrow revenue stream with a growth revenue stream. Until such time as members of the opposition recognise that there needs to be fundamental reform in Commonwealth-state relations, until such time as members of the opposition recognise that the states cannot continue to rely on a redundant dirt-road taxation system when we have a Ferrari like economy, they have no credibility coming into this House and opposing each of our bills that form part of a package that the Australian people have endorsed—and endorsed overwhelmingly.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The process leading to this debate, as with the earlier ones today, has been a disgrace. The government quite deliberately delayed the introduction of these bills concerning the wine equalisation tax and the luxury car tax until last Wednesday, giving the opposition minimal time to examine them, given their complexity, and generally treating the parliament with contempt. As I indicated earlier, we are not going to allow this to continue into the future. These bills are very important to both the wine industry and the car industry. It is not fair to those industries that they should have been forced to deal with so much uncertainty over the past many months.
As well as the GST, the wine industry is facing a second tax—the wine equalisation tax. This second tax is very complex—around 86 pages of legislation contained in five bills. It arises for one reason and one reason only—that is, the arrogance of the Treasurer. The Treasurer would not embrace the idea of a multirate direct tax. He wanted a single rate GST, and he does not care about the consequences. The consequences for wine producers are more complex legislation, as acknowledged by Arthur Andersen in its submission on the GST and the inquiries attached thereto.
Furthermore, the GST is applied on top of the WET—the wine equalisation tax—so wine consumers are facing a tax on a tax. This tax package represents a huge revenue grab on the wine industry and wine consumers. It is estimated that these proposed arrangements will increase the tax on wine by around $147 million from the current level. To maintain current revenue effort plus cover the additional service component, the industry estimates that the wine equalisation tax should be 24.5 per cent, instead it is being slugged 29 per cent under this bill—some equalisation when, in fact, the end result is to increase the tax! It is a funny definition of equalisation.
This will lead to an increase in wine prices across the board of around four per cent, with over the bar prices set to increase by around six per cent. But where was the admission of this price increase in the tax package? The answer is, like so much else, it was not there. The only figure mentioned in the tax package was 1.9 per cent, which is all that the cask wine will increase by under the most favourable of assumptions. We all know that the general inflation claim of 1.9 per cent is completely false. Even the Treasury, the government's own department, has admitted that the inflation impact of the GST is going to start at 3.1 per cent and rise because that 3.1 per cent assumes that there will be a 100 per cent pass-on of the state taxes being abolished. Not one witness before the Senate inquiries believes that assumption, not one, and the government has demonstrated no evidence by which that assumption can hold up.
So, instead of the 1.9 per cent inflation effect of this GST package, by the time the Senate inquiry has completed its business, we will have the inflation effect of this package of between four and five per cent. The fact that the wine industry says it is four and six per cent is just further evidence that the government has understated the inflation effect. That inflation effect is terribly important because not only is it bad for the economy if inflation goes up because it is off the back of higher inflation that interest rates go up, but it also means the compensation package for the GST is inadequate. This is the con 
 that this government has been perpetrating on the Australian public. The wine industry is confirming that the price impact of this package will be in the four to five per cent category.
So, as usual, the government has not disclosed the full impact of its tax proposals to the people. But, in the case of the wine equalisation tax, the issue gets worse. Not only did the government not come clean with consumers about the real effects, it did not even say what the rate of the wine equalisation tax would be nor what types of sales it would apply to. So the industry has been held in limbo since August last year. It did not know the new tax regime that it may face until last Wednesday, and the point made by the industry is that the 29 per cent hike is too high.
To maintain current revenue and the increased GST related service component, a rate of only 24½ per cent is needed; instead the industry is being slugged 29 per cent. The industry was not told about the high rate that it would face before the election. Like so much in this package, people were not told before the election. Some wine producers have even come before the Senate GST inquiry and stated that they were not even aware of the wine equalisation tax proposal. Understandably, they were very upset when they found out.
The Treasurer runs around saying that he is abolishing so-called hidden taxes. In fact, he is trying to introduce what he normally calls two new hidden taxes. That is what is involved here. The level of hypocrisy from him in this debate is astonishing. We are told by the Treasurer that the wholesale sales tax is broken and no good, that the world will end unless we get rid of it, but on wine what do we find? We find that the advantages of the wholesale sales tax have been used in the development of the new wine equalisation tax. Indeed, the conclusion on page 68 of the explanatory memorandum of the wine equalisation tax bill states:
The familiar concepts of the WST have been incorporated into the WET to simplify the introduction of the WET to the wine industry. 

So suddenly the wholesale sales tax has gone from a broken down 1930s type tax which is only relevant in African countries to a tax which will `simplify the introduction of the WET to the wine industry'. What hypocrisy. In addition, the Treasurer has often told the House how we must move to a value added tax. One of the so-called claimed benefits is that each transaction in the chain will be fully taxed—in fact, this is the reason for the massive explosion in compliance costs associated with the GST.
But, in introducing the new wine equalisation tax, which model has the Treasurer chosen? The efficient, current sales tax system where taxpayers can simply quote a number and get goods tax free, thereby deferring paying tax until the last wholesale sale, or the supposedly superior GST style system? Which one? You have guessed it. The Treasurer has chosen the wholesale sales tax model, the one he comes into this parliament and denigrates. The explanatory memorandum quietly notes:
The opportunity has been taken to incorporate quotation for the WET within the GST framework.
That is an admission that the current wholesale sales tax exemption system is simpler and more efficient than the cumbersome GST. As Arthur Andersen has stated to the Senate GST inquiry:
. . . the ATO—
the Australian Taxation Office—
has publicly acknowledged that in order to collect $30 billion in net revenue—
that is what the GST will raise in net terms—
it will collect $40 billion gross.
It will collect $40 billion to collect $30 billion. The wholesale sales tax exemption system is a much more efficient system than the GST, and that is the system that is now being chosen by the government for the wine equalisation tax.
I want to also go to the amendments that the shadow minister for small business will be moving later in the debate. He will be moving some important amendments to this legislation, because he represents one of the premier wine regions of Australia and he knows first-hand the needs of the wine industry.
Before the last election, Labor announced we would look at the exemption for cellar door sales. That was our policy. We have done that, and we will be moving an amendment to exempt the first $100,000 in sales from the wine equalisation tax in order to encourage wine tourism and to benefit small wineries. We have also taken particular care to address the special situation which often occurs in Tasmania—that is, cellar door sales being run on a shared basis. Often very small wineries do not have their own resources to be able to conduct their own cellar door sales, so they combine with other wineries to have a common cellar door sale facility. This legislation treats these sales as a sale which will qualify for the exemption.
The second amendment concerns an attempted con by the government. In the tax package, they said that there would be no GST on samples and other promotional uses of wine. Yet in the wine equalisation tax details released only last week we find that the government want to tax wine used for samples and other promotions through the wine equalisation tax. If the GST is out, why isn't the wine equalisation tax out? That is obviously an inconsistency and it is opposed by Labor. The tax regime should be consistent and that is what is proposed by our amendment.
Finally, on the issue of the luxury car tax, the opposition does not oppose the luxury car tax proposal before the House. Given that the House has already passed the GST, it would not be just to argue against this equalisation tax. The only result would be that the price of luxury motor vehicles, which are overwhelmingly imported, would go down. Clearly, that would be unfair and Labor does not argue about that position.
However, what we do argue is this: whilst we are totally opposed to the GST, it would have been far more efficient to have a multi-rate GST to achieve the government's aims, rather than a forcing of the industry to deal with a whole new tax on top of the GST. This double taxation model has been criticised by leading international accounting firm Arthur Andersen as being more complex than a multi-rate GST system. It will lead to cascad 
 ing, as no credit is allowed to business in respect of this tax. Whilst I am not arguing that this is inappropriate, I am merely pointing out the further hypocrisy of the government in relation to this issue. If a Labor tax cascades, then it is terrible. That is the argument of the government. But if a coalition tax cascades through the economy then they do not want to mention it. What hypocrisy. We do not oppose the legislation. We merely point out the double standards that it represents.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—The importance of this part of the government's tax reform package—A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Bill 1999  and the cognate bills—is quite significant. What we are setting out to do here is iron out some of the corners of discrepancy between the existing ridiculously complicated and archaic system and the new system, which seeks to come up with a minimalisation of tax requirements across the economy.
There are areas where no doubt we will get into difficulty, because from time to time there will be wrinkles in the system. The pure fact about it is that if you do not have a wine equalisation tax then the price of your favourite drop will go down significantly. If you are a person who is into the odd tipple, you might think that is a pretty good thing, but in the general community I do not think there would be widespread support for the Commonwealth endorsing a massive drop in the price of bottles of wine, cask wine or anything of that sort.
So what we are setting out to do here is merely to come up with a system where the impact is neutral. The government has set out, in organising the whole of its tax reform package, to organise a crossover between the old system and the new system, and between one and the other no doubt there are discrepancies that need to be dealt with specifically. The wine equalisation tax and the luxury car tax are two such examples.
The wine equalisation tax is set at a rate of 29 per cent. The purpose of that is to catch up and re-collect the amount of money that was being collected under the old system. Currently, there is a 41 per cent sales tax on wine 
 which includes a 15 per cent state share. The impact of this—and I know the member for Hotham went on at some length about this—on the price of cask wine is 1.9 per cent which is the general increase in CPI forecast for the whole of the tax package. I do not think that is unfair. I think people would expect, if the CPI goes up by 1.9 per cent, that the price of a cask would go up 1.9 per cent. In fact, there is also an estimated impact on the cost of bottled wine of between two and three per cent. I realise that people would argue that perhaps that should be 1.9 per cent too, but I do not think that it is possible to be entirely prescriptive in this process. At this stage we do not know, for example, just how effectively the government's introduction of these various tax reform measures will assist the wineries, the grape growers and all the other people who rely on the wine industry. I think there will be a tremendous boon to those industries flowing from the GST itself.
If we look at one particular issue, the wine equalisation tax, in itself, will not apply to exported wine. That is a tremendous incentive for the wine industry to export. That is a situation which does not currently exist. There is, at the moment, a wholesale sales tax and, if wine is being exported, it bears the cost of that as well. I think what we have got here is a tremendous opportunity for the wine industry that it will seize with both hands. On top of that, there is also the added cost of wholesale sales tax embedded in the various other goods and bits and pieces that those industries buy as part of their operations. They rely on those, so when the GST comes into play they will accrue all the advantages that flow from the wider GST implementation.
The introduction of the wine equalisation tax is a good example of the government setting out to establish the best way forward—a system under which we are seeking to minimise tax, to minimise the red tape that goes with it. Look at what we are doing. We are replacing the present wholesale sales tax and a state sales tax with something that is based completely at the federal level and which is rebated to the states and which, I might add, the states can then choose to rebate back to cellar door operators, if they so 
 desire. I would urge them to do so. The states will have a huge amount of cash coming to them under the GST and, really, it is up to them to start saying how they are going to spend it. Rebating cellar door sales is something that they could choose to do. They could go beyond their pre-existing part of 15 per cent of the current 41 per cent if they wanted to. If they wanted to give an incentive—particularly to the wine industry—and I would urge them to do so, then they could rebate beyond that. That is entirely up to them. They certainly will be bearing the benefits of the government's improved position in relation to the goods and services tax. That is an important issue. Exporting is something that we all want to see more of.
I note that the income forecast under the wine equalisation tax is $595 million in 2000-01, $695 million in the following year and $724 million in the year after that. Those forecasts are designed to come up with a situation of neutrality. We have looked at the forecast situation under the existing arrangements. The idea is to try to smooth the change—not to provide one section of the industry either with a huge advantage or to take it away, to undercut an advantage they already have. It is a very important measure by the government and one which people should wholeheartedly support. The states should bear it in mind when they come to look at rebating cellar door sales, for example.
I turn now to the luxury car tax, which is arranged under exactly the same principles. The idea of the luxury car tax is that we should organise a crossover that is basically cost-neutral. Luxury cars are defined as being cars above the car depreciation limit. Currently, that is set at $55,134 and annually indexed. The problem at the moment is that currently luxury cars are taxed under the wholesale sales tax at 45 per cent and other cars at 22 per cent. So that is above and below that figure of $55,134. The government is setting out to  avoid the obvious, terrible ramifications of introducing a tax and not compensating, so that luxury cars overnight would go through the floor from a 45 per cent tax down to a 10 per cent. Hallelujah to the fact that we have got a drop from 22 per cent 
 to 10 per cent in relation to ordinary cars, and it will be good to see that flowing into the system, but the idea that luxury cars should become so much cheaper all at once would seem a bit obscene to the average Australian. The relativities should be maintained and that is what the luxury car tax is all about.
Important things to bear in mind about this part of the government's tax reform package are that it applies at the retail level and it applies so that businesses will not be able to claim input tax credits on the luxury car tax component of what they pay, and that it is flexible enough to ensure that, for example, if a car is modified to accommodate the needs of a disabled person, then those modifications are not taxed by the luxury car tax and also that vehicles like emergency vehicles are not subject to the luxury car tax.
Overall, the government's tax reform package is an important incentive to the business community. It is an important incentive to average Australians. What I think gets up the nose of average Australians at the moment is the obsession that members opposite and members participating in the Senate inquiry have with the minute details of the package as opposed to the important broad sweep of the improvement that it provides for our country. We are in a position in which under this tax reform package we are going to be able to plan with certainty for the future. There is not a man or woman in the country who would oppose that idea. But to come in here and start carping on like this about some obscure part of the package, in terms of whether or not cellar door sales will be rebated, I think really demeans the whole purpose of what we are on about here. We are setting up a situation that will enable this country to go forward into the new millennium with a much improved position that will apply not only for average businesses—
—Have you got small wineries in your electorate?
—I certainly do have small wineries in my electorate and they are doing very well, thank you. They will do even better because of the advantages that are provided by the government's goods 
 and services tax and by the improvements that they will see in their average daily business activities, particularly when it comes to providing material for export, which is something that small wineries can do just as the larger wineries do.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—My respect for the member for Blair has just grown enormously. For him to be so brave, given that he has small wineries in his electorate, to come in here and say that the proposal to protect those small wineries represents nothing more than a bit of carping on the part of the opposition is just crazy. A brave man he is indeed to come in here all alone—I notice there are no comrades on the other side, and I notice the minister is here on duty but I did not hear any words of support—and express that view about the small end of the wine industry. That is very courageous indeed.
The opposition remains opposed to the regressive GST. We opposed it before the election. We promised the electorate that in government we would not follow the course of the present government and we promised the electorate that in opposition we would do all in our power to knock over a regressive tax—a tax, as the Senate inquiry has shown, which does nothing to boost the Australian economy but does lots to hit people for six—those people least able to afford the burden that that tax will impose upon them.
However, the arrangements this tax bill seeks to put in place will be necessary if the Senate passes the government's GST bills. On that basis, the opposition is not opposing them but, as has been mentioned by the member for Hotham, we will be proposing some amendments which seek to make the wine equalisation tax much fairer. In terms of the luxury car tax, the opposition will not be opposing that either, but it just goes to show what an untidy arrangement the goods and services tax will be if ever given effect.
The importance of the wine industry in Australia cannot be overstated. It now employs more than 60,000 Australians directly and, of course, many more indirectly. Most of those people are employed in the regions. In my own electorate of Hunter, the wine sector 
 is one of the main industries which underpins the local economy. The wine industry is a significant export industry for this country. One billion dollars in wine is expected to be exported from this country next year, and the projections are that the export side of the industry will continue to grow at a rate of about 25 per cent per annum.
The GST bills provided the government with an excellent opportunity to revisit the issues of tax on wine—to have a debate about the impact of the taxation system on the industry, to have a debate about how it affects consumption decisions, to have a debate about how it affects investment in the industry, to have a debate about how it affects export growth, and to have a debate about how, if it all, it addresses the public health issues and social issues that flow from alcohol consumption. But what did we get? No real community consultation, no inquiry, no submissions invited. We got 368 words from the Treasurer during his second reading speech—368 words about a massive tax change in an industry crucial to this nation's economy; 368 words about an industry now exporting its head off.
There was no debate about price elasticities, no debate about import competition, no debate about public health, no debate about those social impacts of alcohol consumption which I mentioned earlier—just a measly 368 words from a Treasurer who, I admit, focused on the big issues but who has no concern whatsoever for an industry which is experiencing some exciting growth and, in particular, he has no concern at all for the smaller wineries which are going to be disadvantaged as a result of the government's decision to choose an ad valorem system. There was no concern at all expressed about the fact that the impost will be 29 per cent, even though the Wine Federation in Australia has demonstrated quite clearly that a tax of around 24½ per cent would have been sufficient to make this a revenue neutral proposal.
The debate over the relative merits of an ad valorem based wine equalisation tax and a volumetric based tax is one we should have had. We should have had it in this place and we should have had it in the wider community. There is no doubt that, relative to the big 
 players, the smaller wineries are  going to be disadvantaged by an ad valorem based wine equalisation tax.
I have already mentioned the fact that the member for Blair was quite brave to come in here all alone without qualification to support the WET, but I really have to ask myself: where is the member for McEwen? Where is the member for Ballarat? Where is the member for Eden-Monaro? Where indeed is the member for Forrest? There is a very interesting trend running through this parliament. Whenever we have a debate in this place on an issue on which the backbench is offering no support, it is reflected in the speakers list. It was reflected when we were debating the petroleum repeal bills and it is reflected again here today. Where are those members with small wineries in their electorates? On our side we have the member for Lyons on the speakers list—which is not unexpected—and I look forward to his contribution. We also have the member for Bass. Again, she is someone who represents a wine region very well.
—What about the member for Barton?
—The member for Barton does not mind a bit of regional wine I might add, but he does not represent a wine region. Yet from the other side we have had one speaker—I repeat, one speaker—from a wine region who was prepared to come in here to support a proposal which will disadvantage their local industry. The wine tourism industry is a major employer in this country, particularly in the regions. When people visit those regions—when they come to the Hunter or when they go to the Barossa, to Margaret River and to the Tamar Valley—they do so to visit the small wineries. They go there to experience the pleasure of wine tasting and all those other things those small wineries have to offer. Of course, while they are there they visit our restaurants, they take up accommodation and, generally speaking, spend lots of money.
I would have thought that the wine tourism industry was just so important to the regions that the government would have had it at the forefront of its mind when considering the 
 form of the wine equalisation tax. More attention should have been given to the impact of the WET on those industries. We should have had, as I said, a full parliamentary inquiry. We should have given the smaller players an opportunity to appear and to put their case. They represent some 550 of the 1,000 wineries which traverse this country and they should have had an opportunity to be heard. It is not surprising that the big players like the Winemakers Federation of Australia have had their day—and the government has been very quick to jump on the ad valorem train—but those small wineries should have been given an opportunity.
I have to concede that, without that inquiry, the opposition is in no position to be advocating here today that we should shift to the volumetric system, but we should have had that opportunity. We are proposing amendments which, as the member for Hotham mentioned, will go a long, long way to compensating those small wineries that are going to be adversely affected by these changes. The amendments will do basically two things. The first will exempt from the wine equalisation tax all cellar door sales up to an amount of $100,000 of wholesale value each year, and the other will exempt from the wine equalisation tax all promotions and those wines given away at wine tasting.
The member for Hotham made a very important point. The wine equalisation tax is supposed to be about topping up the GST to ensure that, for those public health reasons and those social policy reasons, the price of wine does not fall. That is probably a reasonable community expectation. But how do you justify putting an equalisation tax on something that does not have a GST upon it—that is, wine tasting and promotions? There is no logic to that whatsoever. I can only assume and hope that it was a mistake in the drafting. I do appeal to those on the other side to at least support that part of our amendments today. This was a wine equalisation tax which was supposed to be revenue neutral: it is not. Not enough thought has been given to it. I appeal to members on the other side to support the opposition's amendments.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—It was a very good point made by my colleague at the table, the member for Hunter, that when we get into an issue on which some regional areas and regional industries need to be represented, the presence on the speakers list of those members on the government side who represent those regions is always very scarce—very scarce indeed. They just do not come in and speak on the bills. We have had one speaker from the other side on this wine equalisation tax legislation. All the members from those regional seats who should be here speaking and giving representation to their areas have failed to do so. They just butt out and do not bother coming into the debate. That is an indictment of them, of the way they are representing their seats and of the way they are representing their constituents and the industries important to their constituents.
The honourable member for Hotham and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke of the timing of these bills and the lack of time we have had to prepare for a very complex debate. The honourable member who preceded me, the member for Hunter, was quite right to point out that it would have been much better to have a debate after we had had a parliamentary inquiry to look at these different levels. It is beginning to emerge that there are really two wine industries in Australia. There is the large wine industry which represents the large players who have done extraordinarily well to give this country great export dollars and who need to be praised. There are also the smaller wineries who are playing a very important part in not only regional areas of our country but also employment in regional areas. Sometimes it is casual employment, but sometimes up to 200 people work in the small wineries I know of that exist around Tasmania.
There are people that are utilising small amounts of capital to give themselves a return on very small wineries. They should have been given some consideration by the government. They have not been. The government just does not care about them. It has passed them over in this debate—just as the members 
 that represent those regions have done so in this House today.
The wine equalisation tax has become quite an issue in Tasmania. We have some of the best boutique wines in Australia. It is a relatively new industry. There have been a lot of teething problems in putting us on the right track and getting the Tasmanian wine industry going. But now it is really starting to pay off.
The wine industry in Tasmania can be traced back to our well-known family the Alcorsos. Just after the war, Claudio Alcorso started a hobby, a side industry, at his textile company in Derwent Park and developed a little vineyard around where he lived in Berriedale. Since those small beginnings, the Alcorso family have certainly made their name in wines in Tasmania. They are still there making very good wine. Others then saw the potential, and recently many people have started growing grapes and developing wines.
The Sydney Morning Herald features page undertook a feature article about Tasmanian wines recently, and I recommend it to everybody. They reported that there were 56 producers in Tasmania but that most sell all their wine to tourists or locals. The average vineyard is just a few hectares. All are developing their new lines and making the most of developing the tourist trails that are seen as part and parcel of wine selling these days. In the West Tamar in my electorate in the north of the state there is a wonderful wine trail which is well signposted. A very good map exists for tourists these days to take people along that wine trail. Tourists can wander from Legana right through to the bottom end. Then they can cross to the other side of the Tamar River into the top end of the Bass electorate and the East Tamar area, across to the Piper's Brook Winery. The wines themselves have done very well recently, winning local medals with great aplomb around the country. A lot of the bottles of Tasmanian wine you buy now have a medal or two on the label. I was really pleased to introduce one of my favourite brands, Fishburn and O'Keefe, the other night to a number of people. They make an excellent drop. They are now moving their centre of operations 
 from the south of my electorate to the north to extend their range of wines and to expand.
When there was a suggestion by this government of repealing the wholesale sales tax and replacing it with a 10 per cent GST, the wine industry saw there might be some advantage for them in that happening because of the tax burden that they were carrying. However, there was no intention to withdraw the wine equalisation tax, put in place to avoid luxuries falling in price when basic necessities were going up. Suddenly, the smaller winemakers saw themselves being put out of business by those who sold in bulk—and rightly so. They realised that the big boys would have been looking at what the trends were, they would have been looking at what the GST meant to them and they would have been able to position themselves and get their arguments into the government debate. The small wineries were not, of course, in a position to do that. They have not had the opportunity to get their arguments into the debate as well as they should have been able to.
The Tasmanians are represented in the argument by the Tasmanian Independent Winemakers. They believe that the GST and an ad valorem tax would be disastrous for their small wineries. They believe a top-up tax on wine, over and above the GST, should be volumetric, based on volume, and not ad valorem, based on price. According to them, the ad valorem tax increases the price of quality wine and hurts small wineries. Their growth and future depends on the production of low volumes of high quality wines at an economic cost. They also believe that the corporate giants of the wine industry and the Winemakers Federation of Australia are lobbying hard against a volumetric tax and promoting an ad valorem tax, which actively discriminates against small wineries so that a litre of cask wine may be as cheap as a litre of soft drink.
The Tasmanian groups have given evidence to the Senate inquiry and made it quite clear that they oppose the wine equalisation tax completely. I can understand that. Here is an industry which is just about to break through another development barrier, and they are 
 facing being cut off at the knees. They need something much more sympathetic to their current position. At the very least, I will be looking for a generous exemption from WET for wine used in tasting and wine sold genuinely at the cellar door. The latter can be the lifeblood of many small wineries that are the basis of wine tourism.
My colleague Michelle O'Byrne, the federal member for Bass, and I have been working with our local contacts to try and secure a better position for our Tasmanian wines and those small wineries. We have had long discussions with our colleagues to get a position that is acceptable to our mainland colleagues. In Tasmania, few wineries sell over $100,000 worth of wine wholesale. It is this factor that we have pushed to make sure there was an amendment that excluded tastings and promotions on the first $100,000 in cellar door sales.
I believe there are other areas that we could improve on, and I will be looking to the future when we have a Labor government in here to have a good look at the wine industry as a whole to see how this can be further assisted, particularly things like research and development and initial support for small wineries. This is not a criticism of the present research or promotional effort, that is fine, but it is directed more at the large corporations and holding our position on the world stage.
There is a tendency now to see the wine industry as two industries, large and small. The small industries also need to look at their promotional opportunities. They could be very small, but the levies that they pay should be used positively in their development as well.
I just wanted to touch on the significance of tourism in the regional areas. Small wineries can really generate the name of a region. They can lift its name quite considerably in the public domain and, therefore, really assist in the promotion of that region or small town. Food can do the same. If wine and food combine together, they can certainly give a small region which might be really struggling an opportunity to get a focus on how they can achieve some economic development and they will most probably be able to retain the young people in that region for another generation.
The employment opportunities which I touched on earlier can be quite large at times. The work can be on a casual basis, but it can certainly put dollars into the region or the town. Wine tourism is a industry of the future and will continue to grow. An inquiry really should have occurred at the parliamentary level and looked at the needs of small wineries, as opposed to this tax. We could have touched on a considerable number of other issues, but we certainly would have given small wineries the opportunity to have some input, which this government has very arrogantly denied them.
I will certainly be supporting the amendments which my colleagues will be moving during the consideration in detail stage of the bill. I would ask the parliament to support the amendments in order to assist Tasmanian wine growers and those in other parts of Australia, whose businesses are really being put in jeopardy by this legislation and this very arrogant government.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-03-31,"—I wish to inject into this debate some of the concerns of smaller wine producers in my area about this wine equalisation tax. I am persuaded by the arguments of these producers that any top-up tax on wine over and above the goods and services tax should be volumetric and not ad valorem. To base the tax on the price of wine directly impacts on those smaller producers who create a high quality, relatively high cost product compared with the lower price bulk wine sales of the corporations. The National Coalition of Small Wineries rightly point out how this taxing approach subsidises cask wine.
Small wineries are a large part of the burgeoning wine industry in this country. One has only to travel between Young, Cowra and Orange these days to see the dramatic increase in grape plantings, with several thousand hectares having been planted from early this decade. Much of those plantings have been done by smaller wine producers and their object is quality rather than quantity. Yet small wineries are now set to pay at least four times more tax per litre that the corporate wineries pay for their cask wine.
One of the most successful wine producers in the Orange district is Stephen Doyle with his Bloodwood product. He has set out for me in great detail the argument against the manner in which this tax is being imposed. He points out that the 20 largest producers of wine in Australia account for over 97 per cent of production, while the remaining 900 small producers share the balance. Mr Doyle's Bloodwood Wines sells approximately 25,000 litres per year on which he currently collects about $100,000 in wholesale sales tax. Proportionately, Bloodwood pays much more of its income to the federal government than does a corporate producer like Southcorp.
Small producers have already been struggling by having to fund the wholesale sales tax in advance. While having to remit the tax by the 20th of each month, most clients of the small wineries do not settle their invoices for 90 days, thereby creating an enormous cash flow problem.
Mr Doyle and other smaller producers believe that the WET further discriminates against smaller operators. He asks why we cannot exempt small wineries as California does as recognition of the role they play in supporting fragile rural communities across Australia. In fact, the US government provides a full rebate of volumetric wine excise taxes to its smaller wineries as part of its policies to promote small business and expand fine wine exports in an expanding world market, notwithstanding the downturn in Asia.
Growers I have spoken with in my area believe that, if we are going to improve this important part of regional industry, export sales and tourism, the WET proposal—the prepayment of the wholesale sales tax and the discrimination by dominant corporate wineries against smaller producers—needs to be addressed if we really want a fair tax system.
In the same way that the GST discriminates against the lower income earner with no discretionary spending or tax minimisation opportunity, so too does this wine equalisation tax discriminate against smaller wineries and producers. It risks nipping in the bud one of the few success stories in rural and regional Australia in recent years.
The measures in this bill are designed to ensure that a representative four-litre cask need not rise by more than the estimated increase in the CPI. As well, a carton of regular strength beer also need not rise by more than the estimated CPI, low alcohol beer will not go up, whisky remains the same and a so-called representative bottle of wine is not expected to go up by more than three per cent.
That is all very well, but according to the National Coalition of Small Wineries—whose detailed submission to the Senate GST inquiry deserves close reading by all those interested in the non-corporate wine industry—any reform of wine taxation needs to take account of the fact that there are two distinct sectors in the wine industry. The submission says:
. . . regrettably, if the current unbalanced discrimination is to continue, then not only will the small wineries become further marginalised, with the consequent loss of jobs in rural and regional areas, but also it is predicted many hundreds of existing small wineries will be forced out of business.
The submission goes on to say:
The proposed ad valorem top-up tax will also discourage new investment in small wineries.
That, indeed, it will do. These small wineries have been worth many millions of dollars to rural economies right throughout Australia in the past 10 to 15 years, helping support a rural economy that was in sad decline in other commodity areas.
Not only are small producers defending their own patch but the Industry Commission's 1995 report into the wine grape and wine industry came down with a finding in favour of a volumetric tax. The Industry Commission report recommended a composite approach to the taxing of wine for domestic consumption. The ad valorem or GST component would be coupled with a specific volumetric tax collected at the consumption stage. The commission's inquiry committee considered that this would most efficiently address both the revenue raising and cost of alcohol abuse objectives of wine taxation. That is exactly the point that has been made to me by a great student of the wine industry, Stephen Doyle, in his submission and in the long discussion I had with him a fortnight 
 ago, and also with a group of local wine producers as recently as last Friday.
They point out that the growing small winery industry, with its export potential, is exactly the sort of industry we should be fostering for both its export potential and its tourism potential in regional Australia. If we are going to crush it with an ad valorem tax, we are crushing job opportunities by the hundreds and we are beginning to strangle an industry that is just starting to grow, particularly on the tablelands and slopes of central western New South Wales.
So the burgeoning small producer industry is under real threat from this tax. I hope members in the House are listening to the logic of those small producers and not to the well-oiled campaign of the corporate dominated Winemakers Federation. I trust that those members in seats with wineries dominated by the large corporate winemakers will not succumb to their assessment that this is a fair tax for the industry, because it is not.
Much of the cask wine placed on the shelves by the corporate wine makers in this country is not the product of careful grape vine management and vigneron expertise. All of that effort and expense and investment goes into an elite—not an exclusive; an elite—top of the market international wine market. Much of the cask wine is, in fact, an overseas product. It is imported, much of it disguised as apparently local, with former private local labels bought up by the corporations and still named so as to give them a user-friendly, happy, small family type appearance. But the wine is imported from France or Spain. Orlando's cask is a Spanish dry red. You can find imported wine right through the bulk and cask wines that are on the shelves. So much for a tax system supporting the local industry. Again, it is all about looking after the major producers at the expense of the growing little producers who are producing the quality product.
In comparison to the big wineries, the production costs of small wineries are obviously far higher while volumes are low. The proposed ad valorem tax will force many out of the market. My electorate and many parts of rural and regional Australia, which are 
 gaining so much from this growing industry, will not forgive any government or opposition that fails to recognise this. You might ask: why opposition? While the amendments that I have here and have looked through are reasonable, I do not believe they attack the major problems of this tax for smaller operators.
The member for Lyons, the distinguished Deputy Speaker, alluded to these problems in his contribution, but I do not see any amendments that are relevant to the comment he made that the smaller wine industry is being cut off at the knees. These amendments certainly do not substantially address that. The major wineries, the corporate wineries, have leant on the major parties. These amendments do not go far enough. I will certainly make my electorate's concerns known in the hope that this bill will be attended to substantially and fairly in the other place.
Promotions and door sales exemptions are important concessions, but the suggested amendments just do not go far enough and do not address the imposts this ad valorem tax will have on the smaller operators. Nonetheless, I will support these amendments. But they are minimalist. Because I oppose the GST in principle, I then cannot support the body or thrust of the bill anyway.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I would like to compliment the honourable member for Calare on his brief but very erudite talk on this issue. As you have already stated, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, this is really impacting on Tasmania. As Tasmanian members—we have five seats down there—I think it is incumbent upon us to really stick it to the government today. It is a well-known fact that small businesses in Australia are essential to our country's survival. Everywhere you go in rural Australia—and I have a fair chunk in my electorate—country towns are facing tough times. Everyone in this place is trying to strengthen the small businesses in rural communities, for without them towns start to die.
The wine industry, as you stated, has developed at a rapid pace over the last few years, especially in Tasmania, and it is a very important employer in the rural sector. Aus 
 tralia has gained worldwide recognition for its quality wines. Such a reputation is undoubtedly well deserved. However, in the government's legislation they are looking after the big guys. As the member for Calare said, we are being leant on enormously by the huge players, the ones who have gobbled up all the small wineries.
I remember when I first went to South Australia on exchange in 1976. I was living in Edwardstown and I delighted in going down to the southern vales in the car with my wife and my newly born daughter to spend the weekends enjoying the delights of the many small wineries. In 1976 it was very similar there to Tasmania—small wineries with little cellar door sales where you actually met the maker, you shared a few bottles, and he showed you what he was proud of. It was a wonderful time. Since then they have grown and grown and, unfortunately, have been swallowed up by the big guys.
As you stated in your speech, Mr Deputy Speaker, the role played by small wineries in Tasmania—those producing less than 1,350 tonnes of grapes annually—is a critical one, for they produce many of the fine wines for which Australia has become renowned. As you stated—and I totally agree with you—the Tasmanian wines are world's best. I have been lucky enough to wander around the world and taste just about everybody's wines, and I can assure you that Tasmanian wines are world's best.
Why then is the federal government determined to destroy these small wine producers in Tasmania? I cannot believe it. Like you, I am appalled that there are no Victorian members here. I can assure you that there are lots of areas in Victoria whose small wine producers have been screaming just as loudly to their local members as the wine producers in Tasmania have been to us.
The proposed introduction of a GST combined with an ad valorem, or per volume, tax will mean that small wineries will pay four times more tax on their premium quality 750 millilitre bottles of wine than the major corporate wineries pay on equivalent quality cask wine. I reiterate: this is the big sell-out to the huge players. The Winemakers Feder 
 ation of Australia, looking after the big guys, has been very quiet when it comes to supporting its small members. It is no surprise to anyone in this place that these growers are feeling alienated and let down.
The wine industry in Australia is one of our great success stories. But instead of being rewarded, it is now amongst the highest taxed wine producing countries in the world. Due to the relatively small volumes of wine produced, especially in Tasmania, the small growers are in no position to weather this proposed burden. An independent federal government report by the Industry Commission in 1995 recommended a tax comprising a form of GST linked with a volume based tax. What happened? The big wineries and the Winemakers Federation of Australia lobbied against the recommendations so they were not implemented, a case of twisting the arms up the back of the neck.
Why are our small producers being so unfairly treated when in countries such as France, the United States, New Zealand and South Africa a system of volume based taxes is in place? Furthermore, in the United States small wineries receive a full rebate of wine excise tax in recognition of their vital role in regional communities. This government harps and harps about small business and what it is doing for regional and rural Australia, yet in other parts of the world governments in France, the United States, New Zealand and South Africa are looking after their small producers. In the United States they get a full rebate of the wine excise tax. Our small growers are feeling alienated and let down by the Winemakers Federation of Australia and by many of the politicians in this place.
I find it hard to believe that this government is determined to deliver such a blow to one of our most successful, albeit sensitive, rural industries. As you stated, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your electorate of Lyons—and I am sure the member for Bass has similar stories to recount; I do, too, in my electorate of Franklin—where rural industry is struggling and where regional unemployment is rife, one of the small rays of sunshine has been the success of small wineries. But 
 understandably, their costs are high and their profits modest.
I have three of the best wineries in Tasmania. Sharon and Michael Vishacki in Panorama Vineyards, Eric Phillips down at Elsewhere Vineyards and Rob and Anthea Patterson at Hartzview have been fighting this government and trying to convince the Tasmanian Liberal senators Gibson, Abetz, Watson and Calvert that this is bad for Tasmania.
—It's not bad for Tasmania.
—It is bad for Tasmania. These Tasmanian Liberal senators have been very quiet indeed. The producers at these wineries are not your local Labor supporters and voters; they are usually coalition supporters. In the last federal election, what happened? Five-zero, because they were so disgusted with the proposed treatment the Tasmanian wine producers would receive from this coalition government, which is always trumpeting that it is about small business protection and rural and regional Australian development. Why then is it imposing this tax that is honestly going to bring the Tasmanian wine industry to its knees?
—Oh, rubbish!
—The honourable member is interjecting that it is rubbish; I invite him to come down to talk to the wine producers any day he likes. There has been some discussion in our party room about this whole thing, and I will put it on the public record now. Whilst I support these amendments, as the honourable member for Calare says, they are minimalist and I think in all honesty they do not go far enough. Ad valorem is the only way to go.
—Why don't you move it?
—Volumetric is the only way to go, and ad valorem is—
—Order! The minister should direct his remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am getting rather upset about this whole thing, and understandably so. Volumetric is the only way to go and, as I said, I agree with the honourable member for Calare 
 that these are minimalist amendments. They do not go far enough. If we are going to look after Tasmanian wine producers, I think we need stronger amendments. We will be rolled on the numbers, that is quite understandable—we are a dozen short—but, as I said previously, I would like to see what is going to happen to the Yarra Valley member. What is he going to say to salve his conscience when this vote takes place shortly?",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—If the previous speaker, the member for Franklin, had any courage, he would move some amendments instead of being straitjacketed as usual by the organisation that is widely known as the Labor caucus. If you really believe in what you say, do something about it! But do not come in here to say: `You are adopting a minimalist approach.' When you have the relevant minister at this table who is moving amendments that you say do not go far enough, stand up for your constituents! Do not do them in the eye the way the Labor caucus always makes sure the marginal seat holders do their constituents in the eye.
—Rubbish!
—The sole response is `Rubbish'. Gee whiz, that hurts! In this situation, the government's bill is going to ensure that current arrangements can continue for cellar door activities. There is no doubt about that. The rebate scheme in place for cellar door sales will continue because the rebate scheme is provided by the states. Under the compensation arrangements of the GST, where all the revenue of the GST goes to the states, the states can continue with their tastings and promotions. That is what the wholesale sales tax does at the moment: it treats them as applications to own use and therefore they are taxable. Under the wine equalisation tax, the treatment is indeed similar.
—Similar.
—Similar treatment, as I am advised. Under those circumstances, under a GST, a wine producer, I am advised, would be entitled to an input tax credit for the cost of making the wine used for promotion and 
 tastings, the same as if the wine were to be sold. Therefore, under those circumstances there is no difference. The rebate scheme can still be applied by the state government. And, as we know, the state government in Tasmania is a Labor government. Only a second ago, the previous speaker was boasting about how the Labor Party had a five-nil whitewash in Tasmania. If the Labor government and the Labor Party really care about Tasmania, they will continue with the rebate and there will be enough compensation in the GST package—in fact, more generous compensation than in the GST package—for the state of Tasmania than currently exists. So Tasmania is better off. If they really care about the wine producers of Tasmania, then I urge you to go and knock on the door of the Labor Premier of Tasmania and say, `Please give us a guarantee that you will continue with the rebate scheme.' In fact, I launch a challenge today. I challenge the Labor Premier of Tasmania, and all the state premiers for that matter, to make a commitment that they will continue with the rebate scheme. That is not difficult.
There is one other point I wish to make in relation to this debate. Small wineries not registered or not required to be registered for a GST will of course not be subject to the wine equalisation tax. This will cover wineries with an annual turnover of less than $50,000. So the issue raised by the member for Hunter relating to small wineries is not applicable.
Finally, I want to make this point, and I remind the House that this is a critical point in all of these individual bills. We are discussing a package of reforms; they are different fingers on the one hand. When it comes to issues such as the wine equalisation tax and all the other initiatives, the Labor Party has a great history of being cherry pickers. I will be saying a little more about that in a further debate during the proceedings in parliament today, but I want to make the point that this is part of the overall package. For that reason, we strongly support this bill and we will continue to oppose the amendments proposed by the Labor Party.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I am sure you would 
 join with me, as a fellow Tasmanian, in supporting very strongly the amendments that have been foreshadowed by the opposition. The government has proposed a set of measures which will impose grossly unfair consequences on small and medium sized wineries around Australia. Cellar door sales in Australia account for about $216 million in sales annually and provide many of the smaller wineries with over half their income.
Tourism and regional development in many places in Australia depend on the health and viability of the small wineries industry. The direct benefit of wine tourism is about half a billion dollars each year. When you consider all the indirect effects, it amounts to an industry that employs thousands of Australians. The wine industry itself employs about 30,000 people, and grape wine production has grown from 780,000 tonnes in 1994 to nearly one million tonnes in 1998.
Eighty per cent of the thousand wineries rely extensively on cellar door sales. Labor-held electorates with wineries include Hunter, Kingston, Bendigo, Burke and three Tasmanian electorates: Braddon, Lyons and, of course, Bass. Tasmania has concerns to make certain that the industry is better addressed and the opposition is proposing a series of amendments which will specifically go to that sector of the industry. I understand time limits are significant in this debate, but I am anxious to make certain that the interests of the Tasmanian vineyards are properly represented.

Has the Prime Minister seen comments by Colleen McCullough describing his preamble as `one of the most dismally uninspiring pieces of prose I've seen in a long time—no Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln wrote it, that's certain'? Has the Prime Minister also seen the comprehensive condemnation by his former leader Malcolm Fraser, who has said that the preamble should be dropped, including for its failure to recognise Aboriginal custodianship, and that he will be voting against it? In the light of the criticisms of his preamble by Malcolm Fraser, Colleen McCullough, Andrew Robb, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Bruce Ruxton, Ken Crooke and Marise Payne, and in the light of the two-thirds public opposition to it, will the Prime Minister swallow his pride, withdraw his preamble—

The decision to invest, I understand, was made by Evan Rickards, the then guild treasurer, who was the stepson of Robin Greenburg, who ran Western Women and was later gaoled over her actions in connection with the company.

It was ruled out of order under standing order 145, and it was ruled out of order because it obviously contained ironic expressions which are not allowed under standing order 145.
It is fair for the member for Newcastle to observe that I used the terms `scorn' and `derision', which were part of that question, but it is also equally fair and self-evident that the question contained a large number of ironic expressions. For that reason, it was out of order. It would be absurd for the Speaker to hand down some sort of ruling on scorn and derision. On the majority of occasions in the House of Representatives there is a great deal of good natured banter which neither side would want the Speaker to take action over.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—This is another MPI to deal with the GST and we still have not had the Treasurer turn up in the House to defend his case.
—He sent me.
—He sent along the lap-dog. Mr Speaker, this is supposed to be the greatest tax reform of the century and the Treasurer will not come into this place and defend it. What does he have to hide? I will come to what he has to hide in a minute.
This government claimed it was going to introduce a new level of accountability into this parliament. The Prime Minister, in his pride, said that he was going to change the sins of the past and bring in new accountability. When has the government ever come into this place to defend the cacophony of criticism that has been levelled at the GST package? The Treasurer will not attend this place to do it.
Today is the last time the House will sit before the Senate considers the GST package. Unlike this place, the Senate has had the opportunity to fully scrutinise the legislation. Four Senate committees have been looking at it since December—four committees that the Treasurer did not want. He said that the Senate had no right to look at this legislation. Labor proposed one committee and a timetable to allow a vote by the timetable the 
 Treasurer himself had set to enable passage before 30 June this year.
Thanks to the Treasurer's unique negotiating style, he ended up with not one committee but four. He started with none and ended up with four, and yet he rails in this place about obstruction. What a hypocrite. The Treasurer's negotiating style is one of the best weapons Labor has in this debate. For example, we saw him out there trying to be statesmanlike, happy to listen to any of the concerns that Senator Harradine had, and yet we heard him on radio today saying that he has nothing new to offer the senator. I think we should take the transcript of the Treasurer's performance on AM this morning, tie it up in a bow and deliver it to Senator Harradine. I am sure he will be interested. The Treasurer's arrogance knows no bounds. This is a Treasurer who wants you to believe that there are no problems with this package, even though witness after witness has been attesting to them in the committees of the other chamber.
Let us be absolutely clear about Labor's position on this. Labor will be voting against the GST—not for the sake of opposing it but because we have proven that the GST is unfair and that it is a bad tax for the economy. They were the tests that we set for ourselves when we called for the inquiries, when we called for the analysis, when we called for the rigorous examination that the government was not prepared to allow this place to undertake before it went to the last election on this package.
We will be voting against the GST because of that unfairness and because the GST is bad for the economy. We will use every argument and every tactic to try to defeat this tax, because the truth is that it is a tax that cannot be made fair. Labor will be seeking to ensure that the other people who vote on this package vote with us, based on the arguments that have been put to the committees. Labor will not be countenancing any amendments to the GST bill, with one exception: an amendment that we will be seeking to move to ensure that, if the bill gets up, if the GST gets in, the detail of that tax will be disclosed on every receipt that every consumer receives.
To demonstrate again the hypocrisy of this government, it argued the need to abolish the wholesale sales tax because it was a hidden tax. But now that government wants to introduce a new $30 billion tax and keep it hidden. What sheer hypocrisy. We will be seeking to move the amendment to expose that very hypocrisy. That issue aside, Labor will not be supporting amendments to the GST bill. The inquiries that the Treasurer has fought so hard to avoid have produced truckloads of hard evidence to back the claim that this is a bad tax. But the government, despite all this evidence, has yet to move from its starting point of baseless assertion and, to use Professor Dixon's term, lightweight rhetoric.
The government says that we have produced no evidence, but the real fact is that the government has been able to produce nothing to back its assertions that the GST will be good for Australians. For example, the Treasury has done no modelling on the impact of the GST on jobs. The greatest tax reform of the century, and yet they have not even bothered to think about whether or not it will cost jobs. On Monday, I participated in a forum run by the Australian Industry Group, and Reserve Bank board member Dick Warburton, who was speaking on the same panel as I was, was asked what he thought of the fact that there was no employment modelling. His response was a simple shrug. He had no idea why this government had not used the resources of the department to back its claim—resources that it is capable of mustering, and modelling that that department is capable of doing or contracting out. He was at a loss to explain why such modelling had not occurred.
Why was the modelling not done? If the assertion is being made that this tax will increase jobs, why not produce the evidence to back that claim—unless, of course, that claim cannot be backed by the evidence? That is our assertion. How can a government which moralises about transparency and budget honesty produce a package like this with so little scrutiny?
Let us go through what the Senate inquiry process has found. It has found that the government hid the details of the package 
 from the people and misinformed them in its extravagant advertising. It has found that the government failed to tell us that the first year inflation impact was at least 3.1 per cent and not, as it continues to claim, 1.9 per cent. The government continues to argue that the inflation effect is 1.9 per cent when the Treasury has said that it starts at 3.1 per cent—starts, I emphasise, because even that assumes a 100 per cent pass-on of all the taxes being abolished by the states in return for them getting the GST revenues if the government gets it up. Not one witness who has appeared before the Senate inquiry believes that assumption to be correct. Not one piece of evidence has been produced by this government to demonstrate a 100 per cent pass-through, but there has been a wealth of evidence to show that that full pass-through will not happen.
By the time this inquiry is finished, the inflation impact will be not 1.9 per cent but between four and five per cent. Inflation going up means interest rates going up, and we have fought too long and hard to get inflation down in a sustained way to underpin the low interest rates to let this mob muck it up, and that is what they will do. An inflation rate of four to five per cent has implications for interest rates, but importantly it also has implications for the compensation package. If the compensation is based on a 1.9 per cent inflation rate when in fact it is close to five per cent, they have got huge compensation to make up.
The government have also failed to tell us that their assertions of more jobs and growth were not backed up by Treasury analysis—no analysis. That is the point I have made. Yet evidence given by Professor Dixon before the Senate inquiry shows that up to 120,000 jobs will be lost in the short run, assuming workers secure higher wages as compensation for the rising prices. Again, that is the significance of the inflation impact being not 1.9 per cent but closer to five per cent. Up to 120,000 jobs could be lost.
As to the assertion that this is a package that creates jobs, Professor Dixon says that any jobs created in the early years will be due entirely to the fiscal stimulus. It will be nothing to do with their GST, but entirely due 
 to the fiscal stimulus. Of course, the obvious should be apparent to this mob—that you can have a fiscal stimulus without a GST. If you want jobs growth, look to other mechanisms by which you can achieve it. Professor Dixon's modelling says that any economic efficiency gains from the tax package will be negligible and that the package will cause a small decline in average Australian living standards. Great tax this—120,000 jobs gone, no economic efficiency gains, a small decline in average Australian living standards.
—What about the narrow tax base?
—He asks about the narrow tax base. Let me go on to say what Professor Dixon says about the tax base under us and you:
The existing tax system—
that is the existing one, ours—
will collect revenue faster than growth in GDP, so the need for a GST to meet Australia's future revenue needs has not been proven by the government.
Those are not our words but Professor Dixon's. Let me also make the point that under their package, even under their modelling, the growth from the GST in the third year is projected to be only 2.7 per cent. That is less than GDP growth. The only way you can get the revenue base up is to increase the GST, and that proves the falsity of your argument that you have got a lock-in mechanism that will prevent the tax from going up.
I have demonstrated in this place before—I hold it up again—how simple it is to introduce legislation in this place to undo that lock-in mechanism. With four bills and four lines you can undo the lock-in mechanism. This is a farce. The government intends, having introduced this tax, to whack it up at the earliest opportunity.
Let me go again to this question of compensation. The government have failed to provide pensioners with any real compensation beyond that which they would have got anyway. As Geoff Carmody has shown, the government's four per cent pension top-up is likely to be eroded away to zero. The reason that happens is that they come into this place 
 and continue to talk about the 1½ per cent above CPI. It is true that up-front there will be a four per cent increase in the pension and that will have the effect, in the initial circumstances, of lifting the pension. But the problem is, as this graph will demonstrate, that that increase will be eroded in a short space of time. Why? Because pensions, under legislation, are not linked to the CPI in this country; they are linked to male total average weekly earnings. Male total average weekly earnings—indeed, average weekly earnings—are projected by this government in its mid-year review to grow by six per cent. The inflationary effect and the 1½ per cent on top of it will be eaten away in a relatively short space of time.
Therefore, the compensation to pensioners is an illusion, because it will be eroded away. It is simply offering them that which they would have been entitled to anyway by a formula that we developed and that the government have continued. That is the truth of it. Pensioners are going to get dudded by this mechanism. Let this government come in and explain how that is not happening. We have asked questions persistently of the relevant ministers to do with this and they consistently avoid it, because they know that we are right.
Again I make the point: if pensioners are being dudded to the tune of a billion dollars, what are other people being dudded to the tune of? If the government get their GST package up—we will do everything to stop it, tactically and by argument—the extra compensation needed is going to be horrendous. And it is the extra compensation for pensioners that underscores that point. We have already asked the minister today whether housing compensation needs to go up in terms of the relationship with the states. Let us see how much more compensation is needed.
This is an unfair tax. The fact that you have got to give compensation underscores the point it is unfair. The only issue is how unfair. What you have done is try to deny that information to the Australian people.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—Yabberty yabber. I feel like Rex Hunt. I have landed one. The member for Hotham is like a newly landed bream. It is flapping around at a great pace. It starts off that way when the tax package is introduced and gradually, as the oxygen starts to fill its gills, we come across less life, less life, less life to the point where only a few of his colleagues bother to turn up for the great king hit on the taxation compensation package. Maybe that is an indication of his lack of support in caucus.
It should not be too long before we can anticipate some movement in the caucus ranks as the New South Wales Right and the Victorian Right start to have an arm wrestle about the power positions in the Labor Party. We all know that the Victorian Right has started pulling the strings in federal Labor—with the hands of Senator Ray and Senator Conroy and, of course, the member for Hotham, everyone on the front bench seems to have their own Victorian Right puppeteer. And here is a covert to the Victorian Right.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister has strayed onto matters that have got absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the MPI, and I urge you to call him back to the question.
—I thank the honourable member. The minister is being relevant because the subject of this MPI is very broad, and I know he will continue to speak to the terms of it.
—How are internal Labor Party matters related to this?
—They are matters relevant to the level of opposition to the GST. We urge you to heed the advice of John Della Bosca. I imagine that over the next few months we will see some terrific brawls in the Labor Party during this great arm wrestle over the GST, this great arm wrestle about the voting of the Labor Party in the Senate and their voting pattern in relation to all significant bills of the government, whether we have a mandate or whether we wish we had a mandate. The opposition of the Labor Party will be unchanged. It is very revealing that we have seen an outbreak by the Labor Party over the last few months in relation to the 
 levels of support for the GST. The Premier of New South Wales, the much lauded—only on one side of the House—Premier Bob Carr said on ABC Stateline  on 9 October 1998:
My view is that a government with a majority in any lower House ought to be able to implement its program, not subject to frustration by upper house—state or federal—and be judged by the people three or four years down the track.
And we heard a chorus of complaints from the opposition that that is a state matter. Well, let us go federal.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—Neil O'Keefe, the member for Burke, in the Age  of 26 March 1999, only a few days ago, said:
It is 14 years since a consumption tax was first seriously proposed by the federal Treasurer in 1985.
The federal Treasurer was Labor at the time.
Australia doesn't not for much longer have the luxury of this sort of procrastination in major policy and infrastructure decisions . . . 
That was the member for Burke. But he is in good company. Previously unrevealed to the House, on 28 January 1999 on 5AN Labor Senator Chris Schacht said:
If you don't like the government, what it's doing, you vote it out at the next election. But once you vote them in, you give them a chance to carry out their mandate.
—But you haven't got one.
—That was Senator Chris Schacht. So we have had Bob Carr, John Della Bosca, Neil O'Keefe and Chris Schacht; let's go for the final one, the big bang, King Kahuna, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley in the Courier-Mail  of 26 August 1997. He said:
If John Howard goes to the next election with a clearly and honestly described GST tax proposal and he wins the election—
and we won, that is why we are on this side of the House—
Labor will regard that as a mandate and not seek to block the introduction of the GST.
That was the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley.
—Black and white.
—Black and white; pretty clear; no arguments. So what is the argument? 
 Is the argument that the tax base is broken? We on this side of the House say it is. On this side of the House we say that you cannot continue to run a Ferrari-like economy on a dirt-road-type taxation system. That is what we say on this side of the House. The beauty is that some people on the other side of the House are saying exactly the same thing. In Hansard  on 9 December 1998 the member for Werriwa said:
The Australian tax base is broken . . . 
There is nothing equivocal about that; it is pretty clear—six pretty clear words saying, `The Australian tax base is broken.' And he repeated it on 9 December. He said:
It is simply not possible to defend the current tax system on the basis of its progressivity.
He is in good company. John Dawkins, former Labor Treasurer, now vigneron in South Australia—
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—He should be happy with our WET tax proposals.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—On 17 August 1993, he said:
. . . rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco will be progressively increased . . . wholesale sales tax will be increased in two stages over the next two years.
That confirms exactly my interjection to the shadow Treasurer a little earlier.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—In that interjection I pointed out to the shadow Treasurer that what he does not realise is that the tax base of the Commonwealth and the states is deteriorating. The revenue base of Australia is deteriorating, and that is precisely why the states have begun to introduce heinous and onerous taxes like gambling taxes—
—And tobacco taxes.
—And further tobacco taxes, and increasing new land tax and a bed tax in New South Wales. They have been plugging the holes of their revenue base precisely because they have only one growth tax—payroll tax. That is the only growth tax of the states. Financial institutions duty, debits tax, 
 stamp duty on the transfer of shares—they are all narrowing bases.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—Order! The minister will resume his seat. The member for Melbourne has had a pretty fair go, but the tolerance of the chair is beginning to wear thin. The honourable minister.
—I repeat: state based taxes, such as FID, debits tax, land tax—unless you start to expand the base by taxing more and more people's homes—and stamp duty on the transfer of shares are all narrowing taxes, and that is why the states have come up with gambling taxes and why they have extended land tax to the family home. That is why they keep looking for new sources of revenue, new heinous forms of revenue that directly attack productivity. That is why the states are looking for those heinous new taxes.
We are saying that the best form of taxation that you can have is one with as broad a base as possible. There is a fundamental difference in the attitude between the Labor Party and the coalition, and it is this: on this side of the House, we do not try to paper over the cracks. We do not try to plug the holes on a leaking ship with cork; we try to rebuild the leaking ship. In this case, we have put to the Australian people an entire package, and it is a package that includes fair and proper compensation. So, for those people who may be most affected by the implementation of a new tax, we have put in place fair and adequate compensation. It is the first time that has happened, as all of us on this side of the House and all the Australian people know.
When the Labor Party was in government, what was the compensation package for the introduction of FBT? What was the compensation package for the introduction of the capital gains tax? What was the compensation package for the increase in wholesale sales tax from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, from 20 per cent to 22 per cent, from 30 per cent to 32 per cent and so on? What was the compensation package to Australians for the l-a-w tax cuts that were never introduced and the tax hikes that actually followed? There was no compensation. These hypocrites come into this House and lecture us about compensation, 
 yet their entire political history, not just over 13 years, is that they have never once delivered compensation for their tax increases.
In this case, we are trying to rearrange the tax base of Australia so that we actually give growth revenue to the states so that they can allocate it to the areas of growth expenditure such as hospitals, schools, police and roads. That is what we are doing. We are trying to put a structural framework in place that ensures that Australia can maintain its miracle economy not for a year, not for two years, but for a decade and beyond. That is what we are doing.
Our time frame is beyond the next election, and it always has been. That is a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and us. We try to go beyond the next election. We try to look beyond our own political success and look forward to what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. That is why we went to the last election with an entire tax package. That is why we went to the last election promising to sell Telstra in the best interests of the Australian people.
The Deputy Editor of the Economist from London came to this building last night and said that the three biggest impediments to our continuing—in his words—as the miracle economy of the world are: opposition to taxation reform, opposition to privatisation and opposition to industrial relations reform. I was particularly pleased that there were a number of Labor Party members there who heard the independent analyst from London give an opinion about the Australian economy.
In that circumstance, it is quite clear that, if the opposition really do believe for a split second in doing something for the country, for the next generation, for the productivity of Australia and for jobs in Australia, they will stop opposing for opposition's sake. They will stop being obstructionist on everything. I know through my portfolio that members of the Labor Party go into the boardrooms of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart, for all I know, and Canberra saying, `We believe the tax package will go through. Yes, we really support increased productivity. We support tax reform. We 
 support industrial relations reform, and we really do support the sale of Telstra,' and then they walk into the Senate and vote against it at every single point.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—Do you want me to name them? Do you want me to name your colleagues? I will save you the embarrassment.
—Order! Minister, I do not need you to name anybody. You will address your remarks through the chair, and the member for Melbourne will remain silent.
—I am happy to name them, but I am happy to save the member for Melbourne the embarrassment of walking into caucus and being belted up by his friends in the Victorian Right who are doing it. If he keeps pushing me to do it, I am happy to do it.
Under those circumstances, I can say this: we believe that the compensation package is appropriate and fair. We believe it is fair because we have had a look at the tax that we are proposing to introduce. We have had a look at the $13 billion of income tax cuts that are part of the package. We have had a look at the $3½ billion in cuts to diesel fuel. We have had a look at the $10 billion in cuts on the tax of exports. We have had a main assessment done of the number of opportunities for people to make money as a result of our tax package and the creation of wealth amongst the poorer people in Australia, and we have said, `Here is a compensation package.' This is the first time that a government has said that it is a package. The Australian people support it, and you should too.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—I rise today to support my colleague the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation  and also to say that this MPI shows that the Labor Party are very much entrenched in their old retropolitics. We have before the Australian public at the moment proposals for a GST which are entirely logical, entirely appropriate and entirely equitable, and what have the Labor Party done? Ever since we returned from the election—where they were soundly 
 defeated—they have raised questions and technical points every day. Every day we have had: are we going to have a GST on coffins? Should running shoes be exempted? Does it apply to this? Does it apply to that?
The lack of interest that the media have shown in their day by day questions is particularly interesting. I am aware that they see the situation as totally boring. Those people who report from an economic viewpoint know the great integrity of the GST system that is proposed. They are aware of the benefits that are going to be seen right across the Australian community.
As the minister has rightly said, what we are seeing in these GST proposals is the most fundamental change in the Australian tax system since Federation. We see it in a number of areas. The first most significant area we see it is in relation to the shift from the straight manufacturing base, from the product base, from the wholesale sales tax, into the service area. There is no doubt that what we have seen over the last 10 to 15 years is a fundamental shift in the Australian economy away from the straight manufacturing, agriculture and mining sector—even though they remain strong—and the service sector has become more and more important.
These taxes will mean that the service sector is taxed. That sector will provide a significant amount of revenue for the Australian economy and will provide benefits for the previous area I was involved in—tourism. Each year 4.2 million international visitors come to Australia, and right now they are not required to pay any tax—except indirectly if they go into the occasional store and pay sales tax on a product. Now on every item of service they will be paying the 10 per cent tax, and that means that the 4.2 million international visitors who spend an average of $4½ million each year will create a significant boost for the Australian taxpayers as their own tax burden will be reduced. So that is the first aspect: we will see the benefits from widening the base into the service sector.
The second major benefit is what it means for the ordinary taxpayers in Australia. The Labor Party are saying that they are concerned for the disadvantaged and the working 
 people across Australia. The fact is that it is this side of the parliament that is showing the real concern for the average worker in Australia, because this package proposes a significant reduction in the tax rates for the average worker. We have seen bracket creep escalation right across the board and people are moving more and more into the top rate of tax. It is only 1.8 times the average income level that people are suddenly moving into the highest rate of tax. Under these proposals, 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay only a 30 per cent tax rate.
This is a significant reform. This will benefit people right across the board. This will undoubtedly stimulate the Australian economy. This will not only provide benefits to those who receive it but have an escalated impact right across businesses in Australia. That is the second major reason why we should be supporting it—we will see significant levels of tax reduction.
It has also been claimed today that we will not see adequate compensation for those who are less well-off, who are on social welfare. There is no doubt that these changes will bring results: families will be able to earn more income before family payments start to be reduced, the phase-out of payments will occur at a slower rate and the benefits of tax reform for families will be evident. There will be an immediate four per cent increase in the pension when the tax is introduced. The government's commitment is that the pension will remain 1.5 per cent ahead of the CPI, and that will not be changed. So we will have a one-off increase in the pension of four per cent, and we will continue to have a pension above the CPI. For those self-funded retirees, there will be a one-off assistance measure as well. So the opposition's claims that we will not have assistance for those who are underprivileged and that this will impact negatively just do not flow through.
There is another reason for introducing these taxes, and that is that the bills that were introduced into the parliament today will bring great reform to the Commonwealth-state financial relationships. We will not continue to see the regressive taxes in the state area; nine regressive taxes that are currently in 
 place will be removed. These are the BAD tax, the FID tax and the stamp duty taxes.
The stamp duty is taxed at each level of the transaction. If there is a development for an apartment block, you will pay stamp duty on the land, you will pay stamp duty on the development itself and you will pay stamp duty when it is sold to the individual purchaser. Each level will pay the tax. That is why these taxes are seen as regressive. In every tax forum for the last 20 years that anybody has cared to go to, when they have described the state taxation system, they have said, `These are regressive taxes; these are the ones that are impacting directly on those less able to pay for it.' We are not just talking about simple matters; we are talking about one of the biggest areas of expenditure for the average working person or for those who are on some type of assistance from the government.
We will see the removal of stamp duty in the purchase of the property. We will see the removal of stamp duty in leases. We will see the removal of the BAD and the FID in bank account transactions. We will see this total change. State governments will have a growth tax, they will have a stable tax, but they will also have the growth factor so they can look forward to being able to service the infrastructure requirements they need. That will include hospitals, schools, police, bridges and roads right across this great country.
It is very interesting that right across Australia no Premier and no Chief Minister has objected to these proposals. These changes are the most fundamental in taxation reform that we have seen since Federation. And it is all credit to this side of the House that has made these changes. After the comments of Mr Della Bosca last weekend, he still has a problem with hubris but not sufficient that he could not come out and say, `It is time to move on from this very boring debate that the Labor Party gets into on the GST and pass this legislation.' If you look at the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 February, headed `Foot-dragging on the GST', you will see it says:
. . . the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, is already talking about the possibility of an early double 
 dissolution and urging Labor MPs to campaign against the GST. Has he forgotten that he lost the last election?
It is time for the Opposition and the Democrats to stop insulting the electorate and for the Senate to wind up its inquiry and allow the tax reform package to be passed.
This is not the Liberal Party that is talking; this is the Sydney Morning Herald . It is actually expressing their views—

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I stand here today to raise concerns that the GST package will have a negative effect on services—particularly health, charity, housing and community services. The government's GST package will also reduce the standard of living of low income Australian families.
On this side of the House, and out in the Australian community, people are asking why the government does not take a mature approach to this issue and rethink its GST package. It is not too late. If the government continues its push to impose the GST package on the Australian community, it must heed the serious concerns that are being raised about the inadequacies of the compensation component. These concerns are being raised with me on a daily basis by people, family groups and businesses in the Stirling electorate as well as by a broader range of groups and organisations. Individuals, families, businesses and organisations from across Australia have for some time now been telling the government of their concerns. Many have taken advantage of the opportunity offered by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee to send submissions or make a public appearance to air their views and concerns.
The Labor Party and Australian Democrats senators involved in the Senate Community Affairs References Committee have expressed these views and concerns in their report on the GST and a new tax system: The lucky country goes begging. I quote from the report:
The Committee considers that the government's tax package is unfair, complex, confusing, and significantly flawed in many crucial areas.
The overwhelming majority of evidence from across the whole health and welfare sector was highly critical of the impact of the package on the living standards of Australians. The GST will disproportionately hurt low and middle income Australians and the compensation is inadequate and vulnerable to future government budget cuts.
The Committee considers that the tax package will divide the community and entrench that division. Australians will become the `haves' and the `have-nots'. High-income earners will have generous tax cuts and low-income households will have paltry compensation.
The tax cuts and pension increases offered in compensation are skewed towards high-income earners. The Government's own figures illustrate this. For a single person on $20,000 the benefit is 1.3 per cent or $4.28 per week, while for a single person on $75,000 the benefit is 7.3 per cent or $68.55 per week. A single pensioner will get just $2.89 a week out of the package while a pensioner couple gets just $4.81. Just enough for a packet of cereal!
The compensation package assumes that the GST will raise prices by 1.9 per cent. Treasury's own testimony was that in the first year the effect would be 3.1 per cent.
Page 17 of the report states:
The St Vincent de Paul Society took their own survey of families and concluded that the adverse price impact from the GST package might be as much as five times that estimated by Treasury (9.5% instead of 1.9%).
I will seek to table the examples given by the St Vincent de Paul Society showing the negative impact the government's GST package will have on low income families and demonstrating why its compensation measures are so inadequate.
And what about the personal assurance from the Prime Minister to Senator Brian Harradine that `the government would restructure the tax system to benefit families'? This is out of Senator Brian Harradine's press release of 5 March 1998. As a result of this assurance, Senator Brian Harradine decided not to block the passage of the common youth allowance bill because he believed the Prime Minister. He believed that when the Prime Minister promised that the government would `give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in 
 raising sons and daughters' the Prime Minister would keep his word. With the report The lucky country goes begging dramatically highlighting the inadequacies of the GST package and its compensation measures, I wonder how Senator Harradine now views the Prime Minister's promise that the restructure would benefit Australian families.
It is a fact that the government cannot point to one family compensation measure that families with an unemployed 17- to 21-year-old would qualify for in the GST package. It is now clear that when the government gave its commitment to Senator Harradine that the GST tax package would give further recognition to help Australian parents raise their sons and daughters it did not include young unemployed people. Mr Howard should explain to the parents of Australia just why their young unemployed children—they are really adults—do not count as a son or daughter in the eyes of his government. I ask the government to look at the benefits of Labor's tax credit scheme.	Mr Deputy Speaker, I now seek leave to table examples from Labor's policy document which demonstrates the way the tax credit system would benefit families. It is a table.
Leave not granted.
—Labor's tax credit system can effectively deliver families $5,000 more without a GST. It is a shame that the coalition is not interested in informing itself of the benefits of other schemes instead of being so fixated on the GST package and bullying ahead. The government must put political difference aside and make the mature and responsible decision to rethink its GST package for the sake of Australian families and so that the lucky country does not go begging.
I have some young people in my family aged 18 to 21, and their friends are coming to me because of the stress caused to them and their families as they are not eligible for an unemployment benefit or Austudy up to the age of 24 because of the government's policies. One of the concerns raised with me by constituents and when I have been out in public forums is about why young people wear black clothing. Young people will 
 explain to you that one of the reasons why they wear black clothing is that they feel depressed and miserable about their future prospects in this society and that it is a cultural expression of how they feel about themselves, their families, their `fit' with government policies, and their not being valued, particularly by the coalition government—not just at the federal level but in Western Australia as it also has a state coalition government. A further sign of these feelings about themselves and how young people express them—and it has been raised on both sides of this House—is the rising rate of youth suicide, self-harm, drug abuse and other problems experienced by young people.
To me it will be a happy day when the government does not push its GST bills through this parliament. Young people can take perhaps some joy from their life and living because they will feel they will have a future and will be valued with policies that are better thought out and better targeted to people and their needs. Young people are not the only group who have come to me with their concerns or who have spoken to me at forums. People from the aged care sector, people with disabilities, people from the child-care sector, people from the charitable sector, public housing tenants and local government associations have raised their concerns that not only do they feel the GST package will not bring any significant benefits to them but also any compensation packages are not targeted at them or in the short term will be eroded very quickly and they will be worse off than before. Many people have expressed to me their interest in the different kind of tax reform progressed by the Labor Party; tax reform that is more incremental, more targeted and more thoughtful of its impact on people in every area of their lives. If the government goes ahead with this, I do not think it will be the government after the next election.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1999-03-31,"—The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999  is a technical bill which incorporates into the Social Security Act various youth allowance provisions found in regulations. The provisions relate to fares allowances for students, the student financial supplement and the family actual means test. When the youth allowance was introduced last year these provisions were included in subordinate legislation.
In general, transferring these provisions to the Social Security Act will not alter their 
 effects. There are minor drafting improvements to the original provisions which will align these provisions with the style and structure of the Social Security Act. These are all well-established provisions which supplement student resources or target assistance to those most in need. The opposition has used the debate on this bill to repeat its old arguments about the common youth allowance. Reform always attracts criticism but some of the comments made in the debate have been particularly ill-informed. Sadly, as so often is the case, it has been the member for Lilley who has been most extravagant in his rhetoric.
The youth allowance removed perverse incentives in the social security system which encouraged students to leave secondary school early and which penalised people who chose to study rather than to seek work. The youth allowance also reflects the community's view that families have a responsibility to support their children. Youth allowance recognises the significant changes over the last 20 years to the work and study preferences of young people. People under 21 are now far more likely to be in education or training rather than in full-time employment. Young people are more frequently combining part-time work and study to enhance their prospects. Flexibility in income support is necessary to meet these circumstances.
Youth allowance simplifies income support for young people. The youth allowance replaces five benefits with one benefit. It reduces 13 rates of payment to just five. Simplifying the system means that young people no longer have to transfer from one benefit to another due to slight changes in circumstances. Listening to the overheated rhetoric of the member for Lilley, whom I welcome to the chamber, and his colleagues, one could be forgiven for thinking that the youth allowance had a devastating effect on young people. In fact, the new system provides many benefits to youth. I will briefly mention some of the more significant benefits.
We are providing more assistance to young people who must live away from home to study or work. There are higher living away from home rates for students and unemployed 
 people aged under 18. About 48,000 students who must live away from home will now qualify for the first time for rent assistance. Students may also qualify for pharmaceutical and remote area allowances. Full-time students can now receive income support payments worth up to $38 per fortnight thanks to the government's abolition of the minimum entitlement requirements of the old Austudy. All students now have access to an interest free $500 loan advance. Previously, only people on Newstart could obtain such an advance. Many students have gained from the abolition of the education waiting period which affected payments for students between study programs. The criteria for independent status for full-time students have been made more liberal to the benefit of many students.
It surprises me that the member for Lilley should be critical of these initiatives which so strongly encourage young Australians to study. After all, it was the Leader of the Opposition who made so much of his desire to raise school retention rates. The government's reforms to social security are discouraging young people from making the short-sighted decision to leave education and training early. For the record, it is worth noting that the overwhelming majority of young students and unemployed have not been affected or have benefited positively from the introduction of the youth allowance. Some 365,000 people were transferred to youth allowance last year with a majority experiencing no change to their benefits. Many people enjoyed increased benefits.
Removing anomalies between benefit types did reduce benefits to some people. In the case of 2,263 people on Newstart, applying the parental means test did mean a loss of benefits. In many cases, these people lost benefits because their family income was over $58,000 a year. Another 5,000 had their payments reduced. The government does not apologise for tightening the targeting of benefits. Some 30,000 people aged 18 to 20 who were on Newstart at the end of June 1998 remained on that benefit rather than being transferred to youth allowance. These people were not subject to the parental means test. 
I can assure members, in particular the members for Greenway, Fremantle and Batman, that no-one will be disadvantaged by aligning the disability support pension and youth allowance. The bill will ensure that youth rates of the disability support pension will be paid at the level of youth allowance for the equivalent age category. Disability pension rates will be indexed in line with CPI based increases to youth allowance rates. A youth disability supplement equivalent to the child disability allowance is added to the basic pension rate. The supplement will continue. In most cases, the supplement will bring the rate of DSP youth payments to the adult pension rate as previously. In the case of the remaining categories of people on youth rates of DSP—that is, single people under 20 years with no children—there will be no reduction to their payments.
Some 700 independent people under 18 years will actually receive an increase in their maximum rate of payment as the equivalent rate of youth allowance is higher than the current DSP rate. No-one will be disadvantaged by the measure changing the definition of designated parent under the family actual means test. It will merely clarify the existing situation. Nor will anyone be disadvantaged by including youth allowance students under 18 in the calculation of the income free area for family allowance. The amendment preserves the arrangements which have been in place since 1 January 1993.
As a final matter, I must respond to the remarks of the member for Lilley about information I gave to the House on the performance of Centrelink. During his contribution to the debate on this bill, he made a number of claims that I had given misleading information to the House. These claims are utterly false. All the information I provided to the House in relation to Centrelink waiting times and the like has been carefully compiled and has subsequently been checked and confirmed by Centrelink.
The member for Lilley claimed that Centrelink customers have to `wait weeks and weeks' for appointment, to quote him exactly. His source for this claim was a survey of Centrelink offices conducted during the busy 
 January period which showed that 12 offices out of 279 had delays of 10 days or more. It needs to be pointed out that under the arrangements for Newstart it is 16 days before there is an eligibility for the payment in the first place.
The Centrelink average waiting period for appointment is four days. I agree that there are one or two offices where the service is not up to the standard that Centrelink sets for itself. In most of those instances, it is a result of matters such as relocation of offices or some particular local factor. The overwhelming majority of offices—almost 200—had appointments available within five days or less. The claim that `there are people wandering around this country desperately in need who cannot get an appointment' is also simply wrong. A person in hardship will receive an interview immediately. Centrelink undertakes to see those people within 20 minutes. If necessary, an immediate advance payment can be made.
The member for Lilley also claimed that `no appointments were being made in Canberra offices' on the day of his speech. In fact, appointments were available at all offices on that day, sometimes on that very day and, in other cases, the following day. He also claimed in another part of the speech that five additional counter staff were bused in for the opening of the Tuggeranong office to help customers. Putting aside whether anybody would hire a bus for five people, the facts are that there were two extra people at the Tuggeranong office on the day of the opening, following longstanding Labor Party practice that extra staff are provided on those days. In fact, those two staff were brought in to assist with the hospitality and the other arrangements for the invited guests.
If the member for Lilley had bothered on that day, rather than just have a doorstop out on the footpath, he might have noticed that the office had very small queues and very smooth processing of customers' needs on that day. It was entirely appropriate that a couple of extra people should be there to assist with the hospitality and to ensure that as many of the Tuggeranong staff as possible could attend the opening of their office. They 
 were proud of their new office. They wanted to participate in the opening ceremony, and it was appropriate that they should have that opportunity. Unfortunately, the statements made by the member for Lilley, which were not directly related to this bill but were made in his response to the legislation, were completely wrong.
I commend this legislation to the House. It is, as I said, largely procedural in nature, and will ensure the smooth payment of the youth allowance in the future.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The opposition will support these amendments. The government describes the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  as being part of its tax reform package. It ought to be noted by the House that, far from being held up by the opposition, we expressly agreed to expedite Senate consideration of this bill by agreeing to remove it from the Senate GST inquiry. This 
 occurred last week, and the bill was passed in the Senate earlier this week with the amendments. This demonstrates once again that Labor is not against fair tax reform. This bill and the amendments are evidence that we support good tax changes. We continue, however, to remain opposed to the GST.
The effect of these amendments will be to benefit a number of people in remote areas. Labor proposed these amendments in the Senate after receiving strong representations from our Northern Territory representatives, Senator Crossin and the member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon. We are pleased that the government has seen fit to pick up and support these amendments, and the opposition will be supporting them here.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—On behalf of the parliamentary secretaries, I thank the House for the motion that was just carried. I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Darwin Naval Base Project, Darwin, Northern Territory.
The Department of Defence proposes to redevelop Darwin naval base to overcome facilities inadequacies affecting current operations and to cater for a planned increase in the number of minor war vessels to be home ported at Darwin. The base is an element of the Larrakeyah Barracks, and its initial development was completed in 1982. It was designed to support six Fremantle class patrol boats to be home ported in Darwin and to support other naval operational and exercise activities in northern waters.
Since 1982 the tempo of operational activities in the north has increased, as has the intensity of unilateral and bilateral exercises. Four Army landing craft and additional naval heavy landing craft and additional harbour support craft have been relocated to Darwin, placing an unacceptable strain on the existing support facilities. To support the increases in 
 activity and the additional craft, works were undertaken in 1992 to expand the dry berth tie down area and in 1993 works were undertaken to supplement administrative and workshop facilities. Navy intends to further increase the number of minor war vessels to be home ported in Darwin. An additional four patrol boats and another heavy landing craft will be relocated to Darwin on completion of the proposed works.
The predominant elements of the work will be the extension of the existing wharf to cater for landing craft, the construction of a new wharf to support patrol boats and visiting minor war vessels, extension of the dry land storage area to facilitate repair activities and to increase the base's capacity to protect craft in the event of a cyclone and increased fuel treatment and storage facilities to cater for home ported vessels. Inadequacies in office and stores areas will also be addressed.
The estimated turnout cost of the project is $12.4 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project will be committed in September 1999 with the objective of completion of work by June in the year 2001. I commend the motion to the House.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—The aim of the Navigation Amendment (Employment of Seafarers) Bill 1998  is to bring the Navigation Act into line with the Workplace Relations Act and to modernise the act, especially now that company employment applies in the shipping industry. If Australia is to have a competitive shipping industry, reform of the shipping legislation to make it an efficient regulatory tool is essential. This bill is the first stage of that reform, and those who oppose it are sending a message that they oppose a future for the industry.
Judging from the debate, the opposition have either misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented the content and impact of the bill. Despite the many hours of debate afforded to the opposition, they have not come up with one single reason to substantiate the claims they have made against the bill.
Contrary to what the opposition have said, the bill will not compromise safety, will not expose Australian seafarers to abuse, will not facilitate the use of forged certificates, will not open up the coast and waterfront to cheap foreign labour and will not have any of the 
 other ill-informed results claimed by the opposition. The bill simply removes a whole lot of archaic and unnecessary legislation that gets in the way of productive relationships between employers and their employees entering into genuine company employment. The bill does not in any way affect the safety of Australian seafarers, nor does it affect the issues raised in the Ships of shame or Ship safe reports.
The current powers given to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to deal with unseaworthy and substandard ships will not be affected by the bill. The rights of Australian seafarers to refuse to sail on an unseaworthy or substandard ship will remain, as will remedies to recover unpaid wages. Despite claims to the contrary by the opposition, the rights of Australian masters and seamen for wages and repatriation in the event of shipwreck, loss or bankruptcy are being retained.
Suggestions that the employment conditions of Australian seafarers will decline as a result of the amendments to the act are not credible. Australian seafarers enjoy some of the best employment conditions in the world. While some seafarers' conditions are currently set out in detail in the Navigation Act itself, for other industries they are contained in workplace agreements. With the move to company employment of seafarers, there is absolutely no reason to retain the conditions in the Navigation Act. They can be included in employment agreements between seafarers and the companies which employ them.
The bill is not aimed at reducing safety standards and will not have that effect. AMSA retains all of its powers through marine orders made under the Navigation Act to require the production of qualification certificates. Also, section 16 of the act covering the problems of forged certificates is being retained and is not affected by the amendments in the bill. The bill has no implications for the employment of foreign seafarers in Australia whose employment, like all other foreign workers, is determined by the provisions of the Migration Act.
While the bill is amending provisions of the Navigation Act, it is not amending the substance of Australia's cabotage regime. The 
 only amendment is the removal of an archaic provision relating to access to ship's libraries. Removing the compulsory requirement for articles of agreement increases the flexibility of employees and employers to enter into agreements best suited to the differing operations of individual companies.
If the Australian shipping industry is to survive and I guess prosper, it must be efficient and competitive. The legislative tools which regulate the industry must also be efficient and in line with modern practice. These amendments remove inconsistencies between the Navigation Act and the Workplace Relations Act. They bring the industry into line with other industries in this country and, given that company employment has now been adopted in the shipping industry, they remove totally unnecessary and restrictive employment practices.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-03-31,"—I want to address concerns I have heard from universities within and beyond my electorate on the proposed voluntary student unionism. This is not a law about fairness and equity. It is an unbridled ideologically based attack on student associations because of an apparent prejudice that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has about anything that has the name `union' attached to it. Let me read part of a letter from the Orange Agricultural College—that well-known hotbed of neo-Marxist revisionism and the alma mater of several National Party notables, including a recently retired former transport minister. The letter says:
Mr Kemp's anti union ideology is not relevant as far as we are concerned.
Our student association is in the business of providing the best possible student services we can and introduction of VSU will ensure our student services cease.
The minister argues that part-time and distance education students are the ones who most resist payment of these fees. That is not the message I am getting. Many of the services offered by Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, Wagga and Albury have special relevance to distance students, including Austudy and HECS advice, transport, residential school services and so on. Other services offered by MASC, the Mitchell Association of Student Councils, at CSU Bathurst include accident insurance, desktop publishing, a courtesy bus, and O-week organisation—over 50 important services. That is hardly the stuff of left-wing, anti-government activism. The Vice-Chancellor of ANU, Deane Terrell, says:
It is impossible to stop people who have not paid their fees from running onto an oval or from sitting in a cafeteria.
This debate about voluntary versus involuntary unionism would be academic if it were not for the more sinister intent of forcing universities to introduce voluntary student unionism by making it a condition of government funding that a university not raise a fee from a student that is not directly related to the course.
Grants from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs have already decreased from $4.79 billion in 1996 to $4.1 billion this year and are proposed to drop to $3.9 billion in 2001. The Australian vice-chancellors say that the withdrawal of government funding over three years to 2001 represents a reduction of $1,070 a student. The minister would argue that the gap has been made up from HECS. However, even allowing for HECS increases, the reduction is $234 a student and set to drop by a significant amount if these proposals go through.
The arts faculty at ANU, for one, has been decimated in recent years as scarce funds are directed to more market oriented courses. Research now depends largely on tied government grants and funds paid under contract by the corporate sector. The anthropology and archaeology departments at ANU are being ground down to a shadow of their former roles. They might soon themselves be the subjects of archaeological digs to discover what was taught in an age when pure research for other than commercial ends enriched a civilisation.
I had the privilege of attending the 1999 Mulvaney Lecture by Professor Jim Allen at ANU last week at which one of our foremost archaeologists reviewed research from the past four decades and outlined how that research has declined alarmingly. He said:
. . . the decimation of that department last year in the name of economic rationalism, and present attacks on the remnant which is left, may permanently destroy a legacy which might never have evolved in the state universities . . . we must stop the dismemberment of archaeology in the ANU.
And I would add the arts and the classics too. The market will not deliver the type of educated people we need in this country and the 
 government's reliance on the market delivering quality tertiary education is further underlined by the extraordinary payback voluntary student unionism legislation.
The thinking behind that legislation is 25 years out of date, locked in the era of the Vietnam War or the Cold War when student agitation really did move public opinion and embarrassed governments. And why not? But I guess the minister can sleep peacefully knowing that the political extremists of universities like Orange Agricultural College, which I have named, have finally been caught out for daring to use the student association supplied photocopier to copy last year's exam paper.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I want to speak today on behalf of a 100 or so workers currently employed by Telstra at its Docklands call centre in my electorate of Gellibrand. Telstra, unfortunately, has made a decision to close this centre. It is a devastating decision. With the support of the workers, their unions, their families and the local community I am seeking to reverse that decision. We want to convince Telstra to stay in Footscray and to continue to provide local jobs to our region. Those jobs are so scarce and so valued. Each and every job in Footscray matters.
The statistics tell us that in Gellibrand we have 11.8 per cent unemployment, nearly twice the national average of 7.4 per cent, and over 28 per cent of our young people unemployed. These shameful percentages are not just abstract figures. These figures represent 7,273 people and their families who are desperately seeking work and hoping to build better lives. They are our neighbours, our families and our friends. We cannot afford to lose any more jobs and add some more families to this long list.
In pleading with Telstra to reconsider its decision, I am arguing for those 100 jobs to stay in Footscray. In addition to the jobs that go directly from Telstra, I am concerned about the wider impact on our region as a whole. Telstra needs to understand that its decision to take 100 jobs out of Footscray has an impact on every local sandwich shop, milk bar and supermarket currently used by those employees.
I have written today to Telstra asking them to take account of the high unemployment in our region and urging them to reconsider their decision. I have also reminded them of Footscray's advantages. We are so close to the CBD, yet costs are still reasonable, space generous and access comfortable.
Remember that, when I write to Telstra, I am not writing to any old business. It is not a family business or a multinational or even a chain store. Telstra is different. It should be different because it plays a vital role in our community. We are all its customers; we are all still its owners. Due to this, we expect Telstra to be aware about our region and to understand why we want it to stay in Footscray. Telstra needs to have a community view, not just a business view about the decisions it makes.
We simply cannot afford to lose these jobs from Footscray. I urge Telstra to look at our region, its needs and its advantages, and to review its decision—please stay in Footscray.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Footscray</title>,Statements by Members,44,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I rise this morning to speak on the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 . This bill is a necessary piece of legislation to basically tidy up the government's ill-conceived and hastily enacted youth income support payment system—the youth allowance acts. Since its rushed introduction late last year, both the intended recipients—young people—and the payment delivery agency—Centrelink—have been struggling to truly understand the entitlements that are available and the rules governing access to those entitlements, particularly in relation to payments previously available under the student assistance programs, Austudy. Although this bill will consolidate most of the previous provisions relating to youth allowance into the Social Security Act, thereby at least making the basic rules for the system easier to find, it fails to address the fundamental problems surrounding the system.
Changes in the youth allowance at this time—even necessary changes—are impossible to implement effectively due to the climate of fear and the element of fatigue suffered by the major players in this legislation. Changes to the youth allowance affect two groups in particular: the young people of Australia and the staff at Centrelink. Through a succession of government policies, both of these groups have been left in no doubt that this government cannot successfully deal with these affairs.
With regard to Centrelink, which is responsible for administering the provisions of the legislation, this government has slashed away at the organisation, leaving massive understaffing. This, in turn, has made Centrelink absolutely unable to cope with the demands placed upon it. The consequence of this is bungling from the agency, a crisis in staff morale and a disconnection between the offices and the community that it serves.
The bungling in Centrelink is now of serious national concern. This agency, responsible for payments to over six million Australians, has been repeatedly cut to the point where it can no longer do its job effectively. The recent overpayment crisis highlights the situation being 
 faced by Centrelink customers. Customers deserve better than to have debts hanging over their heads for no reason other than an error at Centrelink's end. Staff, on the other hand, are dedicated and professional in their commitment to their clients. I am certain it pains staff greatly to cut corners or make mistakes simply because there is not enough staff to do the job properly.
The government seems arrogant and indifferent to the problems in Centrelink. Along with the unsustainable slashing of 5,000 jobs, the government diverts staff from the task of serving customers and uses them instead to promote the politics of the Liberal and the National parties. Staff and resources that should be ensuring that young people receive their proper entitlements under the youth allowance legislation have instead been applied to the politicisation of Centrelink's communication with its customers. It is a national scandal.
Earlier this year, the government was found to have breached the privacy of 1.7 million pensioners and veterans by spending $800,000 on political propaganda about the GST during the 1998 election campaign. That information was sent via Centrelink. Apart from the obvious implications of privacy and electoral impropriety, it is a wasteful use of government resources. The government should have spent the money wasted on the tax funded GST campaign to provide adequate and timely provision of support payments for young people.
Timeliness is an important issue for young people—indeed, all social security recipients—as most payments are not backdated but can only commence from the time an application is duly received and processed by Centrelink. At least something is being done about this issue through schedule 1 to this bill, which deals with fares allowance. This seeks to add provisions under which a claim for fares allowance may be treated as having been received when the person first contacts Centrelink about the claim by telephone or fax. In theory, this is good.
However, it is now an accepted truth that Centrelink clients cannot speak with a real human being that knows anything about their situation. The dehumanisation of Centrelink is dangerous and degrading for both customers and staff. Current figures illustrate that over 80 per cent of callers failed to get through to Centrelink in 1998. These trends have continued in figures for the first month of this year. In human terms, around 250,000 calls a day are failing to get through to Centrelink. The fact is that calling Centrelink is now becoming the new national lottery.
The 1300 numbers are not functioning because the staffing levels are not adequate and the centralisation of call services does not recognise the unique and personal nature of Centrelink inquiries. People who ring do so only when there is a problem. When people have a problem with something as important as a government benefit, each call is very serious and each one can take some time.
Creating a national call centre has been a disaster. I know that assisting constituents is made that much harder without at least some level of access to the office in which the matter is being dealt with. It is impossible to understand the frustration faced by a Centrelink customer who, after five attempts at ringing the local office, finally gets through, only to be talking with a telephone operator in Sydney or perhaps in Melbourne.
After the nightmare of making telephone contact with staff, the public face the next blow-out in Centrelink—appointment waiting lists. Customers on youth allowance and Newstart are facing delays of up to 14 days before being interviewed. This has resulted in people facing a two-week delay in lodging Centrelink forms. That means two weeks without financial support and two weeks before people can be registered as unemployed for the purposes of the 
 Job Network. And, guess what, the provisions in this bill with regard to fares allowance require that the formal claim is lodged within 14 days of the initial contact. Young people lose again.
The government's plan to introduce agencies to replace Centrelink offices is a concern not only for the privacy and security of rural and regional clients but also because it represents a significant deskilling of the service. In an appalling attempt to paper over the cracks in the Centrelink budget, the Howard government's only solution is to spend $5 million in order to turn credit unions, post offices, business centres and individuals into Centrelink service providers in rural and regional Australia.
This concept raises significant privacy implications. The reality is that Centrelink staff are specifically trained to deal with information regarding taxable income, investments and assets of individuals, information relating to family matters, including family breakdown and custody arrangements, health and medical history, and employment details. This information is by far more sensitive and personal than information currently accessed by the types of non-government organisations outlined by the government. Such information would be required by schedule 3 of the bill covering provisions on the family actual means test and schedule 4 covering definitions of homeless person and FA child.
Centrelink deals with many people who require the services of trained and dedicated staff, of public servants who respect the privacy of an individual and are accountable for their actions. What these agencies will be is a drop-off point: forms can be lodged, but real, meaningful assistance will be scarce, if any.
Quite frankly, Centrelink is in disarray. The service is failing dismally now and racing backwards at breakneck speed. This agency will not welcome changes to the youth allowance when it cannot cope with the current workloads. Changes to allowances, regardless of the benefits of such change, will overburden the current system. What this government should be presenting to the parliament is a package of fundamental and wholesale improvements to Centrelink; the restoration of the budget, so that over six million Australians can be properly serviced; and staffing levels returned to a point where mistakes can be avoided, customers can make contact with the department and the nation can regain its confidence in the social security system. Until this is done, Centrelink will fail to meet the basic needs of young people, and the government will be judged harshly for this.
Set against the plummeting fortunes of Centrelink is the battle-weary youth of Australia. The young people of Australia have received no good news from this government. Policies that strip away youth services and the politics of finger pointing have left young people very cynical and distrusting of change. The provisions covering entitlement to youth allowance force young people under 21 or full-time students up to the age of 25 to remain dependent on their parents and to further have their entitlements assessed on the basis of their parents' income.
The government's agenda has been transparent to young people: Work for the Dole, the Job Network and the common youth allowance are seen as massive failures. These programs lack any vision or tangible outcomes, and the fact that all these initiatives come at the expense of labour market programs and proven government services only serves to further frustrate those young people languishing in the mire of government incompetence.
Work for the Dole has failed to deliver anything in the way of meaningful training or work readiness for Australia's young unemployed. The system could quite rightly be described as `turn up for the dole'. While this may satisfy the Howard government and their punitive outlook on the young unemployed, it is doing nothing to enhance the job prospects of young 
 job seekers. Work for the Dole must be a complement to a range of labour market programs that give all unemployed people the broad range of skills, experience and motivation that will create the shift from long-term unemployment to paid work.
Unfortunately, that cannot happen because this government have scrapped effective and efficient labour market programs, leaving themselves with a one-pronged attack on the issue of the long-term unemployed. These labour market programs were not only effective but supported and endorsed by those going through those very programs. That support came not only from the fact that participants saw these programs as adding greatly to their future employment prospects but also because they treated all unemployed people fairly.
The Work for the Dole scheme is a compulsory requirement for young unemployed that are reliant on youth allowance because it suits the ideology of this government. This government is not about fixing unemployment; it simply wants to be seen to be tough with young unemployed people. This is why in my electorate of Oxley we particularly suffer some of the worst youth unemployment statistics in Australia. In suburbs across my electorate, unemployment is routinely sitting at over 10 per cent of the population, while for those young unemployed people who seek to join the labour force the teenage unemployment rate is up to 30 per cent in some areas. This is clearly not acceptable. This is a tragedy and a scandal in itself. Nearly one in every three young job seekers cannot find work. While this is alarming at a statistical level, it is crippling at a human level.
The great and shameful legacy of this government is their failing on youth unemployment. Young people have been abandoned by the system. Many young people have not had employment in their lives. They have moved from school to unemployment. Their days are filled with hopelessness and sometimes the reckless and antisocial behaviour that often accompanies such hopelessness. These are the young Australians that we must move heaven and earth to get into work. We must create a social safety net that encourages and supports them as they move from benefits to jobs.
The youth allowance must become part of an active package of measures designed to address youth unemployment, not to beat up on young people, but rather an integral part of rewarding young people for work. The youth allowance, must—as the vision of the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, illustrated—be an enabler not a way of life.
The Prime Minister's policies lack that vision. His youth allowance lacks vision and it will continue to fail the young people of our nation. The difficulties faced by our youth are compounded by the government's continued use of experimental and failing services. Of all the experiments of this government, none has failed more spectacularly than the Job Network. This shambolic amalgamation of disparate services was built on the ruins of the ground where the CES once stood.
The Job Network has failed, no matter what smoke and mirrors are used by the government to pretend otherwise. Minister Kemp's great social reform has failed and it has cost all of us dearly. From day one the system started to break down and service providers experienced financial difficulty. The government has since been forced to come to the financial aid of the network several times, and is well short of finding a sustainable platform from which the network will be viable.
Apart from the financial difficulties experienced within the network, the changes have meant that services that were previously freely available to all are now being denied to many. Services are overwhelmingly being run on a commercial rather than on a community or public 
 interest basis. The changes mean that most local community agencies, like Skillshare, have disappeared and regions with high unemployment, such as mine, are not being adequately serviced.
The government's suggestion that the Job Network has increased outlets for support for the unemployed simply does not add up. The fact is there are 150 fewer public, community and private case management sites since the Job Network was introduced. This is a fall of nearly 20 per cent. Because this government cannot get its act together on labour market programs and the Job Network, young unemployed people are left languishing on the common youth allowance.
The concept that young people who are unemployed or studying can be penalised for their parents' earnings at less than $25,000 has left young people struggling and has also had an impact on the entire family. The youth allowance will keep a lot of young people at home. It will also keep a lot of homes in hock. This government should be aware that you cannot be pro families and be anti young people.
In my electorate it is average families who are battling under the increasing financial burden placed on them through changes to the away from home rates and means testing. Not all families share in the Prime Minister's white picket fence dream. The government stay at home youth allowance has failed young people and it is making things tougher and tougher for those young people who, for a variety of reasons, cannot stay at home.
By applying Work for the Dole and the ill conceived and ridiculous `read for the dole' scheme exclusively to young Australians, this government is again playing the politics of finger pointing. These policies are designed to convince Australia that youth unemployment is a result of the failings and laziness of young people. The government cannot sidestep their own failures on this crucial national issue.
If the Prime Minister were serious about literacy he would put the government's money where his mouth is, but no new money is available for literacy training for the unemployed. Instead, the government's commitment to literacy training for the unemployed remains a pitiful $21 million a year. Without new resources the literacy program will be nothing but a hollow stunt.
The bill also provides for the administration of student assistance payments to young people continuing their education. Access to quality education is the most important issue facing young Australians today. Education will make the difference in every young person's life yet this government has let education slide. Budget cuts and up-front university fees are reducing the availability and quality of education for young people.
The government's budget cuts in education have resulted in reduced funding for public schools. At a time when public school enrolments are increasing due, in no small measure, to the government's eligibility requirements for youth allowance, this government is creating a crisis in government schools. Students at university, meantime, are faced with rising up-front government charges as well as an increase in HECS to pay for massive cuts to education funding. That any government can approach the new millennium with a reduced commitment to higher education is simply unbelievable.
The daunting prospect facing many university students and their families is that they will have to meet the increased costs with less support through the youth allowance. This is exactly why there is an overall reduction in the number of Australian students at universities and TAFE colleges. Reducing access to education and training is not just stupid, it threatens the 
 nation's future. Yet still the government persecutes the young people of Australia. They resent Minister Reith and his youth wages because they know the truth. Lower youth wages will not create more jobs, while skills based wages will result in competitive wages for young people in most industries. It is not just the Democrats and Senator Harradine who know the government cannot be trusted; young people know it also.
Now is the time for the government to restore faith with the young people of Australia. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to provide real assistance to young people through a commitment to education and training; to redouble the fight against youth unemployment; and provide fair and reasonable financial support payments and an agency with adequate resource to deliver those payments. We need to stand up for young people and their families, not punish them and not push them down. This youth allowance legislation does nothing for the young people of Australia.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—In March 1998, this House passed the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This legislation abolished unemployment benefits that would have been payable to 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds and inflicted a means test on parents of children 18 years and over. This bill caused considerable hardships to families in my electorate of Greenway and I intend to relate some of these hardships later in my speech.
Nationally the means test applied to some 40,000 young people and some families lost up to $170 a fortnight. The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999  before the House today is intended to incorporate two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy into the Social Security Act 1991. It also addresses technical measures arising out of the implementation of the youth allowance package and is to make consequential amendments relating to the commencement of the youth allowance.
This bill does contain some reasonable and beneficial measures, but other measures will result in reduced entitlements for some young unemployed people. For example, schedule 4 of the bill amends the Social Security Act to address issues identified during the implementation of the youth allowance and Austudy payment. Some of these will have a significant effect upon beneficiaries. The schedule proposed to reduce the rate paid to some disability support pensioners under the age of 21 and to increase the rate for others is an example.
The effect of these changes varies, depending on the pensioner's circumstances. A single person aged between 18 and 21 who does not live at home and has a dependent child will lose $7 per fortnight, while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain about $17 per fortnight. The guardian allowance of $37 per fortnight can be paid under existing legislation to single parents in certain circumstances. This schedule seeks to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate.
Under current provisions, the rate of family allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. A family allowance child can be a child receiving a youth allowance. The schedule seeks to amend this so that the child receiving a youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. This does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent children until they are aged 21 and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result 
 of the youth allowance legislation. These amendments only add to the financial problems of young unemployed people and their families already created by the common youth allowance.
I will now refer once again to some of the problems encountered within my electorate and which I have drawn to this House's attention on previous occasions. They remain important however and deserve to be brought forward once again.
The first relates to a single father, Arthur, and his daughter, Melissa. She sat for her Higher School Certificate in 1996 and completed her first year of a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of New England in 1997, but was unable to continue her studies last year due to a lack of finance. At the time Melissa spoke to me she was 19, unemployed, and had received unemployment benefits of $170 per fortnight. This young lady's income dropped to $20 per fortnight on 1 July 1998 due to the parental income assessment under the Commonwealth's Youth Allowance Scheme. She then had to rely on her father for board and lodging.
The young lady had further difficulties in that she had a medical problem that at the time made her unemployable. She had applied for a disability support pension but had been assessed as being only 10 per cent incapacitated. Therefore, she was not entitled to a pension. To be entitled to a pension Melissa would have had to have been assessed at 20 per cent incapacitated and not be able to work for two years. The unreal aspect of this position is that, if you are even one per cent incapacitated, employers would not employ you.
There is a further difficulty for this family. Arthur, the father, has estimated that his income has dropped by some 15 per cent due to enterprise bargaining negotiations. Many families are suffering this double effect of falling income and a reduction in social security payments.
My second story relates to a mother who rang me to advise of a situation involving her son who had left school in December 1996. Since that time he has completed a life skills training course at TAFE, worked for two months in the timber industry, worked for seven months as a tyre fitter on $4.50 an hour, and had other casual work.
This young man was then unemployed. At the time his mother rang me he was 18 and his mother had expected that he would qualify for unemployment benefits and so at least have sufficient money to be able to enjoy a social life. However this young man, who was already 18 months out of school, had completed a TAFE course and had worked but was then unemployed, did not qualify for unemployment benefits. The government expected this low income family to support this young man. The combined income for the family was $480 a week to support four people.
Another son was an apprentice and so could only marginally contribute to the family's budget. The situation has already caused tension in the family. The mother was worried that her son would leave home, as he had done once previously, and possibly turn to a life of petty crime to obtain sufficient money to live.
My third case study relates to a young man named Michael and his father who came to see me a few weeks ago. The father made it very clear to me that he was very cranky about this legislation. If I had been a Liberal member of parliament he would have been really giving it to me. But he understood, of course, that I was not responsible for this piece of legislation.
This was the situation. Michael was 20 and unemployed and he had received youth allowance of $176 for the period 27 January 1999 until 9 February 1999, approximately $88 per week. Michael was then advised by Centrelink on 10 February that his payment would 
 be reduced to $119.62 per fortnight due to a change in circumstances. It seems the combined family income had increased. This was $53.92 per week. This is a totally inadequate amount for a young man who possibly would be expected to contribute to the household budget, be entitled to enjoy some sporting activity, have a social life, and at the same time travel around to seek employment. Michael then received correspondence from Centrelink dated 24 February stating:
You have received youth allowance at a rate of $176 per fortnight from 1 January 1999 whereas your current entitlement was $119.62 per fortnight depending on your parent's financial year's income.
The result of this was that Michael had incurred a debt of $157.63. Therefore, Michael had to repay this amount which is, in fact, in excess of his current fortnightly entitlement. Centrelink advised him that he was to repay that amount or his payments would be reduced to help recover that amount.
I believe this is a totally unfair way of dealing with low income people who no doubt spend their paltry income each fortnight. If there is an overpayment, they have to beg, borrow or steal—and unfortunately steal could well come into this—to make this repayment or otherwise suffer further reductions in income. These cases give a few examples of how this government's policies are hurting low income families. Young adults who are old enough to vote, to go to war, to get married and who are looking for work, are clearly independent, and they should not be forced to rely on their low income families for support.
Another problem that one of my constituents has drawn to my attention is the amount of paperwork that either the young person or the family has to fill out to claim the common youth allowance. I have brought in some photostatted documents. There are some 40 different pages of instructions and forms to fill out. It would appear that the government is trying to establish a one-stop shop style of form. But, in doing this, the government has created a paper monster, which young people and their families have to work through. In the long run, this quite possibly could lead to incorrect information which may delay payment or may result in an incorrect payment being made. In some cases, this could mean that the person might unintentionally claim more than they are entitled to: they might incur a debt and then that debt has to be repaid.
These are the problems that young people and their families are encountering. The facts are that I believe—and a constituent came to see me about this only a week or so ago—that we need to have smaller forms with fewer items to fill out. The forms should be targeted to particular groups of young unemployed people, whether on an age basis or based on their current employment situation.
I would now like to follow up my own constituents' experiences on the effect of the common youth allowance by quoting from a few articles in journals and daily papers that reinforce my constitutents' experiences. In an article in Feature Outlook, there is reference to the quite substantial savings that the government has made by this legislation. The National Union of Students is quoted as stating that, by raising the age of independence to 25, the government has saved $163.5 million a year; the tightening of the Austudy actual means test has saved another $150 million a year. Some 12,800 18- to 20-year-olds have lost benefits because they are now means tested on the basis of their family income and these have been assessed as being too high. The article I am referring to has been written by Penny Lake and it concludes by stating this:
The government is not addressing the real issue—lack of jobs. They are sidelining this with the youth allowance by focussing on young people and claiming in effect that with extra education, the number of jobs will miraculously increase. It dubiously assumes that a skilled and educated workforce of young people (with limited job experience) will naturally translate into a multitude of jobs appropriate to their individual level of training.
The government is cleverly shifting the blame for unemployment from the policy makers and unaccountable corporate industries to the young unemployed, with possibly disastrous consequences. Youth unemployment is a question to which there are no easy answers. The youth allowance system, has, if anything, made answering it even more difficult.
Further, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald  of 25 August, reports on the findings of a Dr Dasia Black, a family psychologist and a research associate at the Australian Catholic University, as follows:
We define adulthood legally as being over the age of 18 but psychologically as having economic and emotional independence from parents.
She says the youth allowance has prolonged adolescence well beyond the traditional 16-18 year age span. At the same time, the cosy, intact family that is supposedly waiting to cradle these over-sized fledglings no longer exists in many cases.
Black refers to the work of a British sociologist Christopher Jenks, who contrasts the `modern world' of the 1950s-1970s with the `postmodern' world of the 1990s.
Jenks argues that the postmodern world is characterised by a loss of hope and belief in the future, which is reflected in the way young people are treated.
While in the 1950s-1970s we saw young people as our future and therefore worthy of our money and time (hence free university education), in the postmodern world we have no such belief in progress and therefore won't invest in children.
Unlike previous decades when there was a clear path into adulthood—university, jobs, economic independence—young people now have to grow up knowing there might not be a job for them.
Yet they are still bathed in seductive media images of material success.
Black argues that forcing young adults to stay home may lead to conflict as they chafe against dependency and parental rule and values. If they resist the push to go back to the nest, they may be forced instead into poverty and become more vulnerable to crime, alcoholism, depression, stress and even suicide.
To that list I might add drug addiction. The youth allowance reinforces the government's philosophy that forces families to support young people until they have achieved financial independence, whatever the financial plight of their parents may be. This ignores the fact that, in this period of employment insecurity, many families are facing reduced income, longer working hours or reduced employment prospects. This policy is therefore placing an added strain on low income families who are at the time of life when they have raised and educated their children. Some of them are now planning their retirement and others may be facing an uncertain employment future due to the economic rationalist policies of this government—privatisation, corporatisation and outsourcing.
The fall in income for middle-aged workers has been detailed in a report by Bob Gregory, from the ANU. For the purposes of what I am saying today: the figures show that for men aged between 35 and 54 years the income fall is marginal. For those between 60 and 64 years, the weekly fall is $128. We can assume from these figures that the male's ability to support a family starts to slide from the mid-50s age group—that is, of course, provided he is still in employment. So the youth allowance legislation is continuing this government's policy of discriminating against low income people.
It is long overdue that this government and its media mates stopped worrying about the past life of Paul Keating and started thinking about the appalling behaviour they are directing at the future of our nation—the youth. The government seems totally oblivious to the huge dividing line it is creating within our great nation.
For those of us who thought that Malcolm Fraser divided the nation and that we were brought back to unity by Bob Hawke, this government, led by the ex-Fraser Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, makes Malcolm Fraser look like a rank amateur. This government belts pensioners, youth, farmers and city dwellers, criticises every action of the ALP, and then places two former staffers of the member for Flinders into jobs for the boys. Clearly this is just the tip of the iceberg of the government's divisive behaviour. It is not good enough for our nation and it should stop now.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—This government has waged a concerted attack on young Australians and their families. This attack has been directed at every level of their lives, with cuts to education and training, moves to reduce youth wages and the introduction of this youth allowance, an action that has caused great hurt and distress for a number of families and one that continues to cause hurt. I continually wonder how members on the other side of this parliament can live with themselves, knowing that their decisions and their actions have caused so much hurt for young Australians and their families.
While this legislation, the  Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 , does marginally improve or tidy up some aspects of the operational components of the youth allowance, it is more of the same bad medicine. It is legislation designed to entrench measures that are causing hurt to young Australians and their families, whilst at the same time the government is abrogating its responsibility to these same young Australians, putting cost cutting ahead of their welfare and their future.
Young people have been targeted by this government continually. I think this is because they are seen as a less powerful group within the community: they are still coming to terms with their own self-identity and they find it harder to get out there and form those formal structures that are needed to lobby governments in the way that other groups in our community can. Because they are a less powerful group within the community, I think this government has singled them out and decided that they will target them. I do not think this is good enough. Young people are old enough to vote. Young people are old enough to defend our country. Young people, once they are 18, if they commit a crime, have the same responsibility for their actions as a person who is 21, 31, 41, 65; they receive the same penalties and they have the same obligations.
Where you have the same obligations and the same responsibilities, surely you deserve to be treated in the same way as other people. But, unfortunately, that is not the way of this government. This government does not feel that young people, people of 18, 19, 20, are real people. They are not considered adults; they are not considered people who are contributing to our country in the same way as people who have reached the age of 21, 22, 31, 32. This youth allowance is hurting. It hurts young people. It is hurting their families and it is causing great problems within our community and our society. It is forcing young people to be dependent on their families.
When this legislation was initially introduced there were many young people who had made life decisions, decisions that they would move away from their homes as they were now 18. Maybe sometimes situations existed within those homes that made it very hard for young 
 people to continue to live there. There can often be conflict within families. It can also be that moving from the family home to another area improves their opportunities for studying, for obtaining work and developing their own self-identity. Unfortunately, this government does not think that is important. It does not think that young people who are 18, 19, 20 deserve to be able to do this. The government feels that mummy and daddy should still look after them, that they need to be looked after by their families, that it is their family's responsibility. So, whilst on the one hand they are responsible for their acts if they commit a crime, on the other hand they are their parents' responsibility because they are not old enough—not mature enough—to make decisions about their future, about their studies, about where they live. I find this really abhorrent.
As I mentioned, a number of people have financial commitments. The government makes the assumption, too, that parents have spare money, that they have got money sitting around that they can direct towards their children. Children! That is an inappropriate word because they are not children, they are young adults, so it is giving young adults money to survive.
At the time this legislation was introduced a couple of people got in touch with the previous federal member, the Hon. Peter Morris. A case was detailed in our local newspapers of a young person who was put into a situation where the relationships within the home was so dreadful that he could not go back there. If he did not get the youth allowance, he did not eat. He was told by Centrelink, `Sorry, you no longer qualify. It is bad luck but you have got to go and find some other way that you can survive.' This government was abrogating its responsibility, putting that person in an untenable situation. And this is more of that sort of legislation entrenching this stigmatising of young people.
They find it very demoralising indeed. They feel that the government are saying, `We do not think that you are an important person. We feel that you are unemployed because you choose to be.' And on the other hand, they say, `We do not think that we should assist your move from a situation of unemployment to work.' As well as the attack on the income support, there has been an overall attack on young people and on the training available for those young people to access the work force. At the same time as they are increasing the requirements that are necessary for a person to obtain youth allowance, they are cutting Centrelink, and Centrelink is less able to process the applications. There are more mistakes being made. There are more young people being disadvantaged. People are being denied youth allowance when they are actually eligible for youth allowance. It all comes back to this cutting, slashing, cost saving, economic rationalist approach whereby the person is not important but what is important is that you just cut and then you blame those people that are in the least powerful position within our community. I am sorry. I do not think that is good enough. I know that the members on this side of the House feel the same way.
The Work for the Dole program has been touted as the solution to all the problems. I have some real problems with the Work for the Dole program. First of all, look at the word `dole'. For years income assistance was called `unemployment benefit' and there was a definite decision that you should never refer to it as `dole' because the word `dole' carries stigma. By having a program that says `work for the dole' you are stigmatising the people who are receiving that right from the very beginning.
From unemployment benefits we went to Newstart, giving the idea that people were on this allowance or benefit that was setting them up for a new start, getting them ready to go out 
 there and conquer the world. But, no, we are back to Work for the Dole. Here they are being given a handout now and their mutual obligation is to work for that handout.
I put it to the government that they have also got a mutual obligation to young people. They have got a mutual obligation to offer them a future. They have got a mutual obligation to offer them training. They have got a mutual obligation to ensure that there are going to be real jobs for the future.
The previous Labor government introduced LEAP which offered young unemployed people the chance to get on-the-job experience working three days a week while at the same time being able to obtain formal qualifications. So they were equipped with not only experience but also some tangible skills that could be translated into other areas of work, skills that were recognised and which quite often worked as a springboard into more formal education.
That brings me to education. This government has cut funds for education. It has attacked universities. We have only got to see that today is a national day of action at all the universities throughout this country to see the esteem the government is held in by students.
All the time there have been changes to HECS that make it harder for people that come from lower and middle income families to access education. Education is moving back towards being something that is available only to those people who have the money and the ability to access those funds you need to attend university. There have been cuts to TAFE funding, the very basic area, where people can get the most basic of training that often acts as a springboard into other areas of education. This government have constantly and continually cut funding to all areas except for private education. They are putting their money into private education at the expense of those people who really need that funding.
The changes to Austudy have certainly had a detrimental effect and made it harder for young people to be able to attend university and TAFE. There is a constant undermining and eroding of the situation in relation to young people getting education, having income support, having hope for the future, and being able to plan where they would like to be when they are my age or the age of their parents. I do not know how this government can justify the actions that they have taken.
With regard to the initiative about literacy and numeracy and the assessment deeming that young people have poor literacy and numeracy skills and will be forced to do literacy and numeracy programs, I would like to ask the government how they are going to do this. First, how are they going to undertake the assessments? As somebody who has actually conducted literacy assessments, I know that it needs to be done in a controlled environment. It needs to be done in the situation where you can compare the results that one person achieves against another.
Once you have assessed the person's literacy levels, then you have to find a place where they can go to improve those literacy skills. In addition, you need to be able to determine why they have poor literacy or numeracy skills. Why did the education system fail them? Do they have a specific learning disability? If so, is the government going to fund some sort of remediation for those people?
I put it to the government that what they are planning to do there is just another cost-cutting exercise. It is not about improving opportunities for young people with literacy and numeracy problems. It is about cutting; it is about slashing; it is about stigmatising them. It is about making it harder for those young people.
Just touching also on the changes that they have made in the area of young people with disabilities, the opportunities these young people had in the past have been reduced. All the time the government are looking at cutting the funding to that area. They have entrenched a situation whereby young people with disabilities will get the lowest possible income support available. It is all a move away from creating opportunity: opportunity for people with disabilities; opportunity for people with learning disabilities and poor literacy skills, and opportunity for people who are looking at finding employment in different areas. This government have absolutely no commitment to young people.
The government's initiative this week is the decision to cut benefits or make them really difficult to obtain for people who move from an area of low unemployment to one of high unemployment. For example, if they leave Sydney, having been told they have a job in Newcastle, an area of higher unemployment, and they get there and that job falls through, then they will not be granted any sort of financial assistance. It is called the Byron Bay initiative—the surf and sun initiative—and, once again, it is targeting young people. It is saying young people are not working because young people do not want to work. Young people move from one area to another just to be able to get away from their obligation to work. All they are about is taking hand-outs from the government and, because of that, we are going to punish them.
When will the government learn that young people want a future? When will the government actually make a commitment to young people? Instead of constantly attacking young people, this government needs to become relevant to them because at the moment it lacks relevance with its backward looking, regressive policies that are always attacking and removing opportunity from young people. It is about time that it came into the 1990s and learnt about the things that are important to young people.
I wonder how many people on the other side of this House even know the names of the bands out there that young people listen to—good Australian bands. I am sure some of them may have heard of silverchair or the Whitlams, but there are also the Screaming Jets, Regurgitator and Jebediah—all great Australian bands. They are all bands that young Australians hold very dear to their hearts, and bands that are very relevant to young people in our community.
—There are newer ones now; you're showing your age.
—I don't know any of them!
—I suspect very few members actually know who these bands are. And just as members of the government do not take the time to know these fine Australian bands, they do not know the issues that are important to young people. One issue is jobs. They should be helping young people move from a situation of being reliant on youth allowance to employment. They should be helping young people obtain the education and training that will facilitate that move.
The government is not aware of the issues that relate to the problems that young people face in our community. This government is not about coming to terms with issues of youth suicide and drugs. Its answer to drugs is, `Hit them and hit them hard,' rather than looking at why young people are turning to drugs; why young people are taking their own lives. It is not looking at the social impact of its decisions. It is not looking at the fact that young people in our community are grappling and searching for a future.
Young people want to have the support of government. They want a government that is there to offer them opportunity and hope for the future. This government is taking away that hope. This government is not only attacking their financial support through youth allowance; it is seeking to reduce youth wages and make young people dependent on their parents in every possible way.
This government is not about equality of opportunity for young people; this government is about looking after those people that it perceives can benefit it. This attack on young Australians is an attack on every Australian family, on average Australian families, on families that are battling and struggling, on families that are just everyday Australians, and on workers out there who are looking for a future for their children.
The government really stands condemned for what it has done to young people in our community, how it has removed their hope for the future, and how it has failed to offer young people opportunity and a future. This legislation really should be condemned because, while it aims to tidy up some of the mistakes made in the first legislation, it does not cure the problem. It is all about making it harder for young people to have a future, to get training, to get education and to find a job.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999  is a legislative housekeeping exercise. Its purpose is to incorporate two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy into the Social Security Act 1991; to address technical issues arising out of the implementation of the youth allowance package; and to make consequential amendments relating to the commencement of youth allowance.
The youth allowance was introduced in July 1998. It merged all income support for young unemployed people under the age of 21 and full-time students between the ages of 16 and 24 years into one payment administered by the Department of Social Security, DSS, now called the Department of Family and Community Services. The only exceptions were Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme.
While this bill is just a legislative housekeeping exercise, the youth allowance itself has had significant ramifications for many families and many young people. Since its introduction, my electorate office has received many phone calls and letters from young people and their families who had been badly affected by the introduction of the new system.
The youth allowance system has cut off financial independence, placed extra burdens on families and put up new barriers to undertaking study or finding a job for many in my electorate. Unfortunately, I am sure we all remember the unacceptable handling of those dramatic changes at the time that they came in. They were huge changes in a very small period of time, which put the Centrelink agency itself under enormous, in fact unbelievable, pressure.
Rarely in this country have we seen the implementation of a policy so badly handled as a result of the timetable and the enormous extent of the changes involved in such a timetable. Phone calls to Centrelink received the engaged signal. People had to wait days for appointments to discuss the implementation and the implications of the changes that were being delivered to them.
The stress that was already going to affect our young community members was exacerbated many times over by the manner in which this interesting brave new world of support for young people was implemented. I ask: how is it possible to deliver any program, let alone one like this, if you intend to cut 5,000 staff and $150 million from the budget in an environment where major policy changes are taking place and you effect that in the very agency that is expected 
 to deliver the goods? We all know problems at Centrelink are occurring on a daily basis and they will continue to occur not only in the area of youth allowance but across the board in all benefits provided until the government realises and accepts the truth about the crisis within Centrelink.
On a more personal level, the Minister for Family and Community Services and I seem to have engaged ourselves in an ongoing debate about this very question of the ability of Centrelink to continue to deliver services to its client base. I tell the House, with no qualification at all, that I will not resile from my responsibility as a local member to ensure that I tell the government the facts, the truth, about how these decisions are affecting my community and particularly the young people in it. I look forward to the day—and I hope it is not too far away, but I tend to be a bit cynical—when I will not be accused of misleading the community and the government. I look forward to the day when the words I say to the government and the minister will be accepted for what they, in fact, are—the absolute truth.
Recently, there has been a lot of talk about mutual obligation between welfare recipients and government. The government uses this language regularly to highlight what it believes is the propensity for people on welfare to cheat the system. I reject this assessment and reject the implication that, by opposing the government on this issue, I am and we are in some way supporting welfare rorts.
There is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party want to assist young Australians off welfare dependency—there is absolutely no question about that—but not in the way that has been proposed by the Howard government with their youth allowance. To abolish unemployment benefits for 16- and 17-year-olds whilst also slashing the educational opportunities they have is the wrong way to reform the welfare state. To have the income test placed upon families with 18- to 20-year-olds come into effect at income levels of $23,350 is the wrong way to reform our welfare state.
The government appears to believe that if you force young people to stay at school longer they will happily and successfully emerge from that process well qualified, happy and successful, and will automatically walk into a job or a career. However in the real world in which I operate, and we on this side operate, you cannot assume that by setting these extremely stringent rules you can successfully interfere in the lives and the relationships of families.
The decisions being taken by the government in relation to literacy and numeracy, for example, set more hurdles and direct more blame at young people because they are not in paid work. I have heard the comments of many educational experts voicing their concern over these initiatives. What are they saying? They are saying, quite simply, `Don't re-create the schoolroom problems that some of these young people actually have already sitting on their shoulders. Don't believe that you can scoop up groups of young people—who do, in some instances, have undeniable literacy and numeracy problems—and put them back into a system and a process from which they unsuccessfully emerged in the past.'
Let us look closely at those individuals that we are talking about. Let us talk about them as individuals, not as groups and statistics. Probably the only effective way that we could even begin to attempt to address those literacy and numeracy problems would be one on one, in a specially contrived fashion by which all of their problems, all of their difficulties, all of their concerns that they have carried through school, are addressed as one.
But I do not really expect that any government is going to be prepared to fund at that level in the climate in which we find ourselves. Whilst it may be very admirable for this government to politically grandstand—and that is what I call it—about the problems of literacy and numeracy, the message going out to the community from the government is that the whole reason these unemployed young people do not have work is that they are illiterate and innumerate and they are not trying. This is yet another set of blame and yet another set of hurdles, with not one effective component in the process to fix any of the problems. It is pure political grandstanding, in a really cheap fashion, in my view, because it is attacking the very victim in our community and offering nothing in the real sense of the word to overcome those very problems.
If people emerge out of an education system with a literacy and numeracy problem, you cannot just blame the education system, although that has to carry some degree of blame. You have to look very carefully at the individual people. You have to ask yourself why it is that the education system suited some and not others. What was it that was wrong for these young people, and what do we need to do to correct it? We should not herd them up and stick them in a room somewhere, take their money off them and say to them at the same time, `We're blaming you. We're going to victimise you and you won't get another thing until you learn'—in almost the same environment which previously they passed through unsuccessfully.
I implore the government and the minister concerned to really think about this. At the same time as the government is affecting the outcomes of youth allowance payments, it is doing this to youth. Frankly, I deplore that attitude. It is not good enough. It is not constructive. It is not helpful. It is cheap political grandstanding.
I understand that the process for assessing literacy and numeracy is going to be left to the agencies commissioned to carry out these classes or these remedial programs. So how you are assessed in Newcastle may be quite different from how you are assessed in Canberra or Perth, or Darwin or anywhere else. I despair at that as well. Where is the true academic thinking behind teaching when you have a different set of rules dependent upon where you may be, not dependent upon needs as an individual?
I quite often despair when I think of some of the decisions and the attitudes, particularly, that are coming forth from this government in a so-called attempt to address some of these extremely serious issues. These young people are our adult citizens of the future, and I believe that we have got to treat them a whole lot differently from the way we are under the current regime.
It is not the fault of our young people that they cannot secure employment. Instead, we as a society collectively have to look very carefully at what we are doing. We are not providing the employment base and the work environment which encourages them to find work. Even the best of training programs—I want to talk about that very briefly—are no good if there is no employer out there to welcome these young people into a job anyway. Hypothetically, you could create very well-qualified youngsters who still had no jobs. To talk of literacy and numeracy is fine, but I know university graduates who are not illiterate or innumerate but who cannot get work. Let us face it: there are two sides to this whole dilemma.
It was very interesting yesterday to be at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research lunch in this place. The emphasis by a very wide range of extremely well-qualified economists was on what we should do about unemployment. I do not remember seeing Work for the Dole on their list. I do remember seeing a very strong mention in their 
 five-point plan of good, successful, recognised, well-funded training programs, all of which have been completely decimated, in every form, by the current government.
The government walked into power after the 1996 election and decided that anything—good, bad or otherwise—that had been done by the previous government was not to their liking, so out it went. Millions of dollars worth of, in some cases, extremely good training programs were kicked out, purely in a political grandstanding fashion, with no consideration whatever of the success of any of it. What is interesting, though, is that some of the lesser funded but still existing programs that are beginning to emerge or to be talked about strangely reflect some of the things that were in fact in those previous programs.
What this government has got to do is be honest, absolutely honest. It is no good blaming the young people. It is no good saying, `Because you are illiterate and innumerate it is your fault.' It is no good removing financial support from them at the same time as you also force them to stay in a school environment, which, I might add, is now being seen in most parts of this country to be completely unprepared for it. The stories that I am now hearing—as, I am sure, many of my colleagues are—are that it is all very well to say to these kids, `Back to school and stay there,' but you have got to make sure the education system in each of those states and territories, in country towns, in regional and rural areas, can cope with that. That is not happening either.
It is a really cheap shot for any government to stand up and say, `We are going to very effectively attempt to fix the unemployment problem for the young people—our heart tells us it is the right thing to do,' while their head, in fact, is leading them down so many wrong paths that it is distressing. I know that from my own electorate when I get a phone call from a young girl who is crying hysterically because Centrelink cannot handle her Austudy application and information inquiry, or from a young man whose family is in unbelievable financial stress. How stupid is it that a 23-year-old man, who has been overseas for 18 months working around the world gaining wonderful experience, has to ring me up on return and say, `Until I can find work, I am dependent on my parents'? That is an actual truth. When he rang me I thought: I do not believe this, he must be making it up—this is ridiculous. But it is the truth. He was a graduate of school, went overseas, worked, came back very much enhanced by his experiences, needed some support while he resettled and tried to find work, and was told he had to be financially dependent upon his parents. This is madness.
All I can say in conclusion is that I really hope that those more sensible members on the other side of the House, particularly all of those on the back bench who we know share many of our concerns, are given every power that they need to debate this strongly and vibrantly within their own party room. Someone has got to tell the ministers running these insane programs that they are wrong.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I will be brief today because I am sure that a great deal of what needs to be said about the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999  and associated legislation has been said, but I think it is important to draw attention to some of the regional variations that occur. Sadly, the story is pretty much the same around the country, but my own experience as the member for Fremantle is one that I would like to put on the record in the context of those changes.
One of the things you can say about this legislation is that the need for amendments so soon after the implementation of the initial bill is indicative of poorly thought out policy and poorly 
 thought out programs. Mind you, I think all members could have referred them a great many more problems than those that they are attempting to solve by this legislation.
At base, of course, the edifice of this legislation is very clearly designed to transfer the burden of unemployment and income support to families, including those on very modest incomes indeed. That is one of the reasons that I parted company with the original legislation very early. In addition to shifting the burden from government to families who could ill afford to support that burden, it represents an attack on the very hard-won independence of young adults.
As the parent of a young man, I feel very deeply about the fact that young people are being told at the age of 21, in the case of youth allowance, and even older if they are seeking to study, that they are somehow dependent on their parents. Every other signal that we send them says that when they leave school, particularly, that is the point at which we expect them to start standing on their own two feet—even earlier in many respects. From the point of view of the criminal justice system, they are adults long before that. From the point of view of many of the charges that are made on them in the community, they are adults long before that.
We accept them as voters at the age of 18. We understand when they leave school that they will have to make their own way in the world, whether through employment or further study. We accept that they can be married even younger than that and bear children, yet this legislation is saying to young people, basically, `We regard you as dependants. We do not see you as having the capacity to stand apart from your parents.' It is a very convenient fiction indeed. Young people do not believe that and nor do their parents. They see it as a sleight of hand.
In many respects it is a double standard. You only have to look at the Prime Minister's own situation. He has a young daughter. She is working in the work force and yet she is able, because of her father's position, to get a special parking place in Sydney where parking places must be at a premium. So there is some special treatment there of the relationship between father and daughter—in this case, to her advantage. What is happening in reverse with other families is that they are being asked to take on an extra burden when they do not have the means to provide for it.
It represents a very considerable addition to what I see as the miserable attacks on the most disadvantaged in our community. Like many, I suppose, I have sat down and asked myself the question: why would this be occurring? Why would any government seek to place a burden on those already burdened; seek to remove support from those already lacking in support? I have racked my brains about that, and I cannot come up with an answer. I cannot imagine a philosophy, especially in Australia, that would allow you to conclude that you solve any of society's problems by shifting that burden. Yet it has happened in area after area. This is one—the tax changes are another—where we have seen support removed.
If I had to really answer the question—and I would find it very difficult—it is probably based on some misguided notion of standing on your own two feet, of getting government off the backs of the people. You hear that phrase very often from people who are quite happy to dip their hands into the government coffers when it is their own privilege that is at stake—what Galbraith calls the `culture of contentment'.
So if the government need to provide a bailout, for instance, as they have done in various states—and, indeed, as has happened in the United States and other places, when financial institutions collapse—that is fine. Terrific. No problems. But, if it is to provide for the welfare 
 of the least well off in the community, that is somehow the government intruding unnecessarily in the lives of citizens. I think that is, unfortunately, the message that is now being put across to a great many in our community. I think it is an appalling shift in the view that Australians have formerly had of government.
Look at some of the changes even in this legislation—which is essentially tidying up the original bill—to reduce, for instance, the rate of the disability support pensions or the amount that those under 21 will be paid. For example, a single pensioner aged 18 to 21 who is not living at home and who has a dependent child will actually lose money under these proposals. This is a further attack on what would have to be described as one of the most disadvantaged subgroups. This is a single pensioner, a young person 18 to 21, not living at home—struggling, in other words, to be independent, and probably for very good reason, apart from the fact that he or she is an adult with a dependent child. A person like this actually goes backwards under this legislation. Seven dollars may not seem like a lot to the architects of this legislation but, let me tell you, to people who have to live on it, on the amounts of money that they have under these regimes, it is an extraordinary situation. Knowing furthermore that there will be further imposts on them with the imposition of a GST really makes my heart bleed.
I see these people; they come through my door. They cannot survive and they are not surviving. The government does not necessarily want to hear the stories but welfare agencies are stretched to the limit. The offices of members of parliament have queues of people a mile long in these circumstances where government support is simply not adequate. And it is not that these people are not pulling their weight. They are doing everything they possibly can.
This legislation and the surrounding bills are generally indicative of the government's approach to income support for the young unemployed and for students. The only way I can describe it is miserly. Essentially, this legislation is punitive in the approach that it takes and, unfortunately, it is being delivered via a very poor service—and I do not blame the staff for that. I will have a bit more to say about that in a moment.
In a sense, this legislation gives us the opportunity to revisit some of the warnings that we made when the initial youth allowance legislation went through. A great many people, including members on our side of the House, welfare groups and youth groups, pointed out to the government that there were likely to be serious problems, as indeed there are. Even so, I must say that even I have been amazed at the volume of complaints that this legislation has generated. What needs to be remembered, I think, is that at the outset it represented a complete loss of income support, or a very substantial reduction, for over 45,000 unemployed young people aged 18 to 21 who were, for the first time, made newly dependent on their families.
Many examples have come to the attention of my electorate office, but I will give just one to indicate exactly how it affected many families. This example is of a young woman of 20 who had worked successfully, more or less continuously, and who had lived successfully independently since about the age of 15. I have no doubt that, like most families, her mother—and I think it was a single mother, from memory—had provided her with a little additional support, as we all do. We do what we can for our young adult children.
This young woman became very seriously ill and was forced to leave her job, so she went back home to live with her mother for six months. That was a matter of necessity; she could not continue to pay her rent; she was not working, so she lived at home. When she recovered and applied for the appropriate support to find employment, she was told that she could not get any; that she was to be dependent on her mother. Her mother was at the very low end of 
 the income scale but, even so, the young woman was assessed as being ineligible. The additional strain on the family was very substantial, and there were other dependent children.
She was amazed that this was the case. A great many people who confront the legislation do not understand what has been done. Most people are fortunate enough not to have to ask for support in this way. When they do ask and they are told that they are not independent, that they are not adults and that they should go back to the parental situation, they feel diminished. This girl, like many in her position, was very upset because it was extremely difficult for her family to support her. Being an energetic young woman she found work reasonably quickly, but for the period during which she could not find work it was extremely difficult. Ultimately she took a job that she did not want. She wanted to get into good employment and to better herself. That was part of her reason for wanting to start again, but she could not; she had to take the nearest thing in order to take the burden off her family.
I think that the important thing to consider here is the tensions caused by these newly created dependencies. In this case, the mother did what she could for the young adult daughter, but it was obviously extremely difficult for her to manage. In other cases, it is clearly not possible for families to accommodate the people who suddenly turn up on their doorsteps. Sometimes the children have left home out of necessity because family tension has been great. They have needed to leave—to become adults, to set themselves up. I think that is something all of us should think seriously about. If a government really wants to solve some of the problems associated with youth suicide and drug addiction, forcing people into what are already unhealthy relationships is not a very good step to solving those problems. These changes have clearly placed even greater burdens on families.
Senator Harradine, I have to say, was right to be incensed that in the tax package no consideration has been given to the needs of these families, as he was promised they would be. There are substantial costs in providing for the needs of a young adult; it is not just a matter of carving up things a little less generously for the rest of the family. There are needs these young people have if they are looking for employment—as they would be—or if they are studying. It is not as though they simply occupy a space in a household. They actually have considerable costs, for example clothing and, one hopes, little things like recreation—being able to go to the movies once in a while. These costs have to be considered.
These additional burdens were supposed to be taken into account, and Senator Harradine understood that he had been given very firm assurances that they would be. But, apart from the general tax cuts they were offered, we now discover that these low income families were not even considered in the tax package. And, I might say, those tax cuts for the lowest income earners are very small indeed and are likely to be eaten up entirely by the increases through a GST. I remind members that half the tax cuts go to the top 20 per cent. This relief is skewed to the other end of the income scale, not the end where you would expect it to be. The remaining 80 per cent get the other half.
I remind members that the depth of the betrayal of Senator Harradine, and of the rest of the community who implicitly were promised the same thing, is considerable. When asked before the Senate committee what steps had been taken in designing the package to account for this group about whom promises have been made, the government official revealed after some fairly strong questioning that he was not even aware that such a promise had been made. No-one had communicated to him the need to take account of this group.
Even though these families are clearly in desperate need of financial relief as a result of this bill, they are not going to be taken care of in the tax package. It is one of the amendments that we are not likely to see despite the promise given. It is not altogether surprising that Senator Harradine has been a little dark on the government. But, in the end, it is not a problem for Senator Harradine. It is a problem for the families who have been denied assistance. That is the point of this. It is not the politics of it and the fact that Senator Harradine has been upset by the government's betrayal, but the fact that there are a whole lot of families out there with newly dependent children they have to provide for who are not being given any special consideration—indeed, no consideration at all. Nor was it considered important enough to even follow through on those matters.
The other problem with the legislation, which became very clear to me as a local member, was the very unrealistic tests made to establish independence. Some of those are improved a little in this legislation and some are possibly compounded because they are enormously complicated. I challenge any member of this parliament to look at some of the forms that people are now required to fill out through Centrelink and to fill them out with 100 per cent accuracy. I think they would find that they failed rather dismally. In addition, some of the material that is required takes an inordinate number of hours to put together due to the number of attachments required. The difficulty in getting evidence required is very considerable in many cases. Remember that you are dealing here with people who are often not the most able members of the community in terms of their literacy and numeracy skills—something the government has recognised in a very punitive way. Nonetheless, it is true that many of the young unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, are people who have considerable problems in dealing with everyday literacy and numeracy demands that are made upon them. That is why as part of any decent labour market program you need to address those problems, but you need to address them in context and in a way that encourages and does not punish.
There are, as I say, very unrealistic tests to establish independence, and people fall foul of them. They make the wrong claims. What happens then? They are called fraudsters; they are said to be rorting the system. They are blamed for the problems that Centrelink has created. I have had many examples of that, and only through the intervention of a member of parliament—in my case through my office—have injustices been able to be reversed.
People have benefits cut off, for example. In one case not strictly related to the youth allowance, a gentleman on a disability pension received a letter from Centrelink saying that, as a result of a reassessment of his position that he had not initiated, he was entitled to an additional amount of money. Obviously, he was grateful for that. The money was paid into his account in due course and he settled into what he regarded as the new regime. About three months later he got another letter saying it was a mistake and he had been overpaid and that they were going to take $50 out of his pension every fortnight to repay it. That was absolutely thoughtless.
I would challenge any minister here or any member of the bureaucracy in Canberra or any employee of Centrelink to try and live on those amounts of money, let alone have $50 a fortnight removed because of a mistake made by Centrelink. I have to say that that happens not once a week and sometimes not even once a day. But these problems are legion. If the government does not recognise that, it should. It is showing a distinct lack of humanity if it does not follow up on these complaints. We write to the minister to register the complaint and we get the usual placatory letters back that tell us nothing and go nowhere.
I have a lot of sympathy for the Centrelink people. There has been a massive increase in their workload. There have been substantial staff cuts and, as a result of restructuring of Centrelink and the old Department of Social Security, there are a lot of people working in jobs whose rules they do not know. The rules are changing all the time but they do not know them. What we are seeing are delays and queues and errors in assessment that I have just talked about.
If you look at just a simple thing like getting through on the phone, the most recent figures show that 81 per cent of callers to Centrelink in 1998 did not get past the engaged signal. I have to say that is confirmed by my experience, and the experience of a great many other people, particularly those who try to do the right thing and use the telephone system rather than turn up and queue.
That is dangerous because if you get through eventually and make a time for an appointment that appointment might be for two or three weeks later. In a recent Austudy case I know of, a young person had done just that and waited patiently to get an appointment. It was well after the beginning of term time before he finally got to the top of the queue whereupon they said to him, `You don't really need to be here. You could have done that in writing.' I had been party to the initial application and it was not made clear to him that that was what was required. As he walked out the door he looked at the form and it said, `You are only paid from the date of application.' By then nearly a month had passed, during which time he had been living on the bones of his backside, not to put too fine a point on it. He did not get any money for that period even though he had been studying for the duration. That is a fairly typical problem created by the difficulty of getting through by phone and by the long queues.
People are having to wait for weeks, in my electorate and in others, to get an appointment for youth allowance and for Austudy, not to mention other benefits. At Centrelink in Fremantle there are currently only four staff working on the youth allowance section—two are working on the applications, one is the manager, and one is the receptionist. Two additional staff were put on briefly to handle the Work for the Dole and mutual obligation schemes.
The result is that people just cannot get service, and the staff themselves are in desperate straits. Those staff are under stress, and I have a great deal of sympathy for them. As a result of waiting too long, being given wrong information, and being messed around, people become abusive. Their tempers are short and sometimes there are violent reactions. I do not condone those but I can understand why they occur.
Centrelink staff sometimes ring my office in tears. Do not worry about the recipients of these benefits ringing us in tears. Centrelink staff do it as well. I get anonymous emails from staff members from right around the state complaining about the way they are being treated as employees by this government. The government should be a model employer. It is not. It fails miserably. These people are being asked to do a job that is impossible to do with the resources they have. The result is a great deal of dissatisfaction and disaffection from people who should regard them with admiration because they do try enormously to do the right thing by their clients—a word I use reluctantly.
The government has made a complete botch of this. This legislation, in a minor way, improves some of the obvious flaws, but the fundamental principles are wrong and they are not likely to be remedied by this tinkering around the edges.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I rise today to speak in opposition to some aspects of the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999  which is before the Main 
 Committee. I say this because I consider that the youth unemployment rate in this nation today, standing at 23.5 per cent, is clearly an astonishing and unacceptable figure.
I am also especially concerned about the fact that after three years the current government has only been able to reduce youth unemployment by 18,500. That says to me that more has to be done to create decent opportunities that will encourage young people to stay longer at school. And, while staying at school, young people should give serious thought to whether they pursue post-secondary education at a university, or, alternatively, take up a TAFE course, especially as there are growing skill shortages at the moment in some of the traditional trades. That is happening at a time when apprenticeship training in the traditional trades is actually going backwards.
I also indicate my opposition to some aspects of this bill because I consider that growing numbers of our young people are stuck in a rut, a rut of unemployment or jobs without real career aspects, because of the failure of some employers to front up to their responsibilities on the training front.
In considering the issue of junior pay rates, I am very firmly of the view that, should the Industrial Relations Commission report recommend that some form of junior rates continue, it is absolutely essential that in that context employers—and I am saying all employers—front up to their responsibility to ensure that training is part and parcel of such a system.
I consider that young people are prepared to make a variety of sacrifices, provided that, in making those sacrifices, there are guarantees, especially as a result of access to decent training opportunities, of a better working life and career opportunity throughout the rest of their life.
I suppose that takes me to the achievements of the Australian Labor Party between 1983 and 1993 when, I am pleased to say, the year 12 school retention rates and the proportion of school leavers who actually went to university doubled. I personally consider that a major achievement of which this nation ought to be proud. In the context of trying to ensure that we went down the path seriously of creating a long-term learning society, over a decade we actually doubled the year 12 school retention rates, which was all about trying to equip people, having achieved the essentials of life from a learning perspective, to build a reasonable and a decent career opportunity in the future. I think that was a wonderful achievement.
My problem is that, since then, clearly cracks have developed in the pathways between school and work. That has really occurred over the last three years, and I think it is about time that this government got the message from the Australian community that our young people deserve better than the government is offering. The number of young people finishing secondary education has fallen since the Howard government was elected. This is related not only to a lack of emphasis on and support for keeping people at school but also to the squeeze on school funding. The squeeze on school funding has made it more difficult for the school system to look after career opportunities for our young people.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.32 a.m. to 11.44 a.m.
—Prior to the suspension, I was referring to the fact that the number of young people finishing secondary education had fallen. What also disturbs me is the fact that the proportion of school leavers going to university has also fallen since the Howard government was elected. I consider this is because of government policies which in 
 essence mean that children from wealthy families can fill places that are now denied to brighter, hardworking children from lower and middle income families.
It is almost as if, under the Howard government policies, if you are thick and rich you can get to university, but if you come from a struggling working-class family you may not. Because of the new policies which are in essence best described as `if you have got the money you can get in', a lot of very bright young people from backgrounds that are not as wealthy are actually being denied an opportunity. That is not just bad for a young person and that young person's family; it is also bad for the nation. It means, in essence, that those with the potential and best capacity for leadership, who can take Australia forward in the 21st century, are being denied that opportunity because of their economic and social circumstances and their personal family background.
I also believe that there are not enough training places for early school leavers due to deep cuts in support for vocational training and incentives to employers to take on new apprentices. On that note I refer in passing to the fact that this government actually withdrew some of the completion payments that apply to group training. One of the most important areas of apprenticeship training at the moment is, in fact, group training. The withdrawal of those completion payments is an absolute disgrace and it is actually going to pull Australia backwards on the skilling and the trade front in years to come.
It is also interesting to note that, since Labor's last full year in government, the number of traditional apprenticeship commencements has plummeted by 5,000. That is going to be worsened potentially by the changes in completion payments with respect to group training. It is absurd that this is happening at the same time as key areas of the economy are also experiencing crucial skill shortages. This is evidenced by a report recently prepared by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that actually identified, state by state and nationally, the fact that in a number of traditional areas of apprenticeship training we have now got major skill shortages in Australia—at a time when we are going backwards on the apprenticeship completion numbers in those traditional areas.
With that in mind, I raise the fact that, as of 1 January this year, the government introduced the so-called youth allowance. The introduction of this government's youth allowance means that many 16- and 17-year-olds who leave school early will no longer get any income support whatsoever. Furthermore, many young unemployed people aged between 18 and 21, and their families, are worse off because of this decision. Because of these decisions, schools will clearly need extra resources to meet the needs of these students. The federal Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—as it was when this bill was originally prepared—put forward a cabinet submission recommending that $140 million be allocated to help schools cope with the extra students returning due to the youth allowance. In January 1998 the Howard government announced some additional funding, but it was $100 million short of the amount recommended in the cabinet submission. I suppose we come to the conclusion that something has gone missing.
What has gone missing is not just the financial commitment, the under-budget allocation. More importantly, there is a failure by the government to actually commit itself to doing something in a proper way for these young people. It is all about savings rather than investment in our young people for the future. I probably do not need to remind the House that this piece of legislation was so badly mishandled by the Howard government that its implementation date was delayed for six months so as not to throw the school year out.
The purpose of the bill, as I understand it, is to tidy up the mess the government created. As such, it will receive support from this side of the House—but qualified support. We understand that the purpose of the bill is not to further reduce entitlements for young people. But, despite the bill's intended purpose, and some of the beneficial measures that the fulfilment of this purpose provide, there are some aspects of it which do further reduce entitlements for young people.
I want to make it absolutely clear that, in light of the appalling situation that the government has created for young people, Labor sees it as its duty to oppose any measures that will further reduce their entitlements. Labor will therefore, firstly, oppose the measure in schedule 3 which proposes that the actual means test can be applied even where the reason for applying it has not existed during the most recent tax year and the family has suffered a substantial decrease in income.
Although it is acknowledged that this proposal reflects the old Austudy regulations, its incorporation into the Social Security Act will open up unfair practices. For example, the parents of a youth allowance applicant might have owned a company until January of 1998 when they sold that interest. Under the proposal, in 1999, even though they are being assessed on their income and expenditure during the 1998-99 tax year, they would be subject to the actual means test on the basis of an interest in the company they had not had for 12 months. I believe that this is quite a strange proposal and extremely unfair. In fact, we are still awaiting advice from the government about the reason for this measure, as it does not seem to make any sense.
Labor will also oppose the rate reductions contained in schedule 4 for disability support pensioners under the age of 21. The rate reductions mean that, for example, a single pensioner between 18 and 21 years of age, who does not live at home and who has a dependent child, will lose $7 per fortnight while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain about $17 per fortnight. It seems to me that this is a perverse result and will clearly result in a reduction of moneys for one of the most vulnerable groups in the community. It is, unfortunately, typical of the current government's approach to the interests of vulnerable Australians.
The schedule also seeks, unfortunately, to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.51 a.m. to 12.04 p.m.
—Furthermore, under the current provisions, the rate of family allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. Amongst other things, a family allowance child can be a child receiving youth allowance. The problem is that the schedule seeks to amend this so that a child receiving youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. But it does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent until they are 21 years of age and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result of the youth allowance legislation. I believe this is clearly a contradictory result and that is why we are opposed to it.
As a third matter, Labor proposes an amendment to the measure in schedule 4, under which the income test threshold for family allowance will not be increased on the basis of a child receiving youth allowance if the child is over 18. Our amendment would seek to provide that a person over the age of 18 would still be regarded as a dependant for the purposes of the 
 family allowance income test, if they are receiving a reduced rate of youth allowance because of the parental means test.
Fourthly, Labor will oppose the measures in schedule 5 that seek to reduce the rates of exceptional circumstances relief payment and restart income support payment for people of youth allowance age. Labor will oppose this as it will clearly result in a reduced entitlement for some people.
To sum up: the bottom line is that there are not enough training places available for those who want them. They continue to be turned away from a TAFE system which is in danger of falling into neglect. The changes embodied in this bill do nothing to assist such young people who are having enough difficulties at the moment with respect to even getting access to decent training courses. In this environment, the Labor Party will oppose any measures which seek to reduce entitlements for young Australians and their families.
Part of our responsibility as a compassionate country is to look after those most at risk of not making a successful transition to economic independence. These young people deserve better than Work for the Dole, but that is what the thrust of this bill is about. It is, in essence, continuing what has become a characteristic of this government—pointing the finger at young people and saying that they are to blame, rather than facing up to the fact that government has to accept its responsibilities and also accept, publicly, that some of its policy decisions have not really contributed to assisting these young people and their families, who are crying out for help at the moment.
For that reason I am firmly of the view that building new pathways from school to work means that we as a community have to help those who have lost their way, in essence to try and get them back on course. I do not consider that by reducing teenagers' income support the Howard government was actually trying to achieve the core objective that the Australian community expects of government—to have reasonable policies that get young people back on course. Instead, this type of legislation is more and more alienating our young people and pushing them into a wilderness of despair, a sense of a lack of hope for the future, rather than trying to develop an environment with government support mechanisms that guide our young people into the future and, basically, get them back on course.
It must therefore be recognised by this government that there will always be some young people that are simply not suited to some type of institutional learning, whether in secondary schools or TAFEs, and it is no use for the government to say to them, `We are going punish you for not being able to fit the institutional or the intellectual mould that this government believes all young people ought to fit into.'
Unfortunately, that is not the way young people develop in this day and age. They are facing many pressures, many problems, and we have to try and develop a flexible system that accounts for those young people's needs—not a doctrinaire approach based on, `If you do not do it this way, then you are out on your own and we're not going to offer any helping hand, or income support, even if you're in fairly difficult personal circumstances because of your family background, where you grew up, where you went to school, or the suburb or the region that you lived in.' That is not the way we are going to solve the problems of these young people.
As the other side of the coin, however, we have got to come to terms with the fact that some of these people are homeless and from very difficult family circumstances. Their problems need to be attended to, not only in a very compassionate way but also earlier, if we are not 
 to inherit a much worse state of unemployment and social alienation in the future. That is what we are close to ending up with at the moment.
That is contributed to by the fact that this government, in its first 36 months, has not only reduced our capacity to get people into decent apprenticeship and training opportunities but has now sought to punish them when it comes to income support. It has worsened the situation by abolishing decent job programs for young people. It has ended the youth training initiative which formerly provided case management for some of those 15- to 17-year-olds and it has disbanded SkillShare in favour of the new, hopelessly chaotic employment services market. All of that is not helping.
I note recent reports about the fact that, when it comes to intensive assistance, some of those Job Network providers are spending nothing on training for young people. If it is good enough for the government to say to these young people, `You're not getting youth allowance'—a sense of discipline and compulsion—then it should also be good enough for this government to say to those Job Network providers, `You are getting very substantial amounts of government funds for intensive assistance. There is an obligation on you publicly to account for how you spend that money and to explain to the Australian taxpayer why, more often than not—and this includes companies such as Drake International—you are not spending on offering training opportunities to our young people.' For that reason, I argue that the government has created a disastrous situation for young people trying to cross the bridge between school and work.
I must stress that, in the light of this disastrous situation, the opposition will in principle support the bill but, because of what we believe, we will also front up to the government on its potential weaknesses. For that reason, we strongly oppose some of the measures that I have outlined in my contribution to the debate today. In essence, if you want to get young people back on course, it is the responsibility of the government to offer better than what is offered in the bill before the House today.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—We have had a number of contributions from people on this side of the House in this debate about the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 . This morning I have been privileged to hear the members for Fremantle and Batman. As the member for Batman pointed out, we are concerned particularly about schedules 3, 4 and 5 of this legislation. I want to briefly address the issues involved with schedules 3 and 4 in particular, because they have the potential to impact, I think adversely, upon many in the community and particularly on people in my own electorate of the Northern Territory.
I refer firstly to schedule 3 of the bill which repeals the Social Security (Family Actual Means Test) Regulations 1998 and replaces them with similar provisions in the Social Security Act. Currently, the actual means test is provided for by the actual means test regulations, which are derived from the Austudy regulations. Schedule 3 of this bill proposes to incorporate the actual means test into the provisions of the Social Security Act itself. Although the proposed new provisions are structured differently from those in the disallowable instrument, they are of a similar effect. There are, however, some differences. Those were spoken about—and I will not go into them—by the member for Batman in relation to their unfairness, particularly on the basis of an interest in a company that a person had not had for 12 months even though they were been assessed on their income and expenditure in the 1998-99 tax year.
I want to concentrate in particular on the negative impacts of schedule 4 of the amendments to the act to address issues identified during the implementation of youth allowance and 
 Austudy payment. Firstly, the schedule proposes to reduce the rate paid to some disability support pensioners under the age of 21—this, too, was referred to by the member for Batman—and to increase the rate for others. The effect of the changes varies depending on the pensioner's circumstances. For example, a single pensioner aged between 18 and 21 who does not live at home and who has a dependent child will lose $7 per fortnight while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain over $17 a fortnight. I do not think you have to be Einstein to work out that that is a regressive move and that, in fact, you are penalising people for being single and supporting pensioners.
The other two areas of this schedule I want to address relate, firstly, to the guardian allowance of $37 per fortnight which can be paid to single parents in certain circumstances. The schedule seeks to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate. This, of course, is also unfair.
The other element of schedule 4 that I am concerned about is that, under the current provisions, the rate of family allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. Among other things, a family allowance child can be a child receiving youth allowance. The schedule seeks to amend this so that a child receiving youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. This may, of course, be consistent with the treatment of young people receiving education allowance other than the youth allowance, but it does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent until they are 21 years old and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result of the youth allowance legislation. This, of course, is not only discriminatory but also unfair.
The way in which we are treating young people under this and other pieces of legislation being passed by this government and being put to the parliament by this government is indeed regressive and does penalise young people, particularly those who live in regional and remote Australia. I say that because one of the interesting exercises which I have been able to witness over the last 12 to 18 months has been this question of independence and the fact that students need to identify their independent status by earning income for 30 hours a week in a two-year period.
If you live in a place like Alice Springs, which I do, or Katherine or Gove or any of the regional communities in Central or Northern Australia—indeed, anywhere in Australia—and you leave school and are required to go away to university, then immediately you are penalised. I have personal experience of a young person who comes from a family which, whilst not well off, would certainly have been well above the means tests. This person wanted to go to university, had sufficient marks to go to university and was bright enough to get admitted into a number of universities. But he could not undertake the course in Central Australia and was required to move interstate to Sydney. Because of the circumstances of his parents and because he did not have sufficient income, nor did they, to pay for his full-time attendance at a university with residential requirements, he was forced to wait 18 months until he had saved the appropriate amount of money to indicate to the government that he was, in fact, independent.
I do not think that is either fair or reasonable, and it is a position which pertains to a lot of individuals around Australia. I do not believe that the government have properly thought through the implications of these proposals for people who live outside major metropolitan 
 areas. That is something which they need to revisit and which is clearly unfair and grossly inappropriate.
The member for Batman spoke about the adequacy of training provision in terms of what is happening to young Australians. I have also had first-hand experience of watching what happens in the bush. The service made available by agencies such as Centrelink to young Australians who work and live in remote Australia is entirely below standard. If you happen to live in a remote community, then the likelihood of getting any service at all out of Centrelink is all but nil. If you require, for example, to visit some Centrelink offices for an appointment and you happen to live hundreds of kilometres away from your local Centrelink office, the possibility of getting an appointment will certainly be up in the air because in some places you will not get an appointment for up to a week. But even if you do get an appointment, it will take you possibly a day to get an appointment to make an appointment. That, of course, is unreasonable.
There is nothing within the framework put in place by the government which accounts for the locational disadvantage that people who live in rural and remote areas suffer in the delivery of government services, quite apart from the appropriateness of the level of service in terms of income support or otherwise. I say to the government that this is something which you are being marked down for right throughout Australia. Not only does it happen in this area; it happens basically in all areas of service provision.
It seems to me that, whilst you parade yourselves as a champion of people in the bush, you are failing miserably when it comes to the provision of these sorts of services. In the context of this piece of legislation, you should be examining the particular impacts on people who suffer locational disadvantage because they do not live in a major metropolitan area. It is something which I know is hurting a lot of people.
The member for Batman spoke about educational attainment levels. If you happen to live in a remote part of the Northern Territory, the likelihood of your getting to a high school is very remote. The likelihood of your achieving a successful outcome at a high school is even more remote because a significant proportion of those people who live in remote areas in the Northern Territory away from even smaller towns like Alice Springs and Katherine are Aboriginal people who do not have access to sufficient standards of educational service.
I say to the government: if you are fair dinkum about providing services for young Australians, you will address this need. I do not believe it has been addressed. It is something which I have been critical of since I came back into the parliament last year and it needs to be addressed as a matter of some urgency. The way in which you have dismantled the service provision, the training provision, the labour market programs in regional Australia and the provisions that were made available under the old Commonwealth Employment Service, you have effectively withdrawn the services which provided people with the capacity to get access to mainstream services and replaced them with something which gives them access to nothing. This legislation only reinforces the negative view which many Australians have of the way in which Centrelink operates and the way in which the government is providing services to people who live in the bush.
I am conscious of the time. I will complete my statement by saying that, whilst there are some aspects of this legislation which will obviously be of benefit in terms of the workability of the act because they are simply housekeeping measures, it can also be said that the general message within this legislation is that not enough care is being taken to make sure that the 
 services and the standard of support which are available are sufficient to meet the needs of individual Australians who live in regional and remote areas.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1999-03-31,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989—the act. The act enables Australia to fulfil its international obligations as a party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer—the Montreal protocol—to eliminate its consumption of ozone depleting substances. The act controls the import, export and manufacture of a range of ozone depleting substances, known as `scheduled substances', by requiring licences for these activities, and by prohibiting the import and manufacture of certain products containing ozone depleting substances.
The act is a key element in Australia's approach to ozone protection. It is administered and enforced in conjunction with complementary state and territory legislation and controls, and industry and non-government organisation activities, including voluntary codes of practice. This highly cooperative approach to environmental protection is detailed in the 1994 revised strategy for ozone protection and was endorsed by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council in 1995.
The innovative licensing and quota systems, first enacted in 1989, enabled Australia to achieve by 1995 a phase-out of the ozone depleting substances CFCs—chlorofluorocarbons—carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs—hydrobromofluorocarbons. The phase-out has been total other than for a restricted range of essential uses. A total phase-out of halons, except for essential uses, was reached in 1992, one year in advance of Montreal protocol requirements. Australia's foresight in adopting such control measures was most recently borne out in the 1997 Montreal amendment which now requires parties to develop and implement a licensing system to regulate the import and export of ozone depleting substances. These outstanding efforts were formally recognised in 1997 through the award of a certificate of appreciation to the Australian government by the United Nations Environment Program, in a ceremony which marked the 10th anniversary of the Montreal protocol.
The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 represents the most recent step in Australia's response to the challenge of ozone depletion. It proposes amendments to improve the operation of the act's licensing and quota systems, and to allow more effective and targeted regulation of ozone depleting substances. The amendments reflect agreed solutions to issues encountered by industry, government and community stakeholders in progressing Australia's phase-out of ozone depleting substances.
The decision to implement these solutions through legislation was taken through ongoing dialogue with industry and consultation with the Office of Regulation Review to make the initiatives business effective. This is reflected in the conclusions of the regulation impact 
 statements. As a party to the Montreal protocol and its amendments, Australia must phase-out consumption and production of HCFCs by 2020 and methyl bromide by 2005.
The act provides that the import, export or manufacture of either HCFCs or methyl bromide is prohibited unless otherwise authorised under a `controlled substances' licence. The bill clarifies that, in assessing an application for a `controlled substances' licence, separate consideration may be given to each activity in which an applicant seeks to engage. Given the proximity of the scheduled phase-out dates for HCFCs and methyl bromide, and that neither substance is currently manufactured in Australia, this proposed amendment will ensure manufacturing is not commenced in Australia by `controlled substances' licensees without due consideration.
Australia's HCFC industry activity triggered the quota system under the act for the first time in 1997. The act limits the total quantity of HCFCs that may be imported or manufactured by licensees to approximately half the `country cap' allocated by the Montreal protocol, whereby the quota system is triggered.
The HCFC quota system will commence from 1 January 1999. From this date, HCFC `controlled substances' licensees must seek a quota allocation to engage in the regulated HCFC activity of importation or manufacture. The quotas will be allocated for a period of two years. After the first quota allocation, quotas will be based on the licensee's individual activity in the penultimate calendar year before the start of the following quota period.
The amendment enables the continued issuance of a `controlled substances licence' for a two-year period, and further specifies as a condition of the licence the quantity of HCFCs a licensee may import or manufacture within any given year of a quota period. This will ensure Australia's HCFC controls remain equitable and efficient by avoiding possible distortion in the calculation of future quota allocations, for example, if a disproportionate amount of a total quota allocation is imported in the first year of a quota period.
It is with the strong and active support of the fluorocarbon industry that this bill addresses this issue. During the development of the bill, the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department identified an area of duplication in the act, arising from its historical development which reflects Australia's changing international obligations.
The ratification by Australia of the Montreal amendment to the Montreal protocol which the parties adopted at their ninth meeting in 1997 to ban trade in methyl bromide with non-protocol countries, means the substance is now more effectively covered by the existing provisions in subsections 18(2) and (3), rather than in sections 42 and 43, which are to be repealed by the bill.
Subsections 18(2) and 18(3) provide that it is a condition of a licence granted under the act that scheduled substances, which include methyl bromide, are not to be imported to, or exported from, a non-protocol country. Breach of the licence condition without reasonable excuse is an offence with a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units, currently $55,000. The bill also updates the Montreal protocol text in the act with the addition of the most recent text following schedule 3.
The last two amendments will finetune the administration of the act. One allows ministerial delegation of the power to request further information in relation to a licence application. This will shorten the time for licence applications to be assessed and issued.
Another clarifies the scope of the exemption from the prohibition on manufacturing or importing CFC-dependent refrigeration and airconditioning equipment. The amendment specifies that the exemption only applies to the import of the CFC-dependent refrigerated transport containers not their manufacture.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1999-03-31,"—While Australia does not manufacture CFC-dependent refrigerated transport containers, the global shipping industry still relies to some extent on the existing fleet of these containers and so Australia will continue to permit their movement in and out of Australian ports.
While Australia only contributes about one per cent to the total global consumption of ozone depleting substances, it represents a positive role model for the international community through its active participation in international ozone fora, bilateral activities with developing countries and domestic implementation of accelerated phase-out measures developed through a highly cooperative partnership with industry, the community and all levels of government.
This bill will ensure that Australia not only continues to meet its international obligations under the Montreal protocol but demonstrates its ongoing commitment to the recovery of the ozone layer through innovative and effective cooperation with industry. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",REPS,<title>OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—As the Bills Digest  points out, the ozone in the stratosphere, known as the ozone layer, appears to have been declining since about 1960. But ozone loss has become much more rapid since about 1978. The reduction is greatest above the polar regions, especially Antarctica. The decline is not constant, being greatest at the beginning of spring, as the sun first appears after the long, dark Antarctic winter. Although the result is called a `hole', it is rather a fall in concentration of stratospheric ozone gas.
Naturally occurring substances and emissions such as sulfates and chlorine given off during volcanic eruptions are responsible in part for ozone destruction. However, it is human made gases, principally chlorofluorocarbons and halons, following eventual escape into the stratosphere, which are particularly destructive of the ozone layer. These CFCs contain chlorine and the halons contain bromine. Chlorine and bromine attack ozone and break it down. A catalytic process is involved leading to one chlorine atom being responsible for the destruction of up to 100,000 ozone molecules.
There has been concern about the depletion of the ozone layer on a proper basis. That is because the ozone layer reduces the amount of harmful ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth's surface. The ozone layer is also an important part of the global climate system in which all life forms, including humans, have evolved. Any significant change to this layer can have far-reaching consequences for human health.
So ozone destruction is an important issue to all Australians and indeed we are one of the countries most severely affected by the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. The direct human impacts include increased skin cancer and cataracts, and Australia already has the highest skin cancer rate in the world. There is also some evidence of ecological impacts, including phytoplankton in Antarctica, which in turn impacts on our southern fisheries.
Ozone depletion is also a global issue, and we have global responsibilities. This includes the Montreal protocol, which aims to phase out the consumption of a number of substances which have been implicated in the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. By way of 
 background to the international legal framework concerning depletion of the ozone layer, we have had the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer providing an international legal framework to address concerns regarding the adverse impact of certain substances on the ozone layer.
The convention was agreed to back in March 1985 and was ratified by 165 countries including Australia. The Montreal protocol, finalised in September 1987 and ratified by Australia in 1989, established a mandatory timetable for the phase-out of ozone depleting substances.
To meet Australia's obligations under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal protocol, the Labor government passed the Ozone Protection Act in 1989, which was significantly amended by the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995. That legislation prohibits the import, export or manufacture of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs from 1 January 1996 without an essential uses licence or a used substances licence. It established a system of controlled substances licences and reporting requirements for the import-export or manufacture of HCFCs and methyl bromide. It introduced two-yearly administrative fees for licences, with the fees set under the ozone protection regulations, and it established an Ozone Protection Trust Fund to allow revenue from the licensing schemes to be directed towards the cost of its administration and industry awareness programs for the phase-out of HCFCs and methyl bromide.
As a result of these efforts, Australia achieved a total phase-out of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs in 1995. Halons were phased out in 1992, a year ahead of the Montreal protocol requirements. We froze consumption of HCFCs from 1 January 1996 to 1989 levels and the consumption of methyl bromide from 1 January 1995 to 1991 levels. These efforts were formally recognised in 1997 through the award of a certificate of appreciation to the Australian government by the United Nations Environment Program in a ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the Montreal protocol. So we can see that the Labor government has a proud record in this area, and that the former Labor government played an active role in developing and implementing a strategy for ozone protection in Australia during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. This was done in active cooperation with state and territory governments, as well as with industry.
A long-term, bipartisan approach is required to address this problem. The Labor Party is supporting the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]  because it makes a number of necessary amendments to ensure that Australia is able to undertake its international obligations under the Montreal protocol. We are supporting this amendment bill but would like to raise a number of issues in relation to the approach this government has taken on the ozone issue, and I will come to those shortly.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection Act by ensuring that separate authorisation needs to be provided for manufacturing, importing and exporting activities when issuing a controlled substances licence, by allowing conditions to be attached to a licence relating to the import, export or manufacture of the HCFCs, by upgrading and updating the schedules of the act in accordance with international developments, and by narrowing the exemption for refrigerated transport containers which contain controlled substances so that only their import and not their manufacture is permitted in Australia.
On HCFCs, we are ahead of our targets. In the area of methyl bromide and halons, we believe that there is some room for improvement. Turning to methyl bromide, although the Montreal protocol requires a phase-out of methyl bromide by the year 2005, the date to which Australia has agreed, European countries have agreed to phase out the use of methyl bromide by the year 2001. Australia was previously viewed by the international community as being a leader in addressing the issue of methyl bromide. We are now regarded as falling behind due to this government's lack of commitment, and I think we need to make efforts here in Australia to match the European target of phase-out by the year 2001.
Environment Australia has been responsible for developing the phase-out strategy for methyl bromide. It is now the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—Australia to implement the phase-out, and we would question the government's commitment to implementation and, for example, ask: has the government allocated adequate resources to this department to implement the national methyl bromide response strategy?
Another issue with methyl bromide is that the controls apply only to soil disinfestation uses. There are no controls on quarantine and preshipment uses. Therefore, the method of accounting for this chemical is very important. For example, there has been an increase in the reported quantities used in quarantine and preshipment uses. We need some indication from the government as to what steps are being taken to ensure that the increase in reported use for quarantine and preshipment uses does not increase to the extent that real environmental gains are lost.
I turn now to halons. Australia led the world in the phase-out in the early 1990s. States and territories legislated for the removal of halons and the Commonwealth provided a supportive role. These halons have been collected in a halon bank. Other countries have not been as advanced in their halon phase-out and there is now a large black market in halons internationally.
The Australian Defence Force has led the world in its commendable program to phase out halon use. By contrast, the US Department of Defense is now actively shopping for halon supplies throughout the world, to cover for its lack of action and continuing unnecessary overdependence on halon. Much of the currently banked halon material was provided by industry on the clear understanding that the banked material, above the relatively small amounts required for continuing essential use, would be destroyed.
We share the concerns, raised by industries that have borne the cost of phasing out halon, that the halon they have removed on environmental protection grounds and banked in good faith for destruction will be sold off to less environmentally concerned bidders. We are looking for a commitment from this government that the halon bank will not be sold off. It would be an utter travesty if the superior environmental concern and performance shown by Australian firms and government instrumentalities were to be undone by a pitch for dubious export income.
In conclusion, we support the  Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] . We note that it represents the bare minimum in terms of a government response to the ozone issue. From being regarded in the early 1990s as a world leader and honest broker in the management of ozone depleting substances, we have gone now to being regarded internationally as one of the least progressive developed countries. We can ill afford to be dragging the chain on an issue which has such a direct impact on Australians because we are some of the first to suffer as the hole in the ozone layer grows.",REPS,<title>OZONE PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-03-31,"—The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]  will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989. As my colleague the member for Wills has previously advised, the bill seeks to ensure that separate authorisation be provided for manufacturing, importing and exporting activities when a controlled substance licence is being issued. The bill will allow conditions to be attached to a licence relating to the import, export or manufacture of hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The bill also provides for the schedules in the act to be updated in accordance with international developments and, in addition, the bill includes provisions to narrow the exemption for refrigerated transport containers which contain controlled substances, so that their import and not their manufacture is permitted in Australia.
Contrary to what the member for Wills was saying, this bill actually continues to maintain Australia's leading position in the international effort against ozone depletion. I will not be as disingenuous as he, but I will compliment the former Labor government on the work that it did, and suggest that this a further enhancement of that work and something that Australia can indeed be very proud of.
The international legal framework within which Australia is operating is provided by the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Vienna convention was signed in 1985 and has been ratified by 165 countries, including our own. The Montreal protocol, finalised in September 1987 and ratified by Australia in May 1989, established a mandatory timetable for the phase-out of ozone depleting substances.
The Montreal protocol dealt with the phase-out of five chlorofluorocarbons and halons. When it was signed, it was expected that a range of CFC substitutes would be available. The dominant substitute, however, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, whilst causing much less damage to the ozone layer than CFCs, is still ozone depleting in its nature. Thus, in 1990 and 1992, the London and Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol introduced a phase-out of HCFCs and methyl bromide by 2005 and 2020 respectively.
By the time all developed countries are required to cease bulk consumption of these substances, we will be pleased to see even further progress against these amendments to the Montreal protocol. In order to meet Australia's obligations under the protocol, the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995 was established to control substance licensing systems which prohibit the import, export and manufacture of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and hydrobromochlorofluorocarbons from 1 January 1996, without an essential use or used substance licence.
The 1995 act established a system of controlled substances licences and reporting requirements for the import, export or manufacture of HCFCs and methyl bromide. This bill makes further changes to the licensing legislation to ensure that importing, exporting and manufacturing activities are treated individually in their licence applications. Previously, a licence issued under these provisions did provide scope for the licence recipient to migrate from the area of need that they originally applied for into these other areas of activity.
The good news is that Australia has been successful in meeting and exceeding its obligations under the Montreal protocol to date. We achieved a total phase-out of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and hydrobromofluorocarbons in 1995 and halons in 1992, a year ahead of the requirements. Australia has frozen consumption of HCFCs at 1989 levels and the consumption of methyl bromide at 1991 levels.
Under the current licensing situation, the ozone protection section of Environment Australia—and a number of the officers are here today—are charged with administering the controlled substance licences. Environment Australia inform me that licences under the act are issued for a two-year period, currently 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999. Eighteen licences have been issued for this period, 14 for controlled substances, 11 of which are for HCFCs and three for methyl bromide. Three essential use licences have been issued—two for the import of CFCs for the manufacture of metered dose inhalers for asthma treatment and one for the import of small quantities of CFC-13, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for essential laboratory use. One used substances licence was granted for the import of a limited quantity of halon and CFCs for destruction.
The changes outlined in the bill will give the federal government greater control over the import and export of ozone depleting substances in the lead-up to their phase-out; and, because there are currently no manufacturers of HCFCs or methyl bromide in Australia at present, the government will be able to ensure that no future manufacture takes place without due consideration. The transport container import and export exemption is being retained in recognition of the fact that there are many containers in use around the world that will find their way to Australia and then be exported again. The government is changing the exemption to ensure that no transport containers using ozone depleting substances are manufactured in Australia.
Australia has taken a leading role in meeting and exceeding its obligations under the Montreal protocol. In 1997 the Australian government received a certificate of appreciation from the United Nations Environment Program as formal recognition of its efforts in this area. Of course, we have good reason to support initiatives that will help reduce ozone depletion. Ozone depletion is widely recognised as having a highly detrimental effect on our ecosystems. There is considerable evidence that skin cancers are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which the ozone layer can protect us from.
Australia has one of the world's highest incidences of skin cancer and the rates are rising. According to the Australian Cancer Society, the lifetime risk for a white Australian to develop a non-melanocytic skin cancer, is one in 1.5, and one in 50 for a melanoma. ABS statistics show that skin cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality in people aged 25 to 40. Between 1950 and 1994, the mortality rate due to malignant melanoma had slowed in men and fallen in women. This drop has been attributed to earlier detection and treatment during the 1980s. Deaths from non-melanocytic skin cancer, which have been dropping over most of the period from 1950 to 1985, began to show an increase again. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria reports that, over a 10-year period from about 1985, the incidence of non-malignant melanocytic skin cancer increased more than 25 per cent. Skin cancer has long dominated cancer incidence in Australia, where it outnumbers all other forms of cancer by at least two to one.
Australia, New Zealand and Scotland are leading the world in melanoma cases per 100,000 head of population. North America and Europe also have high melanoma rates which are increasing between three per cent and seven per cent a year. As much as Australia likes to be a leader, this is one statistic where, I am sure, we would prefer not to be ahead of the pack. The fact that Australia has such a high incidence of skin cancer is alarming. That we also know that damaging the ozone layer makes the situation even worse, gives us motivation to act.
In the November 1996 issue of the journal Nature, a study was published which looked at projected skin cancer incidence under three scenarios. Those scenarios were: no restrictions on ozone depleting substances; reduced production of five ozone depleting chemicals by 50 per cent by 1999 under the Montreal protocol; or the elimination of production of 21 ozone depleting chemicals by 1996 under the Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol. The study assumed full global compliance with the restrictions and no change in human behaviour with regard to sun exposure. The researchers estimated that under each of these three scenarios the news was not all that flash. Under the first scenario, without restrictions, skin cancer incidence would quadruple by the year 2100. Under the second scenario provided for by the Montreal protocol, skin cancer would double by the year 2100. Even under the Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol, skin cancer incidence would increase by 10 per cent in the next 60 years. So any way you cut it, we have some real challenges ahead, only if considering the wellbeing of the human species, not to mention the broader impact on our ecosystems.
Certainly there have been changes in Australian behaviour in the past three years. When members are visiting the magnificent foreshore in the Dunkley electorate, they are all encouraged to wear their shirts, hats and sunscreen. The jury is still out on the rate of skin cancer in 60 to 100 years time. Our research does illustrate that a huge difference can be made to the rate of skin cancer by ensuring that we meet all of our obligations under the Montreal protocol and its subsequent amendments.
The irony of the situation is that while most of the ozone depleting substances are released in the Northern Hemisphere, the ozone hole, as it is so-called, appears over the Antarctic and a large part of the Southern Hemisphere. This is truly a global problem. The ozone hole is not actually a hole but a drastic thinning in the ozone layer which is caused by a build-up of ozone depleting gases in the cold Antarctic vortex over the southern winter. The Antarctic vortex is a phenomenon that traps a large mass of air over the South Pole, which becomes starved of ozone and is then released as the air warms up in spring. Unfortunately for us in Australia, the hole then expands north leaving most of our country exposed to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation between September and December before dissipating.
The ozone hole is not the only section of the ozone layer that is thinning. There has been a general five per cent to 10 per cent drop in ozone levels throughout the layer over the past decade. The surface area of the ozone hole over the Antarctic now covers an area approximately three times the size of Australia, or 26 million square kilometres according to the most recent report from the world meteorological organisation. Last September the hole was reported as being the deepest ever recorded for this time of year. This compared with an average of 20 million square kilometres in the last few years and exceeds the previous record for this time of year of 22 million square kilometres in September 1994.
The changes we make now will not immediately solve the problem. Ozone depleting chemicals take two to five years to move into the stratosphere so it is already too late to stop the loss of ozone that will occur in the next five years. The replacement of ozone depleting substances is a considerable area of challenge for us. An important part of the CFC and HCFC phase-out equation is to find replacements for these products. The replacements include HCFCs and, while they break down more quickly and pose less of a threat to the ozone layer, they are still ozone depleting substances.
Another replacement is HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons. While they do not contain chlorine, and are therefore ozone safe, there is a large question mark over them because of issues of flammability and toxicity. Hydrocarbons are also viewed as an alternative. They are cheap and readily reliable, but they can be flammable and poisonous and they increase ground level pollution.
Ammonia is viewed as a simple alternative for CFCs for refrigerators, but needs to be handled very carefully. I am not sure how many of us would like to indulge in too much ammonia bathing. Water or steam is also being advocated as an alternative for some of the cleaning applications of CFCs.
CFCs are all around us. They are in airconditioners, refrigerators, foam insulation, cleaning fluids, industrial solvents, aerosol sprays, dehumidifiers and freezers. HCFCs are also in airconditioners and heat pumps. They are a very real presence in our community. An Australian company based in Melbourne, Esanty Refrigerants, has developed a CFC replacement product called ER12. My colleague the member for Deakin has been a long-time strong supporter of their efforts to see it more widely introduced into the domestic and international market. ER12 is a hydrocarbon which can be used as a drop-in replacement for CFCs, and particularly R12 or freon—the CFCs used in car airconditioners up until about the mid-1990s. The debate about the best solution for CFCs and HCFCs is one for another day.
Ozone depletion is a global environmental concern that can be abated by good policy and decisive action. I acknowledge the good work of a former Labor government in this area and would suggest that the  Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]  is about good policy and decisive action. Today we need to pass this bill to ensure that Australia's record on ozone protection remains a strong one.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Excuse the pun, but this government is very liberal in its use of the term `region' and liberal in its frequent use of the term of late. Indeed, judging by the number of times coalition members have uttered the term lately, one could be excused for thinking they had just discovered regional Australia. The truth of the matter, however, is that this government is guilty of ignoring the plight of regions and it has done so at its own political peril.
Regional Australia has responded through the ballot box and is desperate to have its voice heard. Now the Liberal coalition is feeling the backlash of regional discontent. I thought regional New South Wales made that patently clear last weekend. Yet I believe this government is still struggling to come to terms with what it is really like to live in a region. Consistent with its continuing struggle to come to grips with regional issues is its constant definition of regional Australia as `the bush'. This government has a clear misconception of regional Australia. Its concept of `the bush' appears to be simply geographic, that it is stuck out in the middle of nowhere or is the back of beyond. Many regions like my own are not, yet we could be millions of miles away as far as this government is concerned.
Before I am accused of suffering from regional cringe, let me highlight comments made only this week by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston. He described the major breakdown of telecommunication services at Queenstown on Tasmania's rugged and remote west coast last weekend as a `blip'.
The Queenstown Hospital, the major medical and emergency centre for the entire west coast of Tasmania, was without standard telephone services for almost 30 hours or perhaps 29 hours. The minister for communications described it as a `blip'. As far as this government is concerned, when something like that happens in the region it is a `blip'. If it happened in a metropolitan area, would it be `blip'? Not on your nelly. The headlines would read `a disaster'. That is what I mean about this government's disregard for regional Australia.
Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you and I live in regions that have suffered because of a lack of coherent government policy. Telecommunications is just one area where regional areas like Tasmania, and my electorate of Braddon in particular, feel they are being let down. Take the alarming news of the dramatic fall in Telstra services to Tasmania as reported by the Australian Communications Authority. The provision of new services to major rural areas in Tasmania is in serious decline, falling well behind national standards. Many rural and remote areas are still in a telecommunications vacuum. They do not have services that most people simply take for granted, and now they are being asked to have faith in the government's headlong push to sell more of Telstra.
Telstra is being sold off under the pretence of providing better services to regional areas, but where are they? A third of Telstra has been sold off yet King Island remains a telecommunications backwater. Television services in the far north-west and the west coast of Tasmania are lacking or are non-existent, and mobile phone black spots are too numerous to mention. These are services, facilities and choices that metropolitan areas take for granted, so imagine the hoo-ha if these services were `blipped'. I do not think Senator Alston would be as dismissive of this as he was of the Tasmanian incident. If this government wants to get serious about improving regional telecommunications then it should channel some of the money from Telstra's massive dividends to the government into improving regional telecommunications infrastructure. A start would be to initiate a telecommunications audit in Tasmania. The result would not surprise Tasmanians but it would be an eye-opener for some members opposite, assuming they were interested.
But it is not just telecommunications. The issues and challenges in my electorate are as many and varied as they are in regional areas spread across Australia. If I look at health I see Tasmania's health system in crisis. This is not just the result of the former Liberal government's mismanagement of the area but also the result of this government's failure to fund and support the public health system.
I see a lack of opportunity and resources for people to go on to higher education. I see a worsening in unemployment as a damning indictment of this government's treatment of regional Australia. Indeed, my electorate has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia, but is there a coherent strategic plan to tackle this? I see a meagre, inadequate and offensively titled Work for the Dole scheme. I see a lack of industry policy to help boost regional economic growth, and I see a GST as a threat to the underprivileged, the less well off in the community, and the general consumer.
