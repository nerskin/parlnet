"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Further to the comments I made yesterday on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1999, I will now turn to two of the significant issues raised during the debate on the bill. The first is the setting aside of financial agreements. The member for Barton proposed that the grounds for setting aside a financial agreement should be widened to allow a court to set aside an agreement which is harsh, unfair or oppressive. This proposal would, in fact, fundamentally undermine the government's objective of having binding and certain financial agreements. Our policy in allowing people to make binding financial agreements is to provide, to the greatest extent possible, certainty in the way couples settle their personal financial affairs. The objective is to keep people out of court wherever possible. For this reason we have carefully constructed the grounds for setting aside financial agreements to limit the ability of a court to interfere with a couple's genuine agreement. Of course, we recognise that there will be situations, as set out in proposed section 90K, where an agreement will have to be set aside. 
The government accepted the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's recommendations for amendments to that section to expand the grounds. In particular, the government will be moving amendments to make it clear that non-disclosure of a material matter in the making of an agreement may be a ground to set aside the agreement. The government has also recognised the concerns about potential hardship to children and the parents they reside with by amending paragraph 90K(1)(d) to allow a court to set aside an agreement where there is a material change in circumstances relating to the care of children. By moving these amendments the government has responded to legitimate concerns and has carefully considered the overall scheme for setting aside. This was not done in a piecemeal fashion.
 The proposal of the member for Barton would, however, go too far. It would remove any certainty in financial agreements by allowing a court to set aside any agreement simply on an application and not much else. It would mean that parties would be reluctant to enter into a financial agreement because any certainty they sought would not be realised. This is an example of the problems of making policy on the run. The member for Barton has found a provision in the New South Wales Contracts Review Act and seeks to put it in an inappropriate context without appreciating any of the broader implications of this change to the bill. For these reasons the government does not accept the proposal of the member for Barton.
The second subject is the resources of the Family Court. Several members suggested that the government had cut the Family Court's budget and that this had resulted in reductions in voluntary counselling services to regional Australia. The reduction in the Family Court's resources reflects funds transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service along with savings from the abolition of wholesale sales tax. Contrary to the claims of the member for Barton, the transfer of funds to the Magistrates Service does not represent, as he said, an unnecessary duplication of resources. Rather it reflects a transfer of judicial work from the Family Court to the Magistrates Service which will be able to perform that work more quickly and efficiently than the Family Court. The parliament has made the Family Court a self-administering agency so that decisions about the management of the court's administrative and financial affairs are solely the responsibility of that court. How the Family Court chooses to reduce its spending, therefore, is a matter for the court. No direction has been given or indeed could be given by the government on how the court should achieve efficiencies. 
One aspect of the comments of the member for Barton, however, require a response. He suggested that the cuts to voluntary counselling in the Family Court will impact most severely in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia. In fact, the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Justice Alastair Nicholson, has repeatedly made it clear that the court will do everything within its power to maintain services in these areas. Any reductions in services will be made first in metropolitan areas where there is a much more developed network of community service providers that people can turn to for counselling, mediation and other dispute resolution services. I am encouraged by the Chief Justice's determination to maintain services in disadvantaged areas. I welcome the broad support this bill has achieved in debate in this House. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time. ",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The opposition essentially supports the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000 and welcomes a number of positive contributions to the veteran community that are entailed in the legislation. These run the gamut from extending counselling and psychological assessment to the spouses, ex-spouses and children of veterans, and the widening of the veterans' children education service to those offspring of children who are deemed to be in need, to an alteration of the income test treatment of Abstudy resulting from changes made to that payment. Most importantly, it deals with a number of anomalies that have persisted in our benefit scheme in the veterans area, for many decades in some cases. We welcome these benefits, particularly in regard to the Vietnam veterans' situation. We welcome benefits such as the availability of free psychiatric assessment to veterans' partners, access to counselling services for ex-partners, which would be allowed for a further four years after the end of the relationship—obviously in many cases these relationships floundered because of the problems of the veteran and his experience in Vietnam—and an increase from 25 years to 35 years in the age limit of veterans' children on free access to counselling and psychiatric assessment.
However, in regard to the broader issue of recognising these anomalies, the government's activity is none too early. On 3 June 1998, I commented in the House on the then minister responsible for veterans' affairs, who left an enormous difficulty for the current minister due to her performance in the portfolio. She indicated on many occasions that these things that are being rectified now were essentially closed doors and were not going to be altered or rectified. I said:
Eight months later, we are told that it is a minor priority in the government, that they have not really allocated many resources to it and that it might eventually, one day in the future, have an outcome. 
I was referring to the question of the FESR and Ubon. On 25 September 1997 in relation to the then minister's performance, I said:
It is disturbing to note that the review lacked any community representatives or public consultation. Its report has not been released to the public and its reasoning and the evidence that it relied upon have not been revealed. 
In this legislation we tackle a number of the issues that persisted and were the subject of lobbying and very real activities by a wide variety of people. In regard to the FESR, there was an anomaly justified by concepts such as allotment, et cetera; it was really an excuse for a budgetary decision. I want to put on the record the efforts by John Carroll, Bob Gibbs, Admiral Mike Hudson, Noel Payne, Keith Brown-John, Joe Charlton, Bill Paterson, Keith Davidson, Ken Staff and Leo O'Donnell. The reality is, in a variety of these veterans' affairs issues, if it is a small group, it is very difficult to mobilise the wider community, even the wider RSL and veterans' community. If you are talking about pensions for everyone or an increase, this type of thing, there is a wider level of interest and broader support because it supports so many people. In this case, this group of people around Australia have had to drive this issue home, despite persistent refusals by governments of both stripes over many decades to rectify the situation. Here at last we do see some rectification of the matter in regard to the FESR where Air Force and Army personnel received benefits far earlier and a very arbitrary distinction was made, a delineation that really had no logic whatsoever. The government's decision is very welcome. 
With respect to the Ubon, the situation was that it was subject to a Senate resolution at the time. The Senate disagreed with the lack of interest in this question by the then minister in actually rectifying the problem. This was justified because of the figment that the Ubon situation was in no way related to the war in Indochina. However, the situation was that, in June 1965, the rules of engagement were altered for those Air Force personnel and it was said that those new rules of engagement certainly changed the picture. We as an opposition recognise that until that point there was some logic to the government's argument about it basically being support for Thailand and its situation. However, on that date there was a very real change of circumstances. There was extensive evidence of very real danger to the personnel involved and it was really justified by the lack of truthfulness to the Australian public by the government with respect to the situation of Australian forces in Indochina.
We welcome the situation with respect to Ubon. We record that the then minister failed to deal adequately with this matter. He delayed it and showed disdain and disinterest. I want to recognise Mal Barnes, Richard Stone and Michael Morrissey in particular for their perseverance in driving the issue home and making sure that the political system in this country gave recognition to a just case. I also indicate that the 1998 election statement of the opposition at that stage did say that these two matters which the government is now tackling should have been tackled then. There is a concrete history of activity by the federal opposition in trying to give justice to these people. I also want to talk about Jeparit and put on the record Doreen Smith and Harold Harrison, two residents of Newcastle, New South Wales, who, to my mind, have been the main people who have kept pushing this issue before the parliamentary system. This resulted from a situation where the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamens Union, because of their position with respect to the war in Vietnam, decided not to service a number of boats. The civilian personnel were basically discriminated against vis-à-vis people who were serving in the reserves on those boats. There is no real logic to the fact that they have been disregarded all this time and once again they faced very real and concrete danger.
There is one matter, which I foreshadowed, on which the opposition is not satisfied with the bill. As I say, the government have been dragged screaming to rectify these matters and people are getting justice at last. The one matter where we will be indicating in the Senate dissatisfaction with the provisions of this bill relates to the question of the Australian civilian surgical teams in Vietnam between 1964 and 1973. I cite a document which they have produced. To our mind it certainly indicates that the experience they had there is such that the government should not rely on technicalities and avoid giving them their just rewards and recognition for their service. For instance, on page 4 of their document, they state:
Tuberculosis, infestation with intestinal parasites, leprosy and malaria, had always been major causes of morbidity in Vietnam, but now with the overcrowding and the squalid conditions, plague, of which an outbreak began in 1961, had spread to 24 of the 41 provinces of South Vietnam by 1967.
I note further in that document the comments of Dr Bernard Dunn at appendix F, where he says:
The Minister's replies make much of the fact that these women were civilian and not military personnel and were not subject to military direction. As far as I know no Australian Army women nurses were used in a combat area in a military sense during the Vietnam war. The civilian nurses were often located far from any protected military encampments with minimal protection and at times, as during the Tet offensive, were exposed to very real danger. 
The documentation they have produced, with some very moving photographs showing the carnage of the war in regard to the civilian population of Vietnam, appear to be a very substantive argument. On page 15, they indicate the three main points in their submission, which are:
1. The work of these teams assisted the Australian Defence Forces in wartime.
2. The teams assisted and served with an allied country.
3. The teams `incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy during the time of hostilities.'
I could go on and quote at length the various experiences of these people. On page 31, they state:
There was a rocket attack and a whole lot of houses across the road from us got bombed. One of the guys and I went across to see if there were any survivors, went (into this house) and there was a woman lying in the bed, she had one child across here (indicating the chest) and a baby in her arms, they were black you know, like third degree charcoal. It took me a while to get over that. I sort of kept having flashbacks and for a while after I'd wake up in a sweat.
The inquiry that justifies this legislation, the group of people who went around and examined these issues in their review of service entitlement anomalies in respect of South-East Asian service from 1955 to 1975, came to the conclusion that these people had a case. It is quite surprising to the opposition that the minister has deliberately decided, whilst generally following the conclusion of the inquiry, that these people do not have an entitlement. On page 14 of that report it states:
It is recommended that Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical Teams operating in Vietnam during the Vietnam War be deemed as performing qualifying service for repatriation benefits.
So the inquiry—the justification for the rest of the changes in this particular legislation and the rest of the alterations to overcome anomalies—that was set up by the minister said that these people had a just case. One really does have to question exactly why that was not the decision. I notice in the budget facts, the minister's document says:
Repatriation benefits will not be extended to members of the Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical Teams in Vietnam. The policy on repatriation benefits for civilians has consistently required they be attached to the Australian Defence Force, for example in the case of merchant mariners. These civilians worked under arrangements made by the then Department of External Affairs and the review provided little or no evidence that they served under ADF command.
Quite frankly, I think most people in the general Australian population would say that that is not a good enough reason not to recognise the very real dangers and the very disturbing situation that these individuals faced in Vietnam, and that matter will be subject to an amendment attempt by the opposition in the Senate.
In conclusion, there is a wide variety of other anomalies that have been recognised. I also understand that there have been a variety of Labor and Liberal governments that previously did not overcome these problems, but I must say that, in the period when there was renewed interest, activity and lobbying on these matters, before Minister Scott's arrival in the portfolio, there was a very studied delay in the government's rectification of these matters. As I said earlier, the then minister reacted to Senate resolutions and she reacted to lobby groups by saying that the doors were closed, the matter was finalised, it was over, end of story, full stop. I want to reiterate my appreciation of the efforts of a small band of people on these issues. They have actually accomplished very overdue and necessary reforms for a group of people in whom the media probably took only sporadic interest; only occasionally did the vast majority of MPs have this matter brought to their attention. The changes are for the better and overdue.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000. All members in this place, and perhaps most Australians, when they stop to think about it, would perhaps realise we do have the very best system as far as repatriation goes and would appreciate some of the effort expended on behalf of all Australians and veterans who have served this country. As somebody from a generation who has benefited directly from those who have put on a uniform and been prepared to stand their ground in other countries in defence of this nation and in defence of the values that we represent—our freedom, our democracy and our human rights record—I am always greatly humbled to be in the presence of those who have served. 
I must say that I agree with much of what the member for Reid had to say and there are so many anomalies within the Veterans' Entitlement Act that continue to be a great source of frustration to me as a private member in this place. I certainly welcome the measures contained within the two bills before the House this morning which extend certain veterans' entitlements to those who have not had them before, and also guarantee that certain others who may need benefits because of the tragedy of the Black Hawk accident are in fact going to gain them for the children of those who were killed.
I also want to use my contribution in this place as someone, as I said, who has benefited directly from that great sacrifice and service that Australians have put forward over many years in this century to bring forward some of the most glaring anomalies that I have seen come across my desk over the last couple of years. I agree with the member for Reid that there are some handfuls of people who run the cause very loud and very strong and a lot of them are very pleased that this government has responded to them. The Far Eastern Strategic Reserve veterans and so forth have positive examples of this government listening, and reacting, to legitimate claims. The extension of the gold card to World War II service personnel—those who served overseas—is another example of this government's commitment to extending benefits to those who have served. They all come at a cost. Sadly, a lot of them are costs that are met only once the pool of people to receive the benefits shrinks because the survivors have died, which creates a great sense of frustration for those who fight for the rights that so many are now enjoying but a lot of whom never live long enough to see them.
I do not really want to be overly partisan, but I will make the observation that 13 years of the previous government did not achieve the sorts of results for veterans that this government already has managed to achieve in the last 4½ years. But I genuinely believe that there is so much more that could be done, despite the fact that we do have the most generous veterans' system in the world. I also believe that the Black Hawk families may not have received the sorts of benefits they are getting assured so quickly in legislation if it had not been for the determined effort of people like the member for Herbert, who I know is also going to speak on this bill and who took a direct and personal local member style interest in the matter. I think the tremendous media focus on that horrendous accident has brought about a lot of good things for those who have suffered so many bad things.
There are too many examples of non-wartime deaths and accidents having been dealt with in the most cavalier way by the Department of Defence. I cannot help but feel a great distaste about the inconsistencies in the treatment of the survivors of the dreadful accidents and incidents that have occurred. I believe the Department of Defence have a lot to answer for. I welcome the fact that a senior and experienced minister such as John Moore, the member for Ryan, is in charge of the Department of Defence. Most Australians should understand that Minister Moore is taking on the Department of Defence to get them to do not only what this government promised would be done but also those things that are part and parcel of what the people of Australia expect. I welcome Minister Moore's ongoing efforts to try to get the Department of Defence to follow an agenda set not by them and the bureaucrats over in Russell Offices but by the duly elected government of this country.
I have looked back through stories of incidents and accidents that have come across my desk over the last couple of years. A young man up in Tin Can Bay was killed when a hand grenade blew up. His family were treated in a cavalier way and were virtually ignored by the system. Jacinta Watson was a cadet who was killed as a result of a training accident at the Greenbank Rifle Range just outside of my electorate. Her family were unable to get the full range of information they expected from an inquiry. As I said in the parliament about 3½ years ago, that family wrote to the Chief of the General Staff, John Sanderson, and it took four months to even get a response. General Sanderson basically wished them well and said goodbye. There was absolutely no support offered to that family. Jacinta's mother, Genia Otuszewski, from Coopers Plains in my electorate, still carries the burden of the death of her daughter in September 1994. It is dreadful in the extreme that the Department of Defence seem to close ranks and drag out the inquiry for three years until some statute of limitations runs out and then they say, `We're sorry; we've run out of time to get the kind of justice and support that you deserve.' 
It is ironic in the extreme that the government has to legislate in a specific way to get around departmental ideology that leaves those who have been the victims of accidents and incidents high and dry. Clare Stokes, another cadet, was killed in a truck accident in North Queensland while involved in a cadet operation. Her aunt is a constituent of mine. I have written to Minister Scott about this matter on so many occasions. The member for Bowman, a former veterans' affairs minister, has raised this matter in this place as well. The Stokes family are constituents of his. The department has treated her family with cavalier disregard and a lack of compassion. It is a matter of great shame that the family of somebody who was willing to put on a uniform as a cadet and to display their commitment and pride in their country—and be involved in that marvellous organisation—should be so badly treated.
I think about the victims of the Westralia. Contrast what is before the parliament today for the Black Hawk survivors and the victims' families and what happened to Mathew Liddell, a constituent of mine who was a serviceman on the Westralia and who was airlifted off straight after that tragedy. He had to face the prospect that his mate Bradley Meek had been killed beside him. He cannot erase the memory of Bradley Meek's skin coming off onto him when he was trying to revive him, not realising that he was already dead. He has a recurring dream: the skin is all over him and he sees Bradley's staring eyes. This is a human being who is crying from his heart every day. He has recently had some trouble with the law. He is a young man whose life has essentially been ruined. His mother, Dulcie, firmly believes her son will never realise his potential. The military compensation scheme has made a $23,000 interim payout but Mathew has had to spend $6,000 on legal fees to get it. It is outrageous in the extreme to think that a serviceperson in this country who was the victim of a non-wartime accident like the Westralia tragedy—something that made national news, as did the Black Hawk disaster—should have to spend roughly a quarter of the compensation given to him by the military compensation scheme on legal fees to try to get some more justice and support. Where is the support for his family? Where is the post-traumatic stress support? It does not exist. They are fighting the defence bureaucracy to get some justice for this young man.
This man has been granted a 20 per cent disability pension. He cannot hold a job down. Why do the military compensation scheme and the Department of Defence treat this young man and his family in such a poor way? He cannot hope at this stage to erase the memory of the horror of what happened to him and his mate Bradley that day on the Westralia without some support. We owe that chap and others like him that sort of support. We owe the Stokes family that sort of support. We owe the Hitchcock family, who are from my electorate and whose son was on that same truck that killed Claire Stokes, some support and understanding of what occurred, but all we get from the Department of Defence is constant drag-it-out-and-delay-it tactics. For what benefit? I think most Australians would be horrified to know that these sorts of things occurred.
The Liddell family from my electorate are no strangers to Defence life. Mrs Liddell's husband had 20 years service with the Royal Australian Navy. Her oldest son had six years service in the Royal Australian Navy and currently serves as a fire officer in the Queensland Fire Brigade. The Liddells have two sons-in-law in the Army—one served 21 years and was discharged as staff sergeant, and one is currently serving as a warrant officer 2nd class. He went to Timor last year and has 18 years of service. This is a service family. A representative of that family, despite the fact that he has this long service tradition in his family, is being slapped down and discarded on the side of the road of life by the Department of Defence. 
 I welcome what is in this legislation today. I welcome the government's attempts to assist the families of the Black Hawk tragedy to try to repatriate some of the benefits that should have gone to them years ago but that we now can perhaps finally afford. But I am gravely concerned about the approach of the Department of Defence and their total disregard for those who may have been victims of accidents and incidents in non-wartime. If those people are being treated so badly, you cannot help but understand why so many who have served this country in years past feel so let down by the system that takes so long to respond to the genuine needs and genuine calls for assistance. 
I do not think there would be one taxpayer who would hesitate in the slightest to say, `This is a fair dinkum claim; let's just get on with this.' Why isn't the system saying to Mathew Liddell, `Mate, your family has a tradition of service in the defence of this country. Generations have put on uniforms, and you have been the victim of a horrible accident. We understand that things like post-traumatic stress syndrome exist.' Back in the early part of this century they did not understand it when my great-grandfather, Charlie McKinnon, was blown up on the Western Front after serving his country for six months. He came back an absolute basket case and his life was ruined. They did not understand it back in those days. They called it `trench fever' and all sorts of wacky names like that. 
—And some of them were shot for it.
—And some of them were shot for it. The member for Cowan knows all too well what I am talking about. But the astonishing part about it is that today we do know what post-traumatic stress syndrome is all about. Why aren't we fair dinkum and why aren't we getting on with it?
An issue related to all this—as I mentioned, a couple of cadets have been hurt—is the extraordinary circumstance where the Department of Defence do not want to know about cadets. The Department of Defence do not want to know about the cadet service in Australia. They are holding out an absolute line that they do not want to recognise cadets. This government, when it was elected in 1996, had an excellent policy promising to extend the cadet system and has fought a battle for 4½ years against the Department of Defence over providing services to cadets. 
We now have the extraordinary circumstance where the parliamentary secretary, Senator Abetz, who is doing an excellent job in taking on the Department of Defence bureaucracy, wants to get the cadets recognised as a line item in the budget each year—a move that I totally support, because it is getting around the Defence bureaucracy. But I have had RSL clubs come to me who have represented a very strong view, and a view that I totally support, that the support of the Department of Defence for cadets is parlous in the extreme. I am told, for instance, that cadets get whatever is left over, that the quartermasters at various little Defence bases around Brisbane will dole them out whatever they might not need themselves. Quartermasters, being quartermasters, never seem to really find things that they do not need themselves, I suspect. So therein lies part of the problem. 
The air cadets who meet at Macgregor High School cannot even get proper uniforms, or the stripes or badges that go on the uniforms—so they do not get a sense of service and involvement with the defence forces—and the RAAF Base at Amberley will not let them have even a box trailer, let alone the troop carrier. They used to have a troop carrier to drive them around when they went on camps and so forth. The cadets who meet at Nyanda High School get no support out of the Department of Defence when a neighbour complains that they make a bit of noise as they parade each night on the tarmac of the school property, at the beginning and the end of their cadet activities. The Department of Defence does not do anything to support them in the fight against the Queensland Education Department, who have told them to leave, but the Department of Defence tears strips off one of the officers involved in the cadet unit for daring to break the chain of command by talking to his local federal member about the problem. There is something seriously wrong in the Department of Defence. That is a very simple point. 
I welcome the submission that has come from those associated with the Clare Stokes tragedy. Clare's family—including her aunt, Julie Goeldner, from my electorate—have put in a submission to the `Cadets: the future' review, which Senator Abetz has called. It sets out a number of things that need to be talked about: that there need to be rights and responsibilities set out, that the Australian cadet units need to be recognised as part of the Australian Defence Force, that the Australian cadets need to be allocated sufficient funds directly from the budget each year, and that the Department of Defence need to actually take some responsibility for the care, nurture and safety of cadets. They need to take some responsibility.
Whilst the Department of Defence has presided over a magnificent set of service circumstances in East Timor—and I really think it is the sharp end that should feel pleased about that; the troops on the ground, not the people running around with the big gold badges over in Russell Offices, where I reckon just about everybody, even the office boy, has to be a major—I do not think it can rest on the laurels of East Timor and ignore these sorts of issues that I have raised in my contribution today. 
The Department of Defence has to take responsibility for those who have offered themselves as cadets. So many cadets go on to become service personnel. If there is one true thing about the cadet system it is that those who actually stick with it, survive it, and go on to serve, stay in the service and tend to become very good service personnel. But the Department of Defence does not seem to be interested in cadets, and it should be made to be. 
The Department of Defence does not seem to be all that interested in really looking after any of the victims of tragedy. That the Veterans' Entitlements Act is being changed by this Minister for Veterans' Affairs to look after more people and to make sure that those who wish we did not need this assistance are being assisted by the measures contained in these bills before the House today is a good thing, but there is so much more to be done and so much of it is so contemporary. Heaven help those who are trying to fight something from the Vietnam days if we cannot even get something that happened in the last five or 10 years right.
I support this legislation. I commend Minister Scott for his ongoing commitment to try to drive this agenda the right way. I strongly support Minister Moore in his ongoing fight against the Department of Defence—they are my words, not his. I applaud Parliamentary Secretary Abetz in his efforts on behalf of cadets. I lament that so many of the constituents in my own electorate—and as you know there are 148 of us in this House—have had so many problems in getting reasonable justice as a result of the failure of the Department of Defence. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I, like my colleagues, support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000. I think there are some positives in it—some positives that people have waited a very long time for—and I compliment the government and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on those positives.
The previous speaker said that, in his view, we have the best system of repatriation in the world. I think that was roughly what he said—just to paraphrase him. I agree: we do have a very good system. But, when we talk about the best system, we should remember that the people whom the Department of Veterans' Affairs was set up to serve also gave their best—some of them, of course, gave their all. So the system ought to be the best. As I said, there are some positives in this legislation, but in many respects the legislation does not go far enough. I think that is a bit of a reflection on the government and on our system as a whole. The previous speaker also spoke about the need for the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to do more, to look after people better. I agree, but, ultimately, it is not the responsibility of the Department of Defence to do things when it is not resourced to do them. It is the responsibility of the government of the day and the minister of the day. You cannot sheet that home to anyone else. Ministers must take responsibility in a way that they do not seem to want to these days. 
The previous speaker also had a bit of a crack at the Labor Party for not doing enough during its 13 years in government. To a large degree, I would accept that criticism, but it is also important to point out that, for about 22 years of the past 40 years, we have had the Liberal Party in government, and for many of those years there was an immense amount of need that just went begging. Whatever we are putting into place now is being put in place very late and, in many respects, much of it is just too little too late. 
In talking about this legislation, I want to pick up on some of the gaps because I do not want members of parliament thinking that this legislation is addressing all the problems—it is falling short in many areas. One of those areas relates to Queensland. I have had a whole swag of letters from people living in regional Queensland who have written to me about the cessation of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service country outreach program. I want to draw this to the attention of the parliament because this is an excellent service and I cannot understand why it is being defunded. I want to read a letter from Len and Karen Fox from Black Mountain in Queensland, and it is similar to the many letters I have received on this issue. They say:
It is proposed that this service will cease in December 2000. The program has enabled many thousands of veterans in non-metropolitan areas to be seen by `Volunteer Area Representatives', primarily ex-service themselves, to be assessed, and then guided through the process of seeking assistance from the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service (VVCS). This valuable service further supports not only the veteran, but his or her spouse and children who also may suffer as a result of the veteran's war service related conditions.
This valuable service commenced in 1990 here on the Sunshine Coast and since then many thousands of veterans and their families, myself included, have benefited greatly from work carried out by our local representative. Without the dedicated work of—
I do not want to name him—
veterans and their families would not have been made aware of the entitlements that their service to our country now makes them eligible for. This work is far from finished with the children of Vietnam veterans in particular but not forgetting, The Gulf War, Somalia, Rwanda, Cambodia and East Timor veterans now in ever increasing need of assistance and guidance. You would also no doubt be aware of the hugely greater incidence of youth suicide and spina bifida cases amongst these Australian children.
Accordingly, we strongly urge you to look further into this matter and support in any and every way possible the retention of this outstanding service to our veteran community. Whilst this service is currently run under the title of `Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service', this is somewhat of a misnomer in that these services are offered and received by all veterans alike, irrespective of the service.
I really want to draw this letter to the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs because I just cannot believe, like these people who are writing to me, that this service is being defunded, wound up. There are a couple of points I would like to make in relation to this service. One point is the tremendous amount of work that veterans do for other veterans in a voluntary capacity. Many of them, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as you would well know—because I know you take a strong interest in these matters—are themselves TPI pensioners and many of them put in an immense amount of time, work and effort looking after their fellow veterans. I think this sort of service ought to be supported and encouraged, not defunded. 
The other issue I want to raise relates to the children of veterans. I want to draw to the attention of the House the plight of, in this instance, a veteran family where the father is a TPI pensioner and his child has suffered a physical disability directly related to the service of the father. This bill in part deals with extending services to the children of veterans. I want to quote from an article in the Courier Mail of Friday 18 August under the heading `TPI veteran in battle for wheelchair': 
An Agent Orange victim and Vietnam War hero whose son was born with spina bifida is now fighting another battle—with bureaucracy, for a motorised wheelchair.
Clarrie Upton of Townsville said yesterday the Federal Government had already acknowledged that his son Darcy's disability was a direct result of his own exposure to deadly chemicals during his six-month tour of duty in 1967.
But when he and his wife, Lona, applied five weeks ago to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for $5000 to buy Darcy, 31, a motorised wheelchair they were refused.
“We were told he could have five psychiatric assessments, but no wheelchair,” said Clarrie.
Darcy is lying in bed in Townsville General Hospital after an 11-month wait for surgery. He has already endured a lifetime of operations relating to his disability, including regular trips to a Brisbane hospital for shunts to relieve fluid on his brain.
Clarrie said he and Lona were physically and financially unable to move Darcy about in his worn-out old wheelchair.
“I'm 62 and a TPI (totally and permanently incapacitated) pensioner myself ... we just can't do it,” he said.
A Warrant Officer who earned a Bronze Star for his courage in ... training forces in Vietnam, Clarrie said he had been sprayed not just with Agent Orange but with a mixture of chemicals during the war.
“But nobody told us. I didn't find out anything about it until 20 years later when I read Jean Williams's first book (Cry In the Wilderness—Guinea Pigs of Vietnam).”
Clarrie's tour of duty ended when he was evacuated with a heart virus in late 1967. Darcy was born in February 1969.
Mrs Williams said the Government had earmarked $700,000 in its May Budget for the children of Vietnam veterans who had been affected by spina bifida, cleft palate and suicidal conditions.
“This man (Darcy) is 31 and he's never walked, but they won't give him $5000 of this money for a motorised wheelchair because they say the money's only for hospital fees and psychiatric assessments,” she said.
Minister for Veterans' Affairs Bruce Scott was not available for comment yesterday.
As I said at the start of my speech, this legislation in my view does not go far enough. What is the point of five psychiatric visits for the child of a veteran in this situation when there is no ongoing service provided for him? What is the point of five psychiatric visits when this child of a Vietnam veteran's greatest need—not just for himself but for his parents—is an electric wheelchair? Why doesn't the department buy him one? Why does this man have to go out and fight for something for his child when he has spent the best part of his post-Vietnam years fighting for something for himself? 
I am not sure that many people in this place will agree with me, but I have a very strong view that if the physical problem that a child suffers can be directly traced to the war service of his or her father then the Veterans Entitlements Act ought to be extended to fully cover the child of a veteran in that circumstance. I hope one day we might see that happen. If these children are suffering, and particularly when we have a health study that validates their condition and validates the situation and shows that the condition is as a direct result of their father's service, then that Veterans' Entitlements Act ought to be, as I have said, extended to cover that child.
The story I have just read said that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott, was unavailable for comment. I must say that this minister has done some good things, but I think there is a heck of a lot that remains to be done. One of the problems that the veteran community has with this minister is that he is very remote, that he is very difficult to get in contact with, and that often he does not respond to much of the mail that is sent to him. I have experienced this myself in this place. Since I have been here I have put a number of questions on the Notice Paper and in many of those instances I have been forced to wait in excess of three months for an answer. I think that is outrageous when we have a minister with an immense resource—an office full of staff—and he cannot respond within a reasonable amount of time, particularly when we are dealing with issues that are not of a political nature but that go to the wellbeing of some of our veterans. Three months ago in this House I raised the situation of a Vietnam veteran who died in Perth, a fellow by the name of Ken Freeman. I read a letter to the House. I know the minister is aware of it because he was sitting at the table when I read it. Three months ago I put these questions to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on the Notice Paper: 
(1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent death of an SAS Vietnam veteran two days after being admitted to the Hollywood Clinic in Western Australia, and the difficult circumstances confronted by the veteran when being admitted to the Clinic.
(2) Was the veteran initially refused admittance to the clinic pending proof that he was a veteran.
(3) Was access to the clinic only achieved after intervention by the veteran's voluntary advocate.
(4) Will he initiate an immediate inquiry into admittance procedures for veterans at this and similar clinics; if not, why not.
I think that is a pretty reasonable issue to raise. I believe I raised it in a very reasonable manner. I did not endeavour to politicise the issue; I simply wanted some answers—not just for myself but for and on behalf of veterans, and not just in Western Australia but right around Australia. Three months have elapsed and I have not had an answer. I have no idea whether the minister has addressed this issue, whether these procedures which were lacking in Western Australia—and I assume in other parts of Australia—have been addressed. Surely, given all the resources this minister has, he could have cared enough to answer me and other veterans who have concerns about these procedures.
 In talking about that issue, I want to pay a compliment to the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Perth—they are generally a good department. There was a delay in trying to ascertain the cause of death of this veteran and there was a fairly long wait for the coroner's findings but as soon as the department did get those findings they acted very quickly to make sure that Mr Freeman's widow was granted a widow's pension. Her advocate, Rick Giblett, who is one of those TPI pensioners who puts an immense amount of work back into the veteran community, tells me he is very happy and very pleased with the way the department has responded to this widow's needs. I wish I could say the same thing about the minister in this instance. 
I want to touch on the issue of TPI pensioners. There is, unfortunately, a very strong blue going on within the TPI community within Australia. I say `unfortunately' because it appears to me that nationally the TPI association has lost sight of the needs of many younger TPI pensioners to the extent that a number of younger TPI pensioners have come together and launched a campaign to have the rate of the TPI pension improved. I can understand that and I support many, but not all, of the things that they want. 
Some of these veterans do not have a service pension; they survive on a TPI pension. Many of them have young children. Many of these pensioners simply cannot provide the sort of lifestyle and quality of life that they want to provide for their kids simply because the TPI pension is not sufficient to live on. In trying to bring this situation to the attention of the hierarchy of their association and of the government they have found that they have had to raise a pretty loud voice to get their attention. It is unfortunate when you see a split in an association like the TPI association, an association which over the years has done much in support of its members across Australia. There is a very strong wake-up call to the hierarchy of the TPI association. That wake-up call sends a very loud message to the hierarchy and to the government. It says that many TPI veterans, many of the members of that association, are not being properly looked after. Their issues are not being properly put forward in Canberra. I suspect that either that rift will be healed or the TPI association will suffer damage from which it will not recover. 
So I congratulate Blue Ryan from Perth and others who, like him, have put in an immense amount of time and given much of themselves in an endeavour to win something for those many TPI pensioners who need greater support. I know that many TPI pensioners are not financially strapped and many of them, because of other incomes, are doing okay, but that is not true about all of them. The association ought to wake up to this and start advocating properly on behalf of veterans all over Australia.  
In conclusion, I want to say how much I appreciate some of the work that the cadets in this nation are doing. I spent some time with the Girrawheen Senior High School cadet unit a couple of weekends ago. They had their parents with them out in the bush. They were given very strong support by the reserve unit in Perth. I compliment the 11-28 Battalion for the great support they are giving to the cadets there. I also compliment the parents who were involved with this unit for the great work they are doing. Those parents learned a lot when they went out bush with their children, male and female. There are some positives in this legislation, but there is still a heck of a long way to go. We ought to get behind it and get on with it. I support the legislation. ",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—On the evening of 12 March 1996 I was at my home in Townsville. My family and friends were there. We were celebrating my son's 21st birthday. We were not prepared for what was to happen later that evening. At about 7 o'clock in the evening a report came through on the local radio station that there had been a serious accident at the Army's high range training area to the north-west of Townsville involving Black Hawks from 5 Aviation Regiment. Within half an hour I was at the Townsville General Hospital with Brigadier Mike Smith, the then commander of the 3rd Brigade. The awful reality of what happened that evening began to become clear. I called the Prime Minister to let him know what was what. Overnight the Minister for Defence and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence arranged to come to Townsville. Early the next morning I met the two ministers and we went to 5 Aviation. I will never forget the ashen looks on the faces of the members of 5 Aviation Regiment when it became painfully clear that 18 soldiers had lost their lives in that accident.
The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000, which we are debating today, in part helps relieve some of the tragedy of that accident and underlines the government's determination to assist in these awful circumstances. Amendments being made to this legislation will assist Australian Defence Force members who have been severely injured as a result of their service and the families of members who have been killed as a result of their service. The incident that I referred to is covered by the amendments to the bill. These amendments will ensure that any additional payments for the severe injury or the death made by a determination under the Defence Act 1903 will not affect any compensation payments that may be payable under the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986. These additional payments are part of an assistance package that this government introduced after an inquiry into military compensation arrangements undertaken in 1997, in the aftermath of the Black Hawk accident. I know that the then Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop, moved heaven and earth to make sure that the right thing was done for those families who lost a loved one and for those who were severely injured in that incident.
I, like the member for Cowan, also believe that there is a lot more to be done in the area of assisting our veterans. I would like to take this opportunity to articulate some of that, because last week I was privileged to have a meeting with representatives of the veteran community in Townsville and to listen to their concerns. It was a very good and productive meeting. The first point they made was the need for a PTSD clinic in the north. Currently, any veteran who suffers this awful affliction has to travel to Brisbane for treatment. They are away from their families for a long time and they are in a state of stress caused by this affliction. It is entirely unsatisfactory that this should happen. The result is that a number of people just do not go. 
The veterans put the proposition to me that, instead of sending people suffering from PTSD to Brisbane, there should be an opportunity to have a clinic in Townsville—which would pay for itself because there would not be the living away from home and travel allowances and so on. They could stay at the Vietnam veterans house. It would be a good result if we could do that in the local area in North Queensland. It could be done through the Mater or the Park Haven hospitals. I think the veterans made a good point in that regard. 
Something that is worrying me—which I do not think you will be aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley; I am more likely to be aware of it because of the defence component in my electorate—is that we are finding that there are cases of PTSD now coming out of Timor. We have only been in Timor for 12 months. The local vets tell me that of the 41 current cases of PTSD they have on their books seven are Timor veterans, who are still serving members of the ADF, incidentally. The government not only needs to take that into account but it also needs to be very responsive. 
The other matter related to Timor which will impact on veterans ultimately is that soldiers are coming back from Timor with viruses that are not yet known. Because these viruses have not been identified, they cannot get compensation. The local vets indicated to me that they believe the people at James Cook University could help in the identification of these viruses. If that can proceed and be funded then the veterans will be able to make proper claims. At the moment the reality is that if you do not have the name of the virus you cannot claim for it. I think that they have made a valid point in that regard.
Funding is also needed for emergency accommodation for veterans. We have a very good property in Townsville called Zachs Place. Unfortunately, professional help is needed to run the place. It is not satisfactory to do it on a volunteer basis. It needs the employment of a professional house manager, some dollars to cover transportation, and between $40,000 and $60,000 per annum to cover costs. 
The next point that was raised was the proper funding of veterans' organisations. The member for Cowan quite correctly said in this debate that a lot of the help that goes on in the Vietnam veterans community is being done on a voluntary basis. The TNPI people give their time unstintingly to help their fellow veterans. But it is coming to the time where we cannot fund veterans support services by raffles; it is coming to the time where these organisations need help with secretarial services. If we can provide a small amount of money—say, $20,000 a year per organisation—to help with phone costs and the services they provide and to make sure that they do not have to charge big membership fees, it will save the Department of Veterans' Affairs a lot of money. 
The people who provide their services free of charge to the community—and it is very welcome—in particular the people who deal with welfare issues, need more training from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We know that that is a very important component of the services that are provided by the veterans groups. That is something that the government could well take on board and it would be something that the department would also strongly support.
Carrying on from that, I come from a regional area as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. I think that there should be a lot more use of telemedicine type facilities and technology. We have isolated people in the north of Australia, in my patch. The city of Mount Isa is serviced by Townsville, but it is some 500 kilometres to the west and there is a large area in between. Where welfare officers can get onto the telemedicine technology they can get to isolated people very easily and provide much needed services to those who are in very isolated areas.
I also warm to a matter that the member for Cowan raised today. He referred to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and the need to change its name. This is a tough issue and something that I believe the minister is going to have to bite the bullet on, because no longer is the name Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service appropriate. It is now servicing Korean veterans. In fact, it is open to all veterans. So it really should be renamed, I believe, to something like the `Veterans Health and Support Service'. In that way, its true role as it exists today would be recognised. It would encourage more people to use the service who are currently concerned with the name Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I think that we can give strong support to that. 
I was very pleased to have that feedback from the veterans' groups in Townsville. I will continue that process and I will continue to relay that feedback to the government. The Howard government strongly believes that the Australian veterans' community deserves generous support, care and compensation through a simple, fair and responsive system that is unique to their needs. This bill gives effect to a range of measures outlined in the budget as part of the Howard government's commitment to veterans. I am pleased to support this bill, for a wide range of reasons. There are a number of initiatives in the bill. Other speakers have covered the detail of that. As my time has now expired, I can only say to the parliament that I welcome the opposition support for the bill and I give it my strong support.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I rise this morning to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000. There are a number of important elements to this bill. I want to deal principally with the bill's extension of benefits under the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme for those children who are deemed to be in need—and I will say something about that later—the bill's provision for dependents of veterans to receive psychological assessment and counselling services and its provision of repatriation benefits to veterans who served in South-East Asia.
The government said in its budget statement that these benefits under the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme should be given to in-need children, but it is not clear in the statements from the government what `in need' means. I do not know what the criteria are but, having worked in the Department of Veterans' Affairs as a delegate of the Repatriation Commission and officer of the department, I dare say that an officer of the department will make some recommendation or decision. But obviously there should be some guidelines to determine what is `in need'. The Bills Digest indicates that there will be an avenue open to appeal to the Repatriation Commission and the AAT in terms of definitions dealing with someone who is in need. How do you classify someone who is in need? Obviously the department should be putting out guidelines so that potential applicants would have some indication of what the criteria are so that they might qualify for these benefits. Is the assessment going to be relevant purely to whether a person is on the poverty line? Will it have any relevance to whether the person has some sort of mental or physical disablement? Will it have something to do with the fact that there might be a marital breakdown? I do not know. 
Also, is it good to categorise or label children with an `in need' category? Possibly they would not feel too encouraged to be designated as `in need'. When I was working for Veterans' Affairs many years ago, the department used to provide `immediate assistance', and possibly it still does today. If my memory serves me correctly, ex-servicemen who were in indigent circumstances could come to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and get £5, or subsequently $10—I do not know if there was any variation on that amount—if they had fallen on hard times. The point I am making is that guidelines need to be prepared by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and that should be provided to ex-service organisations, particularly the RSL and all the other associations representing ex-servicemen and their dependants, to give people an indication of what the category is and the criteria for determining `in need'.
The other element of the bill that I want to talk about is the extension of psychological assessment and counselling services to be provided to the spouses and dependants of Vietnam veterans. The government should be commended for that because we know from history that war—this applies to any ex-serviceman who has experienced the horrors of war, particularly the Vietnam War—has a tremendous impact on one's life and that its impact starts with the family. The interesting thing here is that the analysis of the morbidity of Vietnam veterans report, which is a very good report, provides some pretty horrifying statistics in the comparisons to be drawn with children of ex-servicemen and the ratio of these children to the total Australian suicide rate. There are some quite alarming statistics. They date from 1988. The youth suicide rate of veterans' children is more than three times higher in 1988, twice as high in 1989, three times in 1990, 2.6 times in 1991, four times in 1992 and, alarmingly, nearly six times in 1993. Sadly, the figures continue up until 1997, indicating that there is a significant increase in the level of youth suicide for children of Vietnam veterans. 
I commend the government for the provision in the bill for appropriate psychiatric assessment and counselling services for those children and the dependants of ex-servicemen. I know that in the time I worked for the Department of Veterans' Affairs many Vietnam veterans suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and they still do. We all know the origins of that, because when the ex-servicemen returned from Vietnam they were outcasts; they were not welcomed. The contribution that they made to their country and the sacrifices they made were ignored by everyone. It was not until later in their lives, when we saw the many manifestations and the symptoms of the impact of that service on their lives, that people started to realise the full impact and horror of the Vietnam War. So when this bill provides that service let us hope that these statistics, which are a sad indictment of our society, are significantly reduced. Unfortunately, here in Australia we have a high level of youth suicide. Quite plainly, although the Vietnam veteran population is small, there has been an increase in those statistics purely by virtue of the fact that the children, through no fault of their own, were children of Vietnam veterans.
The figures in this study are a salient reminder of the government's obligations in war management. We know that successive governments, comprising people on both sides of this chamber, have supported the ex-service community. It is accepted here and internationally that the repatriation system in Australia is the most generous compensation system in the world—and so it should be. I know first-hand of this. My uncle served in the Owen Stanley Ranges in World War II. I remember my mother telling me that he returned in 1945 from the south-west Pacific area and was never the same after his service. It was not long after he returned from that war that he started to drink. He then became an alcoholic. His marriage collapsed and ultimately he ended up sleeping in parks and as a trust case in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That is a terrible thing to happen to anyone, but I know that hurt my mother very deeply because my mother said that when my uncle went to war in the early 1940s he was a very fit, intelligent, handsome young man; she was very close to him. Within a matter of years of doing what all countrymen did after they answered the call in the 1939-45 conflict, he suffered greatly, and that had a devastating impact on his family. In those days, of course, there were not the services that are provided today to ex-servicemen, as this legislation will do. I am, effectively, saying is that the psychological impact of war is paramount in the consideration of veterans' entitlements legislation. The casualties of war can include permanent disabilities, including the broad effects of those on families, as has been clearly evidenced by this debate here this morning. Obviously, the figures in this morbidity of Vietnam veterans study are empirical proof of the effect of that war on ex-servicemen's families.
The member for Herbert, who spoke just before me, has alluded to the fact that all of us in this House should be looking out for the veterans who have recently served in East Timor and, of course, those who are currently serving in Bougainville and doing a great job for their country. No doubt when they return to civilian life in Australia they are going to experience difficulties similar to those of many of the Vietnam veterans. More than that, there are Australian soldiers located in many other parts of the world and in areas which could potentially be war zones or are classified as war zones constituting, obviously, a real threat to their lives. Therefore there is going to be an ongoing need, for many years to come, to provide these services. The government deserves a tick for the benefits in this legislation. I would like to make it quite clear that, like all the other speakers, I support it. I particularly want to acknowledge the fact that the government has put in this budget in the order of $32.3 million to provide these services. 
The bill also has a provision to acknowledge qualifying service in certain areas of South-East Asia. I will not go through all of those areas, which are listed in the Bills Digest. Suffice to say that it includes areas like the Thai-Malay border at a certain period of time and also those who served in the RAAF in Ubon in Thailand. It is all listed in the Bills Digest. Obviously it is a very worthwhile thing. Many ex-servicemen volunteered their services and went overseas, although they may not have served in what we used to call, when I was in Veterans' Affairs, a theatre of war, which is where most but not all servicemen served when they went outside Australia. It gave them what is now called qualifying service and automatically entitled them, subject to the assets test and the income test, to a service pension. That was provided to compensate them for the indefinable and intangible effects of war service. I was an old ministerial writer in the mid-1970s in the Department of Veterans' Affairs—
—A young ministerial writer.
—The member for Dobell, as a member with a very high proportion of veterans and widows and dependants, knows all about this.
—Did you draft replies to my queries?
—I have drafted some replies in my day to Labor members. We used to receive complaints and reply to them. Unfortunately, in those days governments were not quite as generous as the legislation is today, and we had to say to the prospective pensioner, `Unfortunately, although you may have offered yourself, because you did not serve outside Australia in an area classified as a theatre of war, or north of 14.5 degrees south latitude between February 1942 and November 1943 in the Northern Territory because of the threat that was going on from the assault from the north, particularly in Darwin, you do not qualify for the service pension. This is a good extension of a benefit to give these particular ex-servicemen who served in those areas, for example, during the Malayan Emergency, the qualifying service provision. They should be given that provision because, notwithstanding that they might not have had the same experience in combat as others in the front line and those who served in the artillery, quite plainly, if you were prepared to put your life on the line for your country the least your country can do for you is to give you qualifying service, because that extends benefits to the ex-serviceman and dependants. That is the least that the government should do.
All in all, this is a very worthy bill and one that I know we all support. I was making a speech in the Main Committee when the member for Cowan spoke. He more than anyone here has experienced the horrors and the consequences of the Vietnam War. Truly he is a great Australian for the price he had to pay for serving his country. I have not said anything about the member for Cowan before, but I think he happens to be one of the most special members in the parliament. He is clearly a person who has let go of the past. This morning I caught the tail end of his speech as he was saying something about the TPI association, the association for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, needing to lift its game to advocate on behalf of ex-servicemen. I remember that when I was in Veterans' Affairs in the mid to late 1970s there was an enormous power struggle going on between the Victorian and New South Wales branches of the TPI association, and a lot of that was visited on various heads of the department in the states. I was working at that time for the Deputy Commissioner of Veterans' Affairs, Jim Greenwood, who himself was a prisoner of war of the Japanese in Changi. He was also a very distinguished serviceman. He was very troubled in those days that many of the members of the TPI association were not looking after their members; they were there for themselves. If I have understood the message from listening to the last minutes of the member for Cowan's speech, if those people who purport to be representing totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen—and that really means that they are incapacitated for life to such an extent that they cannot work more than eight hours and they cannot earn an income, solely due to war service—are not doing well, obviously they should do something about getting out of it and letting other people who are a bit more enthusiastic look after the TPI association. 
I would like to observe that the Australian civilian surgical aid and medical team do not qualify for compensation. I remember that the member for Mackellar, who is now the Minister for Aged Care, had responsibility for that portfolio and she did not do anything about it—and she is not doing a particularly good job at the moment anyhow in respect of aged care. Last December, at a nursing home in my electorate where there are ex-servicemen there was the opening of a refurbishment. She was invited to that. Because I had other commitments in the electorate, I could not go, but I did send a representative, as I always do when I have more than one function to attend. The member for Mackellar, the Minister for Aged Care, three months before the kerosene baths incident, just bagged the Labor Party, and it was an absolutely inappropriate occasion to do so—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is not relevant to this bill.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I think the member for Lowe was tying it to veterans' affairs.
—This is relevant; there is no point of order. This is relevant to veterans because there are veterans and widows of veterans in the nursing home I was referring to. The minister was taking the opportunity of an opening to bag the Labor Party and its policy. We know, from the 30 questions that were asked of the minister here earlier this year of her failings and of her masterful projection of her inadequacies onto the accreditation agency with her taking absolutely no responsibility herself. Quite properly she should have resigned, because things are not getting any better in nursing homes. There are a lot of ex-service men and women and their dependants in nursing homes at the moment. There is an established community in Lowe in which there is a high proportion of people 65 and over, and there are a lot of ex-service men and women in nursing homes. I wanted to make that point. I conclude by saying that civilian surgical and medical teams should qualify for compensation.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—Can I firstly thank members who made an invaluable contribution to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000. At this point, I should also point out that it is Legacy Week, a most appropriate week to discuss this bill. I ask all members of the House to encourage people in their communities to get behind Legacy in their fundraising during Legacy Week.
Honourable members—Hear, hear!
—This bill delivers a number of budget measures which will provide significant benefits to veterans and their families. The bill addresses the anomalies in the service entitlements of those who served in South-East Asia between 1955 and 1975. I know that it has been of longstanding concern to many of those who served in those theatres that they had not been recognised by previous governments. As a result of this bill, an estimated 2,600 veterans will become eligible for an extended range of repatriation benefits with the reclassification of their service into qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In addition, an estimated 1,500 veterans will gain access to repatriation benefits by the inclusion of their South-East Asia service as operational service. 
The bill will also provide significant assistance to Vietnam veterans and their families. This government commissioned the Vietnam Veterans Health Study to identify and address the concerns of the Vietnam veteran community. The government recognises that veterans' families, as well as veterans themselves, need support, and this bill will facilitate that support. It will enable a range of preventative health initiatives, with support and care services for veterans and their families, including the ex-partners and, importantly, the children of Vietnam veterans. 
A number of questions were raised as a result of speeches to this bill, and I want to make some comment on them. I note that the member for Reid is with us in the House. He raised the issue of nurses in Vietnam. For the benefit of the member for Reid, can I say that this is not an issue of whether or not nurses were covered by compensation—they were covered under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. It is not denied that the nurses endured very difficult conditions. I have said repeatedly that if anyone can show that nurses at any time came under the command of the ADF the nurses would receive the same benefits. We have said that in the past, and I understand from advice from my department that some nurses have been able to show that connection, to show that they were under the command of the ADF, and have received a veterans' entitlement.
The member for Moreton referred to the shortcomings of the Department of Defence in the treatment of a number of service people and service families. I will be talking with the member for Moreton, and I will certainly undertake to look at the cases he has reported on to see that they receive the benefits and the service that they are entitled to. I also recognise the validity of his concern about the treatment of PTSD. However, I would like to remind the House that Australian Defence Force members now have access to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service as a result of this budget bill. I would also like to recognise the comments of the member for Moreton on the status of cadets. I will certainly make sure that his comments are passed on to the parliamentary secretary, because this government is in the final stages of a review of the cadet scheme in Australia.
The member for Cowan raised some interesting issues in relation to TNPIs, and I note his concerns about the current issues within the TNPI federation. Can I advise the House that I have met with the federation a number of times. I have had discussions with them, and those discussions are continuing. Only yesterday I addressed the national congress of the RSL of Western Australia, along with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs. We both noted the concerns of the TNPI federation. I also note the concerns that were raised within the resolutions of the RSL, and I certainly look forward to receiving a positive proposal from them in the near future.
The member for Cowan also raised the issue of the defunding—I think that is how he described it—of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service in western Queensland. Coming from western Queensland, I would be alarmed to hear that this was happening. My understanding is that that really is a furphy. If there is any concern about this, I would hope that it would be raised with my electorate office in western Queensland. I want to assure western Queensland and the member for Cowan that funds will continue to be available in western Queensland—or anywhere, for that matter—on a needs basis. However, it is true that some arrangements for delivery of those services in some areas may have changed. But I certainly will be making sure that veterans, including those in my constituency in western Queensland, are not denied access to the service. I am sure they have not been denied access, and this matter has certainly not been raised with my electorate office. I reiterate that the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service outreach service in western Queensland will continue.
The member for Cowan also raised the issue of a wheelchair for Clarrie Upton. When I was made aware of that issue on 18 August I asked my department about the situation and spoke to Clarrie Upton's mother. I said to her that a wheelchair would be made available by my department if his doctor recommended it. I am sure members of the House are aware that under the repatriation system a local medical officer is a terribly important link between the veterans and those entitlements to make sure that they are delivered. I have assured Clarrie Upton's mother that a wheelchair will be provided should it be recommended by his doctor.
I acknowledge the concern raised by the member for Herbert on assistance needed for Black Hawk victims and their families. I share his concern, hence the provisions in this bill which will I think help those victims and their families. I also note he has some health concerns for Timor victims. The Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs are now closely linked through the Defence DVA links program. We are closely monitoring the health concerns of Timor personnel. We want to ensure that treatment is provided and that compensation is fairly provided. Since our involvement in East Timor through INTERFET, and now UNTAET, there are now some 9,000 Australians who have served in the ADF in East Timor and have a full veteran entitlement as a result of that service. 
I also acknowledge the concerns re the title of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I accept that it provides a service more broadly than just to the veterans of the Vietnam campaign. The initiative where the ADF will now receive access to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service may mean that the Vietnam veterans and the committee that look at this may consider a change of name at some time in the future. I acknowledge that the Vietnam veterans themselves have built their own recognition in the community of the need that they had in relation to those who served in Vietnam by getting the broader community and government to focus on those needs through the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. In many ways, it became a badge of recognition of the need for government to look very closely and provide support for Vietnam veterans and their families. I know it is a name they have always guarded, but I think that, from some of the Vietnam veterans I have spoken to, they see it now working in a broader context as well as for Vietnam veterans. One day they may look at a name change so that it becomes more broadly recognised in the community that it helps not only Vietnam veterans but also members of the ADF. I recall that in the case of the Port Arthur shootings the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service of Tasmania was brought in and gave tremendous support to those families who were traumatised as a result of the shootings.
In conclusion, the government continues our commitment to our veterans and their families, and the matters in this bill certainly support that commitment. There is no more deserving group that require our admiration and gratitude than those men and women who have served Australia in war and in conflict. I thank all of those members who have made a contribution to the passage of this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I will not detain the House unnecessarily on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 for which, I have been advised, the opposition has no suggested amendments. The provisions are not controversial. There is the provision that entitlements deriving from the Black Hawk tragedy should be included so that Veterans' Entitlements Act payments are not reduced because of those figures, which are $200,000 for death or severe injury, $50,000 in respect of each dependent child, et cetera. The other changes are that there will be an extension of counselling within the provisions of the Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the possibility of altering what essentially are typographical errors in Veterans' Review Board decisions, where they have some minor differences from the evidence given. Also, in regard to the Repatriation Medical Authority, it will not be obliged to conduct investigations where the request does not state the grounds for review. These matters are not controversial.
The member for Moreton spoke at length about the compensation scheme. The government has brought down a review of the military compensation scheme and I am pleased to say there have been constructive discussions between the government and the opposition in an area where I think all of us appreciate that a variety of circumstances have led to problems—essentially, the chain of command, the situation of a very distinct culture separate from the rest of the Australian work force, the ready fitness program and its impact in essentially suppressing accidents, and people who do not come forward and reveal their injuries. I think a figure has been cited that the average person in Australia reports an industrial accident after a year. In the case of the armed forces the average is 10 years. That indicates a very real problem, and it has been exacerbated by ready fitness. People fear termination and the loss of their employment. 
Turning to the lack of representation aspect, I do not want to go into the whole question of union representation but one of the realities is that people do not feel they have a representative body that can take up these issues. The member for Moreton cited a number of problems. Obviously there is a significant incidence of cases involving people in his electorate, such as those involved in the Westralia matter and the cadets' injuries, and he has obviously followed these in a very substantial manner. We would hope that these discussions lead to a system that avoids the current practice of interaction between two different schemes—the various requirements as to when you started, the type of injury and the type of operation you are involved. That comes into line with other realities of Australia's workers compensation system while recognising that there are distinct differences that do relate to military service. There is an opportunity in these discussions to bring in a scheme for which we can have bipartisan support and which tackles these difficulties.
In conclusion, the opposition is in accord with the government's legislation. It essentially is a mopping-up operation with regard to changes on Black Hawk that might relate to other similar tragedies and changes in the Repatriation Medical Authority and Veterans' Children Education Scheme.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Today I will speak briefly on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, not just as the member for Gilmore but also in my capacity as chair of the government defence and veterans' affairs committee. This bill contains 11 amendments to various acts, all of which will improve and clarify the position of current and former service personnel and their families with respect to a range of benefits, entitlements, financial assistance schemes and administrative procedures. In the main, these amendments are being made in response to matters raised during consultation with our current and former ADF personnel. The federal coalition should be congratulated for its preparedness to listen to its people and to look at their concerns, and for having determined that, indeed, there is a need to address the situation and proceeding to amend the legislation so promptly. In government we are not just concerned at the state of technology and equipment in the ADF, we are also particularly concerned about the health, welfare and morale of our service personnel and their families.
This bill is full of amendments to various acts to make things better and simpler for Australian Defence Force people. I propose to work my way through the 11 amendments, briefly detailing the reasons for and advantages of each one. The first amendment relates to compensation adjustments. Members may recall the terrible crash involving the Black Hawk helicopters in 1996, the year we came to government. Subsequently an inquiry was held into the adequacy of compensation for ADF members undertaking high-risk activities in Australia. That inquiry resulted in changes to the amount of compensation to be paid in the event of death or severe injury, the types of services covered by these measures and the recipients of each type of payment or service.
The amendments contained in this bill ensure that additional payments for the death or severe injury of a service man or woman made by a determination under the Defence Act 1903 will not affect compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Because competition within our legislative program has delayed the introduction of this bill, arrangements have been made to adjust payments for any veteran who has been adversely affected in the interim. This is a clear demonstration of the determination of the federal government to ensure that the recommendations of inquiries are not simply shelved but acted on for the benefit of our service personnel who, for far too long, have been let down by Labor's inaction. 
The second amendment relates to the extension of counselling and guidance services to the children of ADF personnel who have died or been severely injured during their service. Obviously any resulting trauma could adversely affect the children's educational progress, so it makes good practical sense to ensure that the expertise and educational experience of the members of the Veterans' Children Education Board is made available to those children. The third element of this bill, again, has been sparked by recommendations from a report. Yet again this government is showing its preparedness to adopt the recommendations of the report and its commissions. No more are issues doomed to languish on dusty shelves just because the government has asked for a study or an inquiry into a matter.
Many of the amendments in this bill are the direct result of such reports and studies and here we are, again taking action. Professor Denis Pearce looked at the role of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council. He suggested some changes to improve the system for determining claims for compensation. His recommendations clarify the powers of the authority in respect of requests it receives to review statements of principles. Again, wide consultations were held with the ex-service community, as well as their peak bodies, to test endorsement of these recommendations. We can now confidently say that these changes represent our veterans' needs and wishes.
Amendment No. 4 relates to increasing the Repatriation Commission's flexibility in accepting certain applications for travelling expenses lodged outside of the three-month time limit. Where a veteran has suffered a long-term illness that has impaired that person's ability to manage their affairs, he or she could suffer an unintended difficulty in obtaining reimbursement of travelling expenses incurred in seeking medical treatment. I suspect that the veteran community and ex-service organisations will welcome this change, as I know my office in Gilmore has been made aware of the need. Having demonstrated the need, they expected this government to heed the call and I am happy to say that we have responded appropriately. It is an honour indeed to be able to serve our veterans in a government that will take practical action on their behalf.
As you may imagine, the competing demands of other legislation in our program has delayed this announcement. But the veterans in Gilmore have known that we would make it happen as soon as possible. As chair of the government's defence and veterans' affairs committee, it is great to see our veterans' confidence in government being restored where distrust had grown for some years under the Labor government. As the minister highlighted in his second reading speech:
The present restriction on the Repatriation Commission to delegate its powers to a person employed under the Public Service Act 1999 is a barrier to effective use of contracted and outsourced services.
The fifth amendment, not to be confused with the American one, under this bill enables the Repatriation Commission to delegate its powers to contractors, agencies and firms that are working on its behalf. Control will be maintained through contractual arrangements. The opposition may whinge and ask, `What's wrong with the current delegations? Why change them?' The example that the minister quoted is an excellent example of why it should be changed. If the new pharmaceuticals approvals centre operations were managed by a private contractor it would currently require a contracted pharmacist to make a recommendation to a delegated DVA employee, who would make a decision based on the recommendation. It sounds like something you might see on a television comedy. One of the many things at which this government has proved itself very effective is the streamlining of bureaucracy.
This is just one more example. The sixth amendment in this bill covers the creation of funds for special assistance or benefits granted under section 106 of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. This will streamline the processes associated with any such grant by the commission in the future and will solve the current issues of delays while arranging finance. Amendment No. 7 will facilitate greater flexibility and efficiency in the Veterans' Review Board's operations. These better arrangements include an additional configuration of the board, the use of the slip rule where an obvious error has been made in the text of the decision or its reasons to allow its correction, and power to delegate certain action within the board's registry. 
Highlighted in these amendments are the government's commonsense solutions to possible barriers to efficiency in the service of our veterans. Part 8 of this bill introduces a measure to assist the surviving partner of a deceased veteran. This amendment indemnifies a financial institution against further claim for an amount of income support payments received after the death of a person when the institution, at the request of DVA, allows the partner to access the amount as bereavement payment. Again, this measure streamlines a process that financial institutions have been willing to facilitate. Nobody wants to deny a bereaved partner immediate access to the payment.
The ninth amendment relates to GST consequential issues. It completes the measures to ensure that benefits were retained at their current levels after the new tax system came into force. Rather than having to present legislation to both houses of parliament every time—for, for example, increases to the maximum payment for a medical report—it makes practical sense to allow such fee setting adjustments to occur more easily and without wasting our time on such fine detail. Of course, this amendment will also allow GST to be added.
The 10th amendment relates again to the streamlining of administrative requirements, this time with regard to health care providers. In keeping with the government's commitment to reduce red tape, this item reduces DVA's administrative demands of providers. We want our veterans to be able to access health care without it causing them or the providers a mountain of paperwork. This will save both time and money, as the time delay currently produced by the provider's having to obtain DVA's permission to treat the veteran will now cease. It is high time that we recognised the significant majority of providers and rendered an appropriate level of care. We can rely on the informed and selected monitoring of contractual arrangements to ensure that the desired level of care is being delivered without overservicing occurring.
Last is a measure to provide for an alternative credit provider to administer some advances under the Home Support Advance, HSA. This is one of our initiatives that supports this government's and our community's priorities for our senior Australians to be able to age in place—that is, to assist older people to stay in their homes for as long as they desire. Obviously people can get to a point where the regular home maintenance functions that one performs become too much of a load. Rather than have these chores left undone, thereby reducing the quality of life in the home or creating undue anxiety about finances, HSA has been available but only through one provider, that being Westpac. This amendment will provide the opportunity for tenders for the provision of advances on the open market, therefore ensuring competition engendered by such opportunities will make sure that the best prices and service will be available to our veterans.
Mr Deputy Speaker, as you have heard, this bill contains many changes to programs that affect our ADF personnel and veterans. Every single amendment I have addressed today will provide good news to our current or former service men and women and to their families. That is the message from this government—actions, not empty words for cheap political points. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Like the member for Reid and the member for Gilmore, I support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. Quite obviously, the government has done the right thing for the victims of the Black Hawk helicopter crash in 1996, and their dependants, by extending the compensation of $200,000 for death or severe injury and $50,000 in respect of each dependent child at the date of death or at the time of severe injury. The payment of $1,000 to severely injured members or dependents of deceased members for obtaining professional advice is a very worthwhile thing. As I said in my previous contribution, anything that the government does for the veteran community by way of extending compensation and benefit is justly deserved and will invariably be supported by both sides of this House. It is a very worthwhile cause. 
The extension of counselling services under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme is also a very good thing in terms of counselling services which need to be provided to young children. In my contribution in the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1999 I talked about the high level of youth suicide. It is much higher in the children of the veteran community, as the Morbidity of Vietnam Veterans Study shows. The extension of that service to those children is a very worthwhile thing. 
 I also support the amendments relating to the Repatriation Medical Authority, where you get people who seek a review but do not state grounds for it, where the RMA considers that there are not any grounds for review, or where there is a frivolous or vexatious appeal. Anyone who has worked in Commonwealth jurisdictions knows that people will try a lucky dip approach if there is an avenue of appeal, notwithstanding that there are absolutely no grounds for appeal. This can be very costly and time consuming for the department and, ultimately, for the taxpayer. If there is absolutely no chance of getting a positive outcome, it makes sense to give discretion to the determining authority to not conduct a review and to give the Repatriation Medical Authority time to clarify any reasonable connection between a war caused disease or injury and a veteran's service. The time is better spent there than with those frivolous or vexatious appeals.
Another area of amendment deals with the Veterans' Review Board, which is the final determining authority which one can go to within the repatriation system before contemplating going off to the Federal Court, the High Court or the AAT. Clause 104A of the bill is a proposed amendment to allow the principal member of the VRB or the member who presided at the review in question to alter the record where they are satisfied that there is an obvious error in the text of the decision or the reasons. I worked for many years in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and I know we have some officers from the department here as advisers to the government. I am sure they have experienced errors in recording determinations, because the Department of Veterans' Affairs has made hundreds of thousands of decisions over the years, and at times the determining authority puts the wrong effective date or the wrong spelling of a disease. 
When I was working with the department, there were powers under section 31, I think, of the Repatriation Act, where a delegate of the Repatriation Commission could amend something where there had been a wrong recording. I can think of a funny instance when someone wrote down `cerebral haemorrhoids' when they meant to write `cerebral haemorrhage'. It was quite obvious, even to those not enlightened in the field of medical science, that if someone was suffering from cerebral haemorrhoids, there had been a terrible mistake. You can imagine the cost to the taxpayer to fix that through some formal process of going back to the determining authority—who was, in my day, the assistant commissioner.
I can think of another occasion when a doctor from the department wrote to another doctor to do a medical report on a veteran and asked the doctor to report on the veteran's A/Ds. Anyone who has worked in the Department of Veterans' Affairs knows that when you talk about A/Ds you are talking about `accepted disabilities.' But the stroke between the A and the D was very small, and when the doctor received it—and he did not know the veteran's medical history—he read it as `AIDS'. When the patient came in and was assessed by the doctor, the first thing the doctor said was, `How is your AIDS?' The 75-year-old veteran almost had a stroke on the spot, because he was not aware that he was suffering from AIDS, and indeed he wasn't. Several ministerials and an apology from the minister followed, but these are things that can happen. We all like to be precise in our written expression, and we do not like any terminological inexactitude, so if there is some sort of cosmetic surgery to be done on a determining authority's decision—in this case, the VRB's—and the principal member can do that with a minimum of fuss, obviously that is a very good thing. 
I do not think I need to say more on this bill, because there is support on both sides of the chamber. I think that the net result, as has been described by the member for Gilmore, who went through the amendments more exhaustively, is that it will be of great benefit to the ex-service community because it will streamline the process and it will be more efficient for officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That is what those provisions are designed to do, as well as providing extended compensation to the victims of the Black Hawk helicopter disaster and counselling services for children under the VCES. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—I am very pleased, like other speakers, to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. It is refreshing when the parliament can agree on legislation for some very important Australians. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this legislation, coming from an area of Australia which has relied on the soldier settlement nature of its development for its prosperity, from which subsequent generations now benefit enormously. I am advised that 3,792 of my constituents are recipients of veterans' support in various ways, which is a fairly significant number, spread across 73 communities over what is geographically about 25 per cent of Victoria. I am delighted to support a parcel of amendments to legislation to make their lives somewhat easier, especially considering that these veterans, particularly those of World War II, are now very much in their twilight years. I often regret the passing of my late father in 1992 and have often resented the fact that he was cheated of his twilight years and even an opportunity to see his own son take up a seat in this parliament. I have always resented that, and that gives me a special empathy with veterans and their families who are often cheated of quality in their twilight years because of the ordeals they endured. It is a sad reflection on the world that, even since that time, there are more and more veterans coming through the process, even as recently as those who returned from East Timor.
The parcel of measures in this particular piece of legislation will be very well received. Some of them are long overdue and some relate to some very significant and tragic events that have occurred. They all come together to make life just that little bit easier for veterans and their families and, from that point of view, I give it my full support. The amendments will assist members of the Australian Defence Force who have been severely injured as a result of their service and also the families of members who have been killed as a result of their service. In particular, there are measures that go toward supporting the family who remain, particularly the children. A further element of this package is the provision of access to counselling and guidance services for children of severely injured or deceased veterans.
The bill will also allow the Repatriation Commission to accept an application for reimbursement of travelling expenses incurred by a veteran travelling to obtain medical treatment. For someone representing a rural area, this is a very special amendment which I am very grateful to see. There are some exceptional circumstances that can prevent a veteran from making an application for reimbursement for this travel expense—ill health and so forth—within that three-month period. I am pleased to see that the commission will be given some discretion in that regard. Introducing some flexibility in this regard demonstrates that the government and, indeed, the parliament—given the support from the opposition—are concerned about the veteran community. 
The bill will also complete compensation adjustments associated with the new tax system. These adjustments will ensure that the value of the pension supplement will flow through to the amount of a bonus calculated under the pension bonus scheme and to the farmers income test, which I am very pleased to see. There is some difficulty across the primary production sector of my constituency, where we can often have three generations—the patriarch of the family, himself a veteran, his sons and his grandsons—all involved in the same farming activity. So I am very pleased to see some integration between the criteria associated with that, particularly the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme.  
The Repatriation Commission facilitates access to a wide range of health care services for eligible veterans and their dependants. I am pleased to see in this bill the additional flexibility in the provision of allied health services—for example, podiatry and dietary advice—that veterans sadly need. The commission has progressively reviewed the circumstances in which it needs to approve treatment before it is provided to eligible persons. As the Department of Veterans' Affairs has shifted its focus from being a health service provider to being somewhat of a purchaser of services, services are often provided by persons not necessarily connected to the department. This bill reflects these changes and indicates that the parliament is prepared to recognise changes to the way in which health services are delivered. So I am very pleased to see that.
There are a several measures in the bill—I will not actually make reference to all of them—that deserve special comment. In the wake of the dreadful tragedy of the Black Hawk disaster, there is a measure in the bill to make guidance and counselling support available through the Veterans' Children Education Boards to children of ADF personnel who have died. This measure not only covers the Black Hawk incident but also makes provision if such tragedies occur again. This measure will provide the expertise and educational experience of members of the Veterans' Children Education Boards in each state to children who, because of the death of a parent, may be suffering their own personal trauma, affecting their educational process.
There are amendments in this bill which have the objective of implementing three recommendations in Professor Dennis Pearce's report on the roles of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council—again reflecting the changing way in which veterans access their health support. A person seeking a formal review of his statement of principles pursuant to the Veterans' Entitlements Act will be required to state the reasons for that review and refer to evidence not used by the medical review. Again, this indicates some flexibility and makes it easier for veterans, particularly those from World War II who are well into their twilight years. 
I have referred to the measure relating to travelling expenses. I am very pleased to see this measure, as there are some circumstances, as I mentioned, in which a veteran may not be able to comply with the three-month period. There is also the appropriation of special assistance, the objective of which is to provide apportionment of funds for assistance or benefits granted under section 106 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Ongoing discrete appropriation for special assistance is maintained, so implementation of any grant need not be delayed until finance can be arranged. Linking funding of a grant of assistance or benefit under the special assistance provisions with the funding arrangements for comparable assistance or benefits will enable the Repatriation Commission to make a grant when it is required. This bill addresses many amendments that are long overdue. Veterans in my electorate, particularly those who are required to travel to major metropolitan or provincial centres for health care services, will be most grateful that these measures have been addressed.
I would like just to make some broad comments about veterans and the nature and the character of the people I represent. I have always been very pleased to see that the Veterans' Affairs portfolio does not suffer the normal partisanship that can often occur in this place. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the former government was always very generous to me in requests I made to him, as is the current minister, the Hon. Bruce Scott. I today made a summary of the additional measures by which the minister has responded to the needs of the nearly 4,000 veterans across the north-west of Victoria in my constituency of Mallee. The measures include the recent provision of veterans information facilities at Swan Hill and Mildura and a commitment to meet ongoing recurrent costs there to meet the support that is given to veterans in their inquiries about access to services. For example, the Swan Hill Veterans' Information Centre received $17,822 and the Regional Veterans' Centre in Mildura, which provides a very much needed service to something like 1,500 veterans just in the Sunraysia community itself, received a grant of $33, 644 to assist them with the delivery of their services.   
In total, including all of the assistance being given to veterans to upgrade monuments across the whole of the north-west of Victoria through the Their Service-Our Heritage program, joint ventures with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Veteran and Community Grants program and Building Excellence in Support and Training for Veterans' Advocates, over $200,000 has been provided, spread across 70 communities in my constituency.  So I would like to commend the minister for those very positive and very practical responses. I receive appreciation from veterans on a regular basis for the support that they see this parliament providing.  
I remember Bruce Ruxton, the Victorian President of the RSL, referring to the Hon. Con Sciacca some time ago, when I was in opposition, as being the best Minister for Veterans' Affairs the parliament has ever had. He recently adjusted that comment at a function in Mildura in my constituency out at Red Cliffs RSL. He said that the Hon. Bruce Scott even tips the Hon. Con Sciacca.  So congratulations to the minister.  I think it is deserving and I have always appreciated the responses that he has provided to me to requests I have made. 
Recently a community care seeding grant of $60,005 was given to the Beulah community, which has in the district associated with the town of Beulah about 100 veterans, for the provision of a community bus. It was just a delight to be with that community last week, to hand over the keys to that bus and to see the joy and appreciation on their faces as they appreciated the parliament responding to their needs. Beulah is a very isolated community. Without access to health care in the township, veterans are required to travel. With the support of the state with an amount of nearly $40,000, they were able to purchase a $100,000 bus, which can deliver them to the provincial centre located in Horsham so they can access the health support and associated social activities. It is very important for that age group in their twilight years to be able to enjoy and appreciate the company of others in similar circumstances. 
So I am very grateful to the minister and congratulate him on steering this legislation through the parliament and for the negotiations that he has had in getting wholesome and uniform support from the parliament here. I commend the bill to the chamber and look forward to its speedy passage through the other place. I hope senators in the other place will appreciate this is a much needed measure and that it needs a very speedy response by way of positive support.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I today speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. Members can approach how they make their contributions on certain bills in a range of ways. What I like to do, particularly with these types of bills, is not just look at the technical aspects or the changes in the bill, although I do look at those and mention them in my contribution, but also make comment about the general intent, the purpose and the resulting effect on the community. I also like to make some comments on how the community will receive these changes and what is happening in that community. 
So I am very pleased today to be speaking on this bill, particularly because it comes at a time when we are supporting the needs of our returned soldiers and their families through the annual Legacy appeal—which in fact is today. It was quite timely, as I purchased the badge I am wearing this morning, that I be reminded of the selfless and tireless work Legacy and many other volunteer associations undertake on behalf of the veteran community across Australia. The weather was pretty fresh this morning and I have a great regard for anyone who is prepared to stand outside on a cold Canberra morning selling badges for much needed funds. The gentlemen out there this morning were all volunteers.  It would not surprise me if a few of them headed back to work after their stint of badge selling this morning. One gentleman had actually given a member $5 to buy a badge. I know we do not always carry cash in our wallets, but I hope this volunteer got an IOU from the member and that they will get their money back.   
Overall the effort of Legacy this morning is indicative of the kindness, the compassion and the generosity that can be found in so many veteran associations. Each group has its priority, but I doubt any of them would turn away a veteran or a member of a veteran's family if they were asking for help. Legacy is a great example of an organisation that has evolved with the change in veterans, their problems and the solutions throughout the past 80 years.  I would like to quote a founding member of Legacy, Frank Select: 
We have to remember that in a way we survivors have received a legacy to see that the ideals our comrades died fighting for are maintained in Australia.
 I doubt those at the inaugural meeting of Legacy could have predicted how relevant that statement is today. Legacy now supports people affected by both world wars, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the Malayan Emergency, the Gulf War and our peacekeepers who are so often forgotten in many of the activities—sometimes even in spirit—that are undertaken. But they are certainly not forgotten by members in this place and they are certainly not forgotten by my electorate or the veteran community in Oxley.  
I attend many veterans' functions and am always impressed with the camaraderie amongst the members and the genuine compassion they have for each other. As is the case with many other voluntary organisations, veterans' groups are usually held together through the hard work of a select few. At times it must be frustrating when so many people benefit from the efforts of just so few individuals. I have concluded that the major reason these people advocate for others is the fact that if they did not there would be no-one else.
 It is unfortunate that we find ourselves today still having to buy and sell badges for an annual fund-raiser such as Legacy. I only say that it is unfortunate, because there should be other and more substantial ways for these things to occur, which is not to detract from the good work that Legacy does. These organisations need to be self-funding, but I am frustrated that the financial pressure they face is based on an increase in the resources and services they have to provide to their members.
Quickly looking at the services provided by Legacy, there is a broad and diverse range of assistance available, including counselling and advisory services, war widows' pension claims advocacy and assistance, financial assistance to Legacy widows and dependants, health and welfare programs, information, social and recreational programs and a range of other activities. It is frustrating that an organisation such as Legacy, which was developed in the 1920s to assist returned soldiers and war widows get back on their feet, today represents for some the only source of advice and support on everyday matters that they feel truly gives them what they need.
It is frustrating that Legacy has the need to provide an advocacy service so that a war widow can adequately deal with a federal government agency. It is perhaps also frustrating that while it is probably necessary that they do have one, regardless of how good the service from government can be, it often replaces or substitutes what the federal government agency might do.
The bill we are discussing today has been developed to clarify entitlement eligibility definitions. It is written with the intention of compassion and understanding of veterans' and their families' needs. I do not say that lightly. I have been very critical at times of the department and the minister in certain areas within the portfolio, particularly in areas to do with compassion and understanding. While I think this bill actually redresses some of those issues, I make that statement only to this bill.
The amendments to the Veterans' Children Education Scheme, the VCES, are positive. They indicate a commitment by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the long-term welfare of these people. The amendments to the Repatriation Medical Authority's issuing of determinations of statements of principle are also very positive. The consolidation of multiple cases and the easy rectification of clear administrative errors and decisions are to be commended. It is good to acknowledge that logic can reign in some places of bureaucracy. I am concerned, however, that the theory behind these amendments will be undermined by the reality of the poor resources and the insurmountable caseloads of the responsible agencies. 
In March this year I was inundated with veterans expressing their concern about the changes to the age criteria of dependents of Vietnam veterans eligible for the resources of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, the VVCS. The manner in which the change was done was extremely underhanded and it was calculatedly based on budgetary shortfalls. The government's reaction to the protest was to announce in the Veterans' Affairs budget in May that the age for the counselling services would be raised from 25 years to 35 years. What was heralded by the minister as a budget bonus for veterans was merely the rectification of a harsh and grossly non-compassionate departmental decision. So if in March 2000 the VVCS budget had to save a bit of money, one would assume it would need to find those savings in August 2000. If one assumed that, one would be right. The VVCS has been targeted to save a bit of cash and this time the government is far more crude about it.
It is now proposed that the VVCS cease the country outreach program. This is scheduled for December 2000, just a short few months away, six months after the last failed attempt to save money in similar areas. The VVCS provides an extraordinary service to its clients. It has an enormous and diverse workload. For many years the service provided by the VVCS has reflected the complexity of Vietnam veterans' concerns and problems. Essential to the success of the VVCS has been the inclusion of family, particularly the children of veterans, in the healing and advocacy process.
What are people in the rural and regional areas of Australia to do if they can no longer access the services of the VVCS? The only conclusion I can make is that they will either travel to the nearest service available or simply stop using the service, neither of which is satisfactory or good news for anyone in the veteran community.
The recent Vietnam Veterans Health Survey provided conclusive evidence of the significantly high incidence of youth suicide and spina bifida amongst children of Vietnam veterans. I am alarmed that, nearly two years after the initial report was released, the government is winding up an important element of the report's recommendations. I actually spoke a couple of days ago in this House about the findings of both reports, also the Vietnam Veterans Morbidity Survey. The findings are quite stark. I was very disappointed about what I found in those two reports. I will not go into the details here but I will just repeat that I found the reports, the recommendations and the conclusions to be based on disqualifiers, disclaimers, qualification and fear of liability rather than on the premise that there is something positive to come out of it and something positive to be done—although I am certain that the minister's intention is for that to be the case.
The VVCS is a highly successful and effective unit of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The service provided by the VVCS is important to the veteran community and should not be limited to those fortunate enough to live near a VVCS centre. There is real pain out there in the veteran community, there is real pain in the Vietnam veterans' community and there is real pain in the peacekeeping community. These are people who have, through no choice of their own, been selected by whatever means was appropriate at the time to represent Australia in conflict, to be there for us. These were the people who did not choose to go but did go and went with great credibility and did great service for their country.
What has impressed me in recent years with this community, as I have said on many occasions, is their tenacity, their ability to work together and their capacity to work through and deal with their own issues—their capacity as a community to bind together and to do things for themselves. But as in all things, that is only a starting point, and it is necessary for government to understand its role in that community and its role in providing the resources they need to move forward. 
For whatever reason, right now or in this period in history we are seeing this community rallying around certain issues and really coming together. There might be a number of explanations for that. I think it might be a coincidence of timing, such that after a number of years certain issues have come to the surface again. The Vietnam veterans' community has found a real binding factor in a whole range of issues. I am impressed with that and I think the government should also be very impressed with that. It should be prepared to take extraordinary steps to move towards resolving some of those issues that have been around for many years.
I think the time is right. We are always going to hear from any government or any opposition that the time is right now. But I am not talking about whether it is the minister who is in government now or the minister when we will be in government. Now is the time because the reports have been concluded and we have finalised a number of matters. The community has rallied together with one voice and all of these things are coming together right now. Now is the time for this minister to stand up and say, `I have an opportunity to redress some of these long outstanding issues.' We have seen some movement in this place, after a great deal of pressure in some instances from this side.
One of the things that is important and which I applaud in this bill is the recognition of the need for flexibility. This is what we talk about at the coalface. This is what the veterans want. They want and need flexibility. I think this is recognised here and I applaud that. That needs to be backed up with resources, not just goodwill. As I have just described, the resources include the country program, which is now being axed.
 I do not understand why the government thinks that the axing of the VVCS program in the country somehow signifies an intent to make services more available. We often hear, at painful length, from members of the government about their commitment and dedication and how they understand the bush and regional areas much better than we do. Somehow they think they have licence in these areas. Where is your licence in this area? Why are the government cutting programs in this area? Purely to save money. Certainly, budget measures have to be made and there are always constraints but I do not believe that cutting VVCS in the country is the way to do it.
The member for Mallee spoke earlier, and I commend him on his contribution. He talked about quality of life in general and the quality of life he and his father missed out on. We are talking about something that is very real—something that all veterans feel. It is a physical thing. It is something that not only they, but also their families, go through. Anyone looking at the statistics and seeing the effect cannot deny the great pain that veterans and their families go through. It is something that cannot be denied and it is something we have a responsibility to address.
The member for Mallee also raised the issue of East Timor. It is an issue I want to put on the record. We again have a great opportunity to correct some of the mistakes of the past, for example, the way we treat the service men and women who return from service in East Timor. We should look very carefully—and I know the veteran community is looking very carefully—at the way we treat them. It is something I put on the record because I think it is very important. 
I have a very large veteran community in my electorate of Oxley, of which I am very proud. Ipswich has some great history in this area. My veteran community is very involved. They get out there and are supportive of the families. They try to change things and work together to make life easier and better for all veterans and peacekeepers. Recently we celebrated 18 August in the very heart of my electorate, the suburb of Goodna. Some people say Goodna is a suburb of Ipswich—I always say that Ipswich is a suburb of Goodna. On that day we had an incredible turnout. It was different from the event started a few years ago by a handful of Vietnam veterans and each year attended by a couple of dozen people. This year several hundred people turned out. There was a fly-over by an Iroquois, and the day was attended by the commander of the Amberley RAAF base, a number of local federal and state representatives and the Mayor of Ipswich. It was an absolutely phenomenal event and a fantastic day. The organising committee should be congratulated for their great work, as should the Goodna RSL, the Ipswich RSL, the sub-branch, the Railway branch and the other units in my electorate. I was very proud to be there. It was quite a moving occasion. There were not many dry eyes watching the parade. It brought back a flood of memories. The thing that shines out from these days is that this is a fantastic community and one we need to look after. 
I want to refer in relation to this bill to certificates of appreciation events. I have run a number of these events in my electorate. I thought that the first one I ran would be a one-off. I thought we would ask people whether they were eligible for a certificate of appreciation. I thought it would be something we could do for the veteran community. We have had four events and are coming up to number five. It is something we will keep doing, because it is an incredible event for these people and gives something back to them. 
I did not understand that well until the shadow minister, Con Sciacca, was my guest at one of these events. Con Sciacca is extremely well respected in the veteran community. He is absolutely revered. In giving out the certificates, he started his speech to the veterans in a bizarre way and I scratched my head wondering where he was going with his comments. He spent about five minutes talking about himself. He said he had been given great honours, not only through his position as a member of parliament but also, when he was no longer in office, as a life member of the RSL, which is an even greater honour. He kept talking about the honours he has had, but he drew his speech to a close by saying to those people that there is one thing he will never get and that is a certificate of appreciation because he did not serve. That really summed up how important and significant these certificates are. I commend the government for this bill.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—I thank members on both sides who have made a contribution to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. This bill introduces a number of initiatives that will directly and indirectly benefit veterans and their families. The government is improving the repatriation system, not only through direct measures but also through the better management and organisation of matters under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Defence Service Homes Act 1918.
The overall management of veterans' affairs will be enhanced by the removal of redundant provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the increased flexibility in access to assistance and the streamlining of service delivery. The bill will enable the exclusion of certain additional compensation payments from the offsetting provision in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This will increase benefits to seriously injured members of the Australian Defence Force and the families of those members who have lost their lives in defence service.
Other veterans to directly benefit from this bill are those who may be given an extended period within which they may claim reimbursement for travelling expenses incurred when obtaining treatment. The bill will also benefit the recently bereaved by ensuring they have ready access to bereavement payments. The changes to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 will allow the delivery of home support advances through the most suitable arrangements established by public tender. These advances will assist many veterans and their dependants with home maintenance, modifications and repairs. Overall, the bill is a continuation of this government's commitment to veterans and their families and it ensures that the veteran community continues to enjoy a high standard of compensation and care through access to generous benefits and quality health care services. 
In conclusion I would like to refer to some of the comments that were made. I recognise the validity of the comments of the member for Reid on the proposed reforms to the military compensation. Noel Tanzer also recognised that it is important for bipartisan support to be given to these matters. I thank him for those comments. I look forward to working with the member for Reid in further consideration of these matters. 
I thank the member for Gilmore for her support in this bill. She does a tremendous amount of work in her electorate in representing the views of the veterans in the electorate of Gilmore. She also does a great job on our backbench committee, and I want to thank her for that because she is a fierce advocate of issues relating to veterans, not only in her electorate but also broadly across Australia. She recognises the need to streamline the delivery of services in the community and recognises the benefits that will flow from that. As she said, it is really about actions and not words and I endorse her comments.
The member for Lowe made an invaluable contribution and I thank him for that. I also want to recognise the depth of knowledge he has of the repatriation system. I acknowledge as well the great empathy that he has for veterans because of his past experience. I am sure the story of his own father is very difficult for him to tell. It just reminds us all of the extent of the pain of those who have served our country and the effects of war on the mind and the body; and, too, how that can have an effect on families that will linger and last long after the experience of war and the immediate experience of war.
 I want to thank the member for Mallee for his contribution. Coming from a rural area, as he does, in western Victoria, he spoke of the great significance of the return of service men and women to his electorate, which was settled after the First World War, in many instances with soldier settlement blocks. I remember going to a very large reunion dinner in his electorate a couple of years ago. It was a celebration of the early soldier settlements and of course the success—and in other areas the failures—of some of those early soldier settlement schemes. I also recognise the difficulty that he had in making remarks about his father. I know that it is difficult in this House for members to speak of their personal experience within their own families, as the member for Mallee did when speaking of how war service affected his father and also his family. I am sure those sorts of sentiments could be expressed by many people in this parliament, and I thank the member for Mallee for those comments and acknowledge him also for his very kind personal remarks in relation to me. I must just say to the House that I am here to do my job and I will always give it my best shot. But I thank him for those very kind personal remarks.
I acknowledge, too, the remarks made by the member for Oxley, the final speaker from the other side of the House, and of course the comments he made in relation to Legacy Week. Of course, it is terribly important and I can only endorse those comments and ask all members of the House to encourage people in their own communities to get behind Legacy's fundraising effort and not lose focus on the work it does. I often think that the work of the Legacy people is done so quietly, and they never look for accolades—they just do a good job. It is important that we in this parliament encourage others to give generously in Legacy Week.
I also want to say something in relation to the VVCS and the outreach into rural areas. The member suggested that perhaps there has been some cutting of funding in this area that will see a diminution of this service in rural areas. I said in debate on the previous bill that this is not the case. I am not quite sure where these comments are coming from, but let me assure the member for Oxley that access to the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service is available and that is not going to be cut. In fact, this bill extends the service of the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service to a broader range of service people. I am sure that he and all members of this House would accept that that is a very good thing and something that we should all be behind because it will help current serving members of the Australian Defence Force, in particular those who may have been in Bougainville, Rwanda, Somalia, Cambodia and, of course, also those currently serving in East Timor. So it is an invaluable service and once again I thank the Vietnam veterans who originally put governments on both sides of the parliament on notice so long ago to have this service established to meet the needs of those who have served our country. I am sure that, as it is extended into other areas of service within the ADF, the Vietnam veterans too will gain a great sense of achievement and pride that what they established is benefiting others which is, I think, in the spirit of all those who have served our country. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 makes a number of amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. With regard to the changes to quarantine arrangements being proposed in this legislation, this bill continues the ongoing refinement of the Quarantine Act in the light of the new challenges and changes that confront the quarantine task in the new millennium.
As far as the specific changes are concerned, the amendments to the Quarantine Act that we are debating here today allow for the use of computer based systems for the clearance of cargo in that quarantine task. We are in the information age and facilitating the movement of cargo and trade is going to be to Australia's long-term advantage. Many communities, especially rural and regional communities around Australia, depend very heavily on the export of their produce to generate wealth. They need a very efficient and professional quarantine service to ensure that that task is facilitated with relative ease.
A number of other amendments are being proposed in this legislation that we do not intend to oppose, for example, that the director of quarantine be able to take into account offences against prescribed state and territory laws as well as Commonwealth laws when assessing the suitability of a person to manage a place where goods subject to question may be treated or otherwise dealt with. Another minor amendment is that a quarantine officer is able to give directions to a person in control of a vehicle. At present directions must be given to the owner of the vehicle, which leads to problems when the owner cannot be easily contacted in case of a problem. Another amendment covered by this legislation is that a quarantine officer is given the ability to direct treatment of a premises that has been exposed to a quarantine risk, even if the animal or plant which carried the risk is itself no longer subject to quarantine. There are a number of other smaller, minor amendments that are also covered in this legislation and, as I have stated, the opposition does not intend to oppose them.
I want to make a few comments about Australia's trading performance, because that quarantine task is important to the success of that trading performance. Over the last couple of days statistics have been released by the government which show some very significant export growth, which underpins the importance of trade to the Australian economy. There are several reasons why that export growth has occurred. One significant reason is the low value of the Australian dollar, which is currently trading at around 57c to the US dollar. Another reason is the increase in commodity prices that have been driven by the return to prosperity in the Asian economies to our north. The increase in trade puts further significant pressure on Australia's quarantine task. With that in mind, I move: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to adequately resource the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to carry out its role of protecting Australia's agricultural industries from exotic pest and disease and facilitating Australian agricultural exports”.
I have said before in this House that not only has that increased trade put pressure on the quarantine task in this country but also Australia's membership of the World Trade Organisation has imposed significant obligations on us as a trading nation. We have also seen a massive increase in the mobility of people, not only in Australia but around the world. The recent low domestic air fares in Australia have prompted a significant increase in interstate air travel traffic. Of course, that poses in its own way some significant quarantine risks internally in Australia.
In a couple of weeks we have the Sydney Olympic Games, which will put significant pressure on our quarantine resources. We will see over time an increasing movement of people within Australia. We will see an ever increasing tourism trade, with Australians going overseas and other people visiting this country. We will witness events in Australia—perhaps not again like the Olympic Games—that will draw people here. While those increases in tourism are quite beneficial to the Australian economy, they present some very significant risks to many Australian industries and to farmers and their families.
I do not think Australians fully understand the importance of quarantine to Australia's agricultural industries. My appeal today would be to people who follow the debates in this House and who follow these sorts of issues to really educate themselves, their neighbours and their communities about the importance of quarantine to Australia, because there are many genuine Australian farm families who rely very heavily on the awareness of their fellow Australians about the importance of quarantine to them. You might recall in the old days, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every trip interstate was a reminder of the importance of quarantine because you had to go through various checkpoints where your vehicle was searched and you were personally quizzed about whether you were carrying any materials that might jeopardise agricultural industries in a particular region. Today we really rely on education and public goodwill in managing that quarantine task.
As I have said, many rural industries, the farmers who work in them and the regional communities that sustain them depend very heavily on the efficiency of the quarantine service to protect them. The apple industry is a case in point: it is at risk with the dreaded fire blight disease. The chicken industry has problems with Newcastle disease and the beef industry with foot and mouth disease. All of those industries are very important regionally based industries in this nation. I do not think it is understood or appreciated enough either by some of our trading partners just how fragile our natural environment is and how susceptible to disruptions it is from the introduction of exotic pests and diseases. We have a responsibility to preserve wherever possible the uniqueness of that environment for future generations of Australians, and that sometimes necessitates a very strong and vigilant quarantine effort.
In the past there have been quite significant criticisms of our quarantine effort. Those persistent criticisms have been based around the quality of the staff employed by AQIS and their level of skill and the sometimes expensive procedures that are required to not only clear imports but also to give clearance to exports to give some comfort to our trading partners about the quality of produce that is leaving Australia and whether it complies with the quarantine requirements of the importing country.
There is also a persistent criticism about the time that is being taken to conduct some of the import risk assessments in the new trading environment. Apples is a case in point. The draft import risk assessment was due out last November. It was postponed to May. Then the government announced that it was further postponed until June. We are now told that it is due in September. There is obviously a problem with any process that runs more than nine months beyond the date that was first announced by the government for its completion. The situation in this industry is an example of the need for a process with absolutely no margin of error. If fire blight gains a toehold in this country, the livelihoods of apple growers and the economic wellbeing of the regions they support will be very much under threat. It is absolutely vital that AQIS be resourced adequately to complete and make an accurate assessment of the risks of importing apples from a  country where fire blight is known to exist. 
There are also persistent criticisms of Australia's scientific capacity, as I have just outlined, to conduct these very important risk assessments. There have also been fairly hefty criticisms of the dimensions of the educative task that has been undertaken in the past, given the growth in trade that has occurred and the movement of people internally in this country and the trade growth with other countries. These are very important issues, because AQIS plays a vital role in opening up new market opportunities for Australian producers and it must be adequately resourced to give the customers of agricultural produce confidence in the quality of that produce.
I think the criticisms of the quarantine task that have been levelled in the past have had some foundation, and I acknowledge the presence here in the chamber of the honourable member for Corangamite, who I am sure appreciates, coming from a regional area, the importance of the quarantine task to Australia's agricultural industries. I have moved that second reading amendment because I think these criticisms have to be acknowledged by the government. I know that the government will mount its defence along the lines that in past budgets we have not seen any significant decline in the funding to the quarantine task and to AQIS. However, the government cannot deny these facts. Australia is in a sustained phase of trading growth, and that goes back to the Labor years. That goes back to the 13 hard years of Labor, as the government likes to put it—those 13 exciting years of Labor when we finally turned this country from an inward looking country that had existed under the heavy hand of the conservatives to a dynamic, forward thinking, outward looking country that is now one of the great trading nations of the world. Of course, exports have grown, and the government has to acknowledge that fact, and with the low Australian dollar and with the Australian community, dare I say it, living beyond its means, with rising debt levels and growing imports the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service becomes even more important in managing the quarantine task to ensure that those imports that do come into this country meet our standards and do not pose risks to our agricultural industries or to our environment.
The honourable member for Corangamite, as he swans about the House today, has offered a few comments under his breath to the points I was making. The simple fact is that he is able to allocate $460 million to advertising executives in Sydney and Melbourne to advertise the government's GST, yet he will no doubt come into this House and argue that the government has maintained expenditure on the quarantine task and has not actually cut it. Given the fact that our exports and imports are rising at such an important rate and given the importance of this task to our trading effort, we ought to be looking at beefing it up, not just merely holding the line. If you can find $460 million for the advertising executives to advertise your GST and blow $12 billion on a tax that the Australian community at the end of the day does not really want, then I would hope that in the budget you are considering now you will find some resources to beef up the quarantine task in this country.
Let me go to the second part of this legislation which deals with the wine industry. Once again we have a failure of the government here. It seems we are eternally coming into this House to make a string of minor amendments to legislation because the government got it wrong with drafting errors in the first place. Here we have amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to allow payers of the wine export charge, as well as payers of the wine grape levy, to vote at annual general meetings of the Wine and Brandy Corporation. I would have thought the government should have got that right at the start, but it obviously has not. The honourable member for Corangamite has to be in here to cop the flak. I know he has broad shoulders and I know he likes his drop of chardonnay. He is from the chardonnay set in the Western District, that great squattocracy out there in the back blocks of Corangamite. He likes his drop of wine. He visits my electorate on many occasions to sample the wines of the Geelong region, and we are always happy to see him there. This particular amendment to the legislation we will not be opposing.  
The Australian wine industry is indeed a success story as far as Australian agricultural industries are concerned. Over recent years we have seen a rapid expansion in the wine industry. For example, in 1995-96 production volumes were 130 million litres with a value of $471 million. In 1999-2000 that had grown to 288 million litres with a value of $1.352 million. It is an extraordinary development, and I pay tribute to the wine industry, its leaders, for their vision, their passion for growth in the industry and the hard work of everybody from the entrepreneurs to the workers and those who support the industry and for the magnificent job they are doing in rural and regional Australia. 
Despite the growth, there are some real challenges emerging for the industry. ABARE's 2004-05 outlook identified some of these. The record production that has resulted from increased plantings will present important marketing and promotional challenges for the industry in coming years. The report also identifies the consolidation of production, processing, distribution and retail activities as an urgent priority of the industry in coming years. We can expect a fall in wine prices and that will put significant pressure on the industries. In coming years we can expect a volume growth and a value growth in the wine industry. The influences on that value growth are the exchange rate, changes in the export mix and the normal pressures that come from inflation. But there are also positive factors. Although Australia is a small player on the world stage as far as wine exports are concerned, there is still potential there for us to grow, and of course events like the Olympic Games are going to give a very significant shot in the arm to Australia's wine industry.
Members might not be aware but the Geelong region, which I represent and which the honourable member for Corangamite, who is in this House, also represents, has a long historical association with the wine industry. The first vines were planted in the area in 1842 and by 1861 it was recognised as the most important wine growing region in Victoria. It is an interesting agricultural industry from a local and structural point of view. The number of vineyards in Geelong is around 60. The average size, however, is quite small at six hectares. The total area under plantings at the moment is in the region of 440 hectares and it is growing. 
It is an industry that the Geelong community has earmarked for future development because of its strong linkages to the food industry and tourism. Only a couple of weeks ago, two exciting new initiatives were announced in Geelong to strengthen these important linkages between the wine industry and the food and tourism industries. I was particularly disappointed at missing the launching of these two new initiatives on a very pleasant Sunday morning two weeks ago at La Parisienne Restaurant on Geelong's waterfront—a very attractive waterfront. I notice that the member for Corangamite was not there on that occasion. He normally is. He normally is there sampling. The two initiatives that were announced there were the launch of Geelong's new wine logo and the launch of the food and wine development strategy. I am very sorry the honourable member for Corangamite was not there because, as I mentioned before, he is a member of the Western District chardonnay set that swans around the Corangamite electorate drinking wines from my electorate. I am always happy for him to promote Geelong wines because it means at the end of the day more wealth for my electorate, more employment for my people and of course significant investment for and imaging of the Geelong region. I know he likes a drop; he likes that Bannockburn red. He likes to get up there on Scotsman's Hill with his tory friends sipping on Geelong reds. Geelong is the gateway to the Great Ocean Road and quite a staggering number of tourists visit the region and pass through it on a weekend.

Prime Minister, I refer to your election promise that `the GST will not increase the price of petrol to Australian motorists'. Prime Minister, have you seen the latest GST pricing report from your preferred modeller, Chris Murphy, of Econtech? Have you seen his comments on petrol pricing: `The changeover to the new tax system has added about 1.2 cents a litre to petrol prices'? Prime Minister, if your own preferred modeller thinks the GST has increased petrol prices, what evidence do you have that he is wrong?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—I have not seen that but I will have a look at it. I always try and keep pace with my reading requirements, but maybe the reason why I have not got around to reading that was that my eyes were absolutely transfixed on the transcript that was thrust under my nose by the ever vigilant press secretary who works for me. It is a transcript of a speech made by the then Leader of the House on an urgency motion which was moved by the then Manager of Opposition Business. Both of those gentlemen have changed their positions since this debate took place. The Leader of the House has become the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business has become the Prime Minister. But what is interesting is not so much the positions we held at that time but the description given by the then Leader of the House to the excise adjustment made by the then government without warning and in defiance of promises in 1993. Do you know what he had to say? He said:
First, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) repeated this furphy that the Liberals go on with—that the Australian public was lied to during the election campaign—
And listen to this. This is the best bit:
by virtue of the fact that small adjustments have been made to petrol taxes and sales taxes.
What he defined as a small adjustment was a 5c discretionary increase. Against that background, with that record, you have no credibility on this issue.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—For Australia to succeed as a knowledge nation we need to do two things. Firstly, we need to increase the skills of all of our people, not just the wealthy. We need to invest in the capabilities of our people to handle the type of economy which we now must be in if we are going to succeed as a nation. We have to see education and skilling as not simply a private opportunity but a public investment, and probably the most important public investment that a nation makes. Secondly, we need increased investment in science, technology and engineering, both public and private. We need to see increased investment in science and engineering and research and development as at the heart of the successful nations of this century. We can no longer be a nation that looks to comparative advantage which comes from simply our location, the comparative advantage which comes from our resources, the successful nations, or the comparative advantage, I might say—to take it a point further—that comes from skills in derivatives, from being a derivative economy, from taking up other people's investments. We have always been pretty good at taking up other people's ideas. We have always had a big take-up of technologies invented by others. These are all parts of a comparative advantage, not a competitive advantage. For a competitive advantage we need to be the inventors of new things. 
On both these fronts this government stand condemned by their acts of commission and omission. I draw attention to, for example, the most recent evidence of an act of omission. That comes from their chief scientist, a man whose position was declared—in the mind of this government at its level of relevance—when they took that permanent official of previous Labor governments and made him a part-time adviser to themselves. That is a statement of where they saw the significance of science. But what that gentleman has done in the report that he has put forward is draft a set of particulars for an indictment of this government. On every page of that report is a criticism explicitly of the direction this nation has gone over the course of the last four years. It is an extraordinary document. The initial reaction of the minister to whom that report was offered was to say, `It could be a bit expensive; we need to do these sorts of things without spending too much money.' The indictment in the chief scientist's report goes not just simply to the industry minister and the way in which we treat support for research and development in this country but also to the education minister and the way in which he has handled his obligations as far as the school system is concerned. 
We in the Labor Party have announced a series of policies in this area, and I am pleased to see the endorsement of the Chief Scientist for the various positions we have taken up. We have said that, as far as we are concerned, the starting point, the first building block, of a knowledge nation is what is happening in our schools. We have announced a program of education priority zones to address those weaknesses, particularly in the government school area, which create a culture described by the Chief Scientist as not being conducive to the type of thinking we need in the science, engineering and technology areas. 
One of the reasons why we put down those education priority zones was the revelation that very large numbers of our students were being taught by teachers whose specialist background and whose skills were not in the subjects they were teaching. When the Chief Scientist got hold of that fact, he said that if there is not a love and knowledge of the discipline, but simply a teacher staying just ahead of the students that he or she is teaching, then the culture of knowledge in that area could not be imparted, that what students needed was teachers in love with their disciplines, capable of imparting excitement to the students in front of them. 
The propositions we have put forward are the sorts of propositions that he endorsed, specifically those that we have announced to encourage teacher education, both at the outset and during teachers' careers, to ensure that teachers are supported by government as they restructure their skills or establish those skills in the first case in the maths or science area—the basic building blocks—and to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers in the system who are capable of creating that culture about which the Chief Scientist is talking. 
The report goes beyond that, into the other areas of research and development, and the building blocks associated with research and development, which occur in the research institutions of our nation—the research institutions which are being defunded. It just so happened that the Chief Scientist came up with precisely the policy that we announced to double the number of post-doctoral fellowships in their various categories, enhancing, therefore, our scientific endeavour. He did not come up with a further idea we have had, but I am sure that he would approve of it—that is, how we keep the best brains in our country or bring them back if they happen to be overseas. There is now an obvious substantial brain drain from our universities in the science and technology areas as students find themselves unhappy with the scouring of our universities that has taken place over the last four years by this government. 
This is a massive indictment of the direction of government policy, and the Prime Minister cannot handle it. The Prime Minister sees national development in a 1950s context. He sees national development in terms of the monuments he leaves behind. He sees it in terms of one foot off the bus on the way to the golf course, `Where can I leave a monument behind me when I privatise Telstra, if I get away with that, that both perhaps bribes the community and is an appropriate edifice in my memory?'—his memory so firmly rooted in the middle parts of the last century. That is the Prime Minister's position. He cannot comprehend the facts. He has had at least four reports before him from his Innovation Council and from his Chief Scientist and the various white papers on research that have been put forward but not acted upon by his minister. He has had nothing whatsoever to say about any of those reports, except perhaps that what we ought to do is to start to look back at that monument building. He does not understand that it is how we mine the minds of our people this century that will determine whether or not we are successful.  
You can see it in the value of the dollar. Many factors determine the value of the dollar, but one of the critical factors happens to be this: we are not perceived on this globe as at the leading edge of the new economy. We are being judged on the old basis of Australian development. Therefore, as other countries look to us and work out what the value of our currency ought to be, at the back of their minds is this fear that we may well not be in this century a successful or relevant nation. That is what we have to deal with now. That is why we have done the unusual thing for an opposition of starting to put out very detailed policy in the education area, in the research and development area—
Dr Kemp interjecting—
—The fact that you have not been watching what we are doing is a matter of complete irrelevance. You have been asleep at the wheel for the last four years except in one area—your obsession. Having outlined the positive directions in which we wish to see this area go, I turn now to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is at the table. One of the problems of having an education minister like this minister at the table at this point of time is that his views on education represent his special obsession—a special obsession that has marked his life since he came to be responsible for education policy for the Liberal Party a melancholy decade ago. He put to his colleagues in the Liberal Party what his intentions were. His intentions were to take students out of the government school system and put them in the private school system and to adjust funding in a way that pursued that objective. That has been his obsession. 
Everything the minister says about literacy, everything he says about the positive programs that he believes ought to be pursued in this country, is nothing more than a cover for his basic objective. His basic objective has been the destruction of the public school system, the elevation of the most privileged elements of the private school system and the demonisation of those who are obliged to deliver education to our people. There has been no assistance for enhancing their skills, no assistance for ensuring that they are able to handle the new technologies of education, no assistance for the 300,000 people who are responsible for ensuring that the basic building blocks of our knowledge economy are strong and sound. He has not been assisting them, but demonising them. That is what he has been about. He has gone to the states, deprived them of resources and then said: `Achieve these objectives.' It is not a tactic to achieve those objectives; it is a tactic to blow a smokescreen across his true intentions—those intentions put in place a decade ago and now being implemented by him in detail.
The consequence of that, of course, is the sorts of devastating retention rates that we now see—retention rates going backwards. I was at a school in Victoria recently and there were many good features of the school, and I praised them. I talked about their retention rate of 80 per cent. In Australia that is a good retention rate against an average of 68. I then pointed out to those students that, if I were standing before a class or a school in Korea and talking about an 80 per cent retention rate, I would be addressing failure. If I were standing before a class in the United States and discussing an 80 per cent retention rate, I would be discussing failure. If I were standing before one in the UK, I would be discussing failure. If I were standing before one in Germany, I would be discussing failure. If I were standing before one in France, I would be discussing failure. It is the minister's job, along with those of his state counterparts—
—Why didn't you raise it to 80 per cent?
—My friend, in the early nineties in many parts of this country it got to well above 80. Then we had the state Liberal governments, augmented by a federal Liberal government, and we became uniquely the only country in the Western world that saw those retention rates going down—your unique achievement. And you have other unique achievements. Your other unique achievement is that we are the only country where public investment in education is going down. Your figures would look a great deal worse were it not for the fact that the adjustments that we put in place in 1993—that you have not yet interfered with—still flow through. 
I am going to have a great deal to say about these matters in this parliament over the course of the next year and a bit. This is the most important issue confronting our nation today. The fact that our political opponents cannot understand that—they still see this in the context of a private opportunity and not an opportunity for the development of our nation—is going to be the principal issue around which the next election campaign revolves. The problem for you, my friend, and your colleagues is that your record is already established and there is nothing you can do in the next year to turn it around. We have pride of authorship of our ideas but not ownership. We invite you to pinch them all, and we will top you again.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Knowledge Nation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1,speech
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—It is good to see the organ grinder at last fronting up rather than the monkey. The Leader of the Opposition really had to give this speech because he has to give an occasional speech about education. He shows no real knowledge or interest in it, but he has got himself locked into this concept, which he has never given any content to, of the knowledge nation. He could not ask the shadow minister for education to deliver a speech on it because he has excluded him from the committee to develop the policy. The member for Dobell is not a member of the opposition's knowledge nation committee—the shadow minister has been excluded. The knowledge nation is supposed to be so important, yet the shadow minister for education is not even a member of the committee to draft the policy we have not yet seen. The Leader of the Opposition had to get up—he has not got a shadow minister who can do the job—because he knows he has to give an occasional speech on education; otherwise he would have no credibility whatever. His credibility is already very low. When he was minister for education, he found that it was a very uninteresting portfolio and he developed extraordinarily little interest in it. In fact, he told his biographer Peter FitzSimmons when he was minister for education:
... I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had.
I suppose that is why this is one of the areas where he has achieved less in opposition. He has not achieved much anywhere but he has achieved less here than almost anywhere else. When he talks about his policies, let me just say that we would be happy to take any policies that he puts forward, but there have not been any policies worth taking at the moment. It is just empty rhetoric and occasional motherhood statements that nobody could disagree with. Fundamentally there have been no policies whatever. That is because he was, as the Australian said on 31 March 1993 when he was minister, `one of the most reluctant of education ministers—it is no secret that Beazley's intellectual interests lie elsewhere'. Helen Trinca told Peter FitzSimmons:
I was disappointed, as a journalist, that he didn't seem to be putting his whole heart and soul into the (education) portfolio.
The Financial Review wrote:
... there is a perception that Mr Beazley is not really interested in the employment, education and training portfolio ...
His biographer said:
He just didn't seem totally absorbed in his portfolio ...
The Sunday Age stated:
... the greatest ambition harboured by the highly relieved Beazley was a change in portfolio ...
That is the record in government of the Leader of the Opposition. We can dig deeper into this rhetoric. The Leader of the Opposition mouths this rhetoric about the tremendous importance of higher education. I agree that higher education is fundamentally important to Australia's future. That is why the number of students on campuses now is the highest it has ever been—40,000 more than when Labor was in office. That is why university revenues are higher now than they have ever been—about a billion dollars more than when Labor was in office; around $9 billion. That is why Australia's university investment in research and development continues to grow. In 1998, higher education research and development in Australia was estimated to be at $2,600 million at current prices, an increase of 13 per cent over 1996. As a result of this government's policies we are seeing rising participation rates in schools and growing participation in education, particularly by the age 15 to 24 cohort. On the most recent figures, about 55 per cent of the 15 to 24 cohort were in education or training compared with 49 per cent when we came to office. Our policies have actually lifted educational participation and lifted the research effort of our universities. In fact, I have just returned from leading a trade mission of senior university scientists and researchers to Israel. The Australians finished their trip with a great deal of satisfaction at the state of Australian science and research and its capacity to commercialise that research. 
The Leader of the Opposition had a distinctive view about the growth of participation in universities. Mr Beazley's record was that he gave up; he gave up on universities. He told the Age on 28 February 1992:
The desperation to get into higher education is really misplaced.
As minister in 1993, in a speech to the Centre for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Melbourne, he said:
I do not accept that it is the responsibility of government to meet all so-called unmet demand for higher education. Indeed, it would be irresponsible for a government to seek to do that.
The Australian reported, on 14 February 1992:
Mr Beazley said that Australia had unquestionably reached a point where people's expectations about entering university had to change. “You cannot provide universal higher education,” he said.
He said in the speech to the Centre for the Study of Higher Education:
We are approaching the limits of our capacity to continue to expand publicly funded university places.
That was in 1993. This government has lifted them 40,000 above the point where they were when we came into office. As if that was not enough, he told the Australian on 25 October 1993:
We're going to have to cap university expansion. We've got too many universities in this country. We don't need any more.
That is the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who gets up here and mouths these motherhood statements, without policy content, about the significance of universities for Australia's future. The Leader of the Opposition has the most abysmal record of any minister for education and training since the Second World War. He is a man who when in office totally neglected the 70 per cent of young Australians who do not go from school to university. He had no interest whatever in the promotion of studies for those young students to meet their skills. And everybody on the Labor side admitted it. 
Peter Baldwin, the former Labor member for Sydney, said in his lighthouse speech, `That was something we just didn't do enough about when we were in office.' It was clearly admitted. John Dawkins said exactly the same thing: `It was one of our big gaps.' It was still a big gap in Kim Beazley's speech in Hobart. He did not even mention these people. He does not know anything about it. He does not know what is happening out there—the revolution that is going on in the senior years of schooling as a result of this government's policies. Indeed, he is astonished when he finds out what is going on. In a recent visit to Lyndhurst Secondary College during, presumably, the campaign for the Isaacs by-election, he was immensely impressed with what he found. He said in a press release:
Lyndhurst Secondary College now has a year 12 retention rate of 80 per cent and a tertiary entrance rate of 62 per cent. It is a great example of what can be achieved when schools, governments and communities work together to solve a problem.
These are our policies that he is talking about. He called a press conference to praise our policies. These are the policies—the Jobs Pathway program, the Full Service Schools program, the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. This is the consequence of linking 30,000 businesses with Australian schools over the last four years to make sure that young Australians have relevant skills that are going to lead them through to jobs. The Leader of the Opposition is actually stealing our policies. He has offered us the opportunity to steal his and we would be happy to pick them up, if there were any, if they were any good. They probably will not be, so we probably will not steal them. But anyway it is a kind offer on his part. This is the first opposition in history which is stealing the government's policies. They are already implemented and he is calling a press conferences to praise them. On some matters the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely right. Our policies are working and they are giving students the skills that they need. 
When the Leader of the Opposition was education minister, the issue of literacy was still of some interest to people. But there were surveys coming through showing that there was a massive problem. What did he do about these surveys? He sat on them; he suppressed them. The Australian Education Union—as we know, it writes the Australian Labor Party's education policies and writes all their rhetoric, which is mouthed duly and obediently by people such as the member for Dobell—did not want these surveys published because they showed a problem. Kim Beazley decided that the best way to deal with this problem was to hide it, to brush it under the carpet and hope that nobody would notice. It was only after the change of government that these surveys were finally published, at my direction as minister. We found that 30 per cent of young people in year 9, 14-year-olds, could not read and write properly. These were the young people who were leaving school early and falling into the unemployment queues and becoming long-term unemployed.
The Labor Party is a party which bleats constantly about equity, fairness and social justice. Where was the equity, fairness and social justice in refusing to acknowledge this problem and doing something about it? When I became minister for education I found that, over the entire 13 years of Labor, not a single study had ever been done to assess what was the best way to teach young people to read and write—no evaluation of methods to teach literacy skills. When the National English Literacy Survey was undertaken by us in our first year of government, it confirmed that this problem that had become apparent at year 9 began at year 3—in fact, it began at year 1; it was already very evident at year 3. So we put in place the first national literacy standards ever. They were opposed by the Australian Education Union. They have never been endorsed by the Labor Party—
—Absolute rubbish!
 (Mr Nehl)—Order!
—The Labor Party knows that the Australian Education Union does not like these assessments, because these assessments can show that there is a problem in the schools that needs to be rectified and some people might think that teachers need more skills in order to address these problems. As part of our whole package to lift these skills and opportunities for young Australians, we put in place—contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition says—a $77 million quality teaching program, to teach teachers—
—To teach them how to—
—No, this follows on from—
—That is absolutely wrong—professional development started from year 1 of the national literacy plan.
—Oh, it's part of literacy funding, is it?
—It is part of the literacy funding.
—Order! The member for Dobell will be silent and the minister will ignore his interjections.
—So it is to go to teach teachers to address the needs of young people who need these skills. This is already in place. We are doing this, and the Labor Party is just thinking about it. Kim Beazley is saying this needs to be done. Perhaps if he visited another school after Lyndhurst Secondary College—and maybe the member for Dobell can arrange another visit to a school for the Leader of the Opposition—he will discover that this is already going on and that these skills are actually being taught to teachers now. 
—The member for Dobell is pushing it.
—We have in this Leader of the Opposition a former minister who simply does not understand education—
—Hear, hear!
—The member for Moreton should be silent.
—who has no interest in it, who is wrong in almost everything he says about it and who, worst of all, has betrayed, year after year, the young people in this country who are most disadvantaged, particularly the 70 per cent of young indigenous Australians who could not read or write after 13 years of Labor. We have acted to help them. The Labor Party has no claims to be a social justice party because it has never been concerned with educational outcomes. We are, we have put in place the policies to achieve those outcomes, and that is why Australians see this government as the first government for quite a long time to really address the educational needs of this country.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Knowledge Nation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1,speech
"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Governments are responsible not just for Australia's wellbeing today or tomorrow but for Australia's wellbeing in the coming years and decades. There can be no doubt that the government is ignoring that responsibility, that it is failing in its duty to care. It is failing in its duty to look after the future wellbeing of our young people and our children. They are the ones that will suffer the consequences of this government's neglect and its failure to adequately resource the infrastructure that will guarantee them a future.
The government's insistence on ignoring the value of education and research and development will hurt Australia for generations to come. From its very first days in government, the Howard government mounted a relentless attack on our R&D capacity, with cuts to R&D expenditure for the public sector agencies, a reduction in the major research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and by making the position of chief scientist part time. There could not have been a stronger message sent to the community that this government had a minimal commitment to the development of science and technology. Since then, however, things have got worse and worse.
It is a shocking indictment of this government that business expenditure on research and development has fallen every year since it came to office. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 29 August revealed that Australia has registered the worst percentage decline of the 17 OECD countries listed. This is at a time when other countries, including Japan, the United States and most of the countries of the European Union, have been steadily increasing their commitment to research and development as a percentage of GDP. The 10 per cent fall in gross expenditure on research and development is a damning indictment of a government that is holding back Australia's science and innovation based industries. This government's failure to encourage research and development is an attack on our future, particularly on the future of our young people. At a time when other developed nations can see the importance of supporting and encouraging the business and industries that are at the forefront of technological change, this government does less than nothing: this government actively discourages progress.
Why is this government acting to slow down the creation of the high skilled, high waged jobs that Australia desperately needs to compete in the new economy? The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, has admitted that his government's decision to cut the research and development tax concession in 1996 has been disastrous. He tells us that he will announce a strategy in 12 months to address the issue—12 months time. The chief scientist's report, to which my leader has just referred, underlines very clearly the strong link between research, innovation and growth. At a time when the only constant we know is change, our national wealth, the creation of new jobs and the hopes of our young people are entirely dependent on a reasonable level of expenditure on science and technology, on innovation and on education in science and technology. 
I suspect that part of the problem is that the Prime Minister just does not understand what progress means and is afraid of what he does not understand. He lives in another world—a world gone by where major technological innovations happened rarely and change was slow enough for him to cope with. He does not understand that this government is neglecting its responsibility to young Australians. He does not need to worry about their future; he has had the career he wanted. Doubtless he will write his memoirs in comfort, congratulating himself on his achievements. But if he goes outside his privileged world he will find thousands and thousands of Australians who were young when he was in office and who were deprived of the chance to work in the industries of the 21st century because this government did nothing to encourage research, development and innovation.
The critical element is not only the immediacy of research and development but the future of young people in our schools today. This government when it was elected boasted that it was for all Australians. Now we know what it means by all Australians, or perhaps rather what it does not mean by all Australians. It certainly does not include the 70 per cent of children in government schools, because we have all read the memo where Dr Kemp wanted to encourage children away from government schools. It does not mean the 32,000 disabled children in secondary schools. How pathetically mean to withdraw $3 million over the next four years from this vulnerable group. And it does not include the children who live in rural Australia, who need support in their education. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has muddied education policy with his mantra of freedom of maximum choice for people. In fact, he has bored this parliament and the media into submission. As the Age editorial of 24 August stated, it is time for this minister to forget his silly rhetoric for choice and to meet his obligations as the minister to develop policy for the future needs of this nation.
On Wednesday during question time the minister introduced a new mantra—obviously he has got bored too with the old one. The new mantra is: freedom and equity—fairness. But how can we take this mantra any more seriously than the old one? We know freedom of maximum choice was nothing more than code for, `If you don't have the ability to pay, you don't get the service.' We on this side of the House think that when the minister talks about freedom and equity he still really means, `If you don't have the money, you won't get the service.' How else can you possibly justify increasing the subsidies of the wealthiest 62 category 1 schools by $50 million, yet by his use of the enrolment benchmark adjustment reducing funding to government schools, even though their enrolments are increasing by a similar amount? The very idea that you can blur the public-private divide and create a single market in education is unworkable. Isn't it a sad indictment of this government that compulsory education is seen as a market? They just cannot help themselves. Everything has to be seen as a business. We have to make money out of everything. Wouldn't we rather that the business of the government was the goal of ensuring that each child has access to free, good quality education that is going to lead them to work and a feeling that they have a contribution to make to our community? That is the goal I want my government to have. I do not want it to be a business. There is no point in the minister for education testing our children to see if they are literate and then criticising the teachers and saying they are failing. The government needs to make a genuine commitment to making sure that the schools have the resources they need to ensure that our students get the results that they need. 
Labor has the policy answers to solve the problems created by this government. We will increase public investment in schools. We will increase investment in tertiary education and research and development. One of the initiatives will be the education priority zones. These will help local communities work with the Commonwealth government to solve the problems they are having. Education has always been seen by the Australian Labor Party as the means by which all people, regardless of wealth, are given the way to establish fulfilling and meaningful employment. In 1996 this government introduced the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment Scheme. This takes money from the state schools when the proportion of private enrolments increases, even when our public system is growing. It is unfair and we will abolish it. We will reinvest those funds in government schools. We are committed to increasing the number of research fellowships for Australian researchers. We will ensure that researchers have the opportunities they need and deserve at home. 
—You can protest, but you are messing up our country. The government have failed to meet the demands of the time. They will stand condemned for their lack of commitment to supporting education and their destruction of the research and development capacity of Australian industry. The real answer is a Beazley government.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Knowledge Nation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—I am delighted to stand here today and respond to the matter of public importance the member for Dobell chose not to—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would like the honourable member to withdraw the comment he made just a little while ago across the chamber that I was a spiv. I think that is unparliamentary and he should be asked to withdraw.
—I withdraw all reference to him as a spiv and I will continue my contribution.
The matter of public importance today seeks to break new thresholds in irrelevance in terms of what is actually put before this parliament. Fortunately, there is not an obligation on those that submit it to actually have some relevance of proof or fact to their claims. There is a notion in here that there has not been action taken to advance our national interest, particularly when it comes to developing knowledge, opportunities that stem from it and our longer term capacity. It is also interesting that at the end of the day the Leader of the Opposition's emphasis is on our standing as a knowledge nation—not what we achieve, not what we do, not anything about the opportunities that are made available to our citizens but just how someone might see us. That gives you an insight into what this is all about. The motion is empty politicking. 
It is a further example of what the Treasurer spoke of today where the opposition are in stunt land. They say they are in tax planning land, that they are not in stunt land any longer. I reckon the knowledge nation claim is part of that barren place they have been, with poll driven antics and empty sloganeering. What is this place, the knowledge nation that the Labor Party talks about? Have you heard them talk about ideas? No, you have not heard them talk about ideas. Have you heard them talk about policy? You have not heard them talk about policy other than those hot ones that have been borrowed without consent from other parties that have actually developed the ideas. They are barren of commitment. You look at the commitment itself and even at the SES arrangements for funding. Isn't it interesting that the shadow minister has not consulted the member for Isaacs? The member for Isaacs could tell you something about the SES and why the school community she was a part of thought it was such a good idea. Maybe you should consult and get some insights into what choice in education is about and what role that plays in supporting parents and young people developing the tools and the building blocks so that they can participate in this country.
Look at what the Leader of the Opposition is on about—it gives you an insight into what is really going on when we talk about the Leader of the Opposition and his commitment to the knowledge nation. The Leader of the Opposition has said that being minister for education was one of the most uninteresting experiences he has had. The biography written about him shares with us some of his views and interests, and there are some fascinating quotes. It is helpful to be reminded of them:
... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio—
being education— 
than just about any I have had.
It gives you an idea why the slogan of `knowledge nation' is empty—because the Leader of the Opposition's heart is not in it. He said that it was a portfolio in which there was less capacity to achieve. That was his view. You look at the policy platform and you wonder why it is empty of ideas; it is empty of commitment. There are other references to the now Leader of the Opposition. He is referred to in the Australian on 3 March 1993 as `one of the most reluctant of education ministers'.
Opposition members interjecting—
—It is great to see the members opposite warming up for the footy on the weekend, warming up for a bit of cheering at the AFL Grand Final on the weekend. The shadow education minister is at the table. He has missed out on making a contribution to this debate today because it is recognised that he has nothing to add. He could not crack it for a guernsey on the Labor Party's task force on the knowledge nation, and now he seeks to throw personal vitriol at me for highlighting his inadequacies. I thought you might have got a run off the interchange bench today—one day, perhaps. Let us push on. Why is there this task force? The Leader of the Opposition talks about his visit to the Lyndhurst Secondary College, about what a sensational school the Lyndhurst Secondary College is. Do you know why it is so sensational? It reflects the coalition government's policies. These things do not happen just by chance. These things do not happen by running around with slogans like `knowledge nation' and hoping that there will be some osmosis and that people will think, `That's what we're on about it; let's go and do it.' It actually takes a bit of thinking. It takes a bit of policy insight. It takes a commitment to making sure that you can put in place the programs that will make a difference.
The member at the table was talking before about my background and my personal characteristics. I am happy to share those with people. I went to a secondary college that was a disadvantaged school. That is right: I went to one of those schools. I know a bit about how it works. I know how that policy operated on the ground, and I am happy to share that with the member for Dobell after he has consulted the member for Isaacs about why the SES funding arrangement is a good thing in her mind and why the Labor Party should get behind it. One of the things that the Labor Party seems to miss is that if you do not have the basic tools of a basic education you cannot participate in further opportunities. Three-quarters of young people leaving secondary colleges in this country are not going on to university, and all Labor wants to talk about is university. What is wrong with the three-quarters of our population that do not choose that pathway? Are they somehow less capable of contributing to our country? Absolutely not. They are the people who are in small businesses and trades, making a very meaningful contribution, driving innovation, putting their life efforts behind it. Are they not deserving of recognition? I think they are. Those people out there in small businesses and vocational trades are making a go of their lives, but you do not hear any discussion about them in the Leader of the Opposition's contribution. It is all about universities. If you leave the secondary college and you do not have the basic tools of being able to read and write—
Opposition members interjecting—
—You can shout like you're at the footy—congratulations! If you do not have the basic tools of being able to read and write, how can you then go on to further training and development opportunities? This highlights the absolute hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue—talking about the building blocks of the knowledge nation and then denying individuals an opportunity to gain basic skills and competencies that will allow them to participate in the economic opportunities that we have.
You talk about the record of the coalition government. I think that that is a terrific thing to talk about, frankly. Look at what is going on and you will see an increase in Commonwealth outlays to education—not a cut. This is the great fallacy we hear from those opposite, particularly the newer members. When your colleagues in the Labor Party talk about a cut in education, do you know what they are talking about? They are talking about what we have been able to provide compared with some fallacious, fantasy forward estimates from the Labor Party built on the assumption of a surplus—estimates that actually deliver a $10 billion deficit. How can you compare what we are doing with some midnight dreaming from the ALP, a party that could not balance the budget in a growth period of our economy? The Labor Party calls it a cut, but regular people look at the sums and see it differently. They look at the numbers: in 1995-96 there was $9.4 billion going into education. What is it now? Now there is $11.1 billion going into education. Most regular people think $11.1 billion is more than $9.4 billion—it is an increase. When one number is bigger than the other, that is an increase. It is not a cut; it is an increase. I am happy to go through that again slowly! 
Look at the breakdown of figures in public school funding. There was an 18 per cent increase in 1994. An increase is not a cut; an increase means more—18 per cent more in this case. Look at other areas. Government schools are receiving an extra $1.4 billion over the next four years compared to the last four-year funding period. Look at the resources that have gone into the national literacy plan, helping to test 30 per cent of Australian schoolchildren so that as they go through those early years of their education they learn to read and write. The ability to read and the ability to write are basic tools if you want to engage in any sort of economy. If you are serious about the knowledge nation, you have to make sure that there are the basic tools with which to enter into our economy and our society—but that is something that was not of interest to the Labor Party. We have doubled the number of people that are in new apprenticeships. Apprentices are fine, talented, gifted people—some of them not necessarily academically minded but they are talented people nonetheless—able to make a contribution to our economy. There are 264,000 new apprentices in training as of the middle of this year, picking up the numbers from a 30-year low bequeathed to us by the ALP. What is it you have against people with vocational skills? Don't you recognise the contribution they can make to communities right around our country and the innovation that goes on in smaller businesses, often driven by people who have not gone to university, because they are out there every day toiling with new ideas and new insights?
—Many in Dunkley.
—A great place. What happened at the national ALP conference down there in Tasmania? I do not know whether there was a lot of  practice shouting for the footy going on; one thing that was not going on was any discussion about IT. What happened on the day when information technology and communications were to be discussed? There were 14 sessions on the agenda, and the ALP had 17 federal shadow ministers supposedly talking about policy, but when it came to information technology and communications what was the offering? Enjoying life: arts, culture and heritage. Anything about IT? Anything about communications? Anything about the biggest revolution going on in our world? Nothing. They got to talk about arts, culture and heritage. Important as that is, what about talking about something that we all know is transforming our lives? In the electorate of Dunkley, we are having an e-commerce expo. We are showing what can be done, supporting our community and doing real things, not just flapping our gums like you guys.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed ABC Perth Accommodation Project, East Perth, Western Australia.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation proposes to construct new office accommodation and studio facilities in East Perth. The ABC is seeking to consolidate and improve its Perth accommodation in a way that meets its organisational and strategic objectives. These objectives include: addressing the particular problems and inefficiencies relating to its existing accommodation in Perth; generating revenue for the ABC's digital conversion program; restructuring of the corporation into a content led organisation capable of meeting the challenges of a changing media environment; and maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation. The proposed development will replace inadequate buildings and facilities at 191 Adelaide Terrace in Perth, with accommodation at East Perth that is up to date, functional, safe, compliant and designed to maximise efficiency, output and creativity. 
Many of the buildings on the Adelaide Terrace site are in a poor state of repair and are inappropriate for the functions they contain. Analysis has shown that it would not be cost effective or practical to rehabilitate and maintain this inefficient and unserviceable accommodation to modern standards and, in property terms, the current ABC occupation represents a gross underutilisation of the development potential of this prime near-CBD site. This development proposal involves the purchase of a new site at East Perth from the East Perth Redevelopment Authority, the construction of new facilities and the sale of the existing ABC Adelaide Terrace site.
The broadcasting industry is currently undergoing a major transformation with the advent of digital broadcasting. This project will provide the ABC with the facilities required for digital production and transmission, including facilities suitable for both wide-screen standard definition television and high definition television production. This project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ABC in a number of ways, such as property rationalisation, which will generate revenue to support the digital conversion program of the ABC; production will become more efficient through appropriate building layout, physical proximity and custom-design facilities; enhanced opportunities for cross-media content development and program research will support the generation and re-versioning of content for new services; and integrated technical support and archives facilities that are easily accessible by staff will improve efficiency and contribute to the range and depth of output.
The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $28.5 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in March 2001, with completion and occupancy by December 2002. I commend the motion to the House.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—When the earlier debate on this bill was adjourned, I was lauding the member for Corangamite for his love of Geelong wines and I was discussing the potential of the wine industry in the Geelong region. I know the honourable member for Corangamite has not been offended by the remarks I was making because he slipped me a note during question time on the matters we had under discussion. I think he slipped me the note because honourable members might not know that he is a marathon man, a marathon runner, and he wants to get his times out into the public arena. He chided me for not mentioning the fantastic half marathon he ran from Corop to Warrnambool in two hours and three minutes. All I can say to the honourable member is that we know he loves Geelong wines. He juices up in Corio, he psyches himself up as he drives through Corangamite and then, of course, he runs like a tortoise in Wannon. I have to say to the honourable member: `We want you down in Geelong to sample our fine reds and whites.'
We have a wine industry that is really showing great potential in the region and we acknowledge the constraints on it. We do have a wine community in the seat of Corio. The urban areas are in a sense encroaching on some of the good production lands around Geelong but, with careful planning, we can cater for both the needs of the urban environment and the needs of this very important industry in the region. Another constraint on the industry is, of course, the adequacy of the water supply. Many members might not know that, in the Geelong region, we have had some three years of water restrictions. This is a potential constraint on a very important and growing wine industry in the region. In the last 12 months we have seen the industry coming together, the winemakers coming together, with the City of Geelong and with the tourist authority in Geelong to better promote Geelong wines. We are seeing that, with good planning at the local level, we are getting a very important growth in this excellent industry for Geelong.
So, in my concluding remarks on this particular piece of legislation, let me say that we have put this second reading amendment on the quarantine aspects to give members an opportunity to debate what we think is a very important issue for Australian agriculture, and indeed for Australia generally—that is, the efficiency and the professionalism of our quarantine service and whether it is being adequately resourced by this government. I did mention in the debate earlier today that the government would define `adequate resourcing' as not taking away money from AQIS and from the quarantine task—that is, it may well have maintained expenditures over the period it has been in office and it might well argue that it has not subjected this particular area to the types of savage cutbacks we have seen in other areas. 
The point I was making in that debate is the fact that, over the life of this coalition, our trading performance has grown, as it did under Labor. I do not hide that fact. I am not here to say that just because a coalition government is in power this country is not exporting or that there has been no growth in exports. But certainly we saw over the Labor years, and we are seeing now, reasonably good export performances from our industrial base, from our economy, and, of course, with that and with the growth in imports comes increasing pressure on the quarantine task. Therefore, along with the massive movements of people in and out of Australia and within Australia and, of course, the responsibilities we now assume under the WTO, we would have expected a significant increase in expenditure on the quarantine task. I have moved the amendment but, at the end of the day, we will not be opposing this piece of legislation.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! Is the amendment seconded?

"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—It is always interesting to rise in this House after the member for Corio and put straight some of the propositions that he puts in the area of agriculture. I note that the Labor Party do not have anyone who has any knowledge of agricultural industries on their side. The member for Corio claims that he was born on a dairy farm, but I think he soon found that the union movement was more comfortable and a better career for him than milking cows. I will not pad out 30 minutes as the member for Corio has done, because the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is rather simple legislation. I think the very fact that he has moved a frivolous amendment to this bill to enable him to go on at some length on issues that were not relevant really shows that he does not understand this very much at all.
Rather than putting forward an amendment which suggests that AQIS is not doing its job in Australia, the honourable member for Corio should admit that AQIS has done an exceptional job in the areas it covers. I agree with him when he says that quarantine is a very important area in Australia, particularly for many of our industries. Our isolation ensures that we do not have some of the world's great pests and diseases; therefore, we are very keen to try to keep this country free from them. He also made reference to the honourable member for Leichhardt, who was in the chamber at the time. The honourable member for Leichhardt would be well aware that a couple of years ago an exotic fruit fly entered Australia, near Cairns in North Queensland. AQIS did a great job in eliminating that pest from Australia. I know of at least two occasions when the Mediterranean fruit fly entered Australia through the Kununurra district in Western Australia. AQIS did a great job in cleaning up that exotic fruit fly.
The member for Corio is being very unfair in suggesting that AQIS is not doing its job. I believe it has done a good job. I suppose that agricultural industries believe that it is a little too strong at times. It is criticised because of our commitments to the world trade agreement, which means it has to make assessments on whether imports can come into this country. We all know that industries prefer not to have competition, and therefore the organisation does come under some criticism. Criticism is reasonable if it is fair, but we have a commitment. It was not this government that signed the world trade agreement, but it was signed by Australia and has to be honoured. Therefore, sometimes the decisions that AQIS has to make in these areas of trade are not totally supported by some industries.
These amendments are rather simple and try to streamline the areas where AQIS works. Getting some modern technology involved where products imported into this country have to be assessed by AQIS will hopefully make it cheaper. That, surely, is something that we should be applauding. Extra powers have been given to AQIS in these areas, particularly in relation to exotic insects that may come into this country. It will have extra powers to search and destroy. Having been a minister for forestry in New South Wales, I am well aware of some of the insects that can come into this country and have devastating effects on our exotic forests and our pine forests. It is important that these pests be kept out of this country. 
The honourable member for Corio talked about Australian trade and how it is growing, and it is growing commendably. He talked at length about the wine industry, which has done a magnificent job in the last few years in gaining markets, particularly in Europe, under very strong competition. Those industries are able to do that because they have the support of the Australian government. They have confidence that they are protected by measures in this bill, and that exotic diseases and pests cannot get into this country and decimate industries.
During the parliamentary break, I visited Argentina. If anyone wants some knowledge of what foot-and-mouth disease can do in the cattle industry, it is worth a trip to see those countries that have had to put up with that disease for many years. While I was in Argentina, they declared themselves free of foot-and-mouth. It had taken them years to do it with inoculations. Sadly, I was no sooner back in Australia than there had been another outbreak of foot-and-mouth in Argentina. That means that that country cannot export to world markets, which is a very big detriment to its trade. Australia needs to be able to trade in agricultural products, and we know how important they are to this country. I think that brings home to us how important it is to have the protections that we have in our agricultural industries.
The second part of the bill is very simple. I know the member for Corio said that the government should have got it right in the first place. I have probably been around parliaments in Australia a little longer than the member for Corio, and I recall quite often legislation being amended in a small way because it was not working exactly as it was intended. Thank goodness that, if parliaments can see that legislation is not working the way it was intended, they can quickly rectify it so the original intention of the legislation can be carried through. I support the bill. I think it is a very simple bill. It is obviously bringing into place legislation that will help in the protection of industries in this country and make our quarantine services more effective.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is an important bill, and I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. As has been mentioned by the member for Corio, if we get the provisions of AQIS wrong it has huge repercussions for areas such as the McMillan electorate and other regional seats right across Australia. We do not want to see an outbreak of Newcastle disease, which would damage the chicken industry. We do not want to see foot-and-mouth disease in Australia, which would damage the beef industry. We do not want to see any disease introduced into Australia which has the potential to undermine the good work being done by the many rural industries which people in regional communities so heavily depend upon.
In considering the performance of AQIS, I urge members to at all times run the rule of commonsense over decisions. I have had conversations about AQIS with abattoirs in my electorate and about some of the hardness AQIS applies to circumstances the abattoirs often face. We do need AQIS to be a thorough, strong and accountable authority, but I do not think anyone in this chamber or in Australia more generally would want to see the compliance requirements of AQIS so rigidly enforced that companies in rural areas such as my electorate are forced to go to the wall as a result of complying with its requirements. I make that point whilst we are talking about AQIS and its performance because I do not think it is something which we should allow ourselves to lose sight of.
I want to talk a little bit today about an industry which is particularly important to my constituency, the seed potato industry. It is an important employer in West Gippsland generally and across the entire Gippsland region, but in particular it is an important employer in the town of Thorpdale in the south of my constituency. To give you an idea of how important an employer the potato industry is in Thorpdale, I can recount to you a time when I went to the Thorpdale Primary School for the first time as a member of parliament. I asked the children in the group that I was addressing, which was made up of grade 5 and grade 6 students, how many of them had parents who worked in the potato industry. Every kid except one in the class put their hand up, and it turned out that that one student was the son of one of the schoolteachers. We should not understate the importance of the potato industry to small towns like Thorpdale which have depended, and still depend, very heavily on the potato industry for their livelihood. 
Over the years there have been substantial efforts made by people in the seed potato industry in particular to value add and to export. These are all things which we, as parliamentarians, encourage, and what people universally agree need to be done in terms of Australia's rural industries. We want to see more value adding. We want to see more export of our primary produce. That is what they have done and the success they have had is a tribute to them.
I would point to some statistics which have been provided to me by Seed Potatoes Victoria, the peak body representing seed potato growers right across the state of Victoria. They have kindly provided me with this graph which shows that in 1993 some $223,000 worth of seed potato was exported compared with, in 1999, $2.9 million worth of seed potato exports. You can see very clearly from this graph that the industry has been experiencing some success in its efforts to export its product, namely, the seed potato. 
That is the sort of thing we need to encourage. That is the sort of thing we need to get behind, because towns like Thorpdale need to have an industry which it is dependent on, which is not stagnating, which is not going backwards and which is not harking back to the golden days of the 1940s or the 1950s but which is actually growing its product, value adding to its product and exporting its product, in particular to Asia. This is the sort of thing we need to get behind.
It is worth noting the percentage of seed potato exports as a proportion of total potato exports for the industry over that period. Once again Seed Potatoes Victoria has kindly provided me with two graphs which demonstrate this information. The graphs illustrate that, in 1993, $223,000 worth of seed potatoes were exported compared with $4.2 million worth of total potato exports. In 1999 that had grown to $2.9 million worth of seed potatoes exported compared with $13.189 million of normal potato exports, I guess we would call them. So you can see that not only has the amount of seed potato exported grown but as a proportion of all potato exports over that period it has grown as well.
The reason that I mention this information is not only to inform the House of a great success story in terms of the value adding and export of an Australian primary product but also to highlight the risk to the seed potato industry which has been created by, of all things, the goods and services tax. I have here a letter which I will read out in part to the House. This is a letter from Seed Potatoes Victoria and written by the executive officer, Tony Pitt. The imposition of GST on seed potatoes but not on normal potatoes has the potential to be a significant problem for the industry and to substantially undermine the industry and the good work which they have been doing. This is a letter which he has written to the Australian Taxation Office. His letter was prompted by a decision of the Australian Taxation Office to reverse the goods and services tax status of seed potatoes to be no longer GST free. He says in his letter:
This is a decision which will undermine the work of the last 60 years to develop a certification system for potatoes, a system that has benefited both the industry and consumers.
He goes on:
It is an extremely competitive marketplace and potatoes are traded in a variety of different ways. A certified seed crop is differentiated from other potato crops in that it has followed a system of management protocols and crop health checks determined by the certification authority. When harvested, the potatoes are visually no different from any other potatoes of the same variety but they are able to be labelled as certified seed and generally attract a premium price if sold for seed purposes. 
This is the value adding that I was talking about, not just putting them in the ground and then flogging them off without any sort of thinking in terms of value adding going on. They are actually working to a management plan which is so strict that it is accredited, and that allows them to charge a premium price for their product. As I said before, this is something which we need to encourage, not discourage.
Mr Pitt's letter is quite long. I do not want to read it all out—I do not think I will have time—but he does go on in his letter to say: 
The impost of a 10 per cent goods and services tax on potatoes sold with certification labels will clearly drive buyers towards other products. Some of this will be to unlabelled seed and some will be to potatoes not produced within certification protocols.
He also states what he sees as being some of the likely repercussions of this action taken by the federal government. He says:
The result will not be in the interests of the potato industry, the consumers or Australia as a whole. It may be a worst case scenario, but I can visualise the following as likely repercussions of the decision ...
He then made quite a few dot points in his letter. I might just get to those which most poignantly illustrate the point: `the certification system collapses due to financial constraints', `private certification schemes will probably develop to replace the current scheme'—although there is some concern as to the effectiveness of those and whether or not there will be the same trust associated with them as is the case with the current scheme—`export trade and certified seed collapses because importing countries will not recognise the integrity of privately run schemes' and `the work done in developing a certification scheme in potatoes for the past 60 years is lost as personnel and expertise leave to find other areas of employment'. The last point he makes is `consumers suffer in the long term as disease levels rise again in potato districts and quality and farm productivity decline'. They are the points made by Seed Potatoes Victoria—the peak authority for seed potato growers in the state of Victoria—about the imposition of the GST on their industry. 
It is important to note that in May of this year Seed Potatoes Victoria had a ruling from the Australian Taxation Office saying that seed potatoes would be GST free. In June there was a reversal of that decision. That meant that the previous advice was no longer current, and they had prepared on the basis of that previous advice. Many people in the industry—as has been illustrated by this letter—have some very grave concerns about the impact of the GST on seed potatoes and what it will mean for their certification process, which they have worked long and hard for some 50 or 60 years to get up and running and to have as a real success story. And it is a real success story. They are exporting more than ever and they have been able to get into some of those tough markets in Asia as well, and it is really to their credit.
I note that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is at the table, and I appreciate him being a part of this debate. I would again urge the minister to use whatever power he has to overturn that decision in relation to the GST status of seed potatoes, so that the industry can continue its success, continue to build on its export successes and actually develop the potential that so many of us have seen in the potato industry for quite a few years. I urge the minister, in the best bipartisan tradition of this place, to please take that consideration seriously and perhaps, if he sees fit, report back to the House at some point in the future.
The reason I mention the seed potato industry in particular in relation to this bill is that people in the seed potato industry have raised with me a concern that they have in relation to potato cyst nematode—PCN. I have written to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in relation to this matter. I have his correspondence here which I will mention at least in part. The minister responded on 29 June to my correspondence which I sent on 30 May, and I appreciate the considered letter that he wrote in response. I advise the minister that, to the best of my knowledge—even though this was a considered response from him to me in relation to a serious issue—there has still been precious little progress made in relation to the concerns which seed potato growers in Victoria have about artificial trade barriers between Victoria and other states being created by state administrations refusing to admit that PCN in Victoria is now completely eradicated and no longer a problem. This is a serious issue. The Constitution of Australia does require that there be no trade barriers between states. I fear that we have state administrations in Australia using PCN as a reason to basically stop competition from the very efficient and very productive seed potato growers in Victoria, in particular in Thorpdale. 
—Talk to your mate David Lewellyn in Tasmania.
—The minister tells me to speak to my colleagues. I can assure him that I have done and will do. But I would make the point that the intervention of the minister on behalf of these people would be gratefully welcomed. If the minister were interested in coming to my constituency to meet with these people, I would be very pleased to organise that for him. This is a serious issue. When you are talking about towns like Thorpdale where, as I mentioned before, all the mums and dads are employed in the potato industry, you cannot afford to let an issue like this go without the government attention it deserves.
There are two government issues affecting the industry. The first issue is the imposition of the GST, which is going to, in my view and in the view of Seed Potatoes Victoria, drive people away from the certified product to the non-certified product, which will lead to the destruction of all the good work they have done. The second issue is the establishment of the artificial trade barriers, as I described them, on the very flimsy basis of a PCN problem in Victoria. I think we owe it to the people of Thorpdale and of West Gippsland generally, who depend on this industry, to come up with an appropriate public policy response to the very serious problem which confronts their towns. 
I would point out again—and I do not think we should ever lose sight of this—that, if left to their own devices, the seed potato industry in Victoria would be going great guns. It really seems that it is only government regulation that is standing in their way. I do not think it is a good thing for us to lose sight of that or to be flippant about it. The two things which stand in their way are the establishment by government of these artificial trade barriers and the GST imposed by government. We really owe it to them to not shackle them or stand in the way of their progress in terms of developing export markets, particularly those in Asia. They have done good work. They have been productive. They have been forward thinking. We really need to reward that work rather than punish them by forcing them to endure all sorts of government red tape and bureaucratisation of their industry. As I said, we need to be always conscious of the need to free up these industries rather than restrict them through unnecessary administration costs and charges and all the rest of those things which stand in the way of their progress.
 I conclude by thanking my colleague the member for Corio for his interest in this issue. The member for Corio has been down to my constituency on a number of occasions to meet with potato growers on this issue, and he has been able to provide good advice and be an effective voice for their concerns. I place on record my thanks to the member for Corio for his interest in this area, and I know that it is ongoing. Again I extend a sincere invitation to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is at the table, to come and meet with potato growers in my district so that he might see and hear at first-hand the concerns which they have in relation to this industry. If his timetable does not allow that, he might consider requesting a response from his department on some of the concerns which I have addressed in my remarks today in relation to both PCN and the establishment of the artificial trade barriers, which I do not think anyone in this House thinks are appropriate. In Australia we need to do something in a bipartisan way to fix them.  
We also need to look at the imposition of the GST on seed potatoes but not on normal potatoes, which I think is an anomaly. I do not think it was a situation that could ever have been imagined when the GST legislation was drafted. I challenge anyone to point out the difference between a sack of spuds that are seed potatoes and another sack of spuds that are not seed potatoes. To avoid the cost, the additional 10 per cent GST which they will have to apply, people will start saying that seed potatoes are not seed potatoes, so all the good work in terms of certification will actually be for nothing because there is an additional 10 per cent fee attached to them. So the market will be distorted, if you like, by the impact of the GST, and that is not a good thing. We do not want to see that. That is the sort of product that we want to encourage because it is a certified product and a certified product leads to less risk of PCN in the future. These are the types of things we want to encourage. 
In the last few seconds I have left, I invite the minister to ask a senior officer in his department or an adviser to review some of the comments I have made today and perhaps undertake to write back to me in due course so that I can provide that information to my constituents.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I rise to take part in the debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. This bill was introduced on 28 June and is of importance to Australia's horticulture industries and the grape growing and wine producing industries. Both industry sectors are of importance to primary industry in Australia and in my own region of central Victoria. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. The first provision of the bill relates to quarantine operations. This provision is designed to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 in response to the Nairn report of 1996 on Australian quarantine operations. That report, in recommendation 63, suggests that Quarantine Australia:
Develop and increase the use of electronic information systems to speed the clearance of cargo, subject to the development of satisfactory quality assurance systems and audit procedures.
The government responded to the Nairn report in 1997 and backed the proposal to enhance electronic systems that facilitate the clearance of cargo. The amendment before the House gives effect to this development and, as the minister indicated in his second reading speech, the new part VA is aimed to provide a legislative framework for this system. Accordingly, amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908 allow for the use of a computer based system for the clearance of cargo and a person to be appointed as both quarantine officer for plants as well as for animals. Of course, this is one of the more interesting aspects of this bill and I will have a little bit more to say about that later on in this speech.
The bill also allows for the director of quarantine to take into account offences against prescribed state and territory laws, as well as Commonwealth laws, when assessing the suitability of a person to manage a place where goods subject to quarantine may be treated or otherwise dealt with. It also provides for a quarantine officer to give directions to a person in control of a vehicle. At present directions must be given to the owner of the vehicle, leading to problems if the owner cannot be easily contacted. It also provides for a quarantine officer to direct treatment of premises that have been exposed to quarantine risk, even if the animal or plant which had carried the risk is no longer itself subject to quarantine. Seizure notices are also to be given to a consignee or addressee as well as to an importer. This is important with respect to mail items.
The second set of amendments relate to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and, in particular, to the voting arrangements that have existed for payers of the wine grapes levy and payers of the wine export charge at the corporation's annual general meetings. The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 allow payers of the wine export charge, as well as payers of the wine grape levy, to vote at annual general meetings of the Wine and Brandy Corporation. This had been the government's intention, and the industry's understanding, when the Wine Export Charge Act 1997 was introduced, but their failure to simultaneously amend the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act at that time led to an anomaly in the voting arrangements. 
This bill provides for the appointment of a person to act as a quarantine officer for both animals and plants and it is timely in relation to the potential dangers emerging as a result of the possible flood of fruit and other agricultural items into Australia. I refer in particular to the concern that is being expressed in the apple and pear producing industries in Victoria over the danger of fire blight being brought into Victoria. In my electorate of Bendigo, the Harcourt Valley region produces quality apples and pears and is a fast-growing area for grapes for both the table and the wine industry, and I know that local producers are very worried about their futures should their orchards and vineyards become contaminated.
 Equally concerned are the growers in the Goulburn Valley who have been very vocal in their opposition to AQIS lifting bans on quarantine which will allow fruit from overseas to enter Australia. A report appeared in the Shepparton News on 13 July this year following reports that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is, in fact, revisiting its decision to stop apple imports from New Zealand, where the disease is endemic. At the time of this item's publication, growers in the district were still waiting for the AQIS ruling and several deadlines for the ruling had already passed. The concerns of producers in the district were given all the more focus because a visiting international contingent had been on the road educating growers about the threat of the disease.
Before I continue with the report from the Shepparton News I thought I should refer to the AQIS fact sheet on the Internet, where there is a special section concerning the disease of fire blight in apples and pears. The AQIS fact sheet has these comments on fireblight:
Fireblight is an extremely infectious and destructive bacterial disease of apples and pears. The disease also occurs on several members of the family `Rosaceae', including wild and ornamental species. The organism may persist in stem cankers and is therefore difficult to eradicate. 
Fireblight is endemic on native rosaceous species in North America, particularly the eastern parts of the United States. When the European pear was first cultivated in North America, the fireblight organism was found a favourable host ...
In particular the AQIS fax sheet says:
The apple industry in South Queensland and the pear industry of the Goulburn Valley in Victoria are considered most vulnerable, but apples and pears growing anywhere in Australia could be attacked by fireblight, should this organism enter the country ...
The fax sheet continues:
Fireblight is a native of North America. It first spread to New Zealand in 1920, Bermuda in 1938, Mexico in 1943, United Kingdom in 1957 and Poland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Guatemala in 1996. Subsequently the disease has spread to Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France, Switzerland, Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Armenia, Bulgaria, Jordan, countries of the former Jugoslavia, Italy, Romania, Moldavia, Israel, Turkey and Iran.
This disease gets around.
The AQIS fact sheet lists the species that are susceptible to fire blight and notes the symptoms. It says:
Infected blossoms and new shoots die and discolour, turning brown or black as if damaged by fire. Cankers develop on branches and twigs following invasion of the tissues. Initially these cankers are reddish in colour but progressively they become brown and then black.
Describing the biology of victims of the disease, the AQIS fact sheet notes:
All parts of the plant may be attacked including blossoms, twigs, spurs, fruit and branches. The bacteria enter through blossoms, natural openings or wounds, and multiply rapidly. Spring and summer hail storms can cause injuries, which provide ideal wounds through which infection can occur.
The bacteria overwinter primarily in blighted twigs and stem cankers. Cankers remain dormant until the Spring when new growth commences. Bacteria are most active towards the outer edge of the cankers from which drops of exudate containing abundant bacteria are produced. The bacteria may be spread to blossoms from these exudates by insects, including bees, or by driving rain. Dispersal from the exudate also occurs to young shoots and wounds. 
What is especially informative in the AQIS fact sheet is the warning that the great danger with fire blight comes from the flesh of the fruit affected. This is noteworthy because growers are fearful that they could be facing a lifting by AQIS of the quarantine ban on apples from New Zealand.
Under the heading `Quarantine Risk' the AQIS fact sheet notes:
Introduced vegetatively propagated material represents the major quarantine risk. Seed free of pulp is not considered a quarantine risk ...
and the fax sheet then notes:
... Australia has adopted stringent precautions to minimise the risk of introducing fireblight.
I return now to the report in the Shepparton News dated 13 July. Here there is a report of comments by Dr Tom van der Zwet, a US-based plant pathologist. He notes the conditions that fire blight likes and the kinds of pears grown in the Goulburn Valley. He is reported as saying that it was an explosive mix and one that he would be unprepared to risk if he were making the call on the future of Australia's $320 million apple and pear industry.
In the Shepparton News Dr van der Zwet said that the way the disease established itself in new countries was unproven, but there was no doubt about the result. He is quoted as saying:
If it's not caught in the first year, you'll never get rid of it.
Dr van der Zwet said that the cost would come in controlling and managing it, that there were no registered drugs in Australia to treat it and it could threaten orchardists' livelihoods. Equally noteworthy is the reported comment of Shepparton orchardist George Themilis, a third generation orchardist in the district, who is quoted as saying in the Shepparton News:
We're extremely disappointed in the whole process. 
We feel the risk is too great and that AQIS and the politicians have failed our industry in no uncertain terms. It's outrageous.
I wish to refer also to concerns that have been aroused over the danger of admitting into Australia the killer vine disease known as Pierce's disease. The concern has been aroused because of the decision this year by AQIS to approve the importation of table grapes from California. I refer to the report in the Weekly Times of 9 August that the decision by AQIS is conditional on pre-shipment of inspections and methylbromide fumigation. It reports also that AQIS's decision is awaiting final government approval.
I represent an area in Central Victoria where grape and wine production have been undergoing a rebirth and have started a reinvigorated life. This industry is now a significant element in the economy of the Bendigo region. I can understand why producers would worry about a disease like Pierce's disease. Grape and wine production was big in the Bendigo region in the 19th century until it was wiped out for decades by a disease known as Phylloxera. It has taken decades for the district's grape and wine industry to recover. It would be an outrage to see any section of the industry anywhere in Australia endangered by other diseases and to have to contemplate the possibility of any kind of new threat to the flourishing young industry in Central Victoria.
I note that the Weekly Times reports that the table grape, dried fruit and wine industries are protesting, quite rightly, that not enough is known about Pierce's disease. This disease is presently playing havoc in California, from where the `coals to Newcastle' grapes would be imported to Australia. The disease has existed there since the 1880s, with sporadic outbreaks until 1997 when phenomenal damage was done through the agency of its carrier—a small insect known as the `glassy-winged sharp-shooter'. That damage has been immense, prompting the United States government to allocate $40 million to stop the disease. A state of emergency has been declared in California.
Australian grape industry spokespeople are fearful that, if the disease gets to Australia, it could create devastation. They are not convinced by AQIS's claims that fumigation by methyl bromide will destroy the sharp-shooter as there have been apparently no specific studies to prove the effectiveness of methyl bromide for this purpose. These anxieties have been aired by David Hunt-Sharman, the executive officer of the Australian Table Grape Association, and by the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the Murray Valley Wine Grape Growers Council and the Australian Winemakers Federation. 
The Labor Party has no problem with this bill, but I caution the government to heed the advice of the fruit growers and ensure that this important sector of our agriculture industry is not threatened by diseases that have so far not contaminated our orchards. My colleague the Labor candidate for Murray, Allan Calder, informs me that orchardists in the Goulburn Valley are watching this matter with great interest—as are the growers in the Harcourt Valley and other areas of Central Victoria. The people involved in this industry may face disaster if the minister for agriculture makes the wrong decision. For my part, I am pleased to be able to put this back on the national agenda and trust that the minister will carry out decisions that allow this industry to survive.
I also note that during the research for this debate there were some people from the industry in Canberra this week. I am not sure if they met with the minister, but I know that they did meet with some of the other MPs. That shows the depth of concern that people have about the potential dangers of fire blight in the orchard industry and Pierce's disease in the wine industry. There were allegations of a fire blight outbreak found in a tree in a Melbourne park some years ago. I understand that a New Zealand person made those allegations but nothing more came of it. During the debate my colleague the member for Corio had some wonderful things to say about the wine industry in the Geelong area. I am sure he is right; I am sure they produce some very good quality wines in that area, but I would like to inform him that Bendigo is a superb boutique wine growing area. We have a whole host of superb wineries, with wine crops virtually surrounding the whole district.
The member for Corio, in his contribution, suggested that the member for Corangamite was a great connoisseur of Geelong wines—he probably is. I issue an invitation to the member for Corangamite to visit Bendigo again. He was in Bendigo some three or four weeks ago on a parliamentary committee, looking at our heritage buildings, and was very impressed with the buildings he saw. He kept asking about me about wineries and I kept telling him that I would be more than happy to show him some wineries on another visit—we were very busy at the time. 
I also issue an invitation, and echo the words of my colleague the member for McMillan, to the minister for agriculture to visit the Bendigo region to see the wine industry and the apple and pear orchards in the Harcourt Valley and to learn first-hand how the industry is faring. It is a very efficient industry—an industry that we are all very proud of in Central Victoria. It is an industry that would be in some danger of fire blight and other diseases if AQIS were to lift the import ban on fruit from New Zealand. There are a whole range of areas that need to be looked at. I would personally be very pleased if the minister were able to visit that area, to consult with the industry and to learn first-hand about their problems.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—I thank members who contributed to the debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998. There have been some quite constructive contributions on quarantine issues and matters of interest to agriculture. It was a rare but pleasing sight to see two or three members of the opposition contributing to a debate on agricultural issues—that is very rare indeed. Nearly all of the contributions come from those members who represent the agricultural industries, namely, the members of the National and Liberal parties on the government benches.
The bill deals with basically two separate sets of issues: amendments to the Quarantine Act and amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporations Act. The main amendment to the Quarantine Act is the insertion of a new part to facilitate speedier clearance of international cargo through the use of a computerised system for issuing notices. The legislation will support AQIS in maximising the use of technology to make the most efficient use of its resources. Other amendments proposed to the Quarantine Act will ensure that AQIS is able to deal more effectively with quarantinable diseases and pests if they are discovered in Australia. While AQIS strives to keep such quarantine risks offshore and works actively with our international trading partners to achieve this goal, some quarantinable pests and diseases will make it past the border. 
Timber pests are of particular concern. Australia is free of many timber pests and their establishment in Australia would affect not only our native and plantation forests but also rural areas and vital agricultural industries, and could also prove a problem for backyard trees. This bill strengthens the power of the Quarantine Act to deal with these sorts of issues. There are a range of other, perhaps more minor, amendments which deal with some of the regulations and other elements of the act.
Members in their remarks have made a number of comments about the importance of maintaining Australia's disease-free status in industries wherever they exist. I wholeheartedly concur with those views. It is absolutely essential that Australia adopts and maintains high standards of quarantine. Some of the criticisms from the member for Corio suggesting that the government has somehow or another reduced expenditure or its efforts in quarantine are completely false. Indeed, the government has devoted increased resources to quarantine measures. If the honourable member was to visit parts of North Queensland, particularly areas like the Torres Strait and across into the Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia, he could not help but notice the significant effort that is now going into quarantine in that regard. 
I was in the Torres Strait islands a few months ago. Virtually every island now has a quarantine officer, or if it is an uninhabited island then there will be unattended traps which are visited regularly to try and intercept any risk of insect passage through those islands to mainland Australia. There is a real effort being put into those barrier areas where a particular effort needs to be made. As we are on the eve of the Sydney Olympics, our attention is also drawn to the importance of having a strong quarantine effort at airports. Bear in mind most of the traffic in and out of the country and therefore most of the risk actually comes through the legitimate movement of people to and from the country, especially through our airports and our ports. There needs to be a vigilant effort in that regard at all times.
The second section of the bill deals with the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act. Currently, two different levies are paid to the Wine and Brandy Corporation. The first is known as the wine grapes levy. It is paid to the corporation by wine producers. The second is known as the wine export charge, and it is paid by wine exporters. There are a number of wine businesses that pay both levies. In 1997 when the Wine Export Charge Act was introduced, the intention was to give the payers of both levies the same voting rights at the annual general meeting. A number of consequential amendments were made to the act but inadvertently not all relevant sections were changed. These amendments rectify those anomalies. There has been widespread support around the chamber for the contents of this bill. I note that the opposition has a fairly superficial amendment which does not deal with the substance of the matters in the bill. Naturally we reject both the content and the intent of the amendment, but I thank the opposition for their support of the substantive measures in the bill.
Amendment negatived.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I always find participating in the adjournment debate in this House and bringing praise to local achievement something I can be very proud of. I am not proud today to talk about lack of local achievement. Sadly, nothing could be more embarrassing for the ACT than the current fiasco going on, led by a Liberal local government, in relation to the Bruce Stadium. The Bruce Stadium is a fiasco that began some time ago, when the original estimate of redevelopment cost was $27 million, with $12.7 million of that coming from the public purse. Now, somewhere between $39 million and $50 million has been spent on the redevelopment out of the public purse. We still do not have a naming rights sponsor, so it is still called the Bruce Stadium and accordingly some of the money has been lost. The Olympic effort to bring the Games to Canberra, nothing of which I would ever object to, has so far cost or will cost in the vicinity of $20 million, which includes revenue guarantees given by government to SOCOG. The returfing of the pitch at Bruce has cost around $1 million so far. There is also a revenue guarantee of $3 million per year for 10 years to go to the Raiders, the Brumbies and the Cosmos teams to guarantee their playing there. Another $6 million has been spent on the Manuka upgrade because Bruce was converted into a rectangle and therefore neither AFL nor cricket could be played there. Upwards of $80 million has been spent in costs in one way or another relative to the development or redevelopment of Bruce. 
Now, sadly—this is a tragedy for this community—there is the whole question of whether the Olympics will in fact get here. I personally hope they do, because nothing could make Canberra more proud. The difficult thing to swallow is that the Chief Minister in the ACT always acknowledges when something successful happens—she is very quick to take the praise when something good happens—but when something like this happens where does the line of responsibility lie? With anybody but her and with anybody but her government. We now have the incredible situation where it is going to cost another half a million dollars to returf Bruce Stadium; we have possible threats of litigation from the people who laid the turf in the first place; and we have definite threats of litigation from two other areas of commerce in relation to Bruce Stadium. At the same time we have the Chief Minister curtly walking off a news interview last night because she had to go and talk in the chamber in a minute's time. I am sure she wished she did not have to leave the chamber for the next month, in fact. I have no sympathy for her; I have condemnation for her and her government.
 I sincerely hope that, despite this mess, the Olympics will arrive in Canberra and succeed. My fingers are crossed and I believe it would be fair to say that the rest of Canberra's fingers are crossed. In the meantime what we need is a Chief Minister to stand up to this farce and to do something as a matter of urgency. One of the most important and early things would possibly be to apologise to the ACT community for the damage to our reputation in this country and, unfortunately, internationally.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Capital Territory: Olympics</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
"Sercombe, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The forthcoming Olympics are of historical importance for all Australians. Some aspects of the circumstances surrounding the games have particular significance for particular sections of Australians. In my electorate there is a very large Macedonian Australian community. It is of great interest to them that, in the context of the Olympics, there will be the first visit to Australia of a Macedonian head of state. President Boris Trajkowski is a most impressive man. I had the opportunity to meet him in Skopje, Macedonia, last year at the height of the Kosovo conflict, which was right on the doorstep of Macedonia, and when that country was experiencing massive problems. 
President Trajkowski is visiting Australia via the United States, where he has particularly high level access, including to President Clinton. In Australia, in addition to being here for the Olympics, he will also be taking the opportunity to launch a pay television service by satellite linking Australia and Macedonia. It is most important that President Trajkowski, on his visit to Australia, has high level access to Australian leaders. The absence of a diplomatic mission of Macedonia in Australia underlines the importance of this need for personal contact.
I understand that during the visit he will be attending a reception hosted by the Prime Minister and the Governor-General for visiting dignitaries, but it is most important that, with this opportunity of the historic first visit of a Macedonian head of state, there be one-on-one meetings between Australian leaders, including, hopefully, the Prime Minister, and President Trajkowski. As I said, this is a leader who does enjoy top level access in the United States and it would seem singularly appropriate that that also occurs in Australia.
I have no doubt that one of the substantive issues on his agenda at any such meeting would be the question of diplomatic representation in Australia. This has been an issue for some time. I can say, from the visit I made to that part of Europe last year, that in Skopje the Greek embassy is quite noticeable. And when one visits Athens the Macedonian embassy is quite noticeable. So there is no issue between those two countries in terms of diplomatic representation. Sometimes the sensitivity in the past of that relationship has been given as a reason for perhaps delaying the question of Macedonian representation in Australia. As I said, it is not an issue in that part of Europe; those two countries enjoy close relationships, economically and politically. One would hope that the visit of President Trajkowski to Australia would present the opportunity for top level dialogue between Australian officials and Macedonian officials, and the resolution of this issue.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Macedonian Head of State</title>,Statements by Members,18,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The opposition will be supporting the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000. We have been advised of some amendments that the government will be proposing in the Main Committee, and we will be accepting those amendments also, as they are only minor corrections to the original intention of the bill, and the original intention of the bill has the opposition's support.
This is a bill to amend the Patents Act 1990, to repeal what is known as the petty patent system and to implement in its place an innovation patent system. It makes other amendments which, although some of them are of consequence to individuals, in the great scheme of our whole intellectual property protection regime are relatively minor matters.
As I said, fundamentally the objective of the bill is to introduce a new innovation patents system to provide more accessible and effective protection for what might be called lower level or incremental inventions. It also has two further objectives by way of minor amendments to facilitate the streamlining of the mechanisms available for the payment of fees under the Patents Act and to correct some unintended ambiguities in the Patents Act. I will not refer again to those minor matters. We accept that tidying up process, and it is appropriately done in the context of this piece of legislation. 
I would like to give some background, because I think people can often get lost in the arcane detail of the patents system. There are many people who spend a lifetime working inside the patents system and know it so well, but it can be confusing for the layperson looking in from the outside. At its core, the patents system is a simple and important concept.
A patent, I think, is best described as a right granted for a device, method or process which is new, inventive and useful. But what is important about it is that, in a sense, it is a form of mutual obligation. On the one side, the state says to the inventor, `This is a legally enforceable right that gives you, as the owner, the exclusive right for the life of the patent to commercially exploit that which you have invented.' That is very important. On the other hand, it says to the owner, `Your obligation in these circumstances is to share that know-how by providing a full description of how the invention works.'
It is fundamental to being a successful, modern, industrial country that we have a contemporary, effective, strong body of intellectual property protection laws. This legislation is part of modernising that framework, and we support it. The idea being introduced in this legislation is not new. In fact, many would say that perhaps it should have been done earlier. A report from the Advisory Council on Industrial Property in 1995 concluded that the petty patent was not achieving its objectives.
The scheme was introduced in 1979 with the intention that it would provide protection for innovations typically developed by Australian small and medium business enterprises. It was intended to provide relatively inexpensive patent protection for inventions with a short commercial life. So it was clear that the intention was worthy, and I think it had universal support both at its introduction and during its life. But the review concluded that it was not achieving those objectives and that it should be replaced with the innovation patents system, which would require a lower inventive threshold—the old petty patents system has the same threshold as the standard patent—so that it would be better suited to the needs of small to medium business enterprises and have a shorter life.
The government accepted most of the recommendations of the advisory council by agreeing to establish this system to protect incremental inventions so that a patent may be granted more quickly after a formalities check and provide the patent owner with a right that is quick, cheap to obtain, relatively simple and which lasts for a sufficient time to encourage investment in developing and marketing the invention.
On those grounds, we support what is envisaged here. In essence, it goes to what is important about intellectual property in general historically, and certainly in the 21st century successful economies are going to be based upon the successful development of ideas.
 There are many phases in that. What has now become `the national innovation system' is a phrase that covers a multitude of sins. But I think there is now probably quite a well-developed concept of the cyclical nature of the process. We used to see it as more linear from invention to commercialisation and we now see it as a mutually reinforcing, more circular, process. The Wills report called it a virtuous circle. 
I am concerned—not with this bill, which I support—but with two aspects to which it relates. One aspect is the increasing evidence that, in the area of patents, as in other areas of research and development performance, Australia is falling behind international best practice—not in the regulatory framework but in performance, in output—and that, overall, our intellectual property protection framework is being undermined in ways that cause me concern. But I repeat, my concern is not with the bill; I support the bill and the way that it is strengthening our patents system. 
Copyright protection, which is very closely related as part of this framework of intellectual property protection so fundamental to a modern industrial society, is not getting the recognition it deserves. The rights of copyright owners are not being reinforced and protected as rigorously as, I believe, is the proper objective as defined in the summary of this bill. That is, to encourage people to exercise their creative effort in this country—whether it is an invention through the patent system or an artistic creation which is more likely to go through the copyright system—to make it here, to develop it here, to retain the ownership here and to generate international income coming back to Australia from that intellectual property.
We need to look at the balance between consumer and creator interest. For example, some aspects of what has been done with regard to parallel imports, which has some benefits, do not recognise the fact that intellectual property, as protected by copyright or patent, has many of the characteristics of property, and that the owner has rights in it and that those rights are important not only as a matter of fundamental justice but also as being at the core of successful 21st century economic practice.
I was very concerned to read the report by CHI Research Inc. It was funded by the Australian Research Council and the CSIRO. It asked, `How well is Australia doing in patenting as a measure of our international performance in research and development in this rapidly advancing research based technological age?' and concluded `Fair to middling'. I think the data backs that as not an unreasonable analysis. We are not doing disastrously. From the period 1979 to 1997 our share of patenting in the US patent system actually went up. But it went up very slowly, and many of our key competitors passed us. By definition, not everybody can have passed us, because our proportion went up, so we obviously enhanced our performance compared with some. It was not a disaster; it is just not good enough, and we need to do better. That is why we welcome this minor but welcome advance in the legislative framework for our intellectual property regulation.
As I indicated earlier, we will accept the amendments proposed by the government in the Main Committee, and we wish the bill a speedy passage. But, more importantly, we hope that, when subsequent reviews are done, they will say that Australia's international patent performance is at the international cutting edge, instead of just fair to middling, and that our research and development performance is improving. And when investors around the world look at where they might locate major research and development activity, they will be encouraged to believe that our intellectual property framework is so rigorous, so comprehensive and so contemporary that this will be the place in which they choose to make that investment, to create those jobs and to generate the ideas that could be the foundation for our successful 21st  century economy.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"— It is my pleasure to follow the member for Fraser in this debate on the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 and to say that there is nothing in his remarks which I could differ with, and much to heartily commend. It is pleasing that the measure has bipartisan support and that the legislation can expect a speedy passage through both houses. 
As the member for Fraser said, the success of nations in the 21st century will depend in large measure on their capacity to convert good ideas into good products and commercial successes. It is interesting that in the management literature one of the concepts gaining increasing profile is the idea of latency. It is based on the argument that in any commercial organisation there is a pool of good ideas out there. The line workers in a factory may be sitting there all day assembling components, but they are having ideas about how to improve the products, the processes, and the management of the enterprise.  
The idea of latency is that the most successful organisations are the ones that can take those good ideas that are spread in a diverse, chaotic way throughout the organisation and promote them through the ranks of decision makers, to the point where they can be identified, evaluated and acted upon, and that the truly nimble, fleet-footed, forward looking companies are those which have the capacity to virtually instantaneously elicit and convert the ideas into action. As a nation we are asking ourselves today about our level of latency. We are asking, `What is Australia's capacity to draw out of the population the best in creativity, in innovation and invention, and convert it into action?' 
This measure seeks in an incremental way to tighten the legal framework within which ideas are commercialised. I say `incremental' because the bill specifically addresses incremental innovation. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property, in its review of the petty patent system, identified what it referred to as a gap in our legal framework. It said that in the big ticket items, in the great leaps forward, the system was adequate, but that there was a gap, which particularly applied to smaller and medium sized enterprises and to lower level and incremental innovations where the changes, instead of  being inventions of new technologies, tended to be adaptations, refinements or improvements to existing technologies. The advisory council said that the standard patent system was really too expensive and too slow to be able to rapidly identify those innovations, accord them some legal status, and give the creators the benefit of that commercial protection of their intellectual property. The council therefore recommended this idea of the innovation patent, which already had been adopted by about 45 nations around the world. In that sense it is not a new idea, but it is a good idea. 
The bill achieves its objective of greater speed, economy and flexibility by a couple of means. The first is to lower the threshold of innovation required in order to trigger the protection of the bill. We are not necessarily requiring a kind of great leap forward but just an incremental advance in an existing technology will satisfy the requirements of the legislation. 
The second measure which the bill introduces to increase speed is to grant that protection to a qualifying innovation without what is described as substantive evaluation. That means that there is not a group of scientists who are going to sit around and evaluate every possible ramification of this innovation against a set of statutory criteria. That process is expensive and very time consuming. It will be done on a more off-the-cuff evaluation—a quick look, if you like. A sense of the direction of the innovation will be enough to attract the protection.
Some may say, `Isn't that a concern if you are granting someone protection for an idea which, for example, may have been invented by someone else in some other part of the world? Isn't there a problem if it is not carefully enough evaluated?' The point there is that, if the patentee subsequently seeks to rely on the innovation contained in the innovation patent, then he will have to go through this further step of substantive evaluation, and that will take some time, it will be more costly, it will involve testing the assumptions and the claims of the innovation against the world literature. But he does not have to go through that in the first instance, and that is the simple, commonsense, practical step forward contained in the bill.
The final aspect of the bill is the fact that you will only be granted protection for eight years, as opposed to 20 years, which is the previous standard. What this allows us to do is to better reflect the true character of innovation at the beginning of the 21st century, which is that in many instances a technology simply is not going to last for 20 years. The commercial value of a technology can change very quickly. We are seeing the revolutions per minute, if you like, of innovation increase so fast that the idea of eight years is very attractive to those who recognise that their idea may well be superseded by a better one in a very short space of time. So that is the general background to this set of specific measures. 
I want to turn briefly to this wider question: how do we address this issue of fostering innovation, invention, discovery? One of my reasons for concern is a humanitarian one for that little cadre of eccentric, in many cases, inventors in Australia. As members of the House of Representatives, most of us have had the experience from time to time of the frustrated inventor who, in exasperation, as a final resort, comes to see their local member of parliament to say, `What can you do to help me to commercialise this great idea?'
The inventor is an unusual class of being. Often, we find them to be a little bit eccentric. One of the reasons is that they have the faculty of being able to imagine a new world, a new product—something unseen which is visible to him or her but not to the rest of the world. It is an indicator of the sort of character we are dealing with. Very often, the inventor will become completely obsessed with their particular innovation, whereby they live, sleep and breathe this idea. The level of conviction that this innovation is going to make a difference to the world is palpable. In many cases inventors seem a little eccentric because they have not had enough sleep. That is one of their problems. They are so absorbed with their idea. I suspect that there is no greater form of loneliness and isolation than that which attaches to genius unrecognised, to innovation unappreciated.
—Is that your problem?
—I wish it were my problem. I have enough light only to recognise this form of isolation in others; I would never claim to have experienced it myself. 
The point is that we want to savour and honour the innovators of our culture; we want to allow them to get to market quickly. There have been some interjections from the other side. I point out that this bill—and intellectual property as a concept—is the ultimate refutation of socialism and the bankruptcy of the collective idea. It says that, if you want to motivate people to take risks and to give their heart and soul to an endeavour, you must give them an incentive: an individual personal reward for effort. Intellectual property is a relatively arcane and sophisticated concept. Those opposite who continue to practise the rhetoric of class warfare in relation to education funding and the like demonstrate how much they are creatures of centuries past rather than of centuries to come.
Daniel Boorstin is regarded as the world authority on innovation. He wrote three books entitled The Inventors, The Creators and The Discoverers, and I think won a Pulitzer Prize for one of them. I quote not from any of those books but from Inventors and Discoverers Changing Our World, to which Boorstin has written the introductory chapter. Talking about Columbus—I want to talk about the genius of the individual that must be recognised and nurtured—Boorstin says:
The classic chronicle of discovery is anything but anonymous. On the contrary, it is intensely, even intimately, personal. Columbus's achievement was a work of salesmanship, courage, expertise, knowledge of wind and current, organisational ability and stick-to-itiveness. He did have a compass and could find his bearings by ancient methods. But his was a personal, not a technological, triumph. Nobody before him had just the qualities, or found quite the opportunity, to do it.
Discovery and innovation are intensely personal. They are chaotic, unpredictable, haphazard and serendipitous. We must ask ourselves: are we the kind of culture that values, encourages and nurtures that sort of intensely individual gift and talent? Alexander Graham Bell, for example, said of the inventor: `An inventor could no less cease to invent than he could cease to breathe.' He was saying that some men and women are created to invent; it comes out of their pores. 
The honourable member for Fraser referred to the performance of different nations in the OECD, including Australia. Individual invention takes place in a cultural context, which is either encouraging or discouraging. I must ask: what is our capacity and our level of tolerance to the zany, the eccentric, the different, the unusual and the unorthodox? 
—That's your problem: you're zany.
—You are probably correct. I would be honoured if that were the case—if the zaniness added something to the global body of knowledge. This is why things such as the scientific and scholastic values that have underpinned innovation, particularly in the Western world, over the past five centuries are important. We have seen an unbelievable flowering of knowledge. I refer, for example, to Matthew Richardson and his Penguin Book of Firsts, in which he says:
From around 1300 there is a steady increase in the number of firsts being entered—for which Western Europe is mostly responsible. It culminates in the intense activity of the 19th and 20th centuries—two hundred years that furnish more entries than any earlier period of similar length.
—What were the dates?
—He says that from around 1300 there was a steady increase and then an intense burst in the 19th and 20th centuries. In talking about innovation, the most extraordinary statistic is that in the last 60 years of the 20th century, we added 20 years to the life expectancy of the average Australian. At the beginning of the century, the average Australian was living to the age of 60. Today the average Australian is living to the age of 80, and one in three girls born in Australia today will live to 100. The actuaries and biologists tell us that by the end of the 21st century, Australians will routinely be living to 110 and 115 years. Some will say that that sounds just unbelievable.
—With biotechnology,150.
—That is right. As the member rightly points out—biotechnology. And most of the patents are being registered in the area of biotechnology, of health research—for example, in the human genome project where we have the capability to physically map every gene in the human body. Of course, this raises a number of philosophical questions about whether we should be allowed to own the intellectual property over the human genome. One of the things that Boorstin points out is that the speed of innovation in the last two centuries made it nearly impossible to prophesy impossibilities. I will just repeat that. He says: 
The new partnership of the search to know—discovery—and the passion to innovate—invention—made it nearly impossible to prophesy impossibilities.
When you think, for example, that from the time of Icarus, men and women were dreaming of heavier-than-air flights, century after century, then you get in 1904 to Kittyhawk, where two bicycle manufacturers from Dayton, Ohio, without a tertiary qualification between them, take off in the first heavier-than-air flight in human history on a windy peninsula in North Carolina in 1904. In my own lifetime, a mere 65 years later, you have Neil Armstrong stepping out of the Eagle spacecraft with the words, `One small step for a man'. When you think about the incredible compression of innovation into that century, it is just the most stunning achievement. I can see members looking for me to wind up, which I will happily do now.
—No.
—Extension of time.
—Thank you, I appreciate that very much. The Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Maurice Newman, once said in relation to micro-economic reform that there are prizes for those who get there first. The same maxim is applicable to this idea of patents and the protection of intellectual property—the creation of innovation and discovery. There are prizes for those who get there first. For example, the race to map the human genome is driven in part by the realisation that those who can tie down the variables first will be able to create new technology. 
—Greed—is that what drives technology?
—Not at all. I am just saying that if our task as members of the House of Representatives is to protect and uphold the interests of Australia and the individual citizens who elected us, one of the things we have to do is protect Australia's strategic interests. It is not just quality of life issues; there are also defence and strategic questions. There are, in fact, whole new worlds out there which will be discovered in the next century. We want to ensure that Australia takes its place in the vanguard. We want to be at the forefront. We do not want to be playing catch-up. We do not want to have people in the middle of the next century walking into our electoral offices—or the offices of those who succeed us—saying, `I've had this great idea. I've had several offers to commercialise it, but they all come from overseas.' We want to see these ideas developed in Australia. We want to build a reputation as a country which nurtures idiosyncrasy, eccentricity, differentness and creativity and which does not insist on orthodoxy at every point. We want to be a government that also reflects those values. Those values, I think, are reflected in a small way in this bill. I am grateful that it enjoys the support of all sides of the House and I fully commend it to the chamber.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I think the honourable member for Parramatta made a very good contribution, probably the best contribution I have heard him make to the House. The points he was trying to make were very good—Australia does have to do that and to encourage that. It is just unfortunate that he is a member of a government that has downgraded development and research in this country. We saw a headline this week which was a damning indictment of the Howard coalition government. 
—Your research is deeper than the headlines, surely!
—My research goes further. It shows that the government is a worse government than the headlines are showing. It shows the government is bereft of ideas, decent policy and any opportunity of taking Australia forward.
Government members interjecting—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I will not be provoked by those people on the other side. The Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 does have the support of both sides of the House. It amends the Patents Act 1990 to repeal the petty patent scheme, implement the innovation patent scheme and make other minor amendments. Its major objective is to introduce a new, innovative patent scheme to replace the current underused petty patent scheme and to provide a more assessable and effective protection for lower level and incremental inventions. That will help people get off the ground, and make it simple and easy, but give them some protection while they develop their idea or invention a bit further. It also facilitates streamlining the mechanisms available for the payment of fees under the Patents Act and there are a number of minor amendments to correct unintentioned ambiguities in the Patents Act.
A report in 1995 concluded that the petty patent was not achieving its objectives and recommended that it be replaced with the innovation patent scheme that would require a lower inventive threshold than the standard or petty patent. It would have a shorter life of eight years, compared to the current 20 years of a standard patent, and would provide protection for lower level inventions.
An innovation patent will be granted after a formalities check and will provide a patent owner with a right that is quick and cheap to obtain, is relatively simple, and lasts for a sufficient time to encourage investment in developing and marketing that invention. Then if a substantial examination is to take place, which is time-consuming and costly, in which the invention is assessed against statutory criteria, it will only occur if directed by the commissioner of patents or requested by the patent owner or a third party. If the patent meets the requirement of examination, it will be certified; if not, it will be revoked. To reduce the scope for unsubstantiated threats, an innovation patent owner can only enforce their rights if their patent has been certified. 
These patents are very important to a country and can be used to assist in developing new technology. Some Australian inventions are absolutely legendary and in many cases have generated millions of dollars for their owners and for Australia. The protection provided through the patent scheme has had a big part to play in this success and will encourage people to continue their research to develop new and innovative products, exploit new technology and promote the transfer of technology to Australia.
It seems a great pity that so much can be achieved by Australians all over the nation, yet this government is not prepared to put decent amounts of funds into research and development, or create policies to do so. It cannot just be left to the business community to put up the wherewithal to develop ideas. There are times when there is insufficient risk capital available for the private sector to invest. There needs to be government assistance on crucial inventions. I do not care what the member for Parramatta would call that—maybe socialism, maybe interventionism. But those things need to happen, and the member for Parramatta should look at history and see how they happened in the past and how this great nation of Australia was developed.
I can think of many good ideas that have passed this country by. They might have made something for the inventors, but not enough for them to reinvest and develop their ideas in Australia. So many good ideas have zoomed off and left us—gone overseas, offshore—because of the lack of support from all sectors. This situation is just not being addressed at the moment. Under this government, there is no will to help research and development look at innovative ways to do that. This government keeps passing the buck rather than using the buck to get something going.
—I do not believe that research and development is money down the drain, although those on the other side may think it is. I think the member for Parramatta was talking about people having vision and being able to look outside.
—It is basically true. The member for Macquarie does not understand that governments need that visionary outlook. His party has certainly failed, and is failing, to do that in any way at all.
—The government is certainly not using opportunities to get us into R&D, so I wonder whether this development in the patents scheme system will be able to play a role. It will certainly help to make things simpler and cheaper for people to get something going.
As a country, we are clever—we have had to be. Historically, because of our isolation, people have made do and developed things to cope under the circumstances. No-one would have believed possible what we have been able to achieve at times. That occurs more so as you go further out, where people do not have the same access to things. The statement that necessity is the mother of invention is very true in the history of this country. You can see it all over the place.
I am reminded that islands are a great example of this—and I do not just hold Tasmania up as an example. On some of our islands you can see the dump at the back of the shed and you can see things working. These things are working because of someone's inventiveness and innovation—by people being able to pull something apart and stick something onto something else to keep it working. They know that the ship is not coming in for another two months with the new part they need, so people's ideas—innovations—make things happen. We have been very good at that in this country. 
I can think of a Tasmanian example. Early last century, all the glass developed for precision type usage—including microscopes, gun sights and bomb sights—was imported from Europe, particularly from Germany at that stage. As we came into the Second World War, all that importation ceased and Australia was desperate for precision glass. A Tasmanian academic who had been doing some work with silica sand in Tasmania discovered that we had some of the best silica sand in the world—which we still have—and he started up a small company, undertook a few experiments with different processes and techniques and began manufacturing precision glass, to the extent that people from overseas were beating a path to his door. His little company played a very important role in Australia's war effort and went on long after the war until technology overtook it. He finally retired after making a great contribution to the Tasmanian economy and to a country in need at the time. Of course, he achieved something for himself, but his company really helped hugely at the time.
 Tasmania has had many other inventions, both in the past and now, but many have sadly disappeared offshore to be developed by those who could take a greater financial risk than our local folk. But lodging patents and developing ideas is expensive and needs to be assisted. This bill may help in a small way for some smaller ideas and very early development, but we need to do more and we certainly need to do more in R&D.
This has been made quite apparent with the recent report Investing in our future, compiled by the Australian Research Council and the CSIRO. This found that Australia was lagging behind its trading partners when it comes to lodging patents in the United States. The way it is measured involves the analysis of the patents assigned to a particular country, using a certain technique described in this paper, which provides a means to objectively assess the potential for participating in that prosperity and to identify strong and weak areas in technological potential.
The fact is that 96 per cent of those patents cited in research out of Australia were from publicly funded institutions such as universities and the CSIRO. We have to be more proactive in funding research and development if Australia is to get near the front of the bandwagon. It is for this reason that I think biotechnology research must be encouraged in Australia. We are very strong in this area. Public funding allows us to ensure that it is transparent and open when dealing with safety and ethics of proposals, particularly where the project has implications for health and the environment.
When I was doing research on and discussing the Gene Technology Bill, I found that, despite discussion on the labelling issue previously, we have been eating GMO foods already with consumers really  not being aware of it, despite their objections. How many people read their labels anyway? Most of this material is developed overseas and has been introduced by multinational companies into their products. The companies have the opportunity to make this information available as a positive contribution to the debate, but they are falling down on their responsibilities—probably because of the research needed and the public consultation has been funded from so little. Companies are there to turn a dollar, but the government is there to make sure the consumer gets the truth and fairness of the product. We need to know that GMOs can be a plus for the consumer as well as for the producer, and that should not be hidden, nor the processes under which they are assessed. So public research is essential to ensure an unbiased approach. 
I am just an ordinary backbencher; I have no specific scientific background, but I do have a farming and primary industry one and I can see that there could well be pluses all around in biotechnology. I know the debate is contentious, but I really believe that, used correctly, this technology could bring ordinary farming much closer to organic farming and could be beneficial to farmers, the land and our environment.
I reviewed heaps of material for the GMO speech that I gave this week, and I still cannot believe that what this technology is doing is any less than what man has done over the last 10,000 years or so—only it is being done more quickly, more precisely and with more control from ourselves. Holding up research for a year, as in the Tasmanian case where a moratorium has been put on field trials, I do not believe will work and I believe it will put us behind the eight ball. 
 We will still be importing heaps of produce that has GMO content and not be able to develop import replacements. Knowledge is strength. If we know and can trust what is going on, we can keep an eye on what else is happening around the world, and have our regulators at the ready to deal with problems that might occur. Prohibition tends to send everything underground and that is when things start to get dangerous. I have never been a believer in prohibition so I cannot agree with my own state government colleagues that there is a need for a moratorium and a possible ban on GMOs. They would have to ban the manufactured produce already flowing into the state and we cannot opt out from the rest of the world and expect to survive. 
Patents become part of the chain of events as new ideas come forward. Australia needs to be in a position to hang on to the ownership of the technology, especially that which involves biotechnology at this crucial stage. Obviously, patenting is part of the early process. Any way it can be made simpler and less expensive will help the country and those people using innovative ideas. However, this bill in isolation will not be the answer. It needs to be strongly backed up with additional funding in research and development to encourage more people to seek those patents, to go out and want to patent their ideas and inventions. Better tax incentives are certainly one way to get the private sector involved. Much more needs to be put into the education and training of our young people to make sure they have a good generation of young scientists coming through. I think that has been neglected also by the present government. 
It was only yesterday that I learnt something about bioprospecting and the opportunities in that area and the need for regulation as well. I saw the gathering of insects or plants and making it into a mash, breaking it down to the DNA, working out its make-up and chemistry and writing it down, using Australian plants or animals. When that is in written form, it can be reconstituted using synthetic material, so the actual knowledge is on a piece of paper or a floppy disc. Of course, there are export regulations and controls to stop taking animals, insects or plants out of Australia, but there is nothing to stop someone taking a piece of paper or sending an email. So we certainly need to be looking in this area as well.
We certainly need to be using our processes, whether it is taxation or whatever, to encourage and help people to be innovative. That goes back to younger scientists coming through but it is not only scientists that develop things. We need to make sure that we have a positive proactive world. The world is about ideas. Wealth generation in today's world is ideas that need to be developed into services or goods. That is the way that countries are measuring their wealth.
On innovation, they tell me that over this decade we are living in now we will be inventing and changing the way we are as much as we have done in the last 100 years. We have enormous change before us. We need to be proactive and we need to be encouraging R&D, which this government has just failed. It will go into the history books as being a failure in 2000-01 for its lack of innovation and of giving Australians opportunities. It is holding us back and we need to change that by changing this government. I support this new Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000. ",REPS,<title>PATENTS AMENDMENT (INNOVATION PATENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"— I have to say that some of the things that the member for Lyons just said in this debate on the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 bear very careful regard to the speech he made about the GMOs in the House of Representatives—a very good one. However, I have to say that today he has lapsed into error because the best thing a government can do to encourage innovation is get the hell out of the way and let the juices flow in the brains of the innovative folk of this country. We should let them get better access to capital, protect their private property rights, and stop putting government's hands in their pockets and plundering their income for taxes. We should stop that because that is exactly what would happen should the forces of socialism regain the Treasury bench here in this parliament. That, we will not allow to happen, let me tell you.
Protection of private property is really at the core of innovation. There are two sides to this because if you have inadequate protection of a person's property, especially intellectual property, you will frighten away any investor from putting any money into it to develop it. On the other hand, if you have too much protection by way of patents, or too ferocious a regime of copyright protection, that stultifies the flow of capital from people who would like to develop other things that were, say, very close to that particular invention. They might be frightened away.
I remember years ago in Japan it used to be said that the patent system there was somewhat inadequate when it came to foreign companies registering their inventions in Japan. For example, if you invented the bicycle and got a patent to protect that in Japan, the next thing you know Sumitomo or someone else would come along and patent a red bicycle, or someone would patent a blue bicycle. The protection afforded was very little, especially in the 1970s, with some of the agricultural chemicals that were brought into Japan by some of the large American companies. Suddenly there would be a Japanese chemical that looked suspiciously like it, and with a patent on it, thereby frustrating the opportunities for the real developer of the chemical, whoever that might have been.
Likewise with brand names. In my adult life it has been interesting to see the labels on wine and other sorts of spirits being gradually changed. What was once a bottle of Australian champagne, before I was allowed to drink it—although I did so surreptitiously—is now not allowed to be called champagne. And I learnt the other day that port comes from the Portuguese town of Oporto and so now, according to this EU regime, the Controlleur d' Appellation, the French term for it, you are no longer allowed to call what we know as port, port. When I was a school student it was a pretty cheap sort of grog that we used to get hold of. `Plonk,' we called it. You are not allowed to call it port either. That is an example of how intellectual property is working these days. It goes in some strange directions.
The member for Parramatta, who gave another excellent speech, as he always does, spoke about the human genome project, developing the DNA—
—You just destroyed the credibility of that.
—There is a worry that some of this gene technology will mean cloning Ross Cameron, and that frightens a few people. That aside, what we have done today in introducing this bill is not strike a hammer blow against socialism but perhaps just a little tap on the side of its head. It is another way of protecting private property, which is really the thing that you find the socialists worry most about. It goes back to Marx and all that sort of thing. 
Diminishing the security of title was something that the Keating government's native title legislative regime did. It directly reduced the likelihood of investment in mining and other sorts of rural development. Hence, as late as yesterday, it prompted the tragic resignation from the opposition front bench of our friend the member for Banks. He is such an entertaining gentleman sitting there. And what that is all about is private property. The Queensland government found the native title legislative regime of the Keating government to be affecting investment in mining in Queensland. So Peter Beattie said, `No, we cannot have that, we have got to have something more realistic.' He wanted something more like the coalition's policy, which is what that is code for. Of course, our dear friend Daryl found that he had to do the Kamikaze thing. He has gone, we have lost him.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, this has got nothing whatsoever to do with the bill.
 (Mrs Gash)—Member for Wentworth.
—The honourable member has pointed out that perhaps I was getting a little enthusiastic and went off on a bit of a tangent. Returning to the bill—
—You could move a condolence motion.
—This is not the time for condolence motions. We must not get into Daryl, as the member for Port Adelaide points out. We are talking about private property, and fair enough. A more flexible patent system will give more rights to the individual.
The member for Parramatta made the interesting point that the pace of innovation really took off late last century and early this century. He talked about the Wright brothers and the development of flight and so forth. It set me thinking about what was really behind that innovation take-off. Much of it had to do with the development of the joint stock company. In about the middle of the previous century in Britain the notion of splitting shares into units and allowing individuals to purchase them and the collective ownership of property and investment became a reality. Open exchanges were then developed as newspapers began to publish the prices of various stocks. It happened with the tulips in Amsterdam and the South Sea Bubble, but I think it probably became a mass activity late last century and early this century. I think the great immigration flows to the United States probably had a lot to do with it also. That goes to what the member for Parramatta said about eccentricity and difference within society throwing up the kinds of folk who tinker away in their garages and invent things. They would no sooner stop inventing than stop breathing, as I think he quoted someone describing such people. 
This bill institutes a patent regime with a slightly lower inventive threshold, which gives us reasonably inexpensive and much faster access to comprehensive protection of intellectual property. It should do something to help individual Australian innovators who do not really have the capital to immediately engage a patent attorney to apply for a standard patent offering 20-year protection. It provides protection for eight years and it probably gives people an earlier opportunity to seek investment capital. 
Much has been said about the role of government in this process. The best thing that government can do is lie down and keep still. It should get out of the way and let individual folk access private capital—whether raising it publicly on the second board of the Stock Exchange or seeking venture capital. We then ask: what is the role of government? There is a notion that, if R&D spending were to flow from a department in Canberra, somehow or other more would be available. Not a lot of R&D spending is coming from the United States government, yet all the brightest young IT engineers in the world are going to Silicon Valley.  
They say `IT' stands for `India and Taiwan' these days because that is where most of the new software engineers are being produced. Of course we are trying to persuade them to live in Australia, enjoy our standard of living and contribute to innovation in this country. We will do that not by taking R&D spending out of the Treasury but by taking the government's hands out of people's pockets. Interest rates are one thing but, while our highest rate of income tax stays at 48 per cent, you are saying to people in Bangalore or Hsinchu in Taiwan, `Come and enjoy life in Australia; we'll take half your income from you.' How about that for an attractive offer? Of course they will say, `Don't be ridiculous; we would rather work in California where the tax rates are lower, there is more capital available and there is a sense that things should happen by way of innovation.' 
—Tell us the difference between total tax rates in Australia and the United States.
—The impression, Rod, is that it is better there. There is more capital and the total sum of attraction is higher because here we have—
—Tell us what the tax rate is.
—There are various tiers of it. It depends which state you live in. Why would it develop in California and not here in Australia where there are more—
—We are talking general principles here. There are more resources in terms of individuals closer, in a sense, to Australia who ought to be participating in this sort of activity and yet we are not able to attract them sufficiently. Tax is one part of it, I grant you, but it is also a sense of what a country or a particular jurisdiction is doing to encourage this kind of thing in a general sense. As the member for Parramatta said, we could do more to demonstrate that we want this sort of thing to happen here. Whether the government is to do something by way of taking people's money from them, establishing some guidelines and spending it, or whether it is going to stand back and let the natural processes prevail, that is the sort of road we have to take.
I support this bill. It is a hammer blow to socialism and a good thing for the individuals tinkering in their backyards. I look forward to this government going further in the future to defend private property and fight back against the forces of socialism.",REPS,<title>PATENTS AMENDMENT (INNOVATION PATENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—in reply—In summing up the second reading debate on the Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 I would like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on this bill, including the member for Fraser, the member for Parramatta, the member for Lyons and the member for Wentworth. Each recognised in their comments the importance of the patent system in Australia and the vital role it plays in fostering innovation and providing new economic opportunities and driving economic growth in Australia. The bipartisan support this bill has received, and the recognition from all members of the positive benefits the innovation patent system will deliver to our small and medium business enterprises, are certainly very welcome indeed.
The coalition is committed to fostering innovation and maintaining a strong and effective intellectual property system in Australia. Our commitment is reflected in the innovation summit held in Melbourne earlier this year and by the record $4.5 billion we have committed in funding for major science and innovation programs in the years 2000 and 2001. The Patents Amendment (Innovation Patents) Bill 2000 is a key part of this process, building on the government's commitment to providing a patents system which meets the needs of all Australians and highlighting our ongoing efforts to improve the scope of intellectual property protection here in Australia. 
The government recognises the important role played by both large and small business enterprises in maintaining Australia's position as a strong innovator in the international marketplace. We also recognise that Australia's current intellectual property system may not provide effective or accessible intellectual property rights for those lower level inventions typically developed by small and medium business enterprises. This bill seeks to correct that imbalance by introducing the new innovation patent system.
As I outlined in my second reading speech, the innovation patent system will share similarities with the second-tier patent systems introduced in over 48 other industrialised countries. Experience in these countries suggests that the second-tier patent systems are well used by local enterprises, particularly small and medium business enterprises, and help to foster local innovation. A major investment for many SMEs occurs in the development and testing of new products and improvements that, although not vastly different from existing technology, have significant commercial value. These inventions play an important part in the commercialisation and development of new and existing technology. However, they are often not seen to meet the inventive threshold requirements of the current patent system and there is no mechanism to prevent others from free riding on their investments.
 The innovation patent system has been designed to provide protection for these inventions by requiring a lower inventive threshold than is required for a standard patent. This will allow SMEs to protect and market their good ideas. It will also encourage them to continue to invest in innovation with the confidence that others cannot copy their improvements. The innovation patent system will provide a low cost, fast entry option into the patent system.
The reduced cost of the innovation patent system will be offset by a shorter patent term, with innovation patents having a maximum term of eight years, in contrast to 20 years for a standard patent. This term also reflects the reduced contribution made to technology by lower level and incremental inventions. An innovation patent will be granted without substantive examination. This recognises the fact that only a small portion of granted patents proceed to court actions and that in many cases substantive examination of patents is an unnecessary and certainly a very costly procedure. The patent owner and the public can still ascertain the validity of an innovation patent by requesting examination of the patent. However, this process need only be undertaken where the validity of the patent is questioned or where there may have been an infringement of the patent.
If Australia is to gain the maximum benefit from innovation, we require an intellectual property system that not only protects major developments, but also protects incremental inventions and smaller improvements in technology. The opposition's support for the bill recognises that the innovation patent system will provide this balance and enable both large and small business enterprises to profit from their investments in innovation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Before the Main Committee adjourned yesterday I was making some comments on the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations entitled Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers. The report discusses a number of issues facing people in their 40s and 50s in particular who suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves unemployed.
At the end of my comments yesterday I was specifically discussing the problems that mature age unemployed find in trying to re-access employment and re-enter the workplace. For instance, blue-collar workers, because many of them are in manufacturing industry where restructuring is going on, can find themselves suddenly unemployed. Many of these people who have not had post-secondary educational qualifications find it very hard to re-access employment. The committee recommends, therefore, that local Job Network providers should be involved in special training arrangements for mature age unemployed to provide courses that will assist them in re-entering the work force.
One of the areas in particular where a number of mature age unemployed need help is computer literacy and information technology. Many of them have not had to deal during their working lives with information technology, with computers, and yet the new jobs that they might want to access have those as basic and essential requirements. So the committee recommends that the government fund a national computer literacy training program for mature age workers to bring them up to speed on those computer literacy skills that will make them far more employable. I think it is an excellent recommendation. There is a lot going for it and it would certainly make it easier for a lot of those mature age workers to re-enter the work force.
Another way of assisting the mature aged back into the work force would be to assist in other areas of retraining, including traineeships and apprenticeships. The committee therefore recommends that the government introduce a special training subsidy for mature age people undertaking formal apprenticeships and formal traineeships. Under this government's new apprenticeship system, there is no age restriction to accessing apprenticeships and traineeships, but employers seem to be reluctant to take on older trainees or apprentices. So a special training subsidy for those employers may well encourage them to give that opportunity to mature age unemployed wanting to take on an apprenticeship or a traineeship. 
 One of the other problems in terms of trying to re-enter the employment market is the difficulty that many people have with respect to the cost of travelling to job interviews. I suppose that is not just a problem for mature age unemployed. The committee recommends that the government consider a transport reimbursement scheme for job seekers in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas who are experiencing transport difficulties. It recommends that a trial be conducted by Centrelink in several locations. As a member representing such an area, I would certainly like to see such a trial include the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury areas, because I know that some of my constituents have trouble travelling—and have trouble with the cost of travelling—to job interviews.
Another main area of the committee's report focused on the financial difficulties of the mature age unemployed. As I indicated in my comments yesterday, people in their 40s and 50s have often signed themselves up to fairly substantial, ongoing financial commitments—mortgage payments, children's education, et cetera. To suddenly find themselves unemployed can really create enormous strains. 
The committee has made a number of recommendations to try to ease this pain. Firstly, the committee recommends that greater assistance and incentive be given to those wanting to access part-time or casual work. Perhaps we could consider indexing the means test base. The committee recommends reducing the withdrawal rate for long-term mature age unemployed by 10 cents in the dollar. Secondly, the committee makes a number of recommendations regarding superannuation and access to superannuation. For instance, the committee recommends that the government reconsider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people over 55 who have received benefits for at least 39 weeks. If necessary, a ceiling could be placed on the amount of superannuation assets that are to be excluded. This would ease the financial pain a bit for those over 55 who really are trying to find employment and who cannot do so.
Thirdly, the committee makes some recommendations regarding mature age unemployed being able to access their superannuation to meet mortgage payments. As I said, people of this age often have significant mortgage commitments and finding themselves unemployed at age 45, 50 or 55 can create enormous strains The last thing that people in this position want is to be forced to sell their house because they cannot meet their mortgage payments, even though in many cases they have a fairly large amount put aside in superannuation. So the committee recommends some easing of access to superannuation for these people so that they can meet their mortgage payments.
The committee makes three specific recommendations in this regard. Firstly, it recommends that the government removes the 26-week waiting period before people on Newstart allowance benefits are able to access superannuation funds to meet their mortgage payments. The existence of mortgage commitments should be deemed to satisfy the financial hardship grounds for such access. Secondly, the committee explores the feasibility of allowing anyone over 45 to access their superannuation contributions for mortgage payment purposes in the immediate unemployment period up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Thirdly, the committee recommends that Centrelink publicise on the Internet and in other relevant publications that superannuation fund members who are receiving Newstart allowance benefits may access up to three months repayments and 12 months interest on the outstanding balance of a loan in order to make payments to save the family home from foreclosure. These recommendations would seem to me to be perfectly fair and reasonable for those people of a mature age who suddenly find themselves unable to meet their financial commitments and unable to meet their mortgage commitments because of their unemployment. 
Over recent decades, the toll of unemployment on those finding themselves unable to work has obviously been severe for people of all ages. Over the general business cycles when we have had recessions, including the last one back in 1991—the one that we supposedly had to have—along with the general process of industrial restructuring that has been going on in the country for decades, pressures have been placed on anyone who finds themselves unemployed. But as this committee's investigations have found, there are particular problems facing those of a mature age, in terms of discrimination, stereotypes in the work force, particular barriers making it harder for them to re-enter the work force, and particular financial hardships. This report makes a number of very worthwhile recommendations that would ease the pain and the financial, emotional and social suffering of the mature age unemployed, that would facilitate their re-entry into the work force and, for the community generally, would enable us to continue to use the rich resources provided by our mature age workers. 
It would be a terrible shame for our society, for our community and for our economy if the skills, the maturity, the experience and the work ethic of our mature age people were not able to be applied. That would be a terrible loss to our community. This committee makes some very valuable recommendations not only to assist those people to be reabsorbed into the work force for their own sake but also to allow the community generally to continue to benefit from the contribution that our experienced workers could make. We have certainly seen over the past four years under this government a steady ongoing decline in unemployment—from 8.6 per cent when we came into office down to 6.3 per cent now. Over 800,000 jobs have been created under the policies of this government.
—Not many full-time jobs.
—Most of them are full-time jobs. There is an obvious commitment to strong economic growth and to general policy directions that reduce unemployment and provide opportunities for all our unemployed. We need to continue those sound, strong economic policies that will provide opportunities for all our unemployed, but this report makes recommendations that will enable us to particularly target issues confronting mature age unemployment. I therefore commend the recommendations of this report to the committee and to the government.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The Age counts report before us today concerns a long neglected segment of our community. They are the long-term, older unemployed people. I refer to the statements made by the member for Dickson, Mrs Cheryl Kernot, in this place on Monday, 14 August 2000 in defining an older unemployed person as `40 years of age and over', whilst the report before us defines mature age unemployment as `45 years or more'. The definition of long-term unemployed is `people unemployed for two years or more'. I refer to my own party's policy document titled `Reconstructing the Welfare System', an authoritative text prepared by the shadow minister for family and community services, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan. At page 7 of the policy document, long-term unemployment is defined as `those out of work for longer than two years'.
The honourable member for Dickson's speech on 14 August highlights the thrust of the report before us today: that they, the long-term, mature age unemployed, have been taking an unfair share of the consequences of economic restructuring in this country. I have taken this government to task in this place on several occasions on the utilitarian ethic that drives the government. The Australian Labor Party policy document highlights this evil ethic that has racked and ruined so many in Australia. The honourable member for Dickson's words are apt. They are timely, for what we have in this government's so-called reform of social welfare is nothing more than the bludgeoning of the politically and economically weakest of our society. This government has divided the community into new heights of disparity between rich and poor never before seen in our country. Utilitarian value judgments between deserving and undeserving social welfare recipients are now made along economically driven directives. Cost cutting is the real name behind this so-called reform. This is the real agenda behind the Liberal Party's Fightback and subsequent agenda setting by the government. This government has marked the agenda along United States lines of labour market deregulation, wage cutting and pathetically low minimum wage setting. 
As a direct result of this government's policies, the shadow minister's policy document notes that Australia's long-term unemployment has risen as a percentage of total unemployment from just over 20 per cent of total unemployed in 1990 to over 30 per cent in 1998. This is against a backdrop of falling long-term unemployed as a percentage of total unemployed in the economies of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand. A further consequence is the rising dependence on social security in Australia. Now, one in four households, or 2.34 million households, in Australia live below the poverty line. Finally, the Gini coefficient—that is, the line of evenness of distribution of income through the economy—has demonstrated that we, as an economy, are becoming more unequal, with the coefficient of 0.446.
These are just some of the indicators that show the ineluctable conclusions that Australia is becoming a society of haves and have-nots, a society driven by utility rather than by social justice. The policies of this government are a cynical reminder of majority politics. They pander to middle Australians, they ignore taxing the richer portions of our community, particularly the corporations, whilst they make for misery of the most vulnerable—the long-term and mature age unemployed.
The report before us attempts to address these issues. It makes 38 recommendations, which on the whole are welcome. However, they are small in comparison with the ethical forces driving our economy. It will take more than the recommendations highlighted in the report to reduce the trend toward increased long-term mature age unemployment. It is the growing trend of utility based ethics that has led to this discrimination against mature workers. It is part of the entire economic system perpetrated by this government that discriminates against mature age workers.
It is now a competition between young and old. Mature age workers cost more in pay and benefits; they are less flexible to retrain. Their expectations are higher. They are wiser; they can stand up for themselves more. Consequently, they are the first to go. They are retrenched before younger persons. Put simply, the economy cake gets bigger but they get a smaller slice, or no slice at all. The larger portion of the cake goes to those who already have, and hence those people get more. The injustice is manifest.
I will not go through all the recommendations here. The report is in part a heart-wrenching confession of people suffering in silence severe economic hardship. People reaching the latter years of their life are being compelled to draw down on superannuation in advance of their retirement just to pay for day-to-day costs of living. By retirement, they are penniless and destitute. They become social security recipients and hence a further debt on our society. This is no fault of theirs. They made the effort to make provision for the future, in part by compulsory contribution but also by voluntary contribution.
The recommendations speak of various issues: education, awareness campaigns and even a code of conduct feature in bringing the matter to a head. There are recommendations for training courses, computer literacy, skills and career guidance, traineeships and apprenticeships for mature age workers. There are recommendations for alternative work arrangements, including part-time and casual work options, new business opportunities and eligibility for Newstart and other administrative changes. These recommendations and proposed adjustments are all individually welcome. However, the root of the injustice of the plight of the mature age, long-term unemployed is the utilitarian driven directives of this government. 
In short, the fundamentals are wrong. The government has created an economic environment which denies long-term mature age unemployed people the level playing field they deserve. Indeed, the playing field is not even. Mature age and young employees are not equal. They have differing skills and attributes. Mature age employees have the benefits of experience, knowledge and wisdom. Young people have the benefits of age and flexibility. These are generalisations, but they are the sorts of factors that lead to the very discrimination I have referred to. Further, they are the very factors behind the increase in the long-term mature age unemployed. This government has judged the long-term mature age unemployed to be less valuable than younger employees. They have been scrapped long before their expected retirement date; they have been declared surplus to requirements.
This ethic is based on the utility ethic of the greatest good for the greatest number. It is too bad that the mature age, long-term unemployed should fall on the side of the losers in our society. However, it is a reflection of the deliberate economic policies of this government that these are among the targeted members of society who have been singled out for discriminatory work relations which have, essentially, priced them out of the market. Cheaper, more pliable young workers are thought more suitable than experienced and more expensive alternatives.
I have personally seen the effect on the Public Service during my tenure as an employee of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. During that time I saw a spate of voluntary redundancy packages and forced retrenchments meted out to our Public Service. The effect is that we have witnessed a brain drain within our market that has truly diminished and weakened the intellectual capacity of the Commonwealth Public Service.
The cost of such decimation of the ranks is not easily measurable. Further, we will not see the effects of such decimation for many years. Simply, the demise of public and private sector skills means that there have already been shortfalls in skill levels throughout so many public and private sectors. In some cases, entire professions in Australia have literally been wiped out. I could mention personal representations in my electorate office in respect of building trades and, in particular, the tiling industry. It has come to the point where skilled labourers must be encouraged to migrate to Australia, as we have simply run out.
So too in the public sector: there has been a decimation of skill and experience in the administration of government in Australia, the like of which we have not seen before. A prudent public servant takes many years of experience to acquire a sufficient awareness of governance to be capable of serving as a true public servant. You cannot put an old head on young shoulders. It is true that it takes many years for a public servant to understand the policy implications of the rule of law, administrative law—including notions of procedural fairness—natural justice, privacy, responsible government and so forth. These are ethical issues that are the backbone of good governance. When these public servants walk out the door, they take their experience with them. This is what has happened in so many departments at federal, state and local government levels. This government, in its greed and utility driven wants for bottom line economic imperatives, sees it as more useful to employ a younger, inexperienced officer or to outsource for short-term contracts. The effect is that the ethic of good governance is never imparted. An entire culture is lost. This is the long-term cost of such short-sighted, financially and utility driven objectives. 
I say this in terms of the impacts of the report before us today. These recommendations are window-dressing. They do not address the fundamental inequities that have plagued the management of the long-term, mature age unemployed. The recommendations attempt to cover up a more fundamental inequality which is pervading the economy.
 I do not wish to go into the detail of the 38 recommendations made in this report other than to say that, yet again, the ambit of discussion in this parliament is typified by reductionism. The report reduces the issues to the banal, those piecemeal ameliorative measures that will blunt the hurt of the more fundamental factors which are the ultimate root of the problem. 
The report addresses problems that are by and large the creation of this government. The government has itself to blame for a market of its own making. This market envisions a world where mature, skilled workers are trashed because they are economically too expensive and politically expendable. The effect, as the shadow minister for family and community services so correctly notes, is the drain on national wealth.
What is the national wealth to which the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, refers? It is the skill and experience base I have been referring to during this entire speech. It is the entire infrastructure of that magical mix of experience and youth that is the hallmark of any successful economy, sport team or social endeavour. You do need both. You cannot run an economy with bias towards youth or maturity. The economy must be balanced. The government's policy has discriminated against the aged and, in doing so, introduced fundamental imbalances in the economy. These imbalances will come to plague Australia in the years to come. The Age counts report, while noble in its own reductionist way, does not address the fundamentals. 
National wealth requires an investment in people. This is not simply a cash throwing exercise. Fundamentals have been thrown into disarray. One particular fundamental assumption that is no longer an assumption is that a person has a job until they reach the age of 65. There is now no job security. A job for five years or even three years is considered long term. This trend affects all aspects of life including family building, house purchases and other fundamental family decision making. Whilst this government speaks so bravely about family and children, its economic policies reflect a contempt for the family, including the long-term, mature age unemployed who are discriminated against in being able to sustain a family. 
The opposition has articulated its own policy which is directed towards maintaining the national wealth of its people. Job security and reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty traps are at the heart of this policy. Again, I could go into a long litany of cost cutting which this government has undertaken in pursuing purported social welfare savings of over $5 billion during the 1998-99 budget. There are over 40 areas of cutbacks, too many to go into in any detail here. However, one trend is clear in the government's decisions. In terms of the government's direction they are targeting single parents, people with disabilities, long-term unemployed, and older unemployed. 
You see at a glance the consistency of the utilitarian ethic being played by this government. It is no accident that these four segments of our community are singled out for social attack. They are the ones who must pay for middle Australia's world of increasing share prices, affluence and hedonistic pursuits. These four groups are singled out to be the utilitarian losers who pay the unfair burden of the cost cuts whilst middle Australia enjoys the benefits. 
The alternative to this utility driven economics is a policy built on social justice. Social justice demands that each be given according to their due. This is the core of the opposition's policy response to this most inequitable government policy. Social justice notes the moral goods that are assailed by this government's policy. These include the right to work, the right to a fair income, and the right to the expectation that a person may live the latter years of their life with a degree of certainty.  
For too long the government relied on the legal administrative rule that government may make or unmake laws at will. This is an administrative right in the hands of government. This parliament can and does make laws which often backflip, saying `black' one day and `white' the next. This is both understood and necessary in any functional sovereign state. However, the policy shifts which this government has implemented have had severe deleterious effects on the future of mature workers in the work force. I include in the term `work force' those who are currently unemployed but who are actively seeking to work. 
Gap analysis is a term of art which has, as one definition, the policy loss of shifting from one set of laws to another; in short, what is lost or gained when laws are shifted. The laws relating to employment, industrial relations and training have all made their mark on the long-term and mature age unemployed. Again, it would take too long to go into any detail here. What are important are the ultimate reasons behind the conspicuous increase in long-term unemployed as a percentage of total unemployed. I put it to the parliament that the ultimate reason for this increase to 32 per cent is found in the gap analysis. The government's laws reflecting their implemented policy demonstrate the fruits of their policies. This is the measurable effect amongst many other non-quantifiable adverse effects such as the loss of skill base, wisdom and experience. 
The costs of national wealth and family insecurity are not liabilities on the balance sheet and are therefore selectively forgotten. This is the pervasive nature of ethics as this government presents them. This is the manner in which they dupe themselves into believing that an economic cost cutting exercise is preferable to the survival of a self-serving economy.
 The term `economic rationalism' has been used to describe what is really a policy of unbridled utility maximising pursuits of profit-driven public economies. It is truly not rationalist because its appeal to reason is predicated on the good it is maximising—that is, money. The government's blind pursuit of money has contaminated practically every policy, with other catastrophic consequences. The result has been to deny justice to those who are owed it. As the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, notes, welfare reform is a case of invest now or pay later. It is exactly the same economic/ecological question of any social cost. `Eco' is the Greek prefix for the word `household' and is therefore the common prefix to both words, `economy' and `ecology'. It is no mistake. You cannot refer to a house simply by reference to the living room and bedrooms. To speak meaningfully about the house, you must also refer to the kitchen, bathroom and laundry. So it is with welfare policy. It cannot be presented in terms of its bottom line economic cost cuts. It must be understood properly in its broader context of social impact.
Finally, this government must acknowledge the harm that it has caused by the relentless pursuit of its policy and further acknowledge the logical consequences of its actions. The opposition's policy document focuses clearly on the different policy platform of social justice, in sharp juxtaposition to the utilitarian approach of this government. We have highlighted the imperatives of the rights of rewarding work, the right of education and hence empowerment and flexibility of workers to shift their work environments. But, more importantly, the issue relates to the fundamentals, including the investment in children for the future, as well as the overhaul of the social welfare system, particularly in restoring the more than 40 social security net provisions which this government has either explicitly removed or reduced to impotence.

"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Losing your livelihood after a lifetime of continuous work is a major life trauma. The issue of mature age unemployment will only become more pressing as Australia's population ages. I am pleased that this government has had the foresight to recognise the challenges we face and has attempted to devise and recommend some solutions. 
As a new member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, I have not been as integrally involved in this inquiry as others. However, I would like to congratulate the entire committee for tackling a difficult subject and coming up with a set of practical and worthwhile recommendations in the report entitled Age Counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers.
So much of our self-confidence and the person we consider ourselves to be are tied up in the career or job to which we have chosen to dedicate our life. Prolonged periods of unemployment take a financial toll on older people, but they also take a personal toll on the person's family life and their feeling of self-worth. Mature age unemployment has particularly harsh effects because at this stage people generally consider themselves to be at the prime of their working lives. In fact, there is significant evidence that the psychological stress of losing a job at an older age leads to a high incidence of illness and, in the more extreme cases, even to early death. 
Mature age unemployment also impacts on the wider community because those who leave the work force unwillingly are often unable to save for their retirement. This lack of retirement income threatens to become a serious problem as our population ages, because it forces working taxpayers to foot the bill of increased income support and health costs for a burgeoning generation. 
According to ABS statistics, in 1997 almost half the men aged over 45 were unemployed as a result of retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. It represents a tremendous loss of human capital which gives an insight into the consequences of being underprepared to deal with the changing nature of work. Australia has embraced the technology revolution with relish and those over 45 have not been able to keep up. These people have not grown up with technology and have difficulty adapting to a world where computer skills are as essential as a drivers licence. Becoming computer literate involves a major commitment and many mature age workers are not prepared to invest that much time and energy into learning new skills during what they see as the final years of their working life.
Age counts is a comprehensive report and its recommendations cover a wealth of areas. Although these issues need to be considered in totality, today I would like to focus on two specific areas: firstly, the devastating consequences of mature age unemployment; and, secondly, the remedy that many people in this position adopt—starting their own small business.
 In pure financial terms, the economic loss to the individual and their family of losing a job later in life is devastating. Even with income support, Treasury advice indicates that only about one-third of the net wages and superannuation is replaced. Older workers also tend to have greater ongoing financial commitments than younger people. In addition, many have dependent children to support through university education and aged parents to care for. Losing the income of the main breadwinner, which in older Australians is usually the male, can put an intolerable burden on family relationships. The report notes that a substantial number of relationship break-ups in the 40 years and over age group can be traced back to the male losing his job and his role as the main provider for the family.
In addition to the wage income lost, the mature age unemployed have the additional stress of being cut off from gaining the retirement income they were depending on, such as superannuation. Although award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee levy have increased retirement savings, last year the average balance in superannuation guarantee accounts was still only $8,000 or $9,000. The earlier a person becomes unemployed the more dependent they will become on the age pension. 
At the broader level, mature age unemployment puts a strain on the Australian economy by reducing current and future tax revenue, increasing welfare payments such as the age pension, and increasing spending on health, education and other social services. The result is lower economic growth. A submission to the inquiry indicated that, if the proportion of 50- to 64-year-olds receiving income support remains at the same level as in 1997, a further 460,000 people will be receiving payments by the year 2011. This will cost in the order of $3.6 billion each year. In reality, we can expect the bill to be even higher, due to our rapidly ageing population. In contrast, the report notes that if these older people were to remain in the work force they would add to the national economic output and save taxpayers billions of dollars in welfare support.
The loss of a job also entails the loss of the social and professional networks that come with it which limits the opportunity to find available jobs. In an attempt to avoid the feelings of dependency and financial inadequacy that come with unemployment, many mature age people attempt to start their own small business. It can be seen as an attempt by older people to buy themselves a job. Although the inclination is understandable, it is a risky strategy which can result in the person ending up in a worse financial position than they started with. The inquiry found that mature age people aged 55 or over are the group most likely to be self-employed. A recent survey found that, of 1,000 people who lost their jobs in 1998 to 1999, 33 per cent of those over 50 chose self-employment. But the Employment Strategies Council has estimated that only a tiny three per cent of small businesses are successful.
The consequences of business failure can be even more crippling than the loss of employment for older people. Most have invested their retirement income or redundancy packages in the business and their financial security hinges on its success. The committee's report states that less than 50 per cent of mature age people starting a new business had received any training. One of the key findings of the report is to ensure older people facing loss of employment should be adequately counselled about the risks of starting a business and strategies which can increase their chance of success.
The federal government has established a range of programs to help people setting up a new business. The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS, can be particularly useful to older people. Each year the NEIS program helps about 6,000 people with no previous business experience to get started. The committee was impressed with this program. I fully support the recommendation to expand the NEIS program to provide assistance to those people buying a franchise or an existing business. Although a more limited version of NEIS, called the self-employment development program, is available to those wishing to purchase an established business, it does not provide the full range of support services that NEIS does. However, the committee found that even successful schemes like NEIS must be tailored to the specific needs of mature age people which may involve more frequent face-to-face contact and assistance.
 Despite a wealth of government assistance and schemes designed to help fledgling small businesses, the committee found that there is a lack of awareness about their existence. A wealth of information is available through various web sites and the Business Entry Point, but mature age people often do not possess the computer skills needed to access it. In fact, in 1996 the business longitudinal survey found that less than seven per cent of micro-businesses made use of government programs compared with over 61 per cent of firms with 500 or more employees. This sort of information, combined with anecdotal evidence, has led the committee to recommend that the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business review the way it promotes government programs and disseminates information about the type of assistance available. It is a simple step but one that is clearly not being carried out effectively. 
My final point, which I will touch on briefly, involves older people's relationships with information technology. The committee found that mature age workers require specialised training to become computer literate if they are to participate fully in the work force of the new millennium. The federal government has invested in well-resourced programs to ensure that all school students are taught basic numeracy and literacy. Today computer literacy is almost as important as these other fundamental skills, and the government must institute similar literacy programs for mature age workers. In modern society it is increasingly difficult to function without a base level of computer skills. Without them, the mature age unemployed have difficulty finding work and, if they do, they are confined to low-paid jobs. 
Australia's ageing population makes it a necessity for our society to change its attitude towards the ageing. We must cultivate the recognition that older workers can be just as enthusiastic and motivated as younger ones. Employers need to acknowledge the unique skills that wisdom and life experience bring to a job. The federal government has taken the first steps towards addressing the unique challenges posed by mature age unemployment through this inquiry and now we must act upon the report and its recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the report Age counts. I want to make two key points. First, I want to talk a little about mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley; and, secondly, I want to comment on the McClure report and its implications for the mature age unemployed.
I represent the Latrobe Valley—it is a key part of my constituency—and I must admit up-front that I feel very strongly about this issue. We hear quite a bit about the high levels of unemployment in the Latrobe Valley. I remind the House that the unemployment rate in that area is about 17 per cent in Moe, about 18 per cent in Morwell and about 11 per cent in Traralgon. Those are very high unemployment rates—especially when you compare the rates in those three towns, which are the three main towns in the Latrobe Valley, with unemployment rates in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne where, in some suburbs, unemployment has fallen to below one per cent. 
We have a structural unemployment problem in the Latrobe Valley. Much of the problem of mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley can be traced back to when the local power industry was deregulated and privatised. It is agreed by people on all sides of politics that that led to a reduction in the number of jobs in the power industry in the Latrobe Valley from 12,500 to about 2,500 over a period of five or six years. We lost a lot of jobs and many of those affected now constitute the mature age unemployed. 
 I want to make the point that, in considering those issues which are specific to mature age workers, we must not forget those issues which are specific to the mature age unemployed. We have a lot of skills in the Latrobe Valley, especially in traditional industries such as boilermaking, carpentry, fitting and turning, and the people carrying those skills are mostly those who are over 40 and have worked for many years in and around the industries in my constituency—namely, the power industry and the pulp and paper industry. Those people have a lot to give, a lot of skills and a lot of knowledge to pass on. Too often, though, we forget about those people. We rule them out of the equation and, too often, they are thrown on the scrap heap and forgotten about. We must never forget about these people because they do have so much to give, and so much knowledge to pass on to the younger generation. 
I speak to people right across my constituency who want to make a bigger contribution. They want to do more for their community. They have worked quite often in the one job in the one industry for a period of 25 or 30 years and they are still young men or women—mostly young men, I should point out, as they are mostly from traditional industries. They have worked for 25 or 30 years as a carpenter or as a boilermaker or as a tradesman in the different area, so they have a lot of knowledge and skills. And they are still less than 50 years old, so they have some years before they are really in a position to retire, or some years when they can still make a contribution before they feel that they should retire.
The public policy challenge for places like the Latrobe Valley is: how do you engage with these people who have so much to give and who want to give? How do you get them to contribute towards the other side of the unemployment equation in places like the Latrobe Valley? How do you marry their need to do more and the skills that they have, to giving the young people who are unemployed in such significant numbers in our district—some 35 or 40 per cent—the skills they need so they can get a job and a start? So far, there really has been no genuine effort by the federal government to deal with this very serious issue. We must not forget that nearly all of the problems that we have in the Latrobe Valley now in terms of structural unemployment and mature age unemployment are a direct result of national competition policy. So it is a federal government responsibility, because national competition policy was, of course, a federal government initiative. 
We need to do something, and it is not as though doing something for the mature age unemployed in the Latrobe Valley would cost a lot. What is required is an approach which brings together local government, state government and the federal government, as well as all of the education, employment and skills training providers in the district, so that we can have a whole of region approach to this very significant issue. Thus far, there has not been the leadership provided by the federal government to do that. That is a shame. We do a disservice to those people who need that cooperation for them to achieve their potential, for them to be given the opportunity to provide for a skills transfer to the next generation.
I note the member for McPherson in her contribution earlier made some good points about literacy and adult literacy. I want to pick up on what she had to say. So often we only hear about adult literacy, especially for those people who have come to us from countries where English is not spoken as the main language, and we only talk about adult literacy in the context of mutual obligation—that they must be do this, otherwise they will be kicked off the benefit that they receive from the government. 
We have to have a bigger vision of what we want to achieve when we talk about adult literacy. In an area such as mine, it is no good saying to someone who has been out of work for maybe five, six or seven years and who before that worked in the one job in the one industry, maybe as a boilermaker, a fitter or a carpenter, `You must do this adult literacy course or you will be kicked off unemployment benefit.' That is not the way to engage with that person, to encourage them to participate of their own free will. For adult literacy to mean anything, people have to want to gain it; they have to want to participate.
What benefit can that boilermaker, fitter or machinist—whatever trade he was in—see from taking part in this compulsory literacy program? Nothing. He cannot see any benefit in it, other than that he will get to keep his payment. We have to find a way whereby we say to him, `If you do this, you have got a very good chance of getting a new job, getting some new skills, or at least you will get the opportunity to pass on the skills that you have to other people,' because so much of these people's lives in their 50s and early 60s is about helping the next generation. I find it very humbling when I speak to these people because they are so selfless. Often they are not concerned so much about themselves or getting a job; they are concerned about passing on the skills that they have to the next generation so that the next generation can get a job. 
So we have to have a better approach: engaging with them, instead of just trying to use the whip hand by saying, `You must do this literacy course, otherwise you will be off your benefit.' What we have to say is, `Why don't you do this literacy course? We will encourage you to do it. We will provide you with some incentives to do it. And, if you do it, you have got a better than average chance of getting a job. Or we will find a way for you to pass on the skills that you have, using your new literacy skills, to other people.' I think that is something which they would feel very good about.
We must never lose sight of the need to encourage these people, who so often feel down about the fact that they are out of work, especially—I make the point again—people who come from non-English speaking backgrounds, where there is so much pride wrapped up in being the person who brings an income into the family. A lot of people feel that they are diminished as men if they cannot provide for their family. We must respect that and be sensitive to it. That is the new approach by the federal government which we need to see in its dealing with the serious issue of mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley.
The second point I want to make in this debate is to talk about the implications of the McClure report in the context of mature age unemployment. I think it would be fair to say that bipartisan support has been provided for the report's recommendations. This is a good thing. The recommendations of the report, in their entirety, provide a sound basis for some genuine moving forward on issues which have in the past been almost intractable. So I welcome that.
We need, however, to look very closely at the detail of the McClure report as it relates to those people who are mature age unemployed or who are on mature age allowance, to make sure that the recommendations of the report, when enacted, will not be of any disadvantage to those people, particularly people in that situation who are living in areas of very high unemployment such as the Latrobe Valley and other regions experiencing similar difficulties right across Australia. We need to be careful and watchful of the practical outcome of some of those recommendations. I would point out again that, in an area of very high unemployment such as the Latrobe Valley, if someone is required to apply for an unrealistic number of jobs or expected to get a job very quickly, that is just going to create an expectation which it is impossible to meet.
 What is going to happen when those people who are long-term unemployed do not meet that expectation? They are going to be punished by Centrelink. They are going to feel as though they are failures and that they have somehow not been able to complete the task set for them which people in other areas were able to complete. We need to be very sensitive to the requirements of the mature age unemployed and of  those people who are on mature age allowance in particular regions, such as the Latrobe Valley that I represent, where there is such a high structural unemployment problem.
I think most people would agree that the essence of the McClure report is good in moving people from welfare to work. That is what we want to see. There is a dignity in work, and the mature age unemployed in the Latrobe Valley have experienced the dignity of work. I would point out that there is a lot of sloppy talk around about people who are dole bludgers—people who are on the dole and who do not want to work. Hardly anyone in the Latrobe Valley would meet that phrase. The people in the Latrobe Valley came to the Latrobe Valley to work. That was the principle of migration to the Latrobe Valley. People came to work on the power station projects and related infrastructure projects in the district. They worked as soon as they arrived in Australia and the Latrobe Valley. 
I think it is a sad thing for people who have, in many cases, worked 25 or 30 years in that industry—and have really been fantastic contributors to the Latrobe Valley community—to feel as though they are dole bludgers because a few people use some sloppy talk when referring to people receiving unemployment benefits. I want to remind the mature age unemployed of the Latrobe Valley that we in the Latrobe Valley community do not think of them in that context. We recognise the enormous contribution that they have made. We see it every time we drive around the Latrobe Valley. We see the magnificent assets they have built with their labour. In conclusion, I welcome the contribution of the report, and I look forward to more discussion on this important public policy issue.
—by leaveFirstly, I would like to both thank and recognise all of the members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations who worked on the report Age counts. In particular, the member for Port Adelaide was extremely supportive throughout the process of the inquiry, as were the diligent, hardworking secretariat. We also received considerable assistance in the collection of data from the parliamentary library.
Australia is a country in which we define ourselves through our work. Usually within a few moments of meeting someone, they ask you what sort of work you do. If you do work for which you are not paid—if it is full-time parenting or volunteer work and, in particular, if you are unemployed—you feel that you are a lesser part of Australian society than those people who do work that is paid. Work places us in a social context. It defines the framework of our lives and it gives each of us a sense of belonging and meaningful purpose. In that sense, I agree most strongly with the member for McMillan, who said that most people are not unemployed through choice. Most people who rely on income support, whether it is unemployment benefits, Newstart, disability support and so on, are not there because they wish to be.
Being without a job is devastating, not only for your personal finances but also it exacts an extremely heavy social and human toll. Those of us who are privileged to be members of the parliament—and probably most, if not all of us, have had work before we came into the parliament—may not always know what it is like to not have a job. I think poets often describe it better than we do. Albert Camus said, `Without work, all life goes rotten'. Walter Greenwood described the living corpse of the unemployed in Love on the Dole. That may certainly be said of the many mature aged men and women whose lives touched this inquiry. Their often poignant and extremely moving stories underwrite what is emerging as a significant challenge for a nation whose population is ageing in the face of collapsing age dependency ratios.
 As our country moves from being an agrarian, labour intensive economy, one that has been built essentially on the exploitation of natural resources, to one that is dominated increasingly by a burgeoning, technology-driven set of industries in the services sector, many people over the age of 45 are finding themselves for the first time without work. For the first time in 20 or 30 years of having been continuously in the work force, they suddenly find themselves without a job and they feel that they are of no value to their families or, indeed, to society, which at times can be so cruel in the way it describes people who are unemployed. And certainly not all but, I would suggest to you, most, are not emotionally and technically prepared for what is a major life event.
Losing your job in Australia, after 20 or 30 years continuously in the work force, is like losing a partner. It is like losing a limb or a breast. It is something which requires you to go through a process of grief, significant bereavement, and then a process perhaps of adjusting, not just financially but emotionally, to this major transition. 
The ABS reported in 1997 that almost half of the men over the age of 45 in this country were out of the work force, through retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. Although the unemployment rate for mature age people is lower than the general unemployment rate—4.2 per cent versus 6.3 per cent—the rate of long-term unemployment is much higher and represents the tip of an iceberg of quiet anguish. But pleasingly, since 1996, the number of long-term unemployed over the age of 45 has declined from 69,600 to 56,000 in June 2000.
Central to the report's conclusions is the need for us to challenge and change the attitudes of society and employers to ageing. We live in a society that does not venerate and respect ageing. I think that there is much that Australians could learn, for example, from Asian immigrants, who place a very high value on senior members of the family and, indeed, on ageing. Skill, enthusiasm and adaptation to change are not the exclusive domain of the young. To the workplace must also be brought wisdom acquired through the passing of the years. 
It is rather interesting that the worst parts of the employment sector for age discrimination are the banking, finance and legal sector. The best part—that part of the economy which has the best age balance—is the IT sector, where you have got generally younger people who have grown up as a part of the Internet generation, who have ideas and skills in terms of computer technologies, but who lack wisdom, skill and experience in management and business development. The part of the economy which employs the most number of mature age people is health, education and community services of one sort or another.
One of the more important recommendations in the report relates to the government developing, implementing and undertaking a national campaign to change the attitudes of our society towards ageing. Employers generally reflect those societal attitudes. It is rather interesting that we found in this inquiry evidence of systemic discrimination against older people. For example, in the decade to 1999, mature age workers were more likely to have been laid off or retrenched than people under the age of 45—51 per cent compared to 38 per cent.
The Drake company last year conducted a survey of 500 chief executive officers and human resources managers. Sixty-two per cent said that they would recruit from the 31- to 40-year age group; 23 per cent said that they would recruit only from the 41- to 50-year age group; and not one said that they would recruit someone over the age of 50. Recently, the chief executive of a major Australian company told me that he had recommended to his board the appointment of a man to look after a major component of that company's activities. The board refused to even read his CV once they got to the second line which stated his age as being 60, yet in the view of the chief executive of the company this person was by far and away the best qualified to manage that particular part of the company's activities.
 The Queensland Office of Ageing and the Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland in 1998 also conducted a survey of people in this age group. They found that 66 per cent, two-thirds, had experienced age discrimination and that one-third had been told that they were `too old' by the prospective employer.
One of the other key recommendations in the report is that there be a code of conduct developed for employers—to be appropriate to the size and nature of the business—which provides best practice guidelines for employers in terms of retrenchment, redundancy and dismissal processes. Some employers deal with this extremely well. Most are appalling in their management of it. Too often, still, do we see employees simply go to gates that are locked on Friday night with their last pay cheque. Often, when I was practising medicine, the first I knew that someone had lost their job was that two months later the wife would turn up with psychological distress or, in some cases, evidence of domestic violence, or children presented with bedwetting. That rather poignant subtext of The Full Monty, of the man who loses his job and then is too ashamed to tell his family that he has lost it, I can sadly tell you is day-to-day reality for a number of Australians. In my relatively affluent electorate on the upper North Shore of Sydney I have known men to catch the train `to work' every day, having been unemployed for three months, too ashamed to tell anybody that they no longer have work. 
There surely is a better way in which we can manage retrenchment, redundancy and dismissal. If we can get early interventions, if we can say to employers, `Here are the agencies, government and non-government, available in your area, and here is a checklist of the things you ought to go through when you are dismissing somebody'—keeping in mind that often the employers themselves are in trouble—then that has to produce a better outcome for everybody. For example, the Business Council of Australia told us during the inquiry that the cost to society of a poorly managed work transition is between $50,000 and $150,000. In my previous life—when I had one, perhaps—I dealt with some of the more extreme elements of the medical profession and some of the worst aspects of it, when I was chairing the ethics and professional conduct committee in its processes. It is a bit like the doctor who simply says to the patient, `You've got cancer. You will be dead in three months.' Some employers treat their employees just like that. We saw people who had been frogmarched out of buildings and terrible things done. If we can deal with this issue more humanely, in a more orderly way and get people through that period—hopefully short—of unemployment and back into work, that is in everybody's interests.
One of the key recommendations is the idea that we put significant effort into computer literacy and training for people over the age of 45. Probably we who are sitting in this room—I will include the member for Hinkler in this because I know how skilled he is in this area—grew up with computers. I must say that the first time I did see a computer was, I think, in the second year of my university degree. But among people over the age of 45 you have at least two generations of working age for whom computer training was not a fundamental part of their education. In the same way that the government has put significant political and economic effort into basic literacy and numeracy training for our children, recognising that it is essential for developing full potential, we need to start to put that kind of effort into computer literacy and training for people over the age of 45. Increasingly, you cannot function fully in modern society unless you know how to turn a computer on and also to have access to it.
There are already a number of programs which are available to anybody who wants to go and learn to use a computer. But computer illiteracy, like illiteracy itself, is something about which people feel a sense of shame or deeply embarrassed. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you in particular have some experience of this and know what I am talking about.
 The Australian newspaper recently ran a series on the divide in Australia between extremes of wealth and poverty. There was a woman from Hobart, who was 62, who said, `I can't use a computer. I feel so ashamed to talk about it.' As the economic and social changes that are being worked into Australian society proceed, where we see people in some of our regions and country areas in particular who are at the epicentre of these changes, and as we see people being displaced from labour intensive industries who have never had to use a computer in the jobs in which they have been working—disproportionately represented in mining, agriculture and manufacturing, for example—what we ought to be doing is placing real emphasis in a national training program on those people to give them the skills that they need, in a rudimentary sense, to be a part of modern society and have reasonable confidence of finding another job.  
One of the other things that is equally important is the idea of longitudinal research, of governments having the courage, if not the wisdom, to invest in researching the impact of age balance in a work force. One of the myths that many employers carry is that an older person is less resilient, that they are less adaptive to change, that they are more likely to suffer occupational disease and injury, that they are more likely to be prone to absenteeism, that they are not likely to stay working for you for a longer period of time. In fact, all of the evidence that we saw, both scientific and anecdotal, internationally and less so domestically, defies that very myth. If you employ someone at the age of 55, that person is more likely to work for you for 10 years than someone who is 25, I can most certainly assure you. 
I commend the report to the executive of the government. I hope that both the opposition and the government are able to agree on a number of recommendations at least, and that some of the recommendations in this report become policy. Not for my sake—chairmen of all committees think their reports are wonderful, of course. It is for the sake of the people whose lives are documented in this report that I really do urge the government in earnest to consider its recommendations. And if they are not going to be recommended, I would certainly like to see some compelling evidence as to why that ought to be the case. Thanks very much.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I wish to associate myself with many of the remarks made by the previous speaker, Dr Nelson. Many of the things that he said this morning and many of the things the House of Representatives Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee said in its report, Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers, are very worthwhile recommendations and warrant the government's closest consideration. In my remarks I want to pick up two aspects referred to by the committee in its report. The first concerns mature age people starting their own business, and I will make some remarks about that. The second, which I will comment on later, is the committee's recommendation concerning access to superannuation entitlements for people aged over 55.
In the report, in the section `Establishing a small business—a high-risk option', the committee makes what strikes me as a very accurate statement:
It is imperative that mature-age people considering starting their own business be adequately counselled concerning the opportunities and risks and what they should do to increase their chances of success. Training is vital to small businesses as many are competing for clients against medium and large organisations, whose staff are trained and experienced.
Other members would be well aware of the difficulties of running a small business, the dangers and risks that it involves. I have today, through reading a report in the Herald Sun, become aware of the plight of one such mature age small business owner. Mr Rob Weatherald owns and runs the Euroa BP franchise and has done so for 12 years.
This is very relevant to the report as he is in the position of being a small business owner who is facing the difficulties of engagement with a large and well-known multinational company, BP. Mr Weatherald has publicly raised the issue of temperature-caused shrinkage in petrol and the way BP and other oil companies profit from supplying fuel at higher temperatures, where the fuel subsequently shrinks in volume. 
 The report in the Herald Sun today indicates that the transport company, Brady and Kibble, spends $60,000 a month on diesel at that country service station. But on 18 August the company's manager, Alan Kibble, received a letter from BP saying that the company could receive a 4.6c a litre discount at other service stations, so if it was prepared to take its business away from BP Euroa it could get a 4.6c a litre discount. Mr Kibble, whose 10-truck business is based in Euroa, said: 
I feel for Rob. BP is punishing him because he spoke out. I don't want to take the work off him, but I have got to look after myself.
Mr Kibble also expressed concern that fuel prices would rise in the town because he would go elsewhere for fuel. He went on:
... Everyone in Euroa will be disadvantaged. I've lived in Euroa all of my life and should be supporting the town, not taking businesses away.
One of the Victorian Independent members of parliament, Russell Savage, is quoted in this article as saying:
If you expose any questionable business practices in the oil industry it seems you have your petrol cut off or are discriminated against.
I agree with Mr Savage. I think that this is taking on the same ugly appearance as the case of Mr Trevor Oliver, a former BP petrol station operator in Buangor, also in Victoria, who has lost his petrol business because he was prepared to blow the whistle on oil company price fixing. Some members may recall that after Easter this year Mr Oliver alleged that his distributor, Leahy Petroleum, had told him to raise pump prices by 7c for the Easter break. A media report at the time said:
Late yesterday, prices in Melbourne rose from 74 cents per litre to about 84 cents, while prices in Ballarat had also risen by about 10 cents to about 86 cents. Mr Oliver, who owns a service station in Buangor near Ararat, yesterday said in a statement to [ACCC] investigators that his local distributor, which distributes BP petrol, had told him that prices would rise by about 10 cents per litre. `I don't have any choice, they just jack your price up before you buy it,' Mr Oliver said. `It happens every public holiday, it can't be just pure coincidence.'
I think many motorists would recognise and be familiar with that. Companies claim this is demand and supply. Motorists, and obviously people like Mr Oliver who know something about these things, consider it to be price fixing. 
After he made these allegations public, Leahy Petroleum refused to supply him his fuel. Three months later he is still without supply and the ACCC, that praised him for breaking the culture of silence of price fixing, are still investigating the allegations. A newspaper report in April quoted the chairman of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, describing petrol station owner, Trevor Oliver, as courageous for breaking the `conspiracy of silence'.
—On a point of order, I do not quibble for a minute with the member's right to speak on this subject at some appropriate time but I think he might be on the wrong subject. This is a very long bow if it is relating to the matters before the chair.
—On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I am very surprised that the member for Hinkler wants to suppress a discussion about petrol pricing. But, as I indicated, there is a section in the report which indicates that mature age people considering starting their own businesses need to be adequately counselled concerning the risks involved, and the cases which I am drawing to the attention of the parliament emphasise examples of these risks. Indeed, it is a section of the report with which I completely agree.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—The honourable member has given an explanation. I accept his explanation and ask him to continue his remarks.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your ruling. Professor Fels said:
It's extremely important that someone has had the courage to come forward and speak up about these petrol pricing practices; there has been a conspiracy of silence over the years, which has made the task of detecting unlawful behaviour quite difficult—  
Professor Fels went on to say:
Frankly, the victims are scared, and when they come forward the commission will throw its full weight behind any investigation of alleged unlawful behaviour.
In the same article, the RACV manager of government relations, David Cumming, was quoted as saying:
... a climate of fear had existed within the petrol industry for many years, with operators receiving death threats if they tried to break away from price fixing.
Unfortunately, in this case the ACCC could not do anything to help Mr Oliver. He is still not receiving any petrol from BP. I am delighted to say that there is a Victorian government initiative involving the establishment of a fuel cooperative in Buangor. I applaud this move, but the ACCC needs to get serious about these issues. I note that other petrol retailers have identified these problems before a Senate estimates committee. For example, Mr Harris said:
Senator, if I could make a comment regarding pricing, for the last three years, probably more than three years, I have been purchasing my fuel on a franchise site, and I have been purchasing my fuel for more than I retail it for, so my wholesale purchase price is 100 per cent of the time dearer than I am retailing it for. Therefore, I have to rely on price support to retail my fuel. I do not call the shots. I am an independent business person, but when it comes to the retailing of my fuel, I am effectively under the control of the oil company regarding the price that I sell it for even as much as now.
I call on BP to immediately cease any attempt to discriminate against Mr Weatherald and to immediately cease any attempt to wreck his business. This is Australia. This is not some Third World, tin-pot dictatorship, and we will not stand for thuggery by large oil companies against their franchisees. The right to free speech in this country does not contain some exclusion clause exempting service station owners. Indeed, it is absolutely in the public interest that we are able to find out what is going on in the area of petrol pricing and, for that matter, LPG pricing.
I further call on the ACCC to get fair dinkum about its investigation of oil company price fixing—for example, the fuel grants scheme into which it is apparently conducting investigations now. The ACCC has been quite happy to name and shame in the cases of Video Ezy and other retailers; it has taken a kid gloves approach to the petrol companies.
Thirdly, I call on the government to act to protect Mr Weatherald and other service station franchisees from oil company thuggery. Frankly, the government has exacerbated this problem with its deregulation of wholesale prices. The Treasurer said in 1998 that deregulation would `promote greater competition which would lower prices over time' and that it would `put downward pressure on petrol prices to the benefit of consumers'. Those claims have proven to be rubbish.
What in fact needs to happen is for the government to pass Labor's bill to address the problem of the lack of wholesale competition in the petrol industry and the manipulation of petrol prices by the oil majors. Our private member's bill will address that lack of wholesale competition by giving service station franchisees a legislatively guaranteed right to shop around for up to 50 per cent of their petrol. That will increase competition at the wholesale level, curtail the influence the oil majors have over retail prices and produce lower retail prices for customers. The bill also provides the ACCC with enforcement powers, thus giving retailers the protection from retribution which they are entitled to and which they require.
I said that I was going to refer to another aspect of the report as well, and that is the report's recommendations concerning the issue of mature age people who are forced to draw on their superannuation until they are eligible to receive income support. Recommendation 28 of the committee's report states: 
The committee recommends that the Government re-consider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people aged over 55, who hare received benefits for at least 39 weeks. If necessary, a ceiling could be set on the amount of superannuation assets that are able to be excluded.
I welcome the call in this report by a number of coalition backbenchers for the government to reverse the changes that it made to the early release of superannuation rules back in 1997. In the Age counts report we see the recommendation that I have just read out that the government reconsider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people aged over 55. Labor has always opposed this harsh and unfair measure.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Before the Main Committee adjourned yesterday I was making some comments on the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations entitled Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers. The report discusses a number of issues facing people in their 40s and 50s in particular who suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves unemployed.
At the end of my comments yesterday I was specifically discussing the problems that mature age unemployed find in trying to re-access employment and re-enter the workplace. For instance, blue-collar workers, because many of them are in manufacturing industry where restructuring is going on, can find themselves suddenly unemployed. Many of these people who have not had post-secondary educational qualifications find it very hard to re-access employment. The committee recommends, therefore, that local Job Network providers should be involved in special training arrangements for mature age unemployed to provide courses that will assist them in re-entering the work force.
One of the areas in particular where a number of mature age unemployed need help is computer literacy and information technology. Many of them have not had to deal during their working lives with information technology, with computers, and yet the new jobs that they might want to access have those as basic and essential requirements. So the committee recommends that the government fund a national computer literacy training program for mature age workers to bring them up to speed on those computer literacy skills that will make them far more employable. I think it is an excellent recommendation. There is a lot going for it and it would certainly make it easier for a lot of those mature age workers to re-enter the work force.
Another way of assisting the mature aged back into the work force would be to assist in other areas of retraining, including traineeships and apprenticeships. The committee therefore recommends that the government introduce a special training subsidy for mature age people undertaking formal apprenticeships and formal traineeships. Under this government's new apprenticeship system, there is no age restriction to accessing apprenticeships and traineeships, but employers seem to be reluctant to take on older trainees or apprentices. So a special training subsidy for those employers may well encourage them to give that opportunity to mature age unemployed wanting to take on an apprenticeship or a traineeship. 
 One of the other problems in terms of trying to re-enter the employment market is the difficulty that many people have with respect to the cost of travelling to job interviews. I suppose that is not just a problem for mature age unemployed. The committee recommends that the government consider a transport reimbursement scheme for job seekers in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas who are experiencing transport difficulties. It recommends that a trial be conducted by Centrelink in several locations. As a member representing such an area, I would certainly like to see such a trial include the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury areas, because I know that some of my constituents have trouble travelling—and have trouble with the cost of travelling—to job interviews.
Another main area of the committee's report focused on the financial difficulties of the mature age unemployed. As I indicated in my comments yesterday, people in their 40s and 50s have often signed themselves up to fairly substantial, ongoing financial commitments—mortgage payments, children's education, et cetera. To suddenly find themselves unemployed can really create enormous strains. 
The committee has made a number of recommendations to try to ease this pain. Firstly, the committee recommends that greater assistance and incentive be given to those wanting to access part-time or casual work. Perhaps we could consider indexing the means test base. The committee recommends reducing the withdrawal rate for long-term mature age unemployed by 10 cents in the dollar. Secondly, the committee makes a number of recommendations regarding superannuation and access to superannuation. For instance, the committee recommends that the government reconsider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people over 55 who have received benefits for at least 39 weeks. If necessary, a ceiling could be placed on the amount of superannuation assets that are to be excluded. This would ease the financial pain a bit for those over 55 who really are trying to find employment and who cannot do so.
Thirdly, the committee makes some recommendations regarding mature age unemployed being able to access their superannuation to meet mortgage payments. As I said, people of this age often have significant mortgage commitments and finding themselves unemployed at age 45, 50 or 55 can create enormous strains The last thing that people in this position want is to be forced to sell their house because they cannot meet their mortgage payments, even though in many cases they have a fairly large amount put aside in superannuation. So the committee recommends some easing of access to superannuation for these people so that they can meet their mortgage payments.
The committee makes three specific recommendations in this regard. Firstly, it recommends that the government removes the 26-week waiting period before people on Newstart allowance benefits are able to access superannuation funds to meet their mortgage payments. The existence of mortgage commitments should be deemed to satisfy the financial hardship grounds for such access. Secondly, the committee explores the feasibility of allowing anyone over 45 to access their superannuation contributions for mortgage payment purposes in the immediate unemployment period up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Thirdly, the committee recommends that Centrelink publicise on the Internet and in other relevant publications that superannuation fund members who are receiving Newstart allowance benefits may access up to three months repayments and 12 months interest on the outstanding balance of a loan in order to make payments to save the family home from foreclosure. These recommendations would seem to me to be perfectly fair and reasonable for those people of a mature age who suddenly find themselves unable to meet their financial commitments and unable to meet their mortgage commitments because of their unemployment. 
Over recent decades, the toll of unemployment on those finding themselves unable to work has obviously been severe for people of all ages. Over the general business cycles when we have had recessions, including the last one back in 1991—the one that we supposedly had to have—along with the general process of industrial restructuring that has been going on in the country for decades, pressures have been placed on anyone who finds themselves unemployed. But as this committee's investigations have found, there are particular problems facing those of a mature age, in terms of discrimination, stereotypes in the work force, particular barriers making it harder for them to re-enter the work force, and particular financial hardships. This report makes a number of very worthwhile recommendations that would ease the pain and the financial, emotional and social suffering of the mature age unemployed, that would facilitate their re-entry into the work force and, for the community generally, would enable us to continue to use the rich resources provided by our mature age workers. 
It would be a terrible shame for our society, for our community and for our economy if the skills, the maturity, the experience and the work ethic of our mature age people were not able to be applied. That would be a terrible loss to our community. This committee makes some very valuable recommendations not only to assist those people to be reabsorbed into the work force for their own sake but also to allow the community generally to continue to benefit from the contribution that our experienced workers could make. We have certainly seen over the past four years under this government a steady ongoing decline in unemployment—from 8.6 per cent when we came into office down to 6.3 per cent now. Over 800,000 jobs have been created under the policies of this government.
—Not many full-time jobs.
—Most of them are full-time jobs. There is an obvious commitment to strong economic growth and to general policy directions that reduce unemployment and provide opportunities for all our unemployed. We need to continue those sound, strong economic policies that will provide opportunities for all our unemployed, but this report makes recommendations that will enable us to particularly target issues confronting mature age unemployment. I therefore commend the recommendations of this report to the committee and to the government.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The Age counts report before us today concerns a long neglected segment of our community. They are the long-term, older unemployed people. I refer to the statements made by the member for Dickson, Mrs Cheryl Kernot, in this place on Monday, 14 August 2000 in defining an older unemployed person as `40 years of age and over', whilst the report before us defines mature age unemployment as `45 years or more'. The definition of long-term unemployed is `people unemployed for two years or more'. I refer to my own party's policy document titled `Reconstructing the Welfare System', an authoritative text prepared by the shadow minister for family and community services, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan. At page 7 of the policy document, long-term unemployment is defined as `those out of work for longer than two years'.
The honourable member for Dickson's speech on 14 August highlights the thrust of the report before us today: that they, the long-term, mature age unemployed, have been taking an unfair share of the consequences of economic restructuring in this country. I have taken this government to task in this place on several occasions on the utilitarian ethic that drives the government. The Australian Labor Party policy document highlights this evil ethic that has racked and ruined so many in Australia. The honourable member for Dickson's words are apt. They are timely, for what we have in this government's so-called reform of social welfare is nothing more than the bludgeoning of the politically and economically weakest of our society. This government has divided the community into new heights of disparity between rich and poor never before seen in our country. Utilitarian value judgments between deserving and undeserving social welfare recipients are now made along economically driven directives. Cost cutting is the real name behind this so-called reform. This is the real agenda behind the Liberal Party's Fightback and subsequent agenda setting by the government. This government has marked the agenda along United States lines of labour market deregulation, wage cutting and pathetically low minimum wage setting. 
As a direct result of this government's policies, the shadow minister's policy document notes that Australia's long-term unemployment has risen as a percentage of total unemployment from just over 20 per cent of total unemployed in 1990 to over 30 per cent in 1998. This is against a backdrop of falling long-term unemployed as a percentage of total unemployed in the economies of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand. A further consequence is the rising dependence on social security in Australia. Now, one in four households, or 2.34 million households, in Australia live below the poverty line. Finally, the Gini coefficient—that is, the line of evenness of distribution of income through the economy—has demonstrated that we, as an economy, are becoming more unequal, with the coefficient of 0.446.
These are just some of the indicators that show the ineluctable conclusions that Australia is becoming a society of haves and have-nots, a society driven by utility rather than by social justice. The policies of this government are a cynical reminder of majority politics. They pander to middle Australians, they ignore taxing the richer portions of our community, particularly the corporations, whilst they make for misery of the most vulnerable—the long-term and mature age unemployed.
The report before us attempts to address these issues. It makes 38 recommendations, which on the whole are welcome. However, they are small in comparison with the ethical forces driving our economy. It will take more than the recommendations highlighted in the report to reduce the trend toward increased long-term mature age unemployment. It is the growing trend of utility based ethics that has led to this discrimination against mature workers. It is part of the entire economic system perpetrated by this government that discriminates against mature age workers.
It is now a competition between young and old. Mature age workers cost more in pay and benefits; they are less flexible to retrain. Their expectations are higher. They are wiser; they can stand up for themselves more. Consequently, they are the first to go. They are retrenched before younger persons. Put simply, the economy cake gets bigger but they get a smaller slice, or no slice at all. The larger portion of the cake goes to those who already have, and hence those people get more. The injustice is manifest.
I will not go through all the recommendations here. The report is in part a heart-wrenching confession of people suffering in silence severe economic hardship. People reaching the latter years of their life are being compelled to draw down on superannuation in advance of their retirement just to pay for day-to-day costs of living. By retirement, they are penniless and destitute. They become social security recipients and hence a further debt on our society. This is no fault of theirs. They made the effort to make provision for the future, in part by compulsory contribution but also by voluntary contribution.
The recommendations speak of various issues: education, awareness campaigns and even a code of conduct feature in bringing the matter to a head. There are recommendations for training courses, computer literacy, skills and career guidance, traineeships and apprenticeships for mature age workers. There are recommendations for alternative work arrangements, including part-time and casual work options, new business opportunities and eligibility for Newstart and other administrative changes. These recommendations and proposed adjustments are all individually welcome. However, the root of the injustice of the plight of the mature age, long-term unemployed is the utilitarian driven directives of this government. 
In short, the fundamentals are wrong. The government has created an economic environment which denies long-term mature age unemployed people the level playing field they deserve. Indeed, the playing field is not even. Mature age and young employees are not equal. They have differing skills and attributes. Mature age employees have the benefits of experience, knowledge and wisdom. Young people have the benefits of age and flexibility. These are generalisations, but they are the sorts of factors that lead to the very discrimination I have referred to. Further, they are the very factors behind the increase in the long-term mature age unemployed. This government has judged the long-term mature age unemployed to be less valuable than younger employees. They have been scrapped long before their expected retirement date; they have been declared surplus to requirements.
This ethic is based on the utility ethic of the greatest good for the greatest number. It is too bad that the mature age, long-term unemployed should fall on the side of the losers in our society. However, it is a reflection of the deliberate economic policies of this government that these are among the targeted members of society who have been singled out for discriminatory work relations which have, essentially, priced them out of the market. Cheaper, more pliable young workers are thought more suitable than experienced and more expensive alternatives.
I have personally seen the effect on the Public Service during my tenure as an employee of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. During that time I saw a spate of voluntary redundancy packages and forced retrenchments meted out to our Public Service. The effect is that we have witnessed a brain drain within our market that has truly diminished and weakened the intellectual capacity of the Commonwealth Public Service.
The cost of such decimation of the ranks is not easily measurable. Further, we will not see the effects of such decimation for many years. Simply, the demise of public and private sector skills means that there have already been shortfalls in skill levels throughout so many public and private sectors. In some cases, entire professions in Australia have literally been wiped out. I could mention personal representations in my electorate office in respect of building trades and, in particular, the tiling industry. It has come to the point where skilled labourers must be encouraged to migrate to Australia, as we have simply run out.
So too in the public sector: there has been a decimation of skill and experience in the administration of government in Australia, the like of which we have not seen before. A prudent public servant takes many years of experience to acquire a sufficient awareness of governance to be capable of serving as a true public servant. You cannot put an old head on young shoulders. It is true that it takes many years for a public servant to understand the policy implications of the rule of law, administrative law—including notions of procedural fairness—natural justice, privacy, responsible government and so forth. These are ethical issues that are the backbone of good governance. When these public servants walk out the door, they take their experience with them. This is what has happened in so many departments at federal, state and local government levels. This government, in its greed and utility driven wants for bottom line economic imperatives, sees it as more useful to employ a younger, inexperienced officer or to outsource for short-term contracts. The effect is that the ethic of good governance is never imparted. An entire culture is lost. This is the long-term cost of such short-sighted, financially and utility driven objectives. 
I say this in terms of the impacts of the report before us today. These recommendations are window-dressing. They do not address the fundamental inequities that have plagued the management of the long-term, mature age unemployed. The recommendations attempt to cover up a more fundamental inequality which is pervading the economy.
 I do not wish to go into the detail of the 38 recommendations made in this report other than to say that, yet again, the ambit of discussion in this parliament is typified by reductionism. The report reduces the issues to the banal, those piecemeal ameliorative measures that will blunt the hurt of the more fundamental factors which are the ultimate root of the problem. 
The report addresses problems that are by and large the creation of this government. The government has itself to blame for a market of its own making. This market envisions a world where mature, skilled workers are trashed because they are economically too expensive and politically expendable. The effect, as the shadow minister for family and community services so correctly notes, is the drain on national wealth.
What is the national wealth to which the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, refers? It is the skill and experience base I have been referring to during this entire speech. It is the entire infrastructure of that magical mix of experience and youth that is the hallmark of any successful economy, sport team or social endeavour. You do need both. You cannot run an economy with bias towards youth or maturity. The economy must be balanced. The government's policy has discriminated against the aged and, in doing so, introduced fundamental imbalances in the economy. These imbalances will come to plague Australia in the years to come. The Age counts report, while noble in its own reductionist way, does not address the fundamentals. 
National wealth requires an investment in people. This is not simply a cash throwing exercise. Fundamentals have been thrown into disarray. One particular fundamental assumption that is no longer an assumption is that a person has a job until they reach the age of 65. There is now no job security. A job for five years or even three years is considered long term. This trend affects all aspects of life including family building, house purchases and other fundamental family decision making. Whilst this government speaks so bravely about family and children, its economic policies reflect a contempt for the family, including the long-term, mature age unemployed who are discriminated against in being able to sustain a family. 
The opposition has articulated its own policy which is directed towards maintaining the national wealth of its people. Job security and reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty traps are at the heart of this policy. Again, I could go into a long litany of cost cutting which this government has undertaken in pursuing purported social welfare savings of over $5 billion during the 1998-99 budget. There are over 40 areas of cutbacks, too many to go into in any detail here. However, one trend is clear in the government's decisions. In terms of the government's direction they are targeting single parents, people with disabilities, long-term unemployed, and older unemployed. 
You see at a glance the consistency of the utilitarian ethic being played by this government. It is no accident that these four segments of our community are singled out for social attack. They are the ones who must pay for middle Australia's world of increasing share prices, affluence and hedonistic pursuits. These four groups are singled out to be the utilitarian losers who pay the unfair burden of the cost cuts whilst middle Australia enjoys the benefits. 
The alternative to this utility driven economics is a policy built on social justice. Social justice demands that each be given according to their due. This is the core of the opposition's policy response to this most inequitable government policy. Social justice notes the moral goods that are assailed by this government's policy. These include the right to work, the right to a fair income, and the right to the expectation that a person may live the latter years of their life with a degree of certainty.  
For too long the government relied on the legal administrative rule that government may make or unmake laws at will. This is an administrative right in the hands of government. This parliament can and does make laws which often backflip, saying `black' one day and `white' the next. This is both understood and necessary in any functional sovereign state. However, the policy shifts which this government has implemented have had severe deleterious effects on the future of mature workers in the work force. I include in the term `work force' those who are currently unemployed but who are actively seeking to work. 
Gap analysis is a term of art which has, as one definition, the policy loss of shifting from one set of laws to another; in short, what is lost or gained when laws are shifted. The laws relating to employment, industrial relations and training have all made their mark on the long-term and mature age unemployed. Again, it would take too long to go into any detail here. What are important are the ultimate reasons behind the conspicuous increase in long-term unemployed as a percentage of total unemployed. I put it to the parliament that the ultimate reason for this increase to 32 per cent is found in the gap analysis. The government's laws reflecting their implemented policy demonstrate the fruits of their policies. This is the measurable effect amongst many other non-quantifiable adverse effects such as the loss of skill base, wisdom and experience. 
The costs of national wealth and family insecurity are not liabilities on the balance sheet and are therefore selectively forgotten. This is the pervasive nature of ethics as this government presents them. This is the manner in which they dupe themselves into believing that an economic cost cutting exercise is preferable to the survival of a self-serving economy.
 The term `economic rationalism' has been used to describe what is really a policy of unbridled utility maximising pursuits of profit-driven public economies. It is truly not rationalist because its appeal to reason is predicated on the good it is maximising—that is, money. The government's blind pursuit of money has contaminated practically every policy, with other catastrophic consequences. The result has been to deny justice to those who are owed it. As the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, notes, welfare reform is a case of invest now or pay later. It is exactly the same economic/ecological question of any social cost. `Eco' is the Greek prefix for the word `household' and is therefore the common prefix to both words, `economy' and `ecology'. It is no mistake. You cannot refer to a house simply by reference to the living room and bedrooms. To speak meaningfully about the house, you must also refer to the kitchen, bathroom and laundry. So it is with welfare policy. It cannot be presented in terms of its bottom line economic cost cuts. It must be understood properly in its broader context of social impact.
Finally, this government must acknowledge the harm that it has caused by the relentless pursuit of its policy and further acknowledge the logical consequences of its actions. The opposition's policy document focuses clearly on the different policy platform of social justice, in sharp juxtaposition to the utilitarian approach of this government. We have highlighted the imperatives of the rights of rewarding work, the right of education and hence empowerment and flexibility of workers to shift their work environments. But, more importantly, the issue relates to the fundamentals, including the investment in children for the future, as well as the overhaul of the social welfare system, particularly in restoring the more than 40 social security net provisions which this government has either explicitly removed or reduced to impotence.

"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2000-08-31,"—Losing your livelihood after a lifetime of continuous work is a major life trauma. The issue of mature age unemployment will only become more pressing as Australia's population ages. I am pleased that this government has had the foresight to recognise the challenges we face and has attempted to devise and recommend some solutions. 
As a new member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, I have not been as integrally involved in this inquiry as others. However, I would like to congratulate the entire committee for tackling a difficult subject and coming up with a set of practical and worthwhile recommendations in the report entitled Age Counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers.
So much of our self-confidence and the person we consider ourselves to be are tied up in the career or job to which we have chosen to dedicate our life. Prolonged periods of unemployment take a financial toll on older people, but they also take a personal toll on the person's family life and their feeling of self-worth. Mature age unemployment has particularly harsh effects because at this stage people generally consider themselves to be at the prime of their working lives. In fact, there is significant evidence that the psychological stress of losing a job at an older age leads to a high incidence of illness and, in the more extreme cases, even to early death. 
Mature age unemployment also impacts on the wider community because those who leave the work force unwillingly are often unable to save for their retirement. This lack of retirement income threatens to become a serious problem as our population ages, because it forces working taxpayers to foot the bill of increased income support and health costs for a burgeoning generation. 
According to ABS statistics, in 1997 almost half the men aged over 45 were unemployed as a result of retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. It represents a tremendous loss of human capital which gives an insight into the consequences of being underprepared to deal with the changing nature of work. Australia has embraced the technology revolution with relish and those over 45 have not been able to keep up. These people have not grown up with technology and have difficulty adapting to a world where computer skills are as essential as a drivers licence. Becoming computer literate involves a major commitment and many mature age workers are not prepared to invest that much time and energy into learning new skills during what they see as the final years of their working life.
Age counts is a comprehensive report and its recommendations cover a wealth of areas. Although these issues need to be considered in totality, today I would like to focus on two specific areas: firstly, the devastating consequences of mature age unemployment; and, secondly, the remedy that many people in this position adopt—starting their own small business.
 In pure financial terms, the economic loss to the individual and their family of losing a job later in life is devastating. Even with income support, Treasury advice indicates that only about one-third of the net wages and superannuation is replaced. Older workers also tend to have greater ongoing financial commitments than younger people. In addition, many have dependent children to support through university education and aged parents to care for. Losing the income of the main breadwinner, which in older Australians is usually the male, can put an intolerable burden on family relationships. The report notes that a substantial number of relationship break-ups in the 40 years and over age group can be traced back to the male losing his job and his role as the main provider for the family.
In addition to the wage income lost, the mature age unemployed have the additional stress of being cut off from gaining the retirement income they were depending on, such as superannuation. Although award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee levy have increased retirement savings, last year the average balance in superannuation guarantee accounts was still only $8,000 or $9,000. The earlier a person becomes unemployed the more dependent they will become on the age pension. 
At the broader level, mature age unemployment puts a strain on the Australian economy by reducing current and future tax revenue, increasing welfare payments such as the age pension, and increasing spending on health, education and other social services. The result is lower economic growth. A submission to the inquiry indicated that, if the proportion of 50- to 64-year-olds receiving income support remains at the same level as in 1997, a further 460,000 people will be receiving payments by the year 2011. This will cost in the order of $3.6 billion each year. In reality, we can expect the bill to be even higher, due to our rapidly ageing population. In contrast, the report notes that if these older people were to remain in the work force they would add to the national economic output and save taxpayers billions of dollars in welfare support.
The loss of a job also entails the loss of the social and professional networks that come with it which limits the opportunity to find available jobs. In an attempt to avoid the feelings of dependency and financial inadequacy that come with unemployment, many mature age people attempt to start their own small business. It can be seen as an attempt by older people to buy themselves a job. Although the inclination is understandable, it is a risky strategy which can result in the person ending up in a worse financial position than they started with. The inquiry found that mature age people aged 55 or over are the group most likely to be self-employed. A recent survey found that, of 1,000 people who lost their jobs in 1998 to 1999, 33 per cent of those over 50 chose self-employment. But the Employment Strategies Council has estimated that only a tiny three per cent of small businesses are successful.
The consequences of business failure can be even more crippling than the loss of employment for older people. Most have invested their retirement income or redundancy packages in the business and their financial security hinges on its success. The committee's report states that less than 50 per cent of mature age people starting a new business had received any training. One of the key findings of the report is to ensure older people facing loss of employment should be adequately counselled about the risks of starting a business and strategies which can increase their chance of success.
The federal government has established a range of programs to help people setting up a new business. The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS, can be particularly useful to older people. Each year the NEIS program helps about 6,000 people with no previous business experience to get started. The committee was impressed with this program. I fully support the recommendation to expand the NEIS program to provide assistance to those people buying a franchise or an existing business. Although a more limited version of NEIS, called the self-employment development program, is available to those wishing to purchase an established business, it does not provide the full range of support services that NEIS does. However, the committee found that even successful schemes like NEIS must be tailored to the specific needs of mature age people which may involve more frequent face-to-face contact and assistance.
 Despite a wealth of government assistance and schemes designed to help fledgling small businesses, the committee found that there is a lack of awareness about their existence. A wealth of information is available through various web sites and the Business Entry Point, but mature age people often do not possess the computer skills needed to access it. In fact, in 1996 the business longitudinal survey found that less than seven per cent of micro-businesses made use of government programs compared with over 61 per cent of firms with 500 or more employees. This sort of information, combined with anecdotal evidence, has led the committee to recommend that the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business review the way it promotes government programs and disseminates information about the type of assistance available. It is a simple step but one that is clearly not being carried out effectively. 
My final point, which I will touch on briefly, involves older people's relationships with information technology. The committee found that mature age workers require specialised training to become computer literate if they are to participate fully in the work force of the new millennium. The federal government has invested in well-resourced programs to ensure that all school students are taught basic numeracy and literacy. Today computer literacy is almost as important as these other fundamental skills, and the government must institute similar literacy programs for mature age workers. In modern society it is increasingly difficult to function without a base level of computer skills. Without them, the mature age unemployed have difficulty finding work and, if they do, they are confined to low-paid jobs. 
Australia's ageing population makes it a necessity for our society to change its attitude towards the ageing. We must cultivate the recognition that older workers can be just as enthusiastic and motivated as younger ones. Employers need to acknowledge the unique skills that wisdom and life experience bring to a job. The federal government has taken the first steps towards addressing the unique challenges posed by mature age unemployment through this inquiry and now we must act upon the report and its recommendations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the report Age counts. I want to make two key points. First, I want to talk a little about mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley; and, secondly, I want to comment on the McClure report and its implications for the mature age unemployed.
I represent the Latrobe Valley—it is a key part of my constituency—and I must admit up-front that I feel very strongly about this issue. We hear quite a bit about the high levels of unemployment in the Latrobe Valley. I remind the House that the unemployment rate in that area is about 17 per cent in Moe, about 18 per cent in Morwell and about 11 per cent in Traralgon. Those are very high unemployment rates—especially when you compare the rates in those three towns, which are the three main towns in the Latrobe Valley, with unemployment rates in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne where, in some suburbs, unemployment has fallen to below one per cent. 
We have a structural unemployment problem in the Latrobe Valley. Much of the problem of mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley can be traced back to when the local power industry was deregulated and privatised. It is agreed by people on all sides of politics that that led to a reduction in the number of jobs in the power industry in the Latrobe Valley from 12,500 to about 2,500 over a period of five or six years. We lost a lot of jobs and many of those affected now constitute the mature age unemployed. 
 I want to make the point that, in considering those issues which are specific to mature age workers, we must not forget those issues which are specific to the mature age unemployed. We have a lot of skills in the Latrobe Valley, especially in traditional industries such as boilermaking, carpentry, fitting and turning, and the people carrying those skills are mostly those who are over 40 and have worked for many years in and around the industries in my constituency—namely, the power industry and the pulp and paper industry. Those people have a lot to give, a lot of skills and a lot of knowledge to pass on. Too often, though, we forget about those people. We rule them out of the equation and, too often, they are thrown on the scrap heap and forgotten about. We must never forget about these people because they do have so much to give, and so much knowledge to pass on to the younger generation. 
I speak to people right across my constituency who want to make a bigger contribution. They want to do more for their community. They have worked quite often in the one job in the one industry for a period of 25 or 30 years and they are still young men or women—mostly young men, I should point out, as they are mostly from traditional industries. They have worked for 25 or 30 years as a carpenter or as a boilermaker or as a tradesman in the different area, so they have a lot of knowledge and skills. And they are still less than 50 years old, so they have some years before they are really in a position to retire, or some years when they can still make a contribution before they feel that they should retire.
The public policy challenge for places like the Latrobe Valley is: how do you engage with these people who have so much to give and who want to give? How do you get them to contribute towards the other side of the unemployment equation in places like the Latrobe Valley? How do you marry their need to do more and the skills that they have, to giving the young people who are unemployed in such significant numbers in our district—some 35 or 40 per cent—the skills they need so they can get a job and a start? So far, there really has been no genuine effort by the federal government to deal with this very serious issue. We must not forget that nearly all of the problems that we have in the Latrobe Valley now in terms of structural unemployment and mature age unemployment are a direct result of national competition policy. So it is a federal government responsibility, because national competition policy was, of course, a federal government initiative. 
We need to do something, and it is not as though doing something for the mature age unemployed in the Latrobe Valley would cost a lot. What is required is an approach which brings together local government, state government and the federal government, as well as all of the education, employment and skills training providers in the district, so that we can have a whole of region approach to this very significant issue. Thus far, there has not been the leadership provided by the federal government to do that. That is a shame. We do a disservice to those people who need that cooperation for them to achieve their potential, for them to be given the opportunity to provide for a skills transfer to the next generation.
I note the member for McPherson in her contribution earlier made some good points about literacy and adult literacy. I want to pick up on what she had to say. So often we only hear about adult literacy, especially for those people who have come to us from countries where English is not spoken as the main language, and we only talk about adult literacy in the context of mutual obligation—that they must be do this, otherwise they will be kicked off the benefit that they receive from the government. 
We have to have a bigger vision of what we want to achieve when we talk about adult literacy. In an area such as mine, it is no good saying to someone who has been out of work for maybe five, six or seven years and who before that worked in the one job in the one industry, maybe as a boilermaker, a fitter or a carpenter, `You must do this adult literacy course or you will be kicked off unemployment benefit.' That is not the way to engage with that person, to encourage them to participate of their own free will. For adult literacy to mean anything, people have to want to gain it; they have to want to participate.
What benefit can that boilermaker, fitter or machinist—whatever trade he was in—see from taking part in this compulsory literacy program? Nothing. He cannot see any benefit in it, other than that he will get to keep his payment. We have to find a way whereby we say to him, `If you do this, you have got a very good chance of getting a new job, getting some new skills, or at least you will get the opportunity to pass on the skills that you have to other people,' because so much of these people's lives in their 50s and early 60s is about helping the next generation. I find it very humbling when I speak to these people because they are so selfless. Often they are not concerned so much about themselves or getting a job; they are concerned about passing on the skills that they have to the next generation so that the next generation can get a job. 
So we have to have a better approach: engaging with them, instead of just trying to use the whip hand by saying, `You must do this literacy course, otherwise you will be off your benefit.' What we have to say is, `Why don't you do this literacy course? We will encourage you to do it. We will provide you with some incentives to do it. And, if you do it, you have got a better than average chance of getting a job. Or we will find a way for you to pass on the skills that you have, using your new literacy skills, to other people.' I think that is something which they would feel very good about.
We must never lose sight of the need to encourage these people, who so often feel down about the fact that they are out of work, especially—I make the point again—people who come from non-English speaking backgrounds, where there is so much pride wrapped up in being the person who brings an income into the family. A lot of people feel that they are diminished as men if they cannot provide for their family. We must respect that and be sensitive to it. That is the new approach by the federal government which we need to see in its dealing with the serious issue of mature age unemployment in the Latrobe Valley.
The second point I want to make in this debate is to talk about the implications of the McClure report in the context of mature age unemployment. I think it would be fair to say that bipartisan support has been provided for the report's recommendations. This is a good thing. The recommendations of the report, in their entirety, provide a sound basis for some genuine moving forward on issues which have in the past been almost intractable. So I welcome that.
We need, however, to look very closely at the detail of the McClure report as it relates to those people who are mature age unemployed or who are on mature age allowance, to make sure that the recommendations of the report, when enacted, will not be of any disadvantage to those people, particularly people in that situation who are living in areas of very high unemployment such as the Latrobe Valley and other regions experiencing similar difficulties right across Australia. We need to be careful and watchful of the practical outcome of some of those recommendations. I would point out again that, in an area of very high unemployment such as the Latrobe Valley, if someone is required to apply for an unrealistic number of jobs or expected to get a job very quickly, that is just going to create an expectation which it is impossible to meet.
 What is going to happen when those people who are long-term unemployed do not meet that expectation? They are going to be punished by Centrelink. They are going to feel as though they are failures and that they have somehow not been able to complete the task set for them which people in other areas were able to complete. We need to be very sensitive to the requirements of the mature age unemployed and of  those people who are on mature age allowance in particular regions, such as the Latrobe Valley that I represent, where there is such a high structural unemployment problem.
I think most people would agree that the essence of the McClure report is good in moving people from welfare to work. That is what we want to see. There is a dignity in work, and the mature age unemployed in the Latrobe Valley have experienced the dignity of work. I would point out that there is a lot of sloppy talk around about people who are dole bludgers—people who are on the dole and who do not want to work. Hardly anyone in the Latrobe Valley would meet that phrase. The people in the Latrobe Valley came to the Latrobe Valley to work. That was the principle of migration to the Latrobe Valley. People came to work on the power station projects and related infrastructure projects in the district. They worked as soon as they arrived in Australia and the Latrobe Valley. 
I think it is a sad thing for people who have, in many cases, worked 25 or 30 years in that industry—and have really been fantastic contributors to the Latrobe Valley community—to feel as though they are dole bludgers because a few people use some sloppy talk when referring to people receiving unemployment benefits. I want to remind the mature age unemployed of the Latrobe Valley that we in the Latrobe Valley community do not think of them in that context. We recognise the enormous contribution that they have made. We see it every time we drive around the Latrobe Valley. We see the magnificent assets they have built with their labour. In conclusion, I welcome the contribution of the report, and I look forward to more discussion on this important public policy issue.
—by leaveFirstly, I would like to both thank and recognise all of the members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations who worked on the report Age counts. In particular, the member for Port Adelaide was extremely supportive throughout the process of the inquiry, as were the diligent, hardworking secretariat. We also received considerable assistance in the collection of data from the parliamentary library.
Australia is a country in which we define ourselves through our work. Usually within a few moments of meeting someone, they ask you what sort of work you do. If you do work for which you are not paid—if it is full-time parenting or volunteer work and, in particular, if you are unemployed—you feel that you are a lesser part of Australian society than those people who do work that is paid. Work places us in a social context. It defines the framework of our lives and it gives each of us a sense of belonging and meaningful purpose. In that sense, I agree most strongly with the member for McMillan, who said that most people are not unemployed through choice. Most people who rely on income support, whether it is unemployment benefits, Newstart, disability support and so on, are not there because they wish to be.
Being without a job is devastating, not only for your personal finances but also it exacts an extremely heavy social and human toll. Those of us who are privileged to be members of the parliament—and probably most, if not all of us, have had work before we came into the parliament—may not always know what it is like to not have a job. I think poets often describe it better than we do. Albert Camus said, `Without work, all life goes rotten'. Walter Greenwood described the living corpse of the unemployed in Love on the Dole. That may certainly be said of the many mature aged men and women whose lives touched this inquiry. Their often poignant and extremely moving stories underwrite what is emerging as a significant challenge for a nation whose population is ageing in the face of collapsing age dependency ratios.
 As our country moves from being an agrarian, labour intensive economy, one that has been built essentially on the exploitation of natural resources, to one that is dominated increasingly by a burgeoning, technology-driven set of industries in the services sector, many people over the age of 45 are finding themselves for the first time without work. For the first time in 20 or 30 years of having been continuously in the work force, they suddenly find themselves without a job and they feel that they are of no value to their families or, indeed, to society, which at times can be so cruel in the way it describes people who are unemployed. And certainly not all but, I would suggest to you, most, are not emotionally and technically prepared for what is a major life event.
Losing your job in Australia, after 20 or 30 years continuously in the work force, is like losing a partner. It is like losing a limb or a breast. It is something which requires you to go through a process of grief, significant bereavement, and then a process perhaps of adjusting, not just financially but emotionally, to this major transition. 
The ABS reported in 1997 that almost half of the men over the age of 45 in this country were out of the work force, through retrenchment, redundancy or retirement. Although the unemployment rate for mature age people is lower than the general unemployment rate—4.2 per cent versus 6.3 per cent—the rate of long-term unemployment is much higher and represents the tip of an iceberg of quiet anguish. But pleasingly, since 1996, the number of long-term unemployed over the age of 45 has declined from 69,600 to 56,000 in June 2000.
Central to the report's conclusions is the need for us to challenge and change the attitudes of society and employers to ageing. We live in a society that does not venerate and respect ageing. I think that there is much that Australians could learn, for example, from Asian immigrants, who place a very high value on senior members of the family and, indeed, on ageing. Skill, enthusiasm and adaptation to change are not the exclusive domain of the young. To the workplace must also be brought wisdom acquired through the passing of the years. 
It is rather interesting that the worst parts of the employment sector for age discrimination are the banking, finance and legal sector. The best part—that part of the economy which has the best age balance—is the IT sector, where you have got generally younger people who have grown up as a part of the Internet generation, who have ideas and skills in terms of computer technologies, but who lack wisdom, skill and experience in management and business development. The part of the economy which employs the most number of mature age people is health, education and community services of one sort or another.
One of the more important recommendations in the report relates to the government developing, implementing and undertaking a national campaign to change the attitudes of our society towards ageing. Employers generally reflect those societal attitudes. It is rather interesting that we found in this inquiry evidence of systemic discrimination against older people. For example, in the decade to 1999, mature age workers were more likely to have been laid off or retrenched than people under the age of 45—51 per cent compared to 38 per cent.
The Drake company last year conducted a survey of 500 chief executive officers and human resources managers. Sixty-two per cent said that they would recruit from the 31- to 40-year age group; 23 per cent said that they would recruit only from the 41- to 50-year age group; and not one said that they would recruit someone over the age of 50. Recently, the chief executive of a major Australian company told me that he had recommended to his board the appointment of a man to look after a major component of that company's activities. The board refused to even read his CV once they got to the second line which stated his age as being 60, yet in the view of the chief executive of the company this person was by far and away the best qualified to manage that particular part of the company's activities.
 The Queensland Office of Ageing and the Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland in 1998 also conducted a survey of people in this age group. They found that 66 per cent, two-thirds, had experienced age discrimination and that one-third had been told that they were `too old' by the prospective employer.
One of the other key recommendations in the report is that there be a code of conduct developed for employers—to be appropriate to the size and nature of the business—which provides best practice guidelines for employers in terms of retrenchment, redundancy and dismissal processes. Some employers deal with this extremely well. Most are appalling in their management of it. Too often, still, do we see employees simply go to gates that are locked on Friday night with their last pay cheque. Often, when I was practising medicine, the first I knew that someone had lost their job was that two months later the wife would turn up with psychological distress or, in some cases, evidence of domestic violence, or children presented with bedwetting. That rather poignant subtext of The Full Monty, of the man who loses his job and then is too ashamed to tell his family that he has lost it, I can sadly tell you is day-to-day reality for a number of Australians. In my relatively affluent electorate on the upper North Shore of Sydney I have known men to catch the train `to work' every day, having been unemployed for three months, too ashamed to tell anybody that they no longer have work. 
There surely is a better way in which we can manage retrenchment, redundancy and dismissal. If we can get early interventions, if we can say to employers, `Here are the agencies, government and non-government, available in your area, and here is a checklist of the things you ought to go through when you are dismissing somebody'—keeping in mind that often the employers themselves are in trouble—then that has to produce a better outcome for everybody. For example, the Business Council of Australia told us during the inquiry that the cost to society of a poorly managed work transition is between $50,000 and $150,000. In my previous life—when I had one, perhaps—I dealt with some of the more extreme elements of the medical profession and some of the worst aspects of it, when I was chairing the ethics and professional conduct committee in its processes. It is a bit like the doctor who simply says to the patient, `You've got cancer. You will be dead in three months.' Some employers treat their employees just like that. We saw people who had been frogmarched out of buildings and terrible things done. If we can deal with this issue more humanely, in a more orderly way and get people through that period—hopefully short—of unemployment and back into work, that is in everybody's interests.
One of the key recommendations is the idea that we put significant effort into computer literacy and training for people over the age of 45. Probably we who are sitting in this room—I will include the member for Hinkler in this because I know how skilled he is in this area—grew up with computers. I must say that the first time I did see a computer was, I think, in the second year of my university degree. But among people over the age of 45 you have at least two generations of working age for whom computer training was not a fundamental part of their education. In the same way that the government has put significant political and economic effort into basic literacy and numeracy training for our children, recognising that it is essential for developing full potential, we need to start to put that kind of effort into computer literacy and training for people over the age of 45. Increasingly, you cannot function fully in modern society unless you know how to turn a computer on and also to have access to it.
There are already a number of programs which are available to anybody who wants to go and learn to use a computer. But computer illiteracy, like illiteracy itself, is something about which people feel a sense of shame or deeply embarrassed. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you in particular have some experience of this and know what I am talking about.
 The Australian newspaper recently ran a series on the divide in Australia between extremes of wealth and poverty. There was a woman from Hobart, who was 62, who said, `I can't use a computer. I feel so ashamed to talk about it.' As the economic and social changes that are being worked into Australian society proceed, where we see people in some of our regions and country areas in particular who are at the epicentre of these changes, and as we see people being displaced from labour intensive industries who have never had to use a computer in the jobs in which they have been working—disproportionately represented in mining, agriculture and manufacturing, for example—what we ought to be doing is placing real emphasis in a national training program on those people to give them the skills that they need, in a rudimentary sense, to be a part of modern society and have reasonable confidence of finding another job.  
One of the other things that is equally important is the idea of longitudinal research, of governments having the courage, if not the wisdom, to invest in researching the impact of age balance in a work force. One of the myths that many employers carry is that an older person is less resilient, that they are less adaptive to change, that they are more likely to suffer occupational disease and injury, that they are more likely to be prone to absenteeism, that they are not likely to stay working for you for a longer period of time. In fact, all of the evidence that we saw, both scientific and anecdotal, internationally and less so domestically, defies that very myth. If you employ someone at the age of 55, that person is more likely to work for you for 10 years than someone who is 25, I can most certainly assure you. 
I commend the report to the executive of the government. I hope that both the opposition and the government are able to agree on a number of recommendations at least, and that some of the recommendations in this report become policy. Not for my sake—chairmen of all committees think their reports are wonderful, of course. It is for the sake of the people whose lives are documented in this report that I really do urge the government in earnest to consider its recommendations. And if they are not going to be recommended, I would certainly like to see some compelling evidence as to why that ought to be the case. Thanks very much.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I wish to associate myself with many of the remarks made by the previous speaker, Dr Nelson. Many of the things that he said this morning and many of the things the House of Representatives Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Committee said in its report, Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers, are very worthwhile recommendations and warrant the government's closest consideration. In my remarks I want to pick up two aspects referred to by the committee in its report. The first concerns mature age people starting their own business, and I will make some remarks about that. The second, which I will comment on later, is the committee's recommendation concerning access to superannuation entitlements for people aged over 55.
In the report, in the section `Establishing a small business—a high-risk option', the committee makes what strikes me as a very accurate statement:
It is imperative that mature-age people considering starting their own business be adequately counselled concerning the opportunities and risks and what they should do to increase their chances of success. Training is vital to small businesses as many are competing for clients against medium and large organisations, whose staff are trained and experienced.
Other members would be well aware of the difficulties of running a small business, the dangers and risks that it involves. I have today, through reading a report in the Herald Sun, become aware of the plight of one such mature age small business owner. Mr Rob Weatherald owns and runs the Euroa BP franchise and has done so for 12 years.
This is very relevant to the report as he is in the position of being a small business owner who is facing the difficulties of engagement with a large and well-known multinational company, BP. Mr Weatherald has publicly raised the issue of temperature-caused shrinkage in petrol and the way BP and other oil companies profit from supplying fuel at higher temperatures, where the fuel subsequently shrinks in volume. 
 The report in the Herald Sun today indicates that the transport company, Brady and Kibble, spends $60,000 a month on diesel at that country service station. But on 18 August the company's manager, Alan Kibble, received a letter from BP saying that the company could receive a 4.6c a litre discount at other service stations, so if it was prepared to take its business away from BP Euroa it could get a 4.6c a litre discount. Mr Kibble, whose 10-truck business is based in Euroa, said: 
I feel for Rob. BP is punishing him because he spoke out. I don't want to take the work off him, but I have got to look after myself.
Mr Kibble also expressed concern that fuel prices would rise in the town because he would go elsewhere for fuel. He went on:
... Everyone in Euroa will be disadvantaged. I've lived in Euroa all of my life and should be supporting the town, not taking businesses away.
One of the Victorian Independent members of parliament, Russell Savage, is quoted in this article as saying:
If you expose any questionable business practices in the oil industry it seems you have your petrol cut off or are discriminated against.
I agree with Mr Savage. I think that this is taking on the same ugly appearance as the case of Mr Trevor Oliver, a former BP petrol station operator in Buangor, also in Victoria, who has lost his petrol business because he was prepared to blow the whistle on oil company price fixing. Some members may recall that after Easter this year Mr Oliver alleged that his distributor, Leahy Petroleum, had told him to raise pump prices by 7c for the Easter break. A media report at the time said:
Late yesterday, prices in Melbourne rose from 74 cents per litre to about 84 cents, while prices in Ballarat had also risen by about 10 cents to about 86 cents. Mr Oliver, who owns a service station in Buangor near Ararat, yesterday said in a statement to [ACCC] investigators that his local distributor, which distributes BP petrol, had told him that prices would rise by about 10 cents per litre. `I don't have any choice, they just jack your price up before you buy it,' Mr Oliver said. `It happens every public holiday, it can't be just pure coincidence.'
I think many motorists would recognise and be familiar with that. Companies claim this is demand and supply. Motorists, and obviously people like Mr Oliver who know something about these things, consider it to be price fixing. 
After he made these allegations public, Leahy Petroleum refused to supply him his fuel. Three months later he is still without supply and the ACCC, that praised him for breaking the culture of silence of price fixing, are still investigating the allegations. A newspaper report in April quoted the chairman of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, describing petrol station owner, Trevor Oliver, as courageous for breaking the `conspiracy of silence'.
—On a point of order, I do not quibble for a minute with the member's right to speak on this subject at some appropriate time but I think he might be on the wrong subject. This is a very long bow if it is relating to the matters before the chair.
—On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I am very surprised that the member for Hinkler wants to suppress a discussion about petrol pricing. But, as I indicated, there is a section in the report which indicates that mature age people considering starting their own businesses need to be adequately counselled concerning the risks involved, and the cases which I am drawing to the attention of the parliament emphasise examples of these risks. Indeed, it is a section of the report with which I completely agree.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—The honourable member has given an explanation. I accept his explanation and ask him to continue his remarks.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your ruling. Professor Fels said:
It's extremely important that someone has had the courage to come forward and speak up about these petrol pricing practices; there has been a conspiracy of silence over the years, which has made the task of detecting unlawful behaviour quite difficult—  
Professor Fels went on to say:
Frankly, the victims are scared, and when they come forward the commission will throw its full weight behind any investigation of alleged unlawful behaviour.
In the same article, the RACV manager of government relations, David Cumming, was quoted as saying:
... a climate of fear had existed within the petrol industry for many years, with operators receiving death threats if they tried to break away from price fixing.
Unfortunately, in this case the ACCC could not do anything to help Mr Oliver. He is still not receiving any petrol from BP. I am delighted to say that there is a Victorian government initiative involving the establishment of a fuel cooperative in Buangor. I applaud this move, but the ACCC needs to get serious about these issues. I note that other petrol retailers have identified these problems before a Senate estimates committee. For example, Mr Harris said:
Senator, if I could make a comment regarding pricing, for the last three years, probably more than three years, I have been purchasing my fuel on a franchise site, and I have been purchasing my fuel for more than I retail it for, so my wholesale purchase price is 100 per cent of the time dearer than I am retailing it for. Therefore, I have to rely on price support to retail my fuel. I do not call the shots. I am an independent business person, but when it comes to the retailing of my fuel, I am effectively under the control of the oil company regarding the price that I sell it for even as much as now.
I call on BP to immediately cease any attempt to discriminate against Mr Weatherald and to immediately cease any attempt to wreck his business. This is Australia. This is not some Third World, tin-pot dictatorship, and we will not stand for thuggery by large oil companies against their franchisees. The right to free speech in this country does not contain some exclusion clause exempting service station owners. Indeed, it is absolutely in the public interest that we are able to find out what is going on in the area of petrol pricing and, for that matter, LPG pricing.
I further call on the ACCC to get fair dinkum about its investigation of oil company price fixing—for example, the fuel grants scheme into which it is apparently conducting investigations now. The ACCC has been quite happy to name and shame in the cases of Video Ezy and other retailers; it has taken a kid gloves approach to the petrol companies.
Thirdly, I call on the government to act to protect Mr Weatherald and other service station franchisees from oil company thuggery. Frankly, the government has exacerbated this problem with its deregulation of wholesale prices. The Treasurer said in 1998 that deregulation would `promote greater competition which would lower prices over time' and that it would `put downward pressure on petrol prices to the benefit of consumers'. Those claims have proven to be rubbish.
What in fact needs to happen is for the government to pass Labor's bill to address the problem of the lack of wholesale competition in the petrol industry and the manipulation of petrol prices by the oil majors. Our private member's bill will address that lack of wholesale competition by giving service station franchisees a legislatively guaranteed right to shop around for up to 50 per cent of their petrol. That will increase competition at the wholesale level, curtail the influence the oil majors have over retail prices and produce lower retail prices for customers. The bill also provides the ACCC with enforcement powers, thus giving retailers the protection from retribution which they are entitled to and which they require.
I said that I was going to refer to another aspect of the report as well, and that is the report's recommendations concerning the issue of mature age people who are forced to draw on their superannuation until they are eligible to receive income support. Recommendation 28 of the committee's report states: 
The committee recommends that the Government re-consider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people aged over 55, who hare received benefits for at least 39 weeks. If necessary, a ceiling could be set on the amount of superannuation assets that are able to be excluded.
I welcome the call in this report by a number of coalition backbenchers for the government to reverse the changes that it made to the early release of superannuation rules back in 1997. In the Age counts report we see the recommendation that I have just read out that the government reconsider its decision to include superannuation assets in eligibility assessments for Newstart payments for people aged over 55. Labor has always opposed this harsh and unfair measure.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Mr Deputy Speaker,  I know that the matter I am going to speak about is a matter you would be very interested in too. Today I want to speak about a very special school in my electorate. I will be visiting the Wangee Park School tomorrow to officiate at the opening of the school's interactive sensory garden. Wangee Park School received a Centenary of Federation grant to develop this garden during 1999-2000. They have provided a computerised sound system, and a special sand and water table and some sensory frames have been designed and built especially to cater for the needs of disabled students and community members.
The history of this garden goes back some six years when staff first attempted to take the sensory experience students were having in the classroom out into the outdoors. The community helped with the design and planning of the garden but it was not interactive for the students. The garden has been very useful, however. Many celebrations such as birthdays have been held there, and herbs growing in the garden have been used for cooking classes. Students have been taken on an individual basis around the garden to touch, smell and look at the different plants and mobiles in the garden. This Federation of Centenary grant will help make the garden interactive and thus more enjoyable and meaningful for the students.
The computerised sensor system will react when students go around the garden. More mobiles and chimes have been installed and the sensory frames will enable students to interact using a combination of senses—touch, feel, smell, movement, sight and sound. The sensory table will allow children to experience water play, sand play and other tactile activities. Already three community groups are accessing the garden and sensory equipment at the school, as are other special needs students in the area. Tomorrow will be my first visit to the school. I am very much looking forward to it as I have heard so much about it and the high esteem in which it is held. 
Wangee Park School is a government school for children who have very severe intellectual and physical disabilities. Currently it has 26 enrolments in four classes with students ranging in age from four to 18 years. All the students have specialised educational programs which support their individual needs. Since it opened in 1985 the school has had a relatively stable staff with little change. The teachers under the leadership of the principal, Diana Humphreys, are a very caring and dedicated group of people. It is more than a job for them, and their dedication is reflected in the atmosphere of the school. I have been told by one of my staff, the Mayor of Canterbury, that there is a great feeling about the school. I am looking forward to experiencing that myself tomorrow when I visit. 
While it is a government school, it does supplement its basic level of resources through donations and fundraising, and it has already enhanced the facilities that are available not only to its own students but to the nearby community groups. There is a sensory room already established at the school, and the garden will supplement the experiences offered by the sensory room. Like me, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be wondering just what a sensory room and garden offer. The school has developed its sensory enrichment program in response to the special needs of its students. It focuses on the development of the sensory skills—that is, vision, hearing, touch, feel, taste and movement. The sensory program supports the students' general classroom programs which aim at developing their communication skills, their general functional skills, their social and interpersonal skills and, most importantly, their self-awareness and self-esteem.
The school assists its students in many other ways. There is a school therapy team with physio, speech and occupational therapy assistance available. As far as possible, however, students enjoy the same important aspects of school life that students in other schools enjoyschool assemblies, music and drama activities, sport and access to library facilities. As I noted earlier, it is by all reports a most remarkable school, with a dedicated staff, a very supportive community and students who are being encouraged and nurtured.
Tomorrow is a very special day for them with the opening of this garden and it will be for me. It will be a privilege for me and other members of the community who will be there for the opening of this garden to be able to both support the parents and the teachers in the work they are doing and show to the young people at the school how supportive we are of the education program that is there for them and their participation in that program.
I would like to thank both the school and the people who were on the local Centenary of Federation committee for choosing this project and a couple of other projects that will be opening in my electorate in the next few weeks. I would like to thank particularly Kevin Stewart, the chairman of the committee, who put in a lot of time assessing the various applications that the committee received. I think this is one of the most important projects that the committee oversaw.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Watson Electorate: Wangee Park School</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-08-31,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
	(1) Defence has identified approximately 80 different allowances and entitlements paid to civilian and military personnel.  The introduction of the GST, and any consequential increase in the cost of goods and services, will have no affect on the purchasing power of Defence personnel.
	Most allowances paid to Defence personnel attract income tax.  The buying power of these allowances will not be affected by the introduction of the GST.  Defence personnel will benefit from considerable income tax cuts and consequently will receive an increase in the `after tax' amount of these allowances.  This will cover any increase in the cost of goods and services.
	In addition, all allowance rates are reviewed on an annual or biannual basis.  These reviews will take into account the total impact of the New Tax System, including the abolition of wholesale sales tax, on the purchasing power of allowances.  Recently, travelling allowance rates have been reviewed.  The new rates include an adjustment for the anticipated impact of the GST. 
	Where allowances are paid to enable personnel to purchase specific goods and services, the rate of these allowances will be amended by application of the Australian Bureau of Statistics GST-inclusive CPI.
	(2)	(a) None. 
	(b) Subsidised meal charges have been adjusted to take into account movements in the food component of the CPI and the impact of the GST.  Increases in meal charges range from 6.25% to 8.45%.
	(3) Defence is committed to the principle that personnel should not be financially disadvantaged by the impact of the GST.  Defence has conducted a comprehensive review of personnel entitlements and allowances to determine the impact of the New Tax System.  The review has found that the GST will not impact negatively on personnel entitlements.  In addition, a Defence booklet providing personnel with information about the treatment of Defence allowances and entitlements under the New Tax System has been distributed to all personnel.
	(4) None.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Allowances and Entitlements</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,22,1,answer
