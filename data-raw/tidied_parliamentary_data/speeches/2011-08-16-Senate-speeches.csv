Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:49):  Just prior to going to that I present the government's response to the report of the Senate Environment and Communication Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills and seek leave to have the documents incorporated into Hansard.


Leave granted.



The document read as follows:




Government Response to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry on the:





Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 [Provisions]





Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 [Provisions]





Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 [Provisions]



The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee presented its final report on 27 May 2011. The Committee’s report made nine recommendations. The Government’s response to each of these recommendations is set out below.




Recommendation 1 





2.36 The committee recommends the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. The Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) has been designed to address these issues. 


An activity will be considered additional under the CFI if it is not common practice in an industry or under specific regional or environmental conditions. This common practice test will ensure that early movers who have already adopted more sustainable practices are eligible to participate in the scheme. Credits will be able to be earned from activities that reduce or store carbon from 1 July 2010.


The CFI will also recognise projects that were set up under some other abatement schemes – such as Greenhouse Friendly and the ACT and NSW governments’ Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme – and provide an incentive for these projects to continue. To be eligible for CFI credits, these projects will still need to be conducted under an approved CFI methodology and meet other scheme requirements including additionality. 


The CFI legislation contains several provisions to ensure projects do not have adverse impacts on the environment or communities. 


The CFI excludes high-risk activities through a “negative list”, which will be in regulations. Activities that pose a significant risk for the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment or local communities will be included on the negative list. These activities will not be eligible to receive carbon credits under the CFI. 


The Government has released for consultation an indicative list of activities that would be excluded from the scheme. For example, the list includes establishing an identified weed species as a reforestation project. The Government will continue to consult local communities, industry and other stakeholders on the negative list, including when methodologies are proposed for new activities. 


All CFI projects will have to comply with any applicable water, planning and environment requirements, and obtain all necessary government approvals, before they are eligible to receive credits under the scheme. 


In addition, project proponents will need to take account of regional natural resource management (NRM) plans. As part of its Clean Energy Future plan, the Government will provide $44 million over five years to improve existing regional NRM planning for climate change. Regional plans will provide guidance to landholders on the type and location of carbon projects that will provide social and environmental benefits, and avoid adverse impacts. 


The Biodiversity Fund will provide additional incentives for CFI projects that establish, restore or protect biodiverse carbon stores. The ongoing Biodiversity Fund is part of the Government’s plan for a clean Energy Future and will provide close to $1 billion in support for biodiversity over its first six years.




Recommendation 2 





2.37 The committee recommends the government consider what more can be done to fast track development of methodologies, and to develop and test the workability of carbon offsets projects in key agricultural industries. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


The Government has already invested more than $46 million in research and development through the Climate Change Research Program on ways of reducing pollution and helping Australian farmers adapt to a changing climate. The Climate Change Research Program is addressing the need for research into reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The outcomes from the program will be available by mid 2012 and will assist government and industry to develop new carbon estimation methodologies.


As part of the plan for a Clean Energy Future the Government’s Carbon Farming Futures - filling the research gap program will provide a further $201 million over six years. This program will focus on research into new ways of storing carbon and reducing pollution in the land sector. $20 million will be available to convert research into practical carbon estimation methodologies for use under the CFI. 


In addition, the Government will provide a total of $99 million in direct support for landholders to take action on the ground, including testing new ways to increase soil carbon and reduce pollution. This will include a refundable tax offset to encourage the uptake of conservation tillage farming techniques and participation in soil carbon sequestration research. Like all conservation tillage practices, no-till works to improve the organic matter in the soil by retaining crop stubble. It aims to reduce soil disturbance, minimise damage to soil structure, increase nutrient availability and reduce water loss by increasing soil water holding capacity. 




Recommendation 3 





2.49 The committee recommends the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


Carbon dioxide cycles between the atmos­phere, oceans and land biosphere. Its removal from the atmosphere involves a range of processes with different time scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that around 50 percent of the increase in CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, and a further 30 percent will be removed within a few centuries. The remaining 20 percent may stay in the atmosphere for many thousands of years. 


In this context, 100 years has become the internationally accepted timeframe for ensuring that sequestration is equivalent to (and can be used to offset) emissions. Under the CFI, sequestration projects can be terminated without having to pay back carbon credits after 100 years.  


The Government will monitor international developments on this issue and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international scientific and policy consensus on this matter. 


It should also be noted that the CFI permanence obligations allow significant flexibility. Landholders would be able to cancel their sequestration project at any time by relinquishing the number of credits issued for the project. 




Recommendation 4 





3.31 The committee recommends that in developing the negative list the government takes care to preserve abatement incentives, for example by tightly defining excluded projects to reflect local environmental conditions or circumstances. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation.


To maintain abatement incentives wherever possible, the negative list will be tightly defined to identify the specific circumstances where particular activities have significant risks of adverse impacts. 


To ensure that activities on the negative list are appropriately defined, the Government will consult with stakeholders before adding to or amending the negative list. The negative list will be included in regulations and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.


The CFI Bill also provides for reviews of the operation of the CFI, with the first review to be completed by 31 December 2014. This will present a further opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the negative list in ensuring that the CFI does not provide incentives for activities that could have adverse social or environmental impacts.  




Recommendation 5 





3.46 The committee recommends the government consider options for improving the capacity of natural resource management plans to take account of climate change mitigations options and adaptation needs, and to maximise the broader environmental and social benefits of the Carbon Farming Initiative. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


Regional NRM organisations are well placed to help plan for climate change and to maximise the social and environmental benefits of carbon farming projects. Through Government initiatives such as Caring for our Country, regional NRM organisations have had nearly a decade of experience in providing information, training and support to land managers and environmental, Indigenous, and community groups on sustainable land management.


As part of its Clean Energy Future plan, the Government will provide $44 million over five years through the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund. NRM organisations will develop plans to guide where carbon farming projects should be located in the landscape. These can be used by landholders to identify and develop carbon farming projects that provide maximum social and environmental co-benefits. The fund will also support research and analysis to develop scenarios on regional climate change impacts which can be used for NRM and land use planning.




Recommendation 6 





3.47 The committee recommends the government consider further changes to regional natural resource management plans to improve their governance and consistency, such as by requiring each plan to: 



be managed by a statutory authority; 


address the same basic criteria, at a minimum; and 


be enforced to the same standard. 


Response:  The Government notes this recommendation. 


The Government’s $44 million Regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) Planning for Climate Change Fund will enable the production of NRM plans in each region to a highly professional, nationally consistent standard, to guide where CFI projects, such as tree plantings and avoided deforestation, should be located in the landscape to avoid unintended negative impacts and maximise the carbon co-benefits for biodiversity, water and agricultural production.


The 56 regional NRM organisations that develop these plans are currently a mix of statutory authorities, public companies limited by guarantee and incorporated associations. The nationally consistent standards for the plans will be designed to ensure regional NRM organisations provide the required information and detail in the plans to guide CFI projects.


The Government will establish a new statutory body, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Advisory Board, which will report to the Government and annually to the Parliament about implementation of the land sector measures, including the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund, announced as part of the Government’s plan for a Clean Energy Future. 




Recommendation 7 





4.15 The committee recommends the government address obstacles to indigenous participation in the CFI, including resolving outstanding uncertainties in relation to participation by holders of non-exclusive native title.



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


The Government is committed to helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders benefit from carbon farming. 


As part of the Clean Energy Future plan, the Government has committed $22 million over its first five years to an Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund that will assist Indigenous communities to benefit from the CFI. Funding will be provided for specialists to work with Indigenous communities on carbon farming projects. Funding for research and reporting tools for CFI methodologies will also create further opportunities for Indigenous Australians.


Under the CFI, Indigenous landholders will be able to earn carbon credits for activities including improved savanna fire, livestock, feral animal, fertiliser, soil or forest management, reforestation and vegetation regrowth. 


The Government has made the development of a methodology for savanna fire management a priority. This is an activity which is likely to have high indigenous participation and social co-benefits for Indigenous communities.


The legislation makes it easy for holders of exclusive possession native title to undertake abatement projects and to receive carbon credits. The legislation also provides for holders of determined native title to consent to sequestration projects undertaken by other interest holders on their land. This will enable Indigenous land holders to negotiate a share of the benefits from carbon farming projects. 


The Government is consulting stakeholders about the circumstances in which native title claimants will need to give their consent to projects conducted on land where there are native title interests. Complex legal issues are involved, and any outcome will be consistent with the Native Title Act and Racial Discrimination Act.




Recommendation 8 





4.24 The committee recommends the government make clear that Kyoto-compliant credits will be linked to any future carbon price mechanism. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Government has agreed to link Kyoto-compliant credits with the carbon price mechanism. This will increase incentives for landholders to reduce or store pollution. 


Kyoto-compliant activities include reforestation, savanna fire management and reductions in pollution from livestock and fertiliser.


During the initial fixed price period, liable parties under the carbon price will be able to meet five per cent of their obligations using carbon credits generated under the CFI. In the flexible price period, there will be no limit on the use of credits generated under the CFI.


The CFI non-Kyoto Carbon Fund will provide incentives for other activities that are not part of accounting for Australia’s Kyoto Protocol target, such as revegetation and soil carbon projects. This fund will be worth $250 million over the first six years of the program.


Australia will continue working to develop new international rules that recognise a wider range of action on the land to reduce carbon pollution.




Recommendation 9 





4.26 The committee recommends that, subject to the recommendations contained elsewhere in this report, the Senate pass the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011; the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011; and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011.



Response:  The Government supports this recommendation.


The CFI package of bills will pave the way for farmers, forest growers and landholders to generate saleable carbon credits for domestic and international carbon markets. This will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land and waste sectors which currently make up 22 percent of Australia’s emissions.




Senator LUDWIG:
  Thank you. Also prior to going to the specific amendments, can I continue from where I think Senator Feeney may have left off. Senator Nash, as I understand it, was asking about the types of projects that would be eligible and the availability of the regulations. We have today published the exposure draft regulations that set out the sorts of projects that can and cannot be included in the government's Carbon Farming Initiative and provides protection for the farming sector and the environment.


The government released in key details for regulation a public discussion paper before the coalition made these claims, but we have now released a draft of the key regulations which take feedback from over 50 submissions into account.


The government's Carbon Farming Initiative has, as I think you have heard me reiterate a number of times, been carefully designed to avoid any adverse impacts on food security and the environment, including water, while working to unlock important greenhouse gas abatement opportunities across regional Australia. It is about providing opportunities in these areas through the Carbon Farming Initiative. The draft regulations set out and include a negative list of excluded activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The negative list identifies activities that are ineligible in certain circumstances because they risk adverse impact on biodiversity, water, communities or employment. To give you an example: the managed investment scheme for forestry. The Carbon Farming Initiative additionality test requires projects to go beyond what is required by law. These draft regulations also set out a positive list of activities that go beyond common practice in the land and waste sectors. This will ensure that only projects that are genuinely additional to common practice are credited under the Carbon Farming Initiative.


In contrast, the coalition appear—and perhaps we will have clarity on this—to want a scheme in which politics rather than science and evidence dictates activities that will be eligible. Such an approach would have no credibility in carbon markets or with the community. Instead, it would simply reinforce the suggestion that their subsidies for polluters policy is in essence just a big pork-barrel for the National Party. The Liberals on the other side should stop playing politics and support the government's efforts to reward farmers who are taking action on climate change. I understand that the Liberals opposite may not get the support of their coalition partners, the National Party, but, quite frankly, the Liberals should pursue sensible policy.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:55):  Turning to where we are at in the program—and I am sure that we are all keen to pursue the amendments that are set out for this bill—we are up to items 3 and 4, Senator Xenophon's amendments to clause 56, excluding offset projects, which includes the offset reporting period, excluded offset projects. The position that the government has adopted is that we oppose these amendments. They would shorten the maxi­mum reporting period. A five-year maximum reporting period provides flexibility—for example, it avoids reporting costs at the beginning or end of a project when forest growth rates are slow. The scheme integrity is maintained because credits are issued only after abatement has been achieved. They are the reasons we are not supporting these amendments. However, we accept that in principle Senator Xenophon is endeavouring to improve the bill. But in this instead these amendments would shorten the maximum reporting period.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:57):  I note for the record that the minister did not answer my question about his comment about pork-barrelling for the National Party more fulsomely. Perhaps before he makes a comment he should research it rather more thoroughly so that he can inform the chamber of what he is talking about. I also note for the record the fact that we have only just received the regulations that go with this piece of legislation. That is far from acceptable, given that it is precisely those regulations that we need to ask the questions about in this particular process. We have not had time to go through them in any detail whatsoever. As such, I indicate to the chamber that this may well be a rather laborious process while we try to understand what the minister has indeed put in front of us in terms of the regulations that relate to this legislation.


Senator Xenophon's amendment 4 refers to 4 part i, the availability of water, or part ii, land and resource access for agricultural production. The amendment states that the minister should determine that, if there is an adverse impact that relates to either of those two, the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project. Could the minister inform the chamber as to whether there is anything in these regulations that mirrors that requirement in the amendment from Senator Xenophon?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:59):  This amendment would allow environmentally or socially beneficial projects to bypass the additionality test. That is, in essence, the reason that it is unsound. The positive list is designed to ensure credits are only issued for emission reductions or increases in carbon stores beyond what commonly occurs already. The CFI includes a co-benefits index which recognises projects that have associated biodiversity and community benefits, but ultimately the market will determine what projects come forward, and those with important co-benefits will naturally stack up better than those without. With the way that Senator Xenophon's amendment is structured, it would simply bypass what we describe as the additionality test, and therefore it remains not supported.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:00):  Perhaps I was not quite clear enough in my question. I was specifically talking about the excluded offsets projects, specifically talking about the negative list. The way that Senator Xenophon's amendment is worded simply means that the minister must determine that, if there is an adverse impact on the avail­ability of water or on land and resource access for agricultural production then the project is automatically deemed to be an excluded offsets project. It is thereby saying that, if there is an adverse impact on water or on land and resource access for agricultural products production, it should automatically be an excluded offsets project. That seems to me to be quite straightforward and quite sensible. Perhaps I was not clear enough in my phrasing of the question, but is there anything in the regulations that have just been placed before us that would automatically deem to be an excluded offsets project an activity that is going to have an adverse impact on the availability of water or an adverse impact on land and resource access for agricultural production?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:01):  The short answer is yes. The government is committed to preventing adverse impacts on water availability. Through the negative list, the government will exclude plantation projects in high-rainfall areas unless they hold adequate high-security water entitlements, they are in an area that has a water management plan that has been accredited by the National Water Commission, they are environmental plantings or they address dryland salinity. This regulation will no longer be required once the National Water Initiative commitments are fully implemented across Australia, though. So the short answer is yes.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:02):  Madam Chair, it is good to be back. I think it has been five weeks since we have debated this amendment that I have moved, and I just want to recap for my colleagues—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Is it good that I'm back or good that we are all back?




Senator XENOPHON:
  Madam Chair, it is good that you are back; it is good that we are all back.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Sorry to interrupt you, Senator Xenophon!




Senator Birmingham:
  It's all good!




Senator XENOPHON:
  It's all good, despite the disapproving look of Senator Bernardi. But he's smiling now!


These amendments relate to the negative list. Amendment (4) states that projects which, based on advice by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on agricultural production should be on the excluded offsets project list. As I said in my second reading contribution, ensuring Australia's water availability is vital and I do not believe that it should be left up to regulations. 


This amendment also states that, where a forest was established as a managed invest­ment scheme, it too should be on the excluded offsets list. I note that, since we last debated this matter, the government has tabled the draft Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Regulations. In terms of types of excluded offsets projects, I note that, in division 12, clause 61, reference is made to forestry managed investment schemes, so they are covered. That of course is welcome, and I congratulate the government for going down that path. Obviously it was something that was within consideration. But this amend­ment goes further. It states that, if it is determined by the minister, on the advice of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on land and resource access for agricultural production, the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project.


What is at stake here is simply this—that a Carbon Farming Initiative project should be an excluded offsets project if it is going to damage the availability of water or if it is going to damage land and resource access for agricultural production. It is that straight­forward. It does not go against the integrity of what the government is trying to achieve, but it does give a safeguard in terms of food production and water availability. We know from the very contentious debate about coal seam gas on prime farming land—a different issue altogether—the importance of preserving the integrity of our water supply in this country. That is why it is important that this amendment strengthens those safeguards for both water and prime agricultural production.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:05):  I do not want to lengthen the debate on this, but the challenge is that the amendment would mean—and I think this is probably the objective you are trying to achieve—that this would in truth be unworkable. The minister in this instance, when making a decision, would have to exclude individual projects. Our schema is trying to achieve this in a broader sense. The process that you have entertained would add significantly regulatory complexity to the CFI and really undermine the participation within it, by requiring the minister to examine and make decisions to exclude individual projects. It would also create investment uncertainty for individual landholders, who would then have to be stacked up waiting to find out whether or not they would be excluded or included in that process. We have already committed to parliament to make regulations that would put forestry managed investment schemes on the negative list of projects that are excluded from the scheme. So in that way we think we have achieved the same purpose, rather than trying to do it in—if you will forgive my turn of phrase—a piecemeal way.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:06): I too do not wish to prolong the debate, but this is a very important issue in terms of water security and food security. Can I perhaps turn it around this way. The government says that this is a piecemeal approach; I think that this is a guaranteed approach. It is not piecemeal; it is a comprehensive approach to deal with this issue. But I will truncate the debate so that we can get to the core of the issue. The government says that it will not support this amendment, which disappoints me, but what I am concerned about is this: how does the government say it will set criteria in assessing whether a project is an excluded offsets project? How will it set benchmarks? How will it appropriately assess whether a project will have an adverse impact on water or an adverse impact on food production? If, for instance, there is a risk that it could affect the supply of water in a particular area—for interception, for instance, which is a real issue in our river system, and esteemed water economists and scientists such as Professor Mike Young, from the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, have talked about the issue of interception on many occasions—how will that be assessed? How will it be assessed whether a project reduces the production of a particular type of food grain in a particular area? How does the govern­ment take these matters into account? The government is saying, 'We agree with you that these are important matters, but this is not the way to do it.' How does the government say it will address these very important and fundamental issues?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:08):  From the government's perspec­tive, we think we have achieved that, if you look at the activities on the negative list, projects that were mandatory as at 24 March 2011. Activities that are specifically mandated by government regulations are not additional. Projects that were required by law as at 24 March 2011, when the CFI bill was introduced to parliament, are on the negative list to remove the incentive to repeal regulations in order to circumvent this part—the establishment of vegetation on land subject to clearing of native forest or draining of a wetland within three years of application, as an ineligible offset project; planting a known weed species; the establishment of a forest as part of a forestry management investment scheme—and you look at how you get there.


We will deal with that. Before an activity is listed on the negative list, risks are assessed in accordance with the AS/NZS ISO31000:2009 Risk Management—Principles and Guidelines, so it is—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  There are enough zeros there. The risk management principles and guidelines are used. They are the standard that is appropriate. The minister will recommend that types of projects be added to the list following consultation with stakeholders. Regional communities, region­al NRM organisations and state, territory and local governments can submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. So there is a process before an activity is listed—save the activities on the negative list, as you can clearly now see. The process of how they get on the negative list ensures that there are appropriate risk management principles and guidelines which are used. They are the standards that are accepted in Australia. Then the minister would recommend that types of projects be added to the list following the consultation that you described, and it is a wide-ranging consultation. Of course, it does not preclude regional communities, regional NRM organ­isa­tions, local governments and the like. They can submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. In dealing with this area, we have tried to ensure that there is both a proper standard in place and a proper consultation in place and, of course, information about likely risks for assessment under the standard is input into that process as well.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:11):  I rise to make a few remarks about this. The Greens were very concerned to make sure that we had a negative list in relation to this piece of legislation so that there was some clarity in the community, and I am very pleased that the managed investment schemes went on to that negative list right at the start. The Greens wanted to make sure that we had the benefits of various projects for creating carbon credits and also biodiversity outcomes under the Biodiversity Fund of the climate bills whilst at the same time trying to deal with the perverse outcomes that potentially could be there.


Members of the Senate will recall that I spoke very strongly against the 100 per cent tax deduction for carbon sink forests because they led to a distortion in land prices and so on in rural and regional Australia, after our experience of the managed investment schemes. So we wanted to make sure, in the course of this legislation and looking at the Biodiversity Fund under the climate bills, that we maximised local participation and maximised benefits whilst taking into account the perverse outcomes that might occur. We also wanted to minimise political interference in the decisions and try to make them systemic and policy based.


We have a scenario now where the NRM groups will be funded to assist them to be brought up to a certain level of proficiency. The NRM plans will be put up in the same sort of context. Projects that are brought forward will be compared with NRM plans, so local communities will be involved through NRM groups and through local government in looking at projects that are being proposed. They will be looked at in terms of the negative list and they will not be disallowable instruments of the parliament. I particularly do not want them to be disallowable instruments of the parliament because I want to make sure that we get to policy based outcomes that are not engaged with individual ministerial interference or parliamentary interference with disallowable instruments in this particular case.


I think we have a pretty good balance here with a recognition that we can enhance carbon in the landscape and that we can create opportunities for people in rural and regional Australia to create projects which are good for carbon, good for biodiversity and good for communities, but there is the capacity for any perverse outcomes which start to become apparent in a systemic way to go onto the negative list and add to the negative list over time. From the Greens' perspective I think we have achieved that through the negotiations that have gone on, through the amendments and through the complementarity of the carbon package as it has been announced. I am satisfied that, providing we get the NRM groups up to the standard needed and get the NRM plans, the collaboration of this will lead to good outcomes.


I note that it has been the Greens and the government who have recognised the value of the negative list by saying, upfront, to rural and regional Australia that these particular things will not be considered, including managed investment schemes. We want to make sure that what we are rewarding is additionality, not just existing good practice, but additional carbon in the landscape. We also need to get some academic rigour into this because, ultimately, when we go to international trading it is going to be critical that Australian projects stand up and withstand scrutiny. You are not going to have a good reputation as a player in a global market unless the product you are selling is rigorous—that is, it is additional and permanent. I am satisfied that we are achieving that. By passing this amendment you would be playing governments into individual project decisions and parliaments into disallowing individual project decisions, as well as disempowering the very people you want to empower, the NRM groups and the NRM plans, which are based on proper, natural resource management. That is where we are coming from.


I note with interest that it is the coalition which wanted to abolish the negative list. This is extraordinary. They have been out in rural and regional Australia telling people about all the bad things that might happen and not admitting that it is the coalition that want to get rid of the negative list. It is the coalition that do not want to see managed investment schemes put on a negative list. No, they are happy for it to be 'all stations go', and that is completely unsatisfactory. The Greens will not stand for perverse outcomes in rural and regional Australia on land and water use. We want to maximise the capacity for agricultural production while enhancing carbon in the landscape, enhan­cing restoration of carbon in the landscape and enhancing and maintaining biodiversity in rural and regional Australia. I think we are on track to achieve that with the way that the legislation is designed and also in comple­mentarity with the carbon bills.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  I acknowledge the work that Senator Milne and the Greens have done on the issue of managed investment schemes. I know that the Nationals have also been long-time campaigners on the impact of managed investment schemes. I agree with Senator Milne that we need to maximise the benefits of soil carbon and carbon-farming initiatives and minimise perverse outcomes. The intent of this amendment is to do that by ensuring that we do not have the perverse outcomes that we saw with managed investment schemes. I agree with Senator Milne that it is very welcome that a forestry managed investment scheme is included in the context of the regulations being proposed.


I just want to clarify what the minister has previously said. I think Senator Milne touched on the issue of NRMs and NRM boards having input into this. What are the benchmarks for determining whether a project will be in the excluded offsets list, the negative list, if it is deemed that there will be an adverse impact on water or on the production of food? I still do not quite understand what the criteria will be. I do genuinely appreciate the minister's previous answer in relation to this. I thought he gave a good overview but in terms of the nitty-gritty, the specifics, how would it actually apply and work and how would it be done?


The second issue alludes to Senator Milne's comments about the perverse out­comes that we saw of managed investment schemes, which she has been a long-time campaigner on. If there are perverse out­comes—as I fear there may be in this section's current form—will there be ongoing monitoring and some transparency and accountability to ensure that we do not see those adverse or perverse outcomes that Senator Milne has referred to in a slightly different context? I think it is still relevant in respect of how we deal with this particular amendment.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:20):  I table the draft regula­tions to tidy up the record so that they form part of the debate. In answering the last question, firstly, there is obviously a review in 2014. Secondly, the NRMs will play a crucial role, as will the department, stake­holders, local councils and many other groups who are interested in this and who will continue to monitor. As we speak, a group of NRMs has been receiving training. I had an opportunity to visit one group in Brisbane who have been trained about how to approach and do this work. It is not only leaving it to NRMs to continue but is also about the government supporting the NRM groups and adding to their skill sets so that they can participate, explain and monitor the process.


To the earlier issue you talked about, the nitty-gritty, it is in the document with a number of zeros. It is the risk management principles and guidelines. It is AS/NZS ISO31000:2009 Risk Management—Princi­ples and Guidelines that is used for risk management. It contains the principles and guidelines that you would use in a risk management system. I am not sure about the availability of that document, but I am sure it could be accessed through the Parliamentary Library, or we are happy to make it available to you. I do not want to table it, because I suspect it is copyrighted. It is an Australian standard but, in any event, we can make it available.




Senator Xenophon:
  These are the risk management guidelines?




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes. That is the Australia/New Zealand ISO31000:2009 standard, which you described as the nitty-gritty of how they would then risk manage. As I described it earlier, the risks are assessed in accordance with that particular document. That would be the document that you would use to risk manage. In other words, it is the principles and guidelines.


In addition there are regional NRM plans. As part of the Clean Energy Future plan the government will provide $44 million over five years through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund. The NRM organisations will develop plans in each region to guide where carbon farming projects should be located in the landscape. These can be used by landholders to identify and develop activities to reduce carbon pollution. The fund will also support research and analysis to develop scenarios on regional climate change impacts, which can be used for NRM and land-use planning, because the government recognises that NRM plans are a vehicle for local communities to have a say about the types and locations of abatement projects in their region. It is a requirement of the CFI legislation that CFI proponents take account of regional NRM plans in the development of their projects and report any inconsis­tencies, so it also contains a feedback loop within it.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:24):  Can I have some clarification. I think we followed all of that. The risk management guidelines will determine whether there is an adverse impact on water or on the land's productive capacity, for want of a better term. I just want to get a clear understanding that that is the process. I also understand that the minister just undertook to provide those risk management guidelines. Could we have a time frame on how quickly we can get those?

It will not be in the next hour; I can assure you of that. We will see how we go. You can also make your own inquiries for it, but we will endeavour to get it as quickly as possible. As I said, before an activity is listed on the negative list, risks are assessed in accordance with that ISO code, which is called Risk Management—Principles and Guidelines. In the second step the minister will recommend that types of projects be added to the list following consultation with stakeholders, regional communities and regional NRM organisa­tions. State and territory local governments can also submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. I described earlier how the process would work under that fund. I will not go through it again in the interests of time, but I described how that fund would then support NRMs in that process as well and assist landholders. The whole concept is about assisting landholders in carbon abatement through the CFI framework.

I would say though that the adverse impacts on water and the adverse impacts on agricultural land are probably the key issues in this whole piece of legislation. I understand, as you say, that the risk manage­ment guidelines will be provided to us, but as colleagues would understand it is going to be very difficult for us to have a measure of the appropriateness of this whole process unless we can actually see those risk management guidelines, given that the legislation itself only says the minister must have regard to whether there is a significant risk. Perhaps, Minister, you can expedite the provision of those guidelines. I understand there are process issues around that. If it is not within the next hour, perhaps we will ask you again how long it might be until we see those guidelines. I cannot see the committee stage concluding until we are able to actually see that particular document.

We have answered your questions in relation to how the minister would look at the risks and drawn to your attention source documents that would be utilised for that. Ostensibly it is about a scheme. The scheme is solid and the scheme is about providing carbon farming initiatives to those areas. Using the positive and negative list in an appropriate way is about how we manage those risks. We will do what we can, but I am asking you not to hold your breath.

In part that is due to the fact that there is a process: the risk management guidelines will be used to determine whether or not there should be an excluded offsets project. I would say that it is directly relevant, even to this particular amendment, as it is part of the government's determina­tion of why they are not supporting this particular amendment from Senator Xenophon.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:29):  As Senator Xenophon said, it is good to be back. My recollection of exactly where we were in this debate on this particular amendment is perhaps a tad hazy, I have to confess. I am not sure whether I made a contribution to this amendment previously and indicated that the opposition is inclined to support the amendment. As Senator Nash has been highlighting, we do have particular concerns about ensuring the integrity of this scheme in relation to its interaction with water resources and the availability and protection of key agricultural land and how it may or may not impact on those issues. We think that it is important that they are fully thrashed out.


I am attempting to digest the draft regulations that the minister has laid on the table. I see that they were finished at 11.43 this morning, so they are a new edition according to the printout on the bottom of them. I suspect the coalition will have some questions. I am pleased the draft regulations have been produced. We have been calling and arguing that, for the sake of complete­ness, given that so much of this bill hinges on the operation of the regulations, they all should have been presented in tandem in a final version so we could have a fully informed debate in this place. Having the draft regulations at least takes us a step closer to that. It does not give us the final version, but as quickly as we can we will seek comment from stakeholders and other interested parties to help inform us on how these regulations might work. I suspect we will have some questions about some of the decisions that have been made in the regulations as well as we go through this.


In relation to the amendment of Senator Xenophon, firstly, on a very minor matter, assuming my printout and copy of the amendment is the one that is in play, I suspect that there is a typo in (a) of the proposed clause 1A which currently reads


… was established as, or as part, of a managed investments scheme.


Is that meant to be 'as part of' or 'is part of', Senator Xenophon? It may be 'as part of'. Now that I have read it out loud it makes more sense than when I read it before.




Senator Xenophon:
  It is 'as part of'.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  'As part of' does work so that is okay. I accept that. Minister Ludwig, one of your main or primary arguments against this has been that it creates project-by-project type assessment criteria. I am wondering if in relation to the operation of the bill, you could give us a little clarity as to how or when the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will assess individual projects. Will they purely be projects that are brought to its attention by the administrator or projects that require changes to the methodology? The metho­dology changes are outlined in some detail in the bill. But individual projects may in their individual nature impact on matters of biodiversity or water availability, regardless of the generic nature of how you might attempt to define them. Specific projects, especially in the biodiversity concept, are locality specific in what impact they may or may not have on biodiversity. At what point would you imagine that the administrator or someone would bring a project to the attention of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee who may then provide some advice to the minister if there was a concern about biodiversity, or would it purely be assessment exclusively against these regulations that have been laid on the table?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:34):  The minister has stated in relation to this that there are some risk management guidelines used by Australia and New Zealand for these matters that the government says would deal with the issues that are the subject of this amendment which the government says will deal with them adequately. I cannot test that. I cannot compare what is contained in those guide­lines with what is contained in this amend­ment. I wonder whether the government would have this amendment deferred until those risk management guidelines have been obtained. If the government is not so inclined to do so, it leaves me with no choice but to go to a vote, but I would have thought that may be relevant for the debate in relation to this particular subclause. It is an invitation to the government; whether the government accepts it is another matter. I am concerned that the risk management guidelines are not readily available. I note the government is being quite open that it will make them available at relatively short notice. I appreciate that, but I just wonder whether it would be prudent for this amendment to be dealt with after those risk management guidelines are provided.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I am going to call the minister, but I remind Senator Xenophon that would be a matter for the Senate chamber to determine.




Senator LUDWIG:

It is quite extraordinary that something that is relevant to the considera­tion of an amendment is something that we have to pay for in order to properly consider the context of the amendment given what the government has said. I just find that extraordinary. Madam Temporary Chair, I have taken your objective guidance in relation to this given what I foreshadowed, so I move:


That consideration of amendments (3) and (4) on sheet 7118 be deferred to a later hour.

 Clause 56, page 81 (line 26), omit ""significant"", substitute ""material"".


These amendments relate to the regulations to be determined as to projects that should be on the negative list based on their impact on the availability of water, conservation of biodiversity, employment and the local community. However, under the current drafting the application of the significance test is at a very high threshold. These amend­ments remove this test from the bill and say that the minister must have regard to whether there is a material risk, so whether that kind of project will have a material adverse impact. I am grateful for the discus­sions that I have had with the government and my colleagues on both sides of the chamber in relation to these amendments.

The government takes these issues associated with the negative list very seriously and has, in addition— which I think we have been discussing this morning—put out details of excluded project types for consultation. But, clearly, the importance of this is to get it right and we agree that these amendments will go some way to achieving that.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:40):  I think this is not the first time that I have engaged with Senator Xenophon in a discussion or in a debate or in an amending about the significance of the word 'significant'. I do appreciate the manner in which Senator Xenophon has approached this issue. His original amendments were simply to remove the word 'significant', and the opposition was not favourably disposed to that. However, the substitution of the word 'material' does, I think, provide for an adequate test that where there is something that is of adequate import it should be considered a risk but it does not have to pass a size and scope test as to just how great that risk may be to qualify as being a significant risk or a significant adverse impact. The opposition is pleased to hear that the govern­ment is also supporting Senator Xenophon on these amendments. We offer our support and hope that at least this is an appropriate strengthening of the process for the making of these regulations and for the creation of the negative list and that it will provide all the appropriate protection of water availability issues and biodiversity issues and the other factors that are included in proposed section 56(2) of the bill.

I am wondering if the minister would be so kind as to advise the chamber on what basis the figure of 600 millimetres of long-term average annual rainfall, which is specified in the regulations, was set and what evidence or parties were consulted in relation to that as a minimum benchmark, why that benchmark applies, what advice was taken as to whether that is an appropriate benchmark across all regional areas of Australia and whether there may be some merit in different benchmarks for different geographic localities.

He can deal with that now while we are dealing with these amendments or deal with that when we return to dealing with Senator Xenophon's other set of amendments and considering the other issues there. That is up to him. I do not want to spoil the group love of unanimous endorsement of Senator Xenophon's amendments at present, but I think this is the appropriate zone in which to consider some of the issues related to these regulations.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:46):  Are we moving through the same running sheet: clauses 27, 29 to 38, land registration officials? 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No. We have sheet revised 4. On the amendment sheet, it should have 'revised 4' at the top of the first page. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  Where are you up to? 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We are now at clause 56, amendment (1) on sheet BR247. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  I am with you now, Chair. Maybe it is easier if I move it at this point in time, because the government supports a similar amendment, which is listed below it on the sheet. The government's version in this instance is clear and avoids the ambiguity about the meaning of 'resources'. The difficulty is that, in deferring 56, I am now trying to address something that is no longer there in part; but, nonetheless, we will march on. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Let me get this clear: you are moving that amendment, which would make the opposition's amendment irrelevant if it succeeds. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  This amendment seeks to ensure that when making the negative list, the minister considers whether there is—it will now read—'material risk of adverse impacts on land access for agricultural production'. This amendment will give effect to one of the recom­mendations made by the National Farmers Federation in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications during its inquiry into the Carbon Farming Initiative. The bill already provides that the minister is required to consider whether there is a material risk, if that is the kind of project which will have a material adverse impact on the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment and the local community in or in the vicinity of the project areas for that kind of project. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Minister, could you formally move the amendment. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  I thought I had formally moved it. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We just want to ensure, for Hansard, that you formally move amendment (1) on sheet BR247. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  I formally move amendment (1) on sheet BR247:

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:50):  Thank you, Madam Chair. I am delighted that the minister eventually got to move this amendment, amendment (1) on sheet BR247. This is an important amendment, and it is an amendment that the opposition welcomes. We are in fact delighted that the government, albeit somewhat belatedly, did at least come to the party in presenting this amendment, thereby—indeed, as you hinted, Madam Chair—negating the opposition amendment that is listed to be debated next. We think this is a very important and valid approach. We think it is vital to make sure that these issues of land access for agricultural production are treated as being just as important as the other projects, areas of projects or kinds of projects listed in the existing and proposed section 56. 


Let us just remind ourselves that this is the section that creates the kinds of projects that appear on the negative list—the draft regulations that the minister laid on the table this morning. These are the kinds of projects which, following the amendments of Senator Xenophon's that we endorsed, could have a material risk or a material adverse impact on one or more of the following. We already have the availability of water, the conserva­tion of biodiversity, employment and the local community listed as factors in this regard. We think it is important that land access for agricultural production equally be included, given the importance of food security issues in Australia and the import­ance of reflecting the concerns of many in the farming community. There is a real concern about the potential of this bill, along with a range of other factors at present, to have an adverse impact on farmers' ongoing access to farmlands. 


The opposition had of course proposed inserting part (e) of this amendment with the words 'land and resource access for agricultural production'. The government has presented a slightly different version, 'land access for agricultural production', instead. That is fine. That is welcome. We certainly would not proceed with our amendment should this amendment succeed—and, given that the opposition supports this amendment, we certainly expect that it will succeed. I note that the government has circulated an explanatory memorandum to explain what this means. The explanatory memorandum highlights that it would require the minister to also consider whether there is a signifi­cant, now material, risk that a particular kind of project would have a materially adverse impact on land access for agricultural production:


... in, or in the vicinity of, the project area, or any of the project areas, for that kind of project.


The opposition pursued this issue by presenting our amendments at the earlier stage of debate on this legislation because we agreed with the concerns the National Farmers Federation had and with the recom­mendation they had put that it was important to have an amendment of this type included in this legislation. Also, the government circulated this amendment prior to the recess we have just had, and that of course means that the government has known for some considerable period of time that it was intending to insert part (e) into proposed section 56(2) and that land access for agricultural production would become a factor for consideration.


Minister, given the strong support around the chamber for this inclusion and given the fact that the government has intended to include it for close to a month and a half, I have a question for you that I would appreciate your feedback on: how is this new section reflected in the draft regulations that you have circulated and what work has been done to ensure that this new section, which you have intended for some time to include, is reflected in these draft regulations?

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:55):  I also am very interested in this clause and the question which my colleague Senator Birmingham, who is in charge of this bill in this chamber, has asked. I am delighted, actually, to take part again in this debate on a day which is the very first anniversary of that famous statement by the current Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, when she promised all Australians that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Not only did she promise that; the federal Treasurer, Mr Swan, confirmed that the Labor Party in govern­ment would not introduce a carbon tax. In fact, he rubbished the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who had predicted, I think on no fewer than 10 occasions, that the Labor Party would intro­duce a carbon tax if they won the election. Mr Swan said Mr Abbott was being hysterical even to suggest that, but where are we one year later? We are in the throes of a debate surrounding the new carbon tax which the Labor Party intends introducing.


Madam Temporary Chair, you may recall that the Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, promised that she would not take any action on a carbon tax until she had a consensus in the parliament. There was a consensus on the carbon tax. A year ago today there was a consensus between the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party and most of the Independents, and that consensus was: there will be no carbon tax under the next government, whoever it might be. Yet here we are, just 12 months on from that very famous, very obvious and very clear promise by the Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, to the Australian public that if they voted for her and her party, and for the senators sitting opposite—and about 50 per cent did, with the Greens pref­erences—there would be no carbon tax. That is why Australians voted for either the Liberal-National Party or the Labor Party. They knew, because of a solemn promise by the Leader of the Labor Party, that there would be no carbon tax under the govern­ment she led. Here we are, exactly 12 months later, debating a bill that is putting into place some of the legislation surround­ing the carbon tax that Julia Gillard promised would not be introduced.


How can anyone in Australia believe anything the current Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, might say about any policy issue? She cannot be believed on the carbon tax and she could not be believed on border protection and boat people. Heaven knows how many different changes of policy we have had since the election about 12 months ago. Nobody in Australia can possibly take Julia Gillard's word for any­thing. Today is the 12-month anniversary of Julia Gillard, and of all my Senate colleagues sitting opposite me here, promising the Australian people there would be no carbon tax under this government—and where are we today? I know many of my colleagues in the Labor Party sitting opposite are devastated by the fact that they are required by Labor Party rules to support this policy, which was born of a lie by the Labor Party leader 12 months ago today. 


Progress reported.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:49):  Just prior to going to that I present the government's response to the report of the Senate Environment and Communication Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills and seek leave to have the documents incorporated into Hansard.


Leave granted.



The document read as follows:




Government Response to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry on the:





Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 [Provisions]





Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 [Provisions]





Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 [Provisions]



The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee presented its final report on 27 May 2011. The Committee’s report made nine recommendations. The Government’s response to each of these recommendations is set out below.




Recommendation 1 





2.36 The committee recommends the government consider options to ensure there are no perverse incentives to cease existing abatement projects, and encourage first movers to undertake further abatement or sequestration activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. The Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) has been designed to address these issues. 


An activity will be considered additional under the CFI if it is not common practice in an industry or under specific regional or environmental conditions. This common practice test will ensure that early movers who have already adopted more sustainable practices are eligible to participate in the scheme. Credits will be able to be earned from activities that reduce or store carbon from 1 July 2010.


The CFI will also recognise projects that were set up under some other abatement schemes – such as Greenhouse Friendly and the ACT and NSW governments’ Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme – and provide an incentive for these projects to continue. To be eligible for CFI credits, these projects will still need to be conducted under an approved CFI methodology and meet other scheme requirements including additionality. 


The CFI legislation contains several provisions to ensure projects do not have adverse impacts on the environment or communities. 


The CFI excludes high-risk activities through a “negative list”, which will be in regulations. Activities that pose a significant risk for the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment or local communities will be included on the negative list. These activities will not be eligible to receive carbon credits under the CFI. 


The Government has released for consultation an indicative list of activities that would be excluded from the scheme. For example, the list includes establishing an identified weed species as a reforestation project. The Government will continue to consult local communities, industry and other stakeholders on the negative list, including when methodologies are proposed for new activities. 


All CFI projects will have to comply with any applicable water, planning and environment requirements, and obtain all necessary government approvals, before they are eligible to receive credits under the scheme. 


In addition, project proponents will need to take account of regional natural resource management (NRM) plans. As part of its Clean Energy Future plan, the Government will provide $44 million over five years to improve existing regional NRM planning for climate change. Regional plans will provide guidance to landholders on the type and location of carbon projects that will provide social and environmental benefits, and avoid adverse impacts. 


The Biodiversity Fund will provide additional incentives for CFI projects that establish, restore or protect biodiverse carbon stores. The ongoing Biodiversity Fund is part of the Government’s plan for a clean Energy Future and will provide close to $1 billion in support for biodiversity over its first six years.




Recommendation 2 





2.37 The committee recommends the government consider what more can be done to fast track development of methodologies, and to develop and test the workability of carbon offsets projects in key agricultural industries. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


The Government has already invested more than $46 million in research and development through the Climate Change Research Program on ways of reducing pollution and helping Australian farmers adapt to a changing climate. The Climate Change Research Program is addressing the need for research into reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The outcomes from the program will be available by mid 2012 and will assist government and industry to develop new carbon estimation methodologies.


As part of the plan for a Clean Energy Future the Government’s Carbon Farming Futures - filling the research gap program will provide a further $201 million over six years. This program will focus on research into new ways of storing carbon and reducing pollution in the land sector. $20 million will be available to convert research into practical carbon estimation methodologies for use under the CFI. 


In addition, the Government will provide a total of $99 million in direct support for landholders to take action on the ground, including testing new ways to increase soil carbon and reduce pollution. This will include a refundable tax offset to encourage the uptake of conservation tillage farming techniques and participation in soil carbon sequestration research. Like all conservation tillage practices, no-till works to improve the organic matter in the soil by retaining crop stubble. It aims to reduce soil disturbance, minimise damage to soil structure, increase nutrient availability and reduce water loss by increasing soil water holding capacity. 




Recommendation 3 





2.49 The committee recommends the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


Carbon dioxide cycles between the atmos­phere, oceans and land biosphere. Its removal from the atmosphere involves a range of processes with different time scales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that around 50 percent of the increase in CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, and a further 30 percent will be removed within a few centuries. The remaining 20 percent may stay in the atmosphere for many thousands of years. 


In this context, 100 years has become the internationally accepted timeframe for ensuring that sequestration is equivalent to (and can be used to offset) emissions. Under the CFI, sequestration projects can be terminated without having to pay back carbon credits after 100 years.  


The Government will monitor international developments on this issue and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international scientific and policy consensus on this matter. 


It should also be noted that the CFI permanence obligations allow significant flexibility. Landholders would be able to cancel their sequestration project at any time by relinquishing the number of credits issued for the project. 




Recommendation 4 





3.31 The committee recommends that in developing the negative list the government takes care to preserve abatement incentives, for example by tightly defining excluded projects to reflect local environmental conditions or circumstances. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation.


To maintain abatement incentives wherever possible, the negative list will be tightly defined to identify the specific circumstances where particular activities have significant risks of adverse impacts. 


To ensure that activities on the negative list are appropriately defined, the Government will consult with stakeholders before adding to or amending the negative list. The negative list will be included in regulations and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.


The CFI Bill also provides for reviews of the operation of the CFI, with the first review to be completed by 31 December 2014. This will present a further opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the negative list in ensuring that the CFI does not provide incentives for activities that could have adverse social or environmental impacts.  




Recommendation 5 





3.46 The committee recommends the government consider options for improving the capacity of natural resource management plans to take account of climate change mitigations options and adaptation needs, and to maximise the broader environmental and social benefits of the Carbon Farming Initiative. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


Regional NRM organisations are well placed to help plan for climate change and to maximise the social and environmental benefits of carbon farming projects. Through Government initiatives such as Caring for our Country, regional NRM organisations have had nearly a decade of experience in providing information, training and support to land managers and environmental, Indigenous, and community groups on sustainable land management.


As part of its Clean Energy Future plan, the Government will provide $44 million over five years through the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund. NRM organisations will develop plans to guide where carbon farming projects should be located in the landscape. These can be used by landholders to identify and develop carbon farming projects that provide maximum social and environmental co-benefits. The fund will also support research and analysis to develop scenarios on regional climate change impacts which can be used for NRM and land use planning.




Recommendation 6 





3.47 The committee recommends the government consider further changes to regional natural resource management plans to improve their governance and consistency, such as by requiring each plan to: 



be managed by a statutory authority; 


address the same basic criteria, at a minimum; and 


be enforced to the same standard. 


Response:  The Government notes this recommendation. 


The Government’s $44 million Regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) Planning for Climate Change Fund will enable the production of NRM plans in each region to a highly professional, nationally consistent standard, to guide where CFI projects, such as tree plantings and avoided deforestation, should be located in the landscape to avoid unintended negative impacts and maximise the carbon co-benefits for biodiversity, water and agricultural production.


The 56 regional NRM organisations that develop these plans are currently a mix of statutory authorities, public companies limited by guarantee and incorporated associations. The nationally consistent standards for the plans will be designed to ensure regional NRM organisations provide the required information and detail in the plans to guide CFI projects.


The Government will establish a new statutory body, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Advisory Board, which will report to the Government and annually to the Parliament about implementation of the land sector measures, including the Regional NRM Planning for Climate Change Fund, announced as part of the Government’s plan for a Clean Energy Future. 




Recommendation 7 





4.15 The committee recommends the government address obstacles to indigenous participation in the CFI, including resolving outstanding uncertainties in relation to participation by holders of non-exclusive native title.



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation. 


The Government is committed to helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders benefit from carbon farming. 


As part of the Clean Energy Future plan, the Government has committed $22 million over its first five years to an Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund that will assist Indigenous communities to benefit from the CFI. Funding will be provided for specialists to work with Indigenous communities on carbon farming projects. Funding for research and reporting tools for CFI methodologies will also create further opportunities for Indigenous Australians.


Under the CFI, Indigenous landholders will be able to earn carbon credits for activities including improved savanna fire, livestock, feral animal, fertiliser, soil or forest management, reforestation and vegetation regrowth. 


The Government has made the development of a methodology for savanna fire management a priority. This is an activity which is likely to have high indigenous participation and social co-benefits for Indigenous communities.


The legislation makes it easy for holders of exclusive possession native title to undertake abatement projects and to receive carbon credits. The legislation also provides for holders of determined native title to consent to sequestration projects undertaken by other interest holders on their land. This will enable Indigenous land holders to negotiate a share of the benefits from carbon farming projects. 


The Government is consulting stakeholders about the circumstances in which native title claimants will need to give their consent to projects conducted on land where there are native title interests. Complex legal issues are involved, and any outcome will be consistent with the Native Title Act and Racial Discrimination Act.




Recommendation 8 





4.24 The committee recommends the government make clear that Kyoto-compliant credits will be linked to any future carbon price mechanism. 



Response:  The Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Government has agreed to link Kyoto-compliant credits with the carbon price mechanism. This will increase incentives for landholders to reduce or store pollution. 


Kyoto-compliant activities include reforestation, savanna fire management and reductions in pollution from livestock and fertiliser.


During the initial fixed price period, liable parties under the carbon price will be able to meet five per cent of their obligations using carbon credits generated under the CFI. In the flexible price period, there will be no limit on the use of credits generated under the CFI.


The CFI non-Kyoto Carbon Fund will provide incentives for other activities that are not part of accounting for Australia’s Kyoto Protocol target, such as revegetation and soil carbon projects. This fund will be worth $250 million over the first six years of the program.


Australia will continue working to develop new international rules that recognise a wider range of action on the land to reduce carbon pollution.




Recommendation 9 





4.26 The committee recommends that, subject to the recommendations contained elsewhere in this report, the Senate pass the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011; the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011; and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011.



Response:  The Government supports this recommendation.


The CFI package of bills will pave the way for farmers, forest growers and landholders to generate saleable carbon credits for domestic and international carbon markets. This will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land and waste sectors which currently make up 22 percent of Australia’s emissions.




Senator LUDWIG:
  Thank you. Also prior to going to the specific amendments, can I continue from where I think Senator Feeney may have left off. Senator Nash, as I understand it, was asking about the types of projects that would be eligible and the availability of the regulations. We have today published the exposure draft regulations that set out the sorts of projects that can and cannot be included in the government's Carbon Farming Initiative and provides protection for the farming sector and the environment.


The government released in key details for regulation a public discussion paper before the coalition made these claims, but we have now released a draft of the key regulations which take feedback from over 50 submissions into account.


The government's Carbon Farming Initiative has, as I think you have heard me reiterate a number of times, been carefully designed to avoid any adverse impacts on food security and the environment, including water, while working to unlock important greenhouse gas abatement opportunities across regional Australia. It is about providing opportunities in these areas through the Carbon Farming Initiative. The draft regulations set out and include a negative list of excluded activities under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The negative list identifies activities that are ineligible in certain circumstances because they risk adverse impact on biodiversity, water, communities or employment. To give you an example: the managed investment scheme for forestry. The Carbon Farming Initiative additionality test requires projects to go beyond what is required by law. These draft regulations also set out a positive list of activities that go beyond common practice in the land and waste sectors. This will ensure that only projects that are genuinely additional to common practice are credited under the Carbon Farming Initiative.


In contrast, the coalition appear—and perhaps we will have clarity on this—to want a scheme in which politics rather than science and evidence dictates activities that will be eligible. Such an approach would have no credibility in carbon markets or with the community. Instead, it would simply reinforce the suggestion that their subsidies for polluters policy is in essence just a big pork-barrel for the National Party. The Liberals on the other side should stop playing politics and support the government's efforts to reward farmers who are taking action on climate change. I understand that the Liberals opposite may not get the support of their coalition partners, the National Party, but, quite frankly, the Liberals should pursue sensible policy.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:55):  Turning to where we are at in the program—and I am sure that we are all keen to pursue the amendments that are set out for this bill—we are up to items 3 and 4, Senator Xenophon's amendments to clause 56, excluding offset projects, which includes the offset reporting period, excluded offset projects. The position that the government has adopted is that we oppose these amendments. They would shorten the maxi­mum reporting period. A five-year maximum reporting period provides flexibility—for example, it avoids reporting costs at the beginning or end of a project when forest growth rates are slow. The scheme integrity is maintained because credits are issued only after abatement has been achieved. They are the reasons we are not supporting these amendments. However, we accept that in principle Senator Xenophon is endeavouring to improve the bill. But in this instead these amendments would shorten the maximum reporting period.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:57):  I note for the record that the minister did not answer my question about his comment about pork-barrelling for the National Party more fulsomely. Perhaps before he makes a comment he should research it rather more thoroughly so that he can inform the chamber of what he is talking about. I also note for the record the fact that we have only just received the regulations that go with this piece of legislation. That is far from acceptable, given that it is precisely those regulations that we need to ask the questions about in this particular process. We have not had time to go through them in any detail whatsoever. As such, I indicate to the chamber that this may well be a rather laborious process while we try to understand what the minister has indeed put in front of us in terms of the regulations that relate to this legislation.


Senator Xenophon's amendment 4 refers to 4 part i, the availability of water, or part ii, land and resource access for agricultural production. The amendment states that the minister should determine that, if there is an adverse impact that relates to either of those two, the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project. Could the minister inform the chamber as to whether there is anything in these regulations that mirrors that requirement in the amendment from Senator Xenophon?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:59):  This amendment would allow environmentally or socially beneficial projects to bypass the additionality test. That is, in essence, the reason that it is unsound. The positive list is designed to ensure credits are only issued for emission reductions or increases in carbon stores beyond what commonly occurs already. The CFI includes a co-benefits index which recognises projects that have associated biodiversity and community benefits, but ultimately the market will determine what projects come forward, and those with important co-benefits will naturally stack up better than those without. With the way that Senator Xenophon's amendment is structured, it would simply bypass what we describe as the additionality test, and therefore it remains not supported.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:00):  Perhaps I was not quite clear enough in my question. I was specifically talking about the excluded offsets projects, specifically talking about the negative list. The way that Senator Xenophon's amendment is worded simply means that the minister must determine that, if there is an adverse impact on the avail­ability of water or on land and resource access for agricultural production then the project is automatically deemed to be an excluded offsets project. It is thereby saying that, if there is an adverse impact on water or on land and resource access for agricultural products production, it should automatically be an excluded offsets project. That seems to me to be quite straightforward and quite sensible. Perhaps I was not clear enough in my phrasing of the question, but is there anything in the regulations that have just been placed before us that would automatically deem to be an excluded offsets project an activity that is going to have an adverse impact on the availability of water or an adverse impact on land and resource access for agricultural production?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:01):  The short answer is yes. The government is committed to preventing adverse impacts on water availability. Through the negative list, the government will exclude plantation projects in high-rainfall areas unless they hold adequate high-security water entitlements, they are in an area that has a water management plan that has been accredited by the National Water Commission, they are environmental plantings or they address dryland salinity. This regulation will no longer be required once the National Water Initiative commitments are fully implemented across Australia, though. So the short answer is yes.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:02):  Madam Chair, it is good to be back. I think it has been five weeks since we have debated this amendment that I have moved, and I just want to recap for my colleagues—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Is it good that I'm back or good that we are all back?




Senator XENOPHON:
  Madam Chair, it is good that you are back; it is good that we are all back.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Sorry to interrupt you, Senator Xenophon!




Senator Birmingham:
  It's all good!




Senator XENOPHON:
  It's all good, despite the disapproving look of Senator Bernardi. But he's smiling now!


These amendments relate to the negative list. Amendment (4) states that projects which, based on advice by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on agricultural production should be on the excluded offsets project list. As I said in my second reading contribution, ensuring Australia's water availability is vital and I do not believe that it should be left up to regulations. 


This amendment also states that, where a forest was established as a managed invest­ment scheme, it too should be on the excluded offsets list. I note that, since we last debated this matter, the government has tabled the draft Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Regulations. In terms of types of excluded offsets projects, I note that, in division 12, clause 61, reference is made to forestry managed investment schemes, so they are covered. That of course is welcome, and I congratulate the government for going down that path. Obviously it was something that was within consideration. But this amend­ment goes further. It states that, if it is determined by the minister, on the advice of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on land and resource access for agricultural production, the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project.


What is at stake here is simply this—that a Carbon Farming Initiative project should be an excluded offsets project if it is going to damage the availability of water or if it is going to damage land and resource access for agricultural production. It is that straight­forward. It does not go against the integrity of what the government is trying to achieve, but it does give a safeguard in terms of food production and water availability. We know from the very contentious debate about coal seam gas on prime farming land—a different issue altogether—the importance of preserving the integrity of our water supply in this country. That is why it is important that this amendment strengthens those safeguards for both water and prime agricultural production.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:05):  I do not want to lengthen the debate on this, but the challenge is that the amendment would mean—and I think this is probably the objective you are trying to achieve—that this would in truth be unworkable. The minister in this instance, when making a decision, would have to exclude individual projects. Our schema is trying to achieve this in a broader sense. The process that you have entertained would add significantly regulatory complexity to the CFI and really undermine the participation within it, by requiring the minister to examine and make decisions to exclude individual projects. It would also create investment uncertainty for individual landholders, who would then have to be stacked up waiting to find out whether or not they would be excluded or included in that process. We have already committed to parliament to make regulations that would put forestry managed investment schemes on the negative list of projects that are excluded from the scheme. So in that way we think we have achieved the same purpose, rather than trying to do it in—if you will forgive my turn of phrase—a piecemeal way.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:06): I too do not wish to prolong the debate, but this is a very important issue in terms of water security and food security. Can I perhaps turn it around this way. The government says that this is a piecemeal approach; I think that this is a guaranteed approach. It is not piecemeal; it is a comprehensive approach to deal with this issue. But I will truncate the debate so that we can get to the core of the issue. The government says that it will not support this amendment, which disappoints me, but what I am concerned about is this: how does the government say it will set criteria in assessing whether a project is an excluded offsets project? How will it set benchmarks? How will it appropriately assess whether a project will have an adverse impact on water or an adverse impact on food production? If, for instance, there is a risk that it could affect the supply of water in a particular area—for interception, for instance, which is a real issue in our river system, and esteemed water economists and scientists such as Professor Mike Young, from the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, have talked about the issue of interception on many occasions—how will that be assessed? How will it be assessed whether a project reduces the production of a particular type of food grain in a particular area? How does the govern­ment take these matters into account? The government is saying, 'We agree with you that these are important matters, but this is not the way to do it.' How does the government say it will address these very important and fundamental issues?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:08):  From the government's perspec­tive, we think we have achieved that, if you look at the activities on the negative list, projects that were mandatory as at 24 March 2011. Activities that are specifically mandated by government regulations are not additional. Projects that were required by law as at 24 March 2011, when the CFI bill was introduced to parliament, are on the negative list to remove the incentive to repeal regulations in order to circumvent this part—the establishment of vegetation on land subject to clearing of native forest or draining of a wetland within three years of application, as an ineligible offset project; planting a known weed species; the establishment of a forest as part of a forestry management investment scheme—and you look at how you get there.


We will deal with that. Before an activity is listed on the negative list, risks are assessed in accordance with the AS/NZS ISO31000:2009 Risk Management—Principles and Guidelines, so it is—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  There are enough zeros there. The risk management principles and guidelines are used. They are the standard that is appropriate. The minister will recommend that types of projects be added to the list following consultation with stakeholders. Regional communities, region­al NRM organisations and state, territory and local governments can submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. So there is a process before an activity is listed—save the activities on the negative list, as you can clearly now see. The process of how they get on the negative list ensures that there are appropriate risk management principles and guidelines which are used. They are the standards that are accepted in Australia. Then the minister would recommend that types of projects be added to the list following the consultation that you described, and it is a wide-ranging consultation. Of course, it does not preclude regional communities, regional NRM organ­isa­tions, local governments and the like. They can submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. In dealing with this area, we have tried to ensure that there is both a proper standard in place and a proper consultation in place and, of course, information about likely risks for assessment under the standard is input into that process as well.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-16,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:11):  I rise to make a few remarks about this. The Greens were very concerned to make sure that we had a negative list in relation to this piece of legislation so that there was some clarity in the community, and I am very pleased that the managed investment schemes went on to that negative list right at the start. The Greens wanted to make sure that we had the benefits of various projects for creating carbon credits and also biodiversity outcomes under the Biodiversity Fund of the climate bills whilst at the same time trying to deal with the perverse outcomes that potentially could be there.


Members of the Senate will recall that I spoke very strongly against the 100 per cent tax deduction for carbon sink forests because they led to a distortion in land prices and so on in rural and regional Australia, after our experience of the managed investment schemes. So we wanted to make sure, in the course of this legislation and looking at the Biodiversity Fund under the climate bills, that we maximised local participation and maximised benefits whilst taking into account the perverse outcomes that might occur. We also wanted to minimise political interference in the decisions and try to make them systemic and policy based.


We have a scenario now where the NRM groups will be funded to assist them to be brought up to a certain level of proficiency. The NRM plans will be put up in the same sort of context. Projects that are brought forward will be compared with NRM plans, so local communities will be involved through NRM groups and through local government in looking at projects that are being proposed. They will be looked at in terms of the negative list and they will not be disallowable instruments of the parliament. I particularly do not want them to be disallowable instruments of the parliament because I want to make sure that we get to policy based outcomes that are not engaged with individual ministerial interference or parliamentary interference with disallowable instruments in this particular case.


I think we have a pretty good balance here with a recognition that we can enhance carbon in the landscape and that we can create opportunities for people in rural and regional Australia to create projects which are good for carbon, good for biodiversity and good for communities, but there is the capacity for any perverse outcomes which start to become apparent in a systemic way to go onto the negative list and add to the negative list over time. From the Greens' perspective I think we have achieved that through the negotiations that have gone on, through the amendments and through the complementarity of the carbon package as it has been announced. I am satisfied that, providing we get the NRM groups up to the standard needed and get the NRM plans, the collaboration of this will lead to good outcomes.


I note that it has been the Greens and the government who have recognised the value of the negative list by saying, upfront, to rural and regional Australia that these particular things will not be considered, including managed investment schemes. We want to make sure that what we are rewarding is additionality, not just existing good practice, but additional carbon in the landscape. We also need to get some academic rigour into this because, ultimately, when we go to international trading it is going to be critical that Australian projects stand up and withstand scrutiny. You are not going to have a good reputation as a player in a global market unless the product you are selling is rigorous—that is, it is additional and permanent. I am satisfied that we are achieving that. By passing this amendment you would be playing governments into individual project decisions and parliaments into disallowing individual project decisions, as well as disempowering the very people you want to empower, the NRM groups and the NRM plans, which are based on proper, natural resource management. That is where we are coming from.


I note with interest that it is the coalition which wanted to abolish the negative list. This is extraordinary. They have been out in rural and regional Australia telling people about all the bad things that might happen and not admitting that it is the coalition that want to get rid of the negative list. It is the coalition that do not want to see managed investment schemes put on a negative list. No, they are happy for it to be 'all stations go', and that is completely unsatisfactory. The Greens will not stand for perverse outcomes in rural and regional Australia on land and water use. We want to maximise the capacity for agricultural production while enhancing carbon in the landscape, enhan­cing restoration of carbon in the landscape and enhancing and maintaining biodiversity in rural and regional Australia. I think we are on track to achieve that with the way that the legislation is designed and also in comple­mentarity with the carbon bills.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-08-16,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  I acknowledge the work that Senator Milne and the Greens have done on the issue of managed investment schemes. I know that the Nationals have also been long-time campaigners on the impact of managed investment schemes. I agree with Senator Milne that we need to maximise the benefits of soil carbon and carbon-farming initiatives and minimise perverse outcomes. The intent of this amendment is to do that by ensuring that we do not have the perverse outcomes that we saw with managed investment schemes. I agree with Senator Milne that it is very welcome that a forestry managed investment scheme is included in the context of the regulations being proposed.


I just want to clarify what the minister has previously said. I think Senator Milne touched on the issue of NRMs and NRM boards having input into this. What are the benchmarks for determining whether a project will be in the excluded offsets list, the negative list, if it is deemed that there will be an adverse impact on water or on the production of food? I still do not quite understand what the criteria will be. I do genuinely appreciate the minister's previous answer in relation to this. I thought he gave a good overview but in terms of the nitty-gritty, the specifics, how would it actually apply and work and how would it be done?


The second issue alludes to Senator Milne's comments about the perverse out­comes that we saw of managed investment schemes, which she has been a long-time campaigner on. If there are perverse out­comes—as I fear there may be in this section's current form—will there be ongoing monitoring and some transparency and accountability to ensure that we do not see those adverse or perverse outcomes that Senator Milne has referred to in a slightly different context? I think it is still relevant in respect of how we deal with this particular amendment.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (13:20):  I table the draft regula­tions to tidy up the record so that they form part of the debate. In answering the last question, firstly, there is obviously a review in 2014. Secondly, the NRMs will play a crucial role, as will the department, stake­holders, local councils and many other groups who are interested in this and who will continue to monitor. As we speak, a group of NRMs has been receiving training. I had an opportunity to visit one group in Brisbane who have been trained about how to approach and do this work. It is not only leaving it to NRMs to continue but is also about the government supporting the NRM groups and adding to their skill sets so that they can participate, explain and monitor the process.


To the earlier issue you talked about, the nitty-gritty, it is in the document with a number of zeros. It is the risk management principles and guidelines. It is AS/NZS ISO31000:2009 Risk Management—Princi­ples and Guidelines that is used for risk management. It contains the principles and guidelines that you would use in a risk management system. I am not sure about the availability of that document, but I am sure it could be accessed through the Parliamentary Library, or we are happy to make it available to you. I do not want to table it, because I suspect it is copyrighted. It is an Australian standard but, in any event, we can make it available.




Senator Xenophon:
  These are the risk management guidelines?




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes. That is the Australia/New Zealand ISO31000:2009 standard, which you described as the nitty-gritty of how they would then risk manage. As I described it earlier, the risks are assessed in accordance with that particular document. That would be the document that you would use to risk manage. In other words, it is the principles and guidelines.


In addition there are regional NRM plans. As part of the Clean Energy Future plan the government will provide $44 million over five years through the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund. The NRM organisations will develop plans in each region to guide where carbon farming projects should be located in the landscape. These can be used by landholders to identify and develop activities to reduce carbon pollution. The fund will also support research and analysis to develop scenarios on regional climate change impacts, which can be used for NRM and land-use planning, because the government recognises that NRM plans are a vehicle for local communities to have a say about the types and locations of abatement projects in their region. It is a requirement of the CFI legislation that CFI proponents take account of regional NRM plans in the development of their projects and report any inconsis­tencies, so it also contains a feedback loop within it.

In the second step the minister will recommend that types of projects be added to the list following consultation with stakeholders, regional communities and regional NRM organisa­tions. State and territory local governments can also submit information about likely risks for assessment under that standard. I described earlier how the process would work under that fund. I will not go through it again in the interests of time, but I described how that fund would then support NRMs in that process as well and assist landholders. The whole concept is about assisting landholders in carbon abatement through the CFI framework.

I understand, as you say, that the risk manage­ment guidelines will be provided to us, but as colleagues would understand it is going to be very difficult for us to have a measure of the appropriateness of this whole process unless we can actually see those risk management guidelines, given that the legislation itself only says the minister must have regard to whether there is a significant risk. Perhaps, Minister, you can expedite the provision of those guidelines. I understand there are process issues around that.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:29):  As Senator Xenophon said, it is good to be back. My recollection of exactly where we were in this debate on this particular amendment is perhaps a tad hazy, I have to confess. I am not sure whether I made a contribution to this amendment previously and indicated that the opposition is inclined to support the amendment. As Senator Nash has been highlighting, we do have particular concerns about ensuring the integrity of this scheme in relation to its interaction with water resources and the availability and protection of key agricultural land and how it may or may not impact on those issues. We think that it is important that they are fully thrashed out.


I am attempting to digest the draft regulations that the minister has laid on the table. I see that they were finished at 11.43 this morning, so they are a new edition according to the printout on the bottom of them. I suspect the coalition will have some questions. I am pleased the draft regulations have been produced. We have been calling and arguing that, for the sake of complete­ness, given that so much of this bill hinges on the operation of the regulations, they all should have been presented in tandem in a final version so we could have a fully informed debate in this place. Having the draft regulations at least takes us a step closer to that. It does not give us the final version, but as quickly as we can we will seek comment from stakeholders and other interested parties to help inform us on how these regulations might work. I suspect we will have some questions about some of the decisions that have been made in the regulations as well as we go through this.


In relation to the amendment of Senator Xenophon, firstly, on a very minor matter, assuming my printout and copy of the amendment is the one that is in play, I suspect that there is a typo in (a) of the proposed clause 1A which currently reads


… was established as, or as part, of a managed investments scheme.


Is that meant to be 'as part of' or 'is part of', Senator Xenophon? It may be 'as part of'. Now that I have read it out loud it makes more sense than when I read it before.




Senator Xenophon:
  It is 'as part of'.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  'As part of' does work so that is okay. I accept that. Minister Ludwig, one of your main or primary arguments against this has been that it creates project-by-project type assessment criteria. I am wondering if in relation to the operation of the bill, you could give us a little clarity as to how or when the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will assess individual projects. Will they purely be projects that are brought to its attention by the administrator or projects that require changes to the methodology? The metho­dology changes are outlined in some detail in the bill. But individual projects may in their individual nature impact on matters of biodiversity or water availability, regardless of the generic nature of how you might attempt to define them. Specific projects, especially in the biodiversity concept, are locality specific in what impact they may or may not have on biodiversity. At what point would you imagine that the administrator or someone would bring a project to the attention of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee who may then provide some advice to the minister if there was a concern about biodiversity, or would it purely be assessment exclusively against these regulations that have been laid on the table?

I cannot test that. I cannot compare what is contained in those guide­lines with what is contained in this amend­ment. I wonder whether the government would have this amendment deferred until those risk management guidelines have been obtained. If the government is not so inclined to do so, it leaves me with no choice but to go to a vote, but I would have thought that may be relevant for the debate in relation to this particular subclause. It is an invitation to the government; whether the government accepts it is another matter. I am concerned that the risk management guidelines are not readily available.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:40):  I think this is not the first time that I have engaged with Senator Xenophon in a discussion or in a debate or in an amending about the significance of the word 'significant'. I do appreciate the manner in which Senator Xenophon has approached this issue. His original amendments were simply to remove the word 'significant', and the opposition was not favourably disposed to that. However, the substitution of the word 'material' does, I think, provide for an adequate test that where there is something that is of adequate import it should be considered a risk but it does not have to pass a size and scope test as to just how great that risk may be to qualify as being a significant risk or a significant adverse impact. The opposition is pleased to hear that the govern­ment is also supporting Senator Xenophon on these amendments. We offer our support and hope that at least this is an appropriate strengthening of the process for the making of these regulations and for the creation of the negative list and that it will provide all the appropriate protection of water availability issues and biodiversity issues and the other factors that are included in proposed section 56(2) of the bill.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:41):  The Greens had some concerns about the word 'significant' because it depends on the perspective of the person speaking as to what the meaning of 'significant' is. I am pleased that Senator Xenophon has made that change to 'material'. We will agree with that. That does not preclude, of course, the discussion about what is a material impact. Nevertheless, I think it is a bit clearer and I support it.

 (South Australia) (13:42):  Having indicated our support here—and, of course, perhaps we will return to these when we return to Senator Xenophon's deferred amendments—I want to try to start working through some of the earlier issues in the draft regulations that the government has tabled. I am wondering if the minister would be so kind as to advise the chamber on what basis the figure of 600 millimetres of long-term average annual rainfall, which is specified in the regulations, was set and what evidence or parties were consulted in relation to that as a minimum benchmark, why that benchmark applies, what advice was taken as to whether that is an appropriate benchmark across all regional areas of Australia and whether there may be some merit in different benchmarks for different geographic localities.

 (South Australia) (13:44):  I would just say that if the minister would rather get some evidence and come back to that issue when we deal with Senator Xenophon's other amendments that would be fine. I am just noting that, given we are in the section of amendments that deals with the excluded offsets projects and the minister has tabled this information, the 600-millimetre threshold is one of the early questions and I would appreciate some feedback from him on how that has been set. He can deal with that now while we are dealing with these amendments or deal with that when we return to dealing with Senator Xenophon's other set of amendments and considering the other issues there. That is up to him. I do not want to spoil the group love of unanimous endorsement of Senator Xenophon's amendments at present, but I think this is the appropriate zone in which to consider some of the issues related to these regulations. As I said, the 600-millimetre threshold is an early question that stands out as to why it has been set and who was involved in its setting.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  No. We have sheet revised 4. On the amendment sheet, it should have 'revised 4' at the top of the first page.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We are now at clause 56, amendment (1) on sheet BR247. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  I am with you now, Chair. Maybe it is easier if I move it at this point in time, because the government supports a similar amendment, which is listed below it on the sheet. The government's version in this instance is clear and avoids the ambiguity about the meaning of 'resources'. The difficulty is that, in deferring 56, I am now trying to address something that is no longer there in part; but, nonetheless, we will march on. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Let me get this clear: you are moving that amendment, which would make the opposition's amendment irrelevant if it succeeds. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  This amendment seeks to ensure that when making the negative list, the minister considers whether there is—it will now read—'material risk of adverse impacts on land access for agricultural production'. This amendment will give effect to one of the recom­mendations made by the National Farmers Federation in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications during its inquiry into the Carbon Farming Initiative. The bill already provides that the minister is required to consider whether there is a material risk, if that is the kind of project which will have a material adverse impact on the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment and the local community in or in the vicinity of the project areas for that kind of project. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Minister, could you formally move the amendment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:50):  Thank you, Madam Chair. I am delighted that the minister eventually got to move this amendment, amendment (1) on sheet BR247. This is an important amendment, and it is an amendment that the opposition welcomes. We are in fact delighted that the government, albeit somewhat belatedly, did at least come to the party in presenting this amendment, thereby—indeed, as you hinted, Madam Chair—negating the opposition amendment that is listed to be debated next. We think this is a very important and valid approach. We think it is vital to make sure that these issues of land access for agricultural production are treated as being just as important as the other projects, areas of projects or kinds of projects listed in the existing and proposed section 56. 


Let us just remind ourselves that this is the section that creates the kinds of projects that appear on the negative list—the draft regulations that the minister laid on the table this morning. These are the kinds of projects which, following the amendments of Senator Xenophon's that we endorsed, could have a material risk or a material adverse impact on one or more of the following. We already have the availability of water, the conserva­tion of biodiversity, employment and the local community listed as factors in this regard. We think it is important that land access for agricultural production equally be included, given the importance of food security issues in Australia and the import­ance of reflecting the concerns of many in the farming community. There is a real concern about the potential of this bill, along with a range of other factors at present, to have an adverse impact on farmers' ongoing access to farmlands. 


The opposition had of course proposed inserting part (e) of this amendment with the words 'land and resource access for agricultural production'. The government has presented a slightly different version, 'land access for agricultural production', instead. That is fine. That is welcome. We certainly would not proceed with our amendment should this amendment succeed—and, given that the opposition supports this amendment, we certainly expect that it will succeed. I note that the government has circulated an explanatory memorandum to explain what this means. The explanatory memorandum highlights that it would require the minister to also consider whether there is a signifi­cant, now material, risk that a particular kind of project would have a materially adverse impact on land access for agricultural production:


... in, or in the vicinity of, the project area, or any of the project areas, for that kind of project.


The opposition pursued this issue by presenting our amendments at the earlier stage of debate on this legislation because we agreed with the concerns the National Farmers Federation had and with the recom­mendation they had put that it was important to have an amendment of this type included in this legislation. Also, the government circulated this amendment prior to the recess we have just had, and that of course means that the government has known for some considerable period of time that it was intending to insert part (e) into proposed section 56(2) and that land access for agricultural production would become a factor for consideration.


Minister, given the strong support around the chamber for this inclusion and given the fact that the government has intended to include it for close to a month and a half, I have a question for you that I would appreciate your feedback on: how is this new section reflected in the draft regulations that you have circulated and what work has been done to ensure that this new section, which you have intended for some time to include, is reflected in these draft regulations?

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:55):  I also am very interested in this clause and the question which my colleague Senator Birmingham, who is in charge of this bill in this chamber, has asked. I am delighted, actually, to take part again in this debate on a day which is the very first anniversary of that famous statement by the current Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, when she promised all Australians that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Not only did she promise that; the federal Treasurer, Mr Swan, confirmed that the Labor Party in govern­ment would not introduce a carbon tax. In fact, he rubbished the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who had predicted, I think on no fewer than 10 occasions, that the Labor Party would intro­duce a carbon tax if they won the election. Mr Swan said Mr Abbott was being hysterical even to suggest that, but where are we one year later? We are in the throes of a debate surrounding the new carbon tax which the Labor Party intends introducing.


Madam Temporary Chair, you may recall that the Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, promised that she would not take any action on a carbon tax until she had a consensus in the parliament. There was a consensus on the carbon tax. A year ago today there was a consensus between the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party and most of the Independents, and that consensus was: there will be no carbon tax under the next government, whoever it might be. Yet here we are, just 12 months on from that very famous, very obvious and very clear promise by the Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, to the Australian public that if they voted for her and her party, and for the senators sitting opposite—and about 50 per cent did, with the Greens pref­erences—there would be no carbon tax. That is why Australians voted for either the Liberal-National Party or the Labor Party. They knew, because of a solemn promise by the Leader of the Labor Party, that there would be no carbon tax under the govern­ment she led. Here we are, exactly 12 months later, debating a bill that is putting into place some of the legislation surround­ing the carbon tax that Julia Gillard promised would not be introduced.


How can anyone in Australia believe anything the current Leader of the Labor Party, Julia Gillard, might say about any policy issue? She cannot be believed on the carbon tax and she could not be believed on border protection and boat people. Heaven knows how many different changes of policy we have had since the election about 12 months ago. Nobody in Australia can possibly take Julia Gillard's word for any­thing. Today is the 12-month anniversary of Julia Gillard, and of all my Senate colleagues sitting opposite me here, promising the Australian people there would be no carbon tax under this government—and where are we today? I know many of my colleagues in the Labor Party sitting opposite are devastated by the fact that they are required by Labor Party rules to support this policy, which was born of a lie by the Labor Party leader 12 months ago today.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


In doing so, I do express disappointment that we have been waiting for 150 days for some pretty basic information which goes to the government's financial and economic management. We wrote to the minister at 9.30 or 10 o'clock this morning and nobody had the courtesy to let us know that the intention was to table it today. At this point I do not have a copy of the answer, even though the minister was well aware that this issue was going to be raised after question time. I wrote to the minister twice in relation to this. I wrote to the minister back in May, I wrote to the minister again in July. We had a debate about it for 20 minutes back in July, which you might remember, Mr Deputy President Parry, because it was your first opportunity to chair this session with us as the new Deputy President.


We have a government here in Canberra which is incompetent, fiscally reckless and irresponsible, and refuses to be accountable to the parliament. It is just not good enough that the government is unable to provide an answer for 150 days about how much of the stimulus package remains to be spent for 2011-12 and 2012-13. Some of the information sought has since become public through other channels, specifically in relation to 2010-11 and 2011-12.  The fact that for 150 days this government refused to provide an answer to a question that should be answered within 30 days would seem to indicate that there is something to hide. I would be very interested to read the answer that finally has been put forward and to see why the government would try to avoid answering a basic question like this for more than 150 days.


We have a bad Labor government here in Canberra which spends too much, borrows too much and taxes too much. Whenever questions are raised this unaccountable Treasurer, who treats the Senate with absolute contempt, refuses to provide answers in a timely and appropriate fashion.


We always have to remind ourselves why this government is now able to brag about the stronger position that Australia is in compared to other countries around the world. The reason we are in a better position than we otherwise would be is because this government inherited a budget with absolutely no government net debt. This government inherited a budget with a $22 billion surplus. This government inherited a budget where we had to spend zero dollars on interest payments servicing the debt that was paid off by the previous government.


We now have an incompetent Treasurer who treats the Senate with contempt, who was not able to provide an answer in good time. Whenever he has something to hide, he goes for the cover-up. And we can well understand why he would go for the cover-up. With the government having inherited a very strong budget position, we are now in a position where four out of four budgets under this government have been deficit budgets. Every single budget that has been put together by the Labor Party has been a deficit budget—every single one of them.


But we were told that 2012-13 was going to be different, that 2012-13 was going to see the historically unprecedented experience of a surplus under this Labor government. The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, was going to deliver a surplus budget in 2012-13, but he was not prepared to tell us how much he was still going to spend on his fiscal stimulus package in 2012-13. I would be very interested to see what the answer says and even now maybe somebody can provide me with a copy of the answer that the govern­ment supposedly has tabled here in the parliament. I think it is quite extraordinary that the minister would just tell us that the answer has been provided without actually giving it to us.


Here we have a government which in 2009-10 spent $28 billion on stimulating the economy through fiscal stimulus—that is, by spending taxpayers' dollars, by borrowing money, by going into debt. Do you know what the Reserve Bank was doing at the same time? In 2009-10 the Reserve Bank increased interest rates six times in a row. This government was completely panicked, they were completely out of their depth and they did what they always do when they do not know what to do. They looked at their Labour friends and at their Democrat friends in other parts of the world. They looked at what Gordon Brown was doing in the UK and they looked at what Barack Obama was doing in the US and they thought that, as they were spending money, as they were spending more and as they were taxing more and going into debt, 'maybe we should do the same'. So off they went and spent $89 billion of taxpayers' dollars. Even at a time when the Reserve Bank was putting on the brakes through monetary policy, this government was still out there stimulating the economy. So you have the Reserve Bank and this incompetent and fiscally reckless and irresponsible government going in opposite directions.


I was very interested to observe that in the US we have had interest rates at record lows—hovering around zero per cent—for a couple of years. In fact, the US Federal Reserve said that interest rates in the US would remain at 0.25 per cent or thereabouts until the middle of 2013. That was their attempt to provide additional impetus to the market. Of course, in the UK and in the US they have been printing money for a number of years. They call it quantitative easing.


I have just had advice that the Senate Table Office as at 3.07 pm, which was three minutes ago and was after Minister Wong said to this chamber that the Treasurer's answer had been tabled, had not received an answer to question on notice No. 437. So here we have Senator Wong misleading the chamber. I hope that Senator Wong has the courtesy to come back into this chamber as this is an absolute disgrace. This incompetent government is treating this Senate with absolute contempt. For more than 150 days it has refused to provide an answer to a very legitimate question about how much of the fiscal stimulus package remains to be spent in 2012-13, and here we have the minister for finance, on behalf of the Treasurer, advising this chamber that an answer was tabled in the Senate, when I have advice now from the Table Office that so far there is still no answer. This government is perpetuating the cover-up. This is an absolutely disgrace­ful and outrageous contempt of the Senate.


We have a government that has completely mismanaged our public finances. We have a government that inherited a strong budget position but has completely made a mess of it. Every single one of those Labor senators on the other side of the chamber is going to be responsible, in the passage of history, for the mess that they have created. They are making it worse. We are already in a situation where we are looking at $107 billion worth of government net debt. We have had four successive deficits. In question time today, Minister Wong was laying the groundwork, was laying the foundation, for the delivery of a deficit in 2012-13. The words she used were that, oh well, the world has changed. There is always an excuse for yet another Labor deficit. There is always another reason as to why this government cannot live within its means.


The truth of the matter is that we did not need to go this far into debt. We did not need to spend $89 billion worth of taxpayers' dollars—taxpayers' dollars raised today or taxpayers' dollars borrowed against future generations. In Australia our official cash rate bottomed out at three per cent. In 2009-10 alone we had six successive increases in interest rates to take the interest rate in that year from three to 4.5 per cent. Of course, since then we have had another 0.25 per cent increase, to take it up to the current rate of 4.75 per cent. Clearly, there was an opportunity for the Reserve Bank to continue to do its job and to continue to provide stimulus to the economy, if that was required in its judgment, by further lowering interest rates. Our interest rates bottomed out at three per cent and have since gone up to 4.75 per cent but in the UK and in the US they are still at record lows. We know that is one—not the only one, but one—of the reasons why the Australian dollar is in the position that it is in, which is putting further pressure on exporters across Australia. It is one of the reasons why the Australian exchange rate is where it is compared to that of the US. 


If only the Reserve Bank had been allowed to do its job and if only the Reserve Bank had not faced a government that was putting billions and billions and billions of dollars of fiscal stimulus into the economy—inefficiently, mind you, through pink batts, through school halls, through the Building the Education Revolution and through all of the inefficient programs that they put out there. It would actually have been much more efficient if the Reserve Bank had been able to effectively put more money into the economy by reducing interest rates, which would have left people with more money in their pocket and they would have allocated their money throughout the economy way more efficiently than this incompetent government could. Instead we have pink batts, school halls and all sorts of things that have been examples of bad and wasteful spending of taxpayers' dollars and we have been left with $107 billion of government net debt—from a start of zero net debt and it is rising. In this budget alone, $26 billion is going to be spent on servicing the interest on the debt that this government has accumulated—and again it is rising. 


I make the point here that this incom­petent government is actually going to introduce new multibillion dollar taxes that are going to make us less competitive internationally, that are going to have a serious impact on our economic prosperity into the future. All of that leaves the budget in a worse fiscal position at the end of the process. I will explain: only the Labor Party can come up with a new multibillion dollar tax that would leave the budget in a worse position. We have two examples of this. There is the mining tax, which Treasury tells us will raise about $38½ billion over the decade. Incidentally, $25 billion of that will come from iron ore production in Western Australia. The cost of the related measures—the proposed increase to compulsory super, the company tax cuts and various other measures—is about $57 billion over the same period. 


Over the next decade, the budget is going to be about $20 billion worse off than when this government started, further worsening the structural deficit position. This does not even take into account the fact that every time a state government—like the state government in Western Australia, the state government in Queensland or any other state government with resources—makes a decision to remove a royalty concession or to increase royalties, it will be a further black hole in the budget, courtesy of the dodgy mining tax deal that this government entered into with the three big mining companies. No wonder this budget is in a mess. No wonder the Labor Party cannot deliver a surplus budget. Every time they make a decision, the budget is in a worse position than before they started. 


I will stay on the mining tax for a moment. The government promised to credit all state and territory royalties to those who have to pay the mining tax. Here we have the government which dodgily and inapprop­riately did a deal behind closed doors—it was exclusive and in secret—with the three big mining companies. Not only were all their competitors excluded; state and territory governments, who just happen to have responsibility for royalty arrangements, were also excluded. Nobody included them in the deal, but here we have this incompetent government making a promise to these three big mining companies. Clearly they stared them down. The three big mining companies got this Prime Minister and this Treasurer to promise to credit all state and territory royalties without the state and territory governments being part of the agreement. In this country, you cannot have tax reform in the area of resource taxation or in the area of royalty arrangements without actively engaging and seeking agreement from state and territory governments. Any competent federal leader would know that and any competent federal Treasurer would know that—except for this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. Of course, this is just one example of incompetence.


There is also the carbon tax. I was there on budget night on Lateline. I was sitting next to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. We were both giving our assessment of the budget. Senator Wong was saying how fantastic it was, and I was saying, 'It's just not worth the paper it's written on.' Do you know why I said that, Mr Deputy President? The carbon tax informa­tion was not in it. So we said: 'The revenue figures are wrong. The expenditure figures are wrong. The inflation figures are wrong. The economic growth figures are wrong—everything is wrong.' Minister Wong said, not to worry, that it will be broadly budget neutral. We now know that it will not be. The government will raise $25 billion and spend $4.3 billion more. The budget is going to be $4.3 billion worse off, yet again. 


I conclude my contribution on this: I cannot believe that Minister Wong has not come in here to explain why she has misled the Senate. I hope that an explanation from the minister will be forthcoming at a later hour. She told us that an answer to the question that I raised had been tabled, when clearly the Table Office has confirmed—and I suspect that it is still the case right now—there is no answer from the Treasurer. I think that is absolutely disgraceful. I look forward to it being provided to us ASAP.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:19):  I was going to defend Senator Wong from that attack on why she had not answered the question, until I heard that she had actually misled the Senate. She followed her leader's cause of telling mistruths—in her leader's case, lies, deliberate lies, to the Australian public. It was exactly one year ago today that Julia Gillard, the Leader of the Labor Party, promised Australians that there would be 'No carbon tax under a government I lead'. She also promised that she would not introduce a carbon tax until there was a consensus. There was a consensus a year ago, and that was a consensus of most politicians in this parliament that there would be no carbon tax. 


I wanted to defend Senator Wong because I can understand why she, on behalf of the Treasurer, has not got the time to answer questions. It is because she has been so busy trying to explain and excuse her leader, Julia Gillard, who deliberately lied to the Australian public a year ago today when she said that there would be 'No carbon tax under a government I lead'. A year ago Senator Wong was the minister for climate change. She was the one running around at Copenhagen who was going to save the world from climate change. She was the one who no doubt joined with her leader in putting forward this solemn promise to the Australian public that there would be no carbon tax under a government Julia Gillard led. And I can understand why Senator Wong has since that moment been so busy trying to explain that deliberate and outright lie of her leader, Julia Gillard. 


One might understand why Senator Wong was not able to pass on the answer from the Treasurer. Could I also just perhaps offer a little helpful advice not only to Senator Wong but to all of the ministers on the other side. If Senator Wong, and she is the principal offender, at question time actually tried to answer a question, perhaps there would not be as many questions put on notice because we would get the answers in question time, which is what question time is all about. We in this chamber and the Australian public expect that at question time the government is asked questions about its administration of the government and we and the Australian public expect that reasonably competent ministers might be able to answer those questions in question time.


Very few of the ministers on the other side, perhaps with the exception of Senator Sherry, can ever answer a question without notice. When she is asked a question Senator Wong has adopted the tactic—and just bear my words on this, and look through theHansard—whereby, for the first half of her time, at least, for answering questions she chooses to attack the questioner. It happened today, but that is not unusual. She does it all the time. I would suggest to Senator Wong and other ministers in this chamber that if they were to put a little more effort into actually answering questions rather than attacking the questioner, or rather than talking about anything except what the question is about, there would perhaps be fewer questions put on notice and we would not have the sort of debate and anger that comes up when governments cannot answer questions after 135 days, as it is in this case.


I urge government ministers to try and have a go at answering questions put to them. If you have not got a clue on the answer, which is basically all of the time, can you just sit down instead of wasting the Senate's time in attacking the questioner. In that way we may not have so many questions needing to be put on notice.


Question agreed to.

I ask them this question and I want them to give the chamber the answer: 12 months ago were the Australian people entitled to believe the Prime Minister when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? Were they entitled to believe her when she made that comment 12 months ago?


The answer to that question must surely be yes. But I will wait for Senators Pratt and Feeney to confirm that the answer must be yes to that simple question of whether the Australian people were entitled to believe their Prime Minister 12 months ago when she told them, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Were the people in the gallery in front of you, Mr Deputy President, entitled to believe their Prime Minister when she said to them that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? The answer to that question must be an emphatic yes, they were entitled to believe it.


So the next question for Senators Feeney and Pratt must be: on what basis do you now justify what was a clear lie to the Australian people? Rise today and tell the chamber and the community on what basis you justify a lie told 12 months ago. If there is no justification, and there can be no justifi­cation, stand up and tell this chamber, tell the people in the gallery, the people listening today and the thousands of people who were demonstrating today on what basis you justify not going to the Australian people for a fresh election to let them vote on this issue.


There are three key issues; there are three key answers to three key questions. I will be very interested to hear, Senator Feeney and Senator Pratt, what your responses will be. You cannot leave this chamber today without answering those questions because they are fundamental questions about the public policy debate we are having at the moment. They are fundamental questions which you must answer. The Australian people surely were entitled to believe their Prime Minister when she told them six days before the last election that there would be no carbon tax. You and I know, Senator Feeney, through you Mr Deputy President, that had she been truthful to the Australian community the outcome of that election would have been entirely different.


It was a bald faced lie designed to put people at ease about a carbon tax prior to the election. She either knew it was a lie at the time, having had the discussions with Senator Brown before then, or knows there can be no justification whatsoever for her behaviour since. If the Australian people are not able to rely on their Prime Minister to be truthful with them about such a significant public policy matter, how can they believe anything else she tells them? How can they believe her? This debate is about the Prime Minister's integrity. This debate is about the sorts of matters that Senator Wong refused to answer today. We saw utter incompetence from this senior government minister. She had absolutely no idea of the implications for the freight sector, the small business sector and regional and rural Australia in the answers she gave. She had absolutely no idea whatsoever. My home city of Ballarat, along with Geelong and Bendigo, are great manufacturing centres in regional Victoria. 


Senator Feeney, you and I know what the outcome of this tax will be. You and I know what your own union leaders are saying about this insidious, toxic tax. You know what effect it will have on the coal industry and you know what jobs will be at risk. You have provided absolutely no level of comfort for anyone outside regional and rural Victoria, let alone metropolitan Australia, in relation to what this tax will do. 


Let me go very quickly through some of the ramifications, all of which are undeniable and all of which beggar belief—and it beggars belief that an Australian Prime Minister can do this to her own people. A family on a single income of $65,000 a year will receive no compensation— (Time expired)

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:31):  I rise on the motion to take note of Senator Wong's answer. 




Senator Ronaldson:
  Answer my question.




Senator FEENEY:
  Senator Ronaldson, having just endured your hyperbole for the last few minutes, I am sure you will pay me the courtesy of listening. The Labor Party's policy is to achieve a five per cent cut in 2000 emission levels by 2020. This represents a goal of abating some 160 million tonnes of carbon by 2020. I think that policy is generally well known. What I think is perhaps less well known is that the Liberal and National parties have the same policy. It is also their policy to cut 2000 carbon emission levels in this country by five per cent by 2020. One might think that the fact that we have the same target and the same policy might mean that we are in an environment where there could be accord. One might think that it might be the basis for agreement. Of course once upon a time it would have been. The reason it is not the case now, the reason it is not the basis for an accord, is that the Liberal and National parties live in shame of their own policy. Theirs is a policy that was cobbled together in the aftermath of dealing with the clash between those opposite who are sceptics and those who believe in climate change. They now have a policy which they seek to hide. This is why those opposite wander around Australia and say different things to different audiences. This is why those opposite attend rallies of climate change sceptics and shamelessly agree with those audiences. 


The fact that their policy is the same policy as the government's is hidden. When one looks in detail through their policy, their so-called direct action policy, one finds it is neither direct nor about action. It is a policy that aims to achieve the very same targets as our policy, but they have found a more expensive route to do it. The direct action policy is a policy which ultimately boils down to paying polluters and sending the bill to Australian households. Theirs is a command economy model and it goes to one of the more extraordinary features of this debate. The government are promoting a policy which ultimately will result in an emissions trading scheme—a floating price. The fixed permit will ultimately transition into a carbon market and that market will mean—




Senator Fifield:
  It is an artificial market.




Senator FEENEY:
  On that interjection, one might reflect that the very first markets in every sphere of activity were. There is demand. There is supply. There will be a market and that market will set a price. If those opposite want to have angst about the design of this market, let them do that. But surely their first order of business should be to try and craft a market of their own. But they are not doing that; of course they are not. Those opposite are seeking to achieve the same target that this government are seeking to achieve, but they have looked to the Soviet Union for inspiration. It is a five-year tractor factory in the Urals that sits as the guiding light for the policy of those opposite. 


While it is estimated that the carbon price designed by this government and to be delivered by this government will cost something in the order of $550 per person, I have seen an assessment that under the coalition's policy it will cost $750 per person. How can this be so? Those opposite are crafting a policy which hinges on the idea of a committee of cabinet handing out enormous sums of money to their friends, the polluters. The extraordinary proposition, as Malcolm Turnbull has so eloquently put it, is that those who are polluting will be paid to abate their polluting. Under their own system there is absolutely no incentive for polluters to reform their behaviour. But wait; it gets worse. Under their carbon plan, 70 per cent of the carbon to be abated is to be abated through soil carbon. As we know, soil carbon is not presently accounted for in the Kyoto accounting standards. So their 70 per cent target is something that cannot be accounted for in the international system. That may be an unfortunate thing— (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:36):  I rise on the motion to take note of Senator Wong's answer. I was listening with great interest to Senator Feeney, particularly where he said that both parties have the same emissions reduction target of five per cent by 2020, and that given this it would be nice if there could be bipartisan accord. Can I say that there is a bipartisan accord on the way to deal with this and it is not the one Senator Feeney was referring to. In fact, the bipartisan accord came into existence exactly one year ago today when the Prime Minister put a hand on her heart and solemnly said to the people of Australia, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' From that day on there was a bipartisan approach to dealing with emissions reduction, based on the fact that neither major party would introduce a carbon tax. Earlier this year, the bipartisan approach to emissions abatement which Senator Feeney longs for evaporated when the Prime Minister broke her solemn promise to the Australian people.


So here we are on the first anniversary of her statement that—and I repeat her very clear statement—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' On this anniversary of her solemn statement to the Australian people the Prime Minister should apologise. Today thousands of people have been out the front of Parliament House, all of them incensed by the fact that the Prime Minister managed to achieve a victory at the last election based, at least in significant part, on the fact that she had made that promise to the Australian people. We all know there is no doubt that there are seats around the country which Labor would not have won had she not done that.


The Prime Minister now says, 'Things changed after the election and we had to go with the circumstances we faced at that point.' When Tony Abbott, as Leader of the Opposition, was challenging the Prime Minister prior to the election, there was absolutely no doubt as to the circumstances he was talking about. When he said to the Prime Minister, 'Will you rule out introducing a carbon tax after the next election?' it was in the full knowledge that the Greens had an excellent chance of winning the balance of power in the Senate and that the Prime Minister would need to deal with the Greens. It was in the full knowledge that the election was going to be tight and that there could be a need to deal with Independents in the post-election environment. The Leader of the Opposition put that challenge to the Prime Minister knowing full well that that was the case and the Prime Minister, in making her response, knew full well that those were the circumstances in which that challenge was being put to her. Yet she still stood up and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' 


So after the election, when what was likely to occur did occur, the government, for what can only be considered grubby personal reasons of wanting to hang on to power, did a deal with the Greens. As a result the Prime Minister had to renege on her promise to the Australian people and, as we all know, is now seeking to introduce this carbon tax.


I say again, the argument we have in this place when talking about the government's carbon tax is not whether Australia should take action to reduce emissions. That is accepted by both major parties. Senator Feeney acknowledged that just a few minutes ago. The argument is: what is the best way to do this? This is despite the fact that government senators—Senator Feeney excluded on this particular occasion—continue to paint themselves as the only major party committed to this outcome. It is disingenuous and dishonest to do that because clearly both major parties have a plan to reduce emissions. The government's plan is far more about being seen to be doing something than actually addressing the problem. Their toxic new carbon tax may help them to feel warm and fuzzy and may even help them sleep better at night—because they feel they have done something for the environment—but their tax will not help reduce global emissions and will not address the challenge of climate change. 


In answering a question from Senator Abetz, Minister Wong spoke about China's renewable energy production but failed to look at the relativities, to mention the percentage of renewables of the total economy which that represented. This is massive compared with Australia's energy production. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-08-16,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:41):  In question time today, Senator Wong gave excellent responses to the questions asked of her and said in one of her responses, 'To be a first-rate economy you need to be a clean energy economy.' Australia's carbon pollution is continuing to grow at a rapid rate. Without action it is expected to grow by almost two per cent a year to 2020. That is why the Australian government has a comprehensive plan to build a clean energy future. Our plan includes introducing the carbon price, promoting innovation and investment in renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency and creating opportunities in the land sector to cut pollution.


Climate scientists have been telling us for years that the world is warming and that carbon pollution poses a threat to our environment and our economy. The rest of the world is acting and we cannot be left behind. Eighty-nine countries, which represent 80 per cent of global emissions and 90 per cent of the world's economy, have already pledged to take action on climate change. Australia generates more carbon pollution per capita than any other developed country, including the United States. We also produce significantly more pollution per person than India and China. Our carbon pollution is increasing at a rapid rate and without action it will continue to grow. We cannot wait any longer. We must act now and the Gillard Labor government is taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


A price on carbon is not a tax on ordinary Australians. It is the big polluters who will pay under the government's carbon price plan—unlike the direct action plan of those opposite who insist on making taxpayers pay. Under their plan, families will be worse off with each Australian household paying around $1,300 more in taxes. In the government's plans, Australia's 500 biggest companies will be charged for the pollution they produce. This will help drive investment in clean energy technologies. It will be good for our children and our grandchildren. All of the money raised from the carbon price will be used to support households and jobs and to invest in clean energy and climate change programs. To assist households with price impacts, the government is introducing a comprehensive assistance package. This will comprise two rounds of tax cuts and increases in pensions, allowances and benefits. The tax cuts and increased payments will be targeted at those who need them most. This will mean Labor will ensure that pensioners, low- and middle-income earners and families are assisted.


Under our assistance package, nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through a combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Almost six million Australian households will receive tax cuts or increases in payments that fully cover the average price impacts of the carbon price. Labor will also provide a 20 per cent buffer for over four million Australian households. This means that those households will receive assistance that covers 120 per cent of the average price impact of the carbon price. Age, disability support and carer pensioners will receive $338 a year for singles on the full rate and $510 a year for couples combined on the full rate.


We know that self-funded retirees will also require support when the carbon price is implemented, so we will be providing the same assistance to eligible self-funded retirees that we are providing to age and disability pensioners. We are also tripling the tax-free threshold to over $18,000, which means that over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return.


In my home state of Tasmania the assistance package will ensure that 102,300 pensioners receive assistance through their pension payments to offset any carbon price increases. More than 45,600 families in Tasmania will also receive household assistance through their family assistance payment. On top of this, taxpayers in Tasmania with an annual income under $80,000 will get a tax cut, with most receiving at least $300 per year. This assistance is in stark contrast to the plan offered by the opposition. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:47):  The opposition has asked questions today on the carbon tax and is seeking to take note of answers to those questions for the very simple reason that every Labor member and senator who was elected at the last election—every single one—was elected on the basis of a lie. In the House of Representatives, of 150 members, 148 presented themselves to the electorate on a platform of there being no carbon tax—because I assume that Mr Oakeshott and Mr Bandt presented themselves on a platform of a carbon tax. The entire economic policy of this government is therefore also based on a lie.


I take a particular interest in the effect of this so-called economic reform because my state of Victoria will be hit first and hit hardest by the carbon tax. You may know, Mr Deputy President, that my office is in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and the south-east of Melbourne is the home of manufacturing in Australia. Somewhere in the order of 44 per cent of manufacturing output comes from the south-east region. There are 70,000 people employed in manufacturing in that region. I have been visiting manufacturer after manufacturer during the break, with Mrs Mirabella from the other place, the shadow minister for industry, innovation and science, and when you talk to manufacturers it is not a pretty story that you hear. They tell you in detail the number of employees they will have to lay off if a carbon tax comes into place and about how much their energy bills will go up. We are talking hundreds of thousands of dollars in increased costs for many of these businesses.


I do want to acknowledge, however, that one Labor member, Mr Dreyfus from the other place, who is the parliamentary secretary for climate change and a carbon tax, has been visiting manufacturers in the south-east. Indeed, when I went to the annual general meeting of SEMMA, the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Alliance, a week or two back, Mr Dreyfus was addressing the meeting on the topic of 'Why a carbon tax is good for you'. He did not receive a terribly good reception, it would be fair to say. He did not persuade the audience. I recall that one manufacturer stood up and said, 'In my business we're going to have to pay $120,000 a year more in electricity because of the carbon tax,' and Mr Dreyfus's response was, 'That just goes to prove my point that the impact of a carbon tax will only be modest.' What Mr Dreyfus considers to be modest is something entirely different from what a business considers to be modest.


We have spoken a bit about the manufacturing sector and we have spoken about the steel industry and other industry sectors, but there is one area that has received scant attention from this govern­ment in relation to the impact of a carbon tax. That is the area of disabilities, carers and the voluntary sector. The government, when it comes to people with disabilities, says: 'Trust us. We'll give compensation. It'll be sorted.' The government is offering an increase to the disability support pension. That sounds fine if you accept that that compensation is adequate—which I do not, but let's just put that to one side for a second. There are over four million Australians with a disability. There are 813,000-odd people on the disability support pension. That means there are in excess of 3.2 million Australians with a disability who will receive no direct compensation as a result of the carbon tax. It is ironic in the extreme that at a time when the government is talking about improving long-term care and support for people with disabilities through the idea of a national disability insurance scheme—and that is something I am very supportive of—and making the lives of people with a disability easier, it is also looking at a way, a method, that will impact directly on the living standards of people with disabilities. Carers, according to the government, will receive an increase in their carers payment, but there are many millions more carers than there are people on the carers payment. This tax will hit the south-east of Melbourne hard. It will also hit people in my portfolio hard. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-16,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:52):  I rise to respond to an answer the minister gave in relation to coal seam gas. I find what is going on in Australia with coal seam gas fascinating because there is an assumption, which keeps getting trotted out all over the place, that coal seam gas is cleaner than coal as an energy source and, therefore, we should embrace a massive expansion of coal seam gas.


When I asked the minister today if she could tell the Senate whether coal seam gas extracted in Australia is less greenhouse gas intensive than black coal on a life cycle analysis, she could not answer the question. That is because the work has not been done here in Australia on the greenhouse gas intensity of coal seam gas on life cycle analysis. It is about time that it was. I am one of those people who has said strongly that gas internationally has to be seen at the maximum as a bridging fuel. In Australia we need to move straight to renewables and people looking at gas need to see it as an interim measure and not as a long-term investment. Because certain companies see the profits that they think they can get from coal seam gas, tragically they have completely overrun rural communities in Australia. These communities are outraged at what has been going on, as is the medical fraternity which is out there very strongly warning of the health impacts of coal seam gas.


The Greens will bring in legislation which will give farmers the right to say, 'No, you can't come on to the property to extract coal seam gas.' I will be very interested to see what the coalition does. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has got into quite a pickle on this. Last week he said that farmers should say no, but he has spent the past 24 hours back-peddling and trying to dig himself a place to hide from that issue. We need to have Australian studies on the greenhouse gas intensity of coal seam gas from whoa to go, including fugitive emissions from the areas where these gas wells are being drilled and fugitive emissions from not only those leaking wells but also the pipes. We need to have the energy input analysed from the reverse osmosis of the billions of litres of produced water. We also need to look at the energy embodied in the transport of the gas to the liquefication facilities, the liquefication itself and the transportation overseas. Once you start looking at the greenhouse gas emissions and the intensity of all that, you will find that all these people who claim that coal seam gas is cleaner than coal are in fact wildly exaggerating any benefits. When you take away the disbenefit of loss of agricultural production, you will show that coal seam gas is not the great investment that so many people claim it is.


It is time we took food and water security seriously. I have argued in here until I am blue in the face that you cannot deal with these issues separately. You need to look at the water crisis, the food crisis, the energy crisis and the climate crisis all at once and not take actions that lead to perverse outcomes if you deal with only one of those and not the rest at the same time. Farming communities across Australia are quite rightly saying they are under enormous pressure. They are under pressure from the dollar; they are under pressure because they are losing land to the expansion of urban areas. They are losing because they cannot make a decent farm gate price anymore because of the impact of the supermarkets in Australia and competition from imported food, which is coming into this country having been grown under different environmental conditions and lower wages elsewhere. They are under pressure all over the place and now they find that the gas industry is marching onto their properties with no consideration, no consultation in many cases and completely disrupting life on their land—not to mention the impacts on the Great Artesian Basin. We still cannot get an answer from the government or anybody else on the impacts of this massive expansion of coal seam gas on water availability in Australia and the Great Artesian Basin.


I am glad the minister is going to come back because we want to know on what basis these claims are being made. Are the claims being made just on the basis of industry or have there been any independent reports? Are these reports based in Australia or overseas? I would not mind betting that most of them will come from companies that have done some sort of studies elsewhere. (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:58):  by leave—I move:


The Senate records its deep regret at the death on 31 July 2011, of the Honourable Allan Clyde Holding, former minister and member for Melbourne Ports, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family.


Allan Clyde Holding was born in Melbourne on 27 April 1931. After being educated at Hawthorn West Central School and Trinity Grammar School in Kew, he studied for a bachelor of laws degree at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1955. As John Cain recalls, it was Clyde and he who promoted the activities of the Melbourne University Labor Club and the Victorian Young Labor association into strong and effective student and policy organisations which produced a number of future Victorian Labor politicians and activists. Clyde's early career was as a solicitor specialising in industrial law, particularly industrial accidents. He co-founded the law firm which today is known as Holding Redlich. In 1962 he was elected as the member for Richmond to the Victorian parliament. In 1967 Clyde became leader of the parliamentary Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition, a position which he held until 1977. His 10 years of party leadership were a tumultuous time in which Labor lost two state elections, saw factional fighting which led to federal intervention and a leadership challenge from Barry Jones, which Clyde remarked as being unsuccessful on the grounds that 'Quiz kids can't count'. After the second election loss, he resigned the leadership. He successfully won the seat of Melbourne Ports at the 1977 federal election, and held the seat at the following seven elections, finally retiring in 1998 after 21 years in the Commonwealth parliament.


As an authentic and influential Labor politician, Clyde was loved and hated—often at the same time. He bore the scars of his upbringing between the Great Depression and the Second World War and the exper­iences of a political party under stress during the 1950s. For some, he was a 'cynic with decency', others described him as 'an old style' Labor numbers man who was prepared to promote Bob Hawke's leadership aspira­tions, but for many he is remembered as a competent and conscientious adminis­trator who took on vested interests after he became the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the first Hawke government in 1983.


Clyde strongly pushed for uniform national Aboriginal land rights, which at the time were not fully supported within the Labor leadership, or by the mining industry or state governments. As the history of his time shows, there was intense lobbying against land rights and, without the direct support of his ministerial colleagues, he was unable to prevail. In 1987, after nearly four years, he was removed from Aboriginal Affairs to have his responsibilities focused on the lesser portfolio of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. Within 12 months, his main portfolio was switched to Transport and Communications Support, and finally to cabinet in the portfolio of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Not many ministers would have enjoyed the experiences of having three such disparate portfolios in such a short period. As part of a wider reshuffle in 1989, Prime Minister Hawke demoted Clyde to the Arts and Territories portfolio. By the accounts of the time, this was a messy, widely leaked demotion, which Clyde resisted. In 1990 he went to the backbench and remained there until he retired in 1998.


It would be misleading to define a person's achievements in one paragraph. Yet there were a number that I am sure he would have been enormously proud of: the handing back of Uluru to its Indigenous owners; the appointment of Charles Perkins as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; the appointment of Betty Churcher to the directorship of the National Gallery of Australia; his direct support to the National Film and Sound Archives and to Film Australia; and his push to establish the National Museum of Australia, which now dominates the northern edge of the western basin of Lake Burley Griffin. Clyde's passion for justice, the arts and Aboriginal issues continued after his retirement from the parliament. Put simply by Bob Hawke, Clyde 'was pre-eminently a good, decent and remarkably brave man'.


On behalf of the government and, in particular, Victorian senators, we mark his passing on 31 July 2011 with respect. We offer our sympathies to his surviving family: his second wife, Judy, and their daughter, Isabella, and his first wife, Margaret, and their children, Peter, Jenny and Danny, and the four grandchildren.


I was lucky enough to be able to attend the memorial this morning in Melbourne, along with those from both sides of parliament, in recognition of his work. It was a very fond recollection of Clyde's life, with many very funny stories told. There were many stories about his determination to stand up to the worst of the elements of the Victorian socialist Left—the Bill Hartleys and the George Crawfords—who pushed such divisive policies. Clyde was remembered fondly for being part of those who made the success of the Victorian Labor Party their mission. His leadership in standing up to those elements and his willingness to take risks in pursuit of sound public policies, at the expense of support from the likes of Crawford and Hartley, were remembered fondly. The intervention that became the foundation for the success of the Victorian Labor Party governments of John Cain, Steve Bracks and John Brumby goes back to that period when Clyde Holding was one of the key figures who democratised the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. This was fondly remarked on by some who were more directly involved than myself.


I am lucky enough to have inherited the benefits of Clyde Holding's work. I doubt that I and a number of people in this chamber today would be able to stand up in a federal Labor government if it had not been for the courage and determination of Clyde Holding in overturning those who sought to put warped ideology ahead of the needs of the Victorian and Australian public. I, like many others in this chamber, will miss Clyde Holding.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:05):  The Hon. Clyde Holding was a respected political opponent of the coalition. More importantly, he was highly regarded by his own and was a faithful servant of the ALP and the people of Victoria. He served 15 years in state parliament and 21 years in the federal parliament, making a total innings of public service of some 36 years. That is a huge innings in anybody's language. To remain opposition leader for 10 years is a huge task. Losing elections always leads people to seek the silver bullet—a new leader is all you need—so to retain the confidence, albeit amidst challenges, for so long and then be promoted to federal politics is an exceptional accolade.


From there, a distinguished ministerial career followed. Senator Conroy, on behalf of the Labor government, has provided a detailed, eloquent tribute. I do not seek to add to that but to simply say that as a coalition we note his resilience, his skill as an orator and his passion. We also note that he was deservedly seen as a respected friend of the Jewish community. The coalition acknowledges the service of the Hon. Clyde Holding to our nation. Our condolences are expressed to his widow and his four children.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:07):  I too speak in support of this condolence motion on the death of the former Leader of the Opposition in Victoria and former member for Melbourne Ports and minister in the Hawke Labor government, Clyde Holding. The name 'Clyde Holding' was first noticed by members of the Labor Party when as a 24-year-old law student in 1955, following the catastrophic split in the party, he was appointed as the new antigrouper secretary of the Victorian Young Labor Association. It was to be the start of a very long life in politics. As a young lawyer in the 1950s, Clyde specialised in industrial accidents and went on to establish, with other Labor lawyers, the law firm Holding, Ryan and Co., now Holding Redlich, which was later to become a leading Melbourne legal practice.


The death in 1962 of Bill Towers, a bootmaker, Gallipoli veteran and also president of the Collingwood branch of the Australian Soviet Friendship League during World War II, required a by-election for the seat of Richmond. Clyde contested Labor preselection—held under the questionable auspices of the Victorian central executive—and he won by one vote. Needless to say, he easily won the seat in the May 1962 by-election, with a thumping 66 per cent of the primary vote, commencing 36 years of continuous service in state and federal parliament. In the early years he established his member's office in the front room of his house in Waltham Street, Richmond. He maintained cordial relations with the Richmond local Labor machine, those dynasties of the Loughnan and O'Connell families—a not inconsiderable achievement in itself. Much has been written about the ALP in Richmond in those years, both fiction and non-fiction, but throughout it all Clyde survived and his standing and reputation grew.


It is difficult in the 21st century to understand the parlous state of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party in the 1960s and 1970s. For me, it is summed up best by Barry Jones's wonderful description of Labor's campaign launch in 1964, when Clyde was seeking re-election after his first term. Barry himself of course, as we have heard, contested a leadership battle against Clyde in 1976, leading to that famous comment from Clyde, 'Quiz kids can't count'. Barry Jones vividly recalled the 1964 campaign launched by Labor opposition leader Clive Stoneham in Prahran Town Hall with a speech televised live:


We sat in the hall, hoping for the best but fearing the worst. The speech had been prepared by the ALP head office, with minimal consultation with Stoneham. He was to read the speech from large sheets of pasteboard on which the text had been written. At the top left corner of the first sheet his name, 'CLIVE', had been written in capitals as a cue to avoid confusion. Unfortunately, the curves of the letter 'C' had been drawn over-generously, so the letter resembled an 'O'.


At 8pm the live telecast began. Allan Fraser—


the member for Eden-Monaro, who had been brought down from New South Wales to be campaign director in the election—


stood by the first pasteboard sheet, pointing to the name 'CLIVE'. The Leader looked baffled and said nothing. Allan Fraser tapped the name 'CLIVE' again. Silence. He tapped a third time. Clive Stoneham smiled, relaxed and mysteriously began his televised campaign election speech with the words, 'Thank you, Olive'.


Worse was to come. The speech was due to run on television for 30 minutes, but Stoneham finished after 25. Inviting questions from the floor was not considered to be a good idea, so Dinny Lovegrove, Deputy Leader and an excellent impromptu speaker, was called on. Unhappily, he reached back to his deep memory as a Trotskyist in the 1930s. He began:


'We know what this election is about: the struggle between the rich and the poor. We know who our enemies are: the kind of people who have two cars in the garage, central heating and a sprinkler system in the lawn. And on their walls, they have something that looks as if two cockroaches have been crawling about in Indian ink, a piece of so-called modern art!'


Barry concluded:


It was great rhetoric. Unhappily, Labor lost more seats and it was eighteen years before we won another Victorian election.


It fell to Clyde Holding, after Labor suffered its fifth consecutive defeat in the 1967 Victorian state election, to succeed Clive Stoneham and take on the tough job of party leader. His 10 years of leadership coincided with a party struggling to deal with the impact of the split, a weak and ineffective parliamentary team, a state parliamentary organisation overwhelmingly focused on internal party matters, and Victorian politics dominated by Henry Bolte and then Dick Hamer as Liberal premiers, propped up in power by the DLP. Clyde Holding led Labor in three successive election losses in 1970, 1973 and 1976. For Clyde these years must have been as frustrating as they were gruelling. Clyde was a committed campaigner against the death penalty in Victoria. He was an active and vocal opponent of the death penalty cases of Robert Peter Tait in 1962 and of Ronald Ryan in 1967, the last man to be legally executed in Australia.


Clyde was arrested at one protest against the hanging of Ronald Ryan. He used to recount with great amusement the story of how the local police sergeant had ordered a compliant constable to go down to the demo and pick out the biggest yobbo he could find and bring him in. That yobbo was Clyde. Back at the station Clyde was asked for his name, which he gave, Allan Clyde Holding; his occupation, which he gave, lawyer and member of parliament; and was bowled over by the next question: 'Can you read or write?' Clyde survived the experience.


Clyde was a tough operator in a tough environment against an equally tough opponent, Henry Bolte. On one occasion he received a grudging compliment from Bolte at an end-of-year function. I have been told that Bolte said of Clyde Holding, 'I don't have a son but if I did have one I'd like him to be like you—dirty, hard and rotten.' Praise indeed from Henry Bolte.


Clyde made the move to federal politics in 1977 when he contested Labor preselection for Melbourne Ports, which had been held by Frank Crean for 26 years. He was up against a very strong candidate in Frank's son, Simon, but repeating the pattern of his 1962 preselection success he won the ballot by the narrowest of margins: one vote. Clyde represented Melbourne Ports for 21 years from 1977 to 1998. Unlike his career in the Victorian parliament, spent entirely on the opposition benches, he served in the federal parliament throughout the years of the Hawke and Keating governments.


From 1983 to 1990 he served as a minister and for a short period in cabinet. As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Hawke government from 1983 to 1987, he placed Aboriginal land rights firmly on the national agenda. The handing back of Uluru to its traditional owners in 1985 in the face of hostile opposition, particularly from the Northern Territory government, was a highlight. In fact Clyde Holding had a very early and deep commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs long before they became mainstream issues. He was deeply frustrated by opposition to his plans to recognise native title years before the High Court's Mabo decision.


He concluded his ministerial career with responsibility for the arts. Not all ministers for the arts have been passionate about the arts themselves but Clyde was widely read. He was a Shakespearean tragic, a collector of paintings, including Aboriginal barks, and a lover of music. He played a central role in the Commonwealth's receipt of the great gift of Bundanon from the painter Arthur Boyd. He was responsible for expanding the Film Finance Corporation, the National Archives, the National Gallery and the National Library.


After Labor was returned in the 1990 federal election and after service in five portfolios Clyde stayed on the back bench until his retirement from parliament at the 1998 election. I served in the federal parliamentary Labor Party with Clyde for nine years. He had a quirky sense of humour, always seemed easygoing, was a prodigious reader, was curious and certainly was very skilful on his feet. He was a stump orator of the very highest calibre. More than that, he was exceptionally effective in parliamentary debate. And he was deeply committed to Labor values.


Mr President, Clyde Holding made a difference and he will be missed. My sincere sympathy also goes to Clyde's family and his many friends.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:47):  Today we mark the anniversary of the Prime Minister's carbon tax lie. Today we mark the anniversary of the Prime Minister's broken promise, which she solemnly and emphatically made on 16 August 2010 in the shadow of a difficult election that was just five days away and that she knew she was at serious risk of losing. Five days before the last election, when the Prime Minister knew she was in trouble, the hollow men in her office and the spin doctors at Sussex Street in Sydney and around Australia were telling her, 'Unless you make an emphatic promise that there will be no carbon tax under a government you lead, chances are that our government will be history and you will no longer be Prime Minister come 22 August.' The only reason the Prime Minister looked down the barrel of that camera and talked directly to the Australian people, five days before the last election, is that she knew that she had to rule out a carbon tax otherwise she was not going to be Prime Minister for more than another five days.


The carbon tax is a bad tax based on a lie. It is a broken promise and it is a policy we oppose, firstly because it is a broken promise, but also because it is bad policy for Australia. The carbon tax is bad for household budgets, it is bad for the economy and it is no good for the environment either. The lie continues, because the Prime Minister tells us that the whole point of the carbon tax is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. She tells us that somehow this carbon tax package will help Australia make a contribution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. But, of course, it will not do anything of the sort. The lie continues to this day.


The carbon tax will push up the cost of everything, it will make Australia less competitive internationally, it will cost jobs and it will hurt small business, and all of that without doing anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It will make overseas emitters more competitive than even the most environmentally efficient equivalent businesses in Australia. Helping overseas emitters to take market share away from businesses in Australia is not effective action on climate change; it is a reckless and irresponsible act of economic self-harm.


I note that we have a senator from Tasmania in the chamber with us. I have travelled around Australia over the past five or six weeks, including to an aluminium smelter in Bell Bay, in the seat of Bass. I am sure that Senator Polley well knows which company I am talking about. It is a company that over the past 20 years has done much to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It has done much to reduce its energy intensity. It has done much to reduce the emissions it produces. In fact, as Senator Polley would know, as a manufacturing business in the great state of Tasmania it draws most of its energy from hydro. I see Senator Polley is nodding, so she agrees with me.


But, do you know what will happen with this carbon tax? Aluminium smelters in China will become more competitive than the aluminium smelter in Bell Bay, near Launceston. Aluminium smelters in China will take market share from the aluminium smelter in Tasmania. That is what they have told us. I see that Senator Polley is now shaking her head, so she no longer agrees. But I know for a fact that the Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten, was there meeting with the good people at the aluminium smelter on the same day I was there. We were both told that in this current economic environment, where they are right on the edge in terms of international com­petitiveness—given the strength of the Australian dollar and given the state of the economy internationally, generally—that this carbon tax will seriously undermine and put further pressure on their international competitiveness position. They told that to representatives from the government as well as representatives from the Liberal-National party. They have said that this carbon tax will help businesses in China, who would be more polluting, to take market share from that particular business in Tasmania. That is not effective action on climate change. As a US congressman observed, this is more akin to an act of unilateral economic dis­armament.


I will go through some of the lies that are still being perpetrated now. I just talked about emitters in China. Manufacturing businesses in China cannot wait for this carbon tax to come into place. They know this will help them take market share from Australian manufacturing businesses. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Treasurer and others keep talking about how we are somehow going to reduce emissions by sending business overseas. But reducing emissions in Australia in a way that increases them by more in other parts of the world does not do anything for the environment; it actually leaves the world worse off environ­mentally. People here in Australia have been asked to make a sacrifice. Their jobs have been put at risk. They have been asked to pay more for their electricity, they have been asked to pay more for their gas and they have been asked to pay more for their household goods, and what for? Only to shift emissions to other parts of the world.


Let us just have a look at the impact that this carbon tax will have on emissions. Emissions in Australia are going to continue to go up. At present, according to the information that was released as part of the package, we put out levels of about 578 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in Australia in 2009-10. Under the core policy scenario, by 2020 our domestic emissions will be 621 million tonnes. Now emissions are continuing to go up. So the government says: 'Don't worry about that. They'll be lower than they otherwise would be. The reason we can say emissions are going down is that without a carbon tax they would go up by more. They're not going to go up by quite as much.'


Let us look at that argument. We turn around and say, 'What is going to be the impact on jobs?' We are told that jobs will continue to grow. The economy is going to continue to grow. But hang on: economic growth is going to be lower. There are going to be fewer jobs, and the government is saying that there is not going to be an impact of the carbon tax. When it comes to jobs, when it comes to the economy, you have to compare things with current levels. Compared with current levels, supposedly jobs are still going to go up, even though they are going to be lower than they otherwise would be. When it comes to emissions you cannot compare with current levels; you have to compare with what the situation would have been. You have to decide. If you say that emissions are going down just because they are going to be lower than they otherwise would have been, then you have to admit that jobs are going to go down as well—and of course the Treasury modelling assumes that real wages are going to go down.


Let us look at the impact on emissions globally. Only three years ago Treasury did what they said was the most comprehensive modelling ever done on anything to do with carbon pollution and so on. They assumed then that China, in 2020, would put out 16.1 billion tonnes of emissions. Three years later, they have revised their modelling. Now they think China will put out 17.9 billion tonnes of emissions by 2020. So just by having revised their expectations, they now think that Chinese emissions are going to be 1.8 billion tonnes higher in 2020 than what they thought three years ago. That is more than three times—




Senator Williams:
  Three times Australia's total.




Senator CORMANN:
  That is three times Australia's total annual emissions, which are currently less than 600 million tonnes. In 2005, China's emissions were at 7.2 billion. The global community now expects that China's emissions will be at 17.9 billion tonnes in 2020. That is an increase of 10 billion tonnes in emissions between 2005 and 2020.


This carbon tax package is a joke. It is a broken promise. It is bad for Australia. This is a bad tax based on a lie, and this parliament should not support it. The Prime Minister will stand condemned for her deceit  of the Australian people.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2011-08-16,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:57):  I always like following Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann has learned absolutely nothing from the inquiry that his party set up to look at the carbon tax. He has obviously not listened to Treasury. He has obviously not listened to any of the scientists. He is obviously determined to be a climate change denier and part of the right-wing group in the coalition that actually do not care about the long-term future of this country but are only interested in short-term politics. I think we have to come back, from time to time, to remind ourselves what this is all about. It is all about trying to deal with carbon pollution that is warming the planet.




Senator Williams:
  Carbon is not a pollutant.




Senator CAMERON:
  I hear Senator Williams interjecting that carbon is not a pollutant. This is typical of what I think is the bulk of the coalition's view. It is unscientific. It is antiscientific. It is trying to deny the science of climate change. Senator Williams at least does not make any bones about the fact that he is a denier of this stuff. That is to his credit. I do not accept what he says, but at least he does not deny it. The worst elements in the coalition are those that say, 'I agree with the science, but …'—and then they have all the arguments about why the science is not relevant. It is a nonsense.


Senator Birmingham will be talking here later. I think Senator Birmingham is one of the most tainted politicians in this chamber in relation to climate change. Senator Birmingham was a strong supporter of putting a price on carbon but, when he thought he could make some political progress within the coalition, he dumps his values, he dumps his policies—and what does he do? He takes up 'direct action'.


We have another group in the Senate who are obviously climate change deniers: the DLP. The DLP are here. I am never quite sure what pocket the DLP are in—whether it is the Nationals' pocket or the Liberals' pocket—but he is always in one of those pockets, let me tell you.




Senator Williams:
  He's not in your pocket!




Senator CAMERON:
  I really don't want him near my pocket! But let us see what the eminent scientists in this country say is the real issue. There is the CSIRO. Senator Williams would rely on the CSIRO plenty of times to get information about the climate, about the weather, about what is happening with carbon in the soil—he would rely on that. But he does not believe what the CSIRO say in their recent book, Climate Change: Science and Solutions for Australia. What do the CSIRO say? This is not a political party; this is Australia's scientists. They say: 'Climate change is one of the greatest ecological, economic, and social challenges facing us today.'


We agree on this side that these are huge challenges, but it takes the Labor Party to deal with big challenges. What you get from the coalition is misinformation, fear campaigns and an idealisation of people like Lord Monckton. What do we have? We had Senator Cormann, as I said in the last session, lining up to get Lord Monckton's autograph in Western Australia! That is the sort of level of anti-science that is in the coalition. It is clear that the climate change deniers are in control.


What do the CSIRO say? They say: 'The impacts of climate change are already clearly visible in Australia.' It is not a theory; it is 'clearly visible', according to the scientists. They say:


Southern and eastern Australia’s water supply reliability is expected to decline as a result of reduced rainfall and increased evaporation, affecting irrigation, domestic and industrial water use, and environmental flows.


How could any person who says they stand up for the bush deny the science? It is absolutely a joke.




Senator Cormann:
  You're clearly committed to do to the Labor vote what you've done to the AMWU membership!




Senator CAMERON:
  And here we have Senator Cormann! Senator Cormann must have gone up to have a look at Lord Monckton's autograph and he is all fired up and he wants to come after poor me, trying to deal with the scientific facts.



Senator Williams interjecting—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  We have the climate change deniers over there attacking me when I am dealing with the scientific facts. So, anyway, the National Party are doing a great disservice to the bush by being climate change deniers. The CSIRO go on to say:


Development and population growth in Australia’s coastal regions will exacerbate the risks from sea level rise and increase the likely severity and frequency of coastal flooding.


People who have a scientific brain are saying these things, but you can't expect Senator Williams, Senator Joyce, Senator Cormann or the DLP to actually understand these issues, because this is a political exercise for them. It is not a scientific exercise; it is an exercise in political denial. It is an exercise in misinformation. It is an exercise in fear campaigns. That is what the coalition are about.



The CSIRO go on to say our infrastructure is under threat. They say heatwaves, storms and floods will have a direct impact on the health of Australians. They say:


Moderate warming in the absence of rainfall declines can be beneficial to some agricultural crops, and higher levels of carbon dioxide can stimulate plant growth.


We hear this from the opposite side all the time. But the CSIRO say:




However
—





you know that


word 'however'—




… 
these positive effects can be offset


by changes in temperature, rainfall, pests, and the availability of nutrients. Production from cropping


and livestock is projected to decline over much of southern Australia, as is the quality of grain, grape,


vegetable, fruit, and other crops.



Senator Williams, you are doing your so-called constituency a great disservice by being a climate change denier, because you are denying the scientific facts. This is not an argument about whether the government's position is more economically responsible than the coalition's position; it is actually a debate between science and the deniers—and the deniers are in control in the coalition. Malcolm Turnbull actually knows the real position. I will come to Malcolm Turnbull in a minute. On the science, where is the document The science of climate change: questions and answers from? It is certainly not from the coalition. It is from the Australian Academy of Science. They explain climate change. They explain how the earth's climate has changed in the past and how it has changed in the recent past. They say unequivocally that human activities are causing climate change. They list the causes, similarly to the CSIRO. Then they ask the question of how we deal with the uncertainty of some of the science. They say this:


Although climate forecasts are uncertain and will remain so, the broad conclusions of climate change science as outlined above—


And I hope that the DLP are listening—


are based on many lines of evidence that together give a high degree of confidence. Partly because of scientific uncertainty but also because many aspects of human life are involved, decisions about action on climate change will need to involve extensive consideration of issues beyond science, including ethics, economics and risk management.


I have heard people argue that it is the sun that is doing it. NASA, who have more information and understanding about the sun than anybody else on the planet, do not agree with that proposition. I suppose that the NASA scientists are part of the climate science communist collusion against democracy—NASA. What NASA says is that the Arctic sea ice minimum has declined 11.5 per cent in this decade, that carbon dioxide is now 391 parts per million, that sea level is increasing by 3.27 millimetres a year, that global temperature has gone up 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1880 and that Greenland's land ice is reducing by 100 billion tonnes per year.


That is the science of the issue. We now have to deal with the politics. And the politics are underpinned on the other side by a lack of scientific understanding, a lack of scientific acceptance and attacks on our scientists. They are the cheerleaders for Alan Jones against people like Professor Karoly. Actually, I am not sure who is cheering who on. Why do they have this position? If you look at why they are doing this, they do not accept the science. They want to back in their big business backers in the mining industry. They want to back in the billionaires, such as Twiggy Forrest. They want to back in all those people who are opposing this because it might affect their profits. It is about time that those on the other side stood up for the Australian nation against the billionaire miners in this country. It is about time that they stood up for their constituency, because that constituency will be harmed. But what they are doing is simply relying on the donations flowing in from the billionaire miners and because of that they are taking a position against the national interest in support of the billionaire miners.


I have gone through some of the issues. But there is at least one—and there is more than that; we know that—coalition MP who knows the real truth here. Who is that? Malcolm Turnbull, who you all hailed as the most economically literate leader that you had ever had—back when he was your leader. But after he was knifed by the right wing—the extremists of the party—he suddenly became not economically literate. But he does have some economic literacy. I do not agree with everything that he says, but I agree with what he said about direct action, which is your supposed policy. He said that it was a recipe for fiscal recklessness. And you dare to come here and lecture us about fiscal responsibility when the most competent economic analyst on your side, Malcolm Turnbull, has got you pegged. He said that the chief advantage of the opposition's direct action policy is that it is easy to stop if you do not believe in preventing climate change. You do not believe in it.


What the government has done is take the challenge up. We are making sure that the polluters pay and not the community. You have a $70 billion black hole that you are trying to cover up. And one of the things that you are going to try and do is get rid of the department of climate change. You will want to get rid of the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology next. You are an absolute disgrace. Short-term politics are driving you and the national interest has dropped to second best. You are a disgrace. You are a rabble. You will fall apart and be exposed. And I hope to be there exposing you all the way down the line. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2011-08-16,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:12):  I note that Senator Cameron said that those on the other side use misinformation and fear campaigns. Senator Cameron, please do not leave the chamber. Stay here: I have some messages for you. He talks about carbon pollution. But what is it? Why is it when you go on to Google and you search for a list of pollutants carbon dioxide does not come up? 'Carbon pollution', Senator Cameron says. But 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the food that we eat is carbon. Did you enjoy your lunch of pollution today, Senator Cameron? Under your description, that is exactly what it is. That is misinformation, deception and propaganda.


One year gone since the big promise from the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She said it twice. And who was that backed up by? The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Mr Swan, with words to the effect that the accusations by Tony Abbott and the coalition that if Labor were re-elected they would introduce a carbon tax were 'hysterical'. The highest elected office in the country is Prime Minister. And what did she do? She betrayed the Australian people. The second highest elected position in this nation is Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Swan is also the Treasurer. He betrayed the Australian people as well. There are 150 members over in that other chamber, the House of Representatives. I know of 145 at least who went to the last election saying there would be no carbon tax. But now what is the government doing to the Australian people? Senator McLucas shakes her head. Well, there are 72 Labor members over there who said there would be no carbon tax. There are 73 coalition members. That makes 145. That was the policy of 145 of those elected members of parliament prior to the last election: 'There will be no carbon tax.' And what have we got? It was a big false claim. There was a backflip.


This is what is wrong with this government. The Australian people have lost trust in this government. They do not trust it to manage the money. We have seen the waste of money. They do not trust it to balance the books. We have seen debt—I looked at the website of the Australian Office of Financial Management last Friday—of $197 billion. That figure is renewed on the website every Friday. The Australian people do not trust you with money. They do not trust you in the way you spend it. They do not trust you in your borrowing and wasting of it. They do not trust your promises about no carbon tax. That is why the Labor Party, the Australian Labor Party—I should clarify because we have another Labor Party in this chamber now, the Democratic Labor Party—has a 2 in front of its primary vote in the polling: because the Australian people do not trust you. It is as simple as that. There is mis­management and waste and the government says: 'We will have the budget in surplus come next year. Next May there will be this big surplus budget.' But now it is backtracking on that. Surplus budgets are something that the Australian Labor Party does not understand. In the last 17 years of government under the Australian Labor Party, there have been four government budget surpluses. The ALP only sees red print all over its budgets.


But I will go back to this argument about the carbon tax and the cost to business. The cement industry are going to get a 94.5 per cent discount. That means they are only going to get taxed about $9 million. This is an industry that is facing huge competition from cheap imports from places like China. We have just seen the announcement of the closing down of the Kandos factory, with the loss of 98 jobs directly plus the truckies' jobs and all the other jobs that rely on it. They are gone. And you are going to put $9 million on that industry, which can hardly even afford to remain financially viable because of the high Australian dollar—brought about, I might add, by the high interest rates brought about by government waste and spending. Here is the government, foot on the accelerator, stimulating the economy, and the Reserve Bank has got its hand on the handbrake, pulling on it hard, with seven interest rate rises in a row—and we wonder why the Australian dollar is way above parity with the US dollar. That is one of the main reasons: our interest rates, including the 4.75 per cent official cash rate. 


What is the cost to business? The cement industry, which is already in trouble, will be in more trouble. In our Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes, chaired by the very capable Senator Cormann, we have heard about Bindaree Beef, an abattoir in the local town where I live, employing 630 people. I believe it is the biggest employer in the seat of New England. I hope Tony Windsor actually thinks about that one day before he votes on this tax. There will be a cost of $2.74 million to that abattoir in the first year. We can go around the countryside and show you the abattoirs closed down. You can go to Broome, Derby, Katherine, Coonamble, Guyra, Gunnedah or Byron Bay—you can go around and see them closed everywhere. And what is this government going to do? It is going to put taxes on these businesses. Do their competitors in America have to face a tax? No, they do not. It is just another nail in the coffin.


Then we have the cost to the transport industry. On 1 July 2014 there will be another 6.21c tax on the truckies' diesel—in other words, there will be less rebate for the truckies. The government has already taken 3½c off their rebate. The return to the truckies per litre of diesel was 18½c when Labor won government in 2007. Now it is down to 15c. The truckies use eight billion litres of diesel a year, so the government has already charged the trucking industry over $240 million. As Tony Sheldon told our committee, this carbon tax is a death tax. Truckies will be forced to work harder, work longer and drop the maintenance on their vehicles. That is what your Transport Workers Union colleague and supporter said. Senator McLucas may shake her head, but the evidence is in Hansard if you want to read the transcript of the committee hearings. It is all in Hansard. He referred to it as a death tax because he is showing common sense about the effect on the transport industry. 


Now we get to the most amazing thing of all. What is this going to do for the globe? When we get to the committee stage of this legislation, when it gets to this place, I will have a question. We know there are about 380 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere now. I want to know how much this tax will do to reduce those parts per million. That is what I want to know. The fact is that by 2020 our CO2 emissions will have gone up 43 million tonnes a year in Australia. We are not going down; we are going up. We have heard the figure today from Senator Cormann. China is going to go up by about eight billion tonnes to 17.9 billion tonnes. So we are going up. What are we going to do then? With some of that $72 billion taxed from the 500 largest emitters, we are going to buy carbon credits. This is when it is going to get really interesting. We are going to buy those credits from places overseas like Nigeria—they might be selling carbon credits—Brazil and Argentina. Who is going to check and police those carbon credits, to make sure they are for real and are not fake, fraudulent? This is opening up a whole new game around the world to transfer money off to other countries. That is what this is about. 


In Australia, we are going to have the carbon cops. Bob Carr and Kim Yeadon, when he was minister—Kimberley Maxwell Yeadon, the jumped-up shop steward, as John Laws used to refer to him—brought in the tree police. A farmer who pushed over a tree faced a fine of up to $50,000. They talk about property rights. We are going to have the carbon cops. If a company puts in the wrong information, there will be a fine of up to $1.1 million or 10 years jail or both. They are going to be going around policing our companies. But what is going to happen with these credits we are buying from overseas? We will have no idea, but the billions will flow. I think the greatest statistic of all is that the emissions trading scheme that has been in place in 27 European Union countries plus three other countries—30 in total—for more than 5½ years, covering about 500 million people producing 14 per cent of the world CO2, collects approximately $500 million a year. That is $1 per person—$1 for producing 14 per cent of the world's emissions. We are going to tax Australians almost $400 per person—400 times the amount—for producing one-tenth of the emissions, 1.4 per cent. Is that justice? Is that fair? Emissions are going to go up. I am a firm believer in climate change. I believe the climate has been changing for millions of years and will continue to do so. They say the sea levels are rising. Why has Deb O'Neill MP bought a house down near the beach? Why is Minister Carmel Tebbutt moving down near the beach? If the sea level were going to rise, that would be the last place you would be going. They do not even think it is going to rise. I will check those statistics out, but that is the information—that is two Labor MPs who have moved down close to the waterfront, having total faith that the sea levels will not rise. This is a farce. In this inquiry we are having in the committee that Senator Madigan is part of, the more we dive into this whole carbon tax plan, the more ridiculous we can see the whole plan is.

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (18:22):  That rant and rave just show you how important it is to come into this chamber and have these debates. I welcome this debate. I think I and my colleagues would be happy to be here minute after minute and hour after hour debating this issue, because—

  You keep interjecting but with no alternative points of policy and no alternative points of fact. We just listen to ramble after ramble. Let me give you a—



Senator Nash interjecting—



Senator Williams interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Crossin is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Thank you very much, sir. Let me just give you one really good example of a ramble. I am surprised—but maybe the next speaker might go to this. This is an example of why we would be happy to debate endlessly in this chamber our policy on putting a price on carbon. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, just today, talking about the position that Qantas has taken in taking jobs offshore, said this:


Clearly Labor’s Carbon Tax has not assisted Qantas in its need to compete internationally.


Suddenly, today, that is the carbon price's problem. That is this government's problem. Senator Abetz went on to say:


Planes can’t fly without fuel and the imposition of Labor’s Carbon Tax will have on operating costs is bad news for the aviation sector.


Guess what? This is another example of the mistruths, mismanagement and clear lack of understanding that we have from the opposition in this parliament, because—wait for it—there is actually no tax being applied to aviation fuel. Not only that, but our policy kicks in on 1 July next year, so how can you possibly blame the position that Qantas has taken—




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. It is clear. On actually stating the truth there, it is clear in the legislation that it is going on—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, could you explain the point of order.




Senator Williams:
  the fuel, domestic fuel, aeroplane fuel.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Let me clearly respond to that. Before you rush into this scare campaign, that is exactly what you need to do: read the legislation and try and get a grasp of the policy issues that we are putting before this country and this parliament. In fact, there will be no carbon price on international aviation flying from Australia. Get that clear. Get that really clear. But that has absolutely nothing to do with the position that Qantas has taken today. The carbon price will not even come into effect until 1 July next year. So we have another example just today where the Leader of the Opposition in this very chamber misleads, once again, on the carbon price on aviation, trying to pretend to the rest of this country, to Qantas workers, to Qantas passengers and to clients of Qantas that somehow this government is responsible for the decision that Qantas has taken. As Minister Combet said in the press release he released just half an hour or so ago: 'Senator Abetz has today revealed just how far the coalition is prepared to go in its unprincipled fear campaign against a carbon price.' Once again, Minister Combet is right. He is absolutely right.


While we are talking about scare campaigns here, let us turn the tables a bit about the deceitful, unprincipled and reckless scare campaign that is being run by the opposition and their leader, Mr Abbott, as he tries desperately to prove to the people of this country that he is fit to lead this country, that he is fit to be Prime Minister and that in fact he has an alternative policy. There is an alternative policy, but it is far worse, much worse, in terms of its impact on households than you could ever imagine. I will get to that a bit later if I get a chance. Claim after claim from Mr Abbott can be clearly discredited. It is all based on fear. It is based on a lack of understanding. It is based on an inability to grasp the fact that climate is changing.


We want to have an impact on that change. We want to have an impact on carbon that is put into the air. We want to put a price on carbon and we want this country to be involved in that and be a leader around the rest of the world.


Let us have a look at the first claim from Mr Abbott. He said on 19 July:


I mean, that’s my position and that’s always been my position but I’ve never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme …


That is what he said on 19 July. Well, this is the real fact about that claim. Mr Abbott was a senior minister in the Howard government that went to the 2007 election—let us talk about that point in time, the 2007 election and what was said prior to that election, where the party of the people sitting opposite me went to that election—with a policy of introducing an emissions trading scheme. And yet he said:


… I've never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme …


So what does that mean? When the coalition parties went to the election in 2007, everyone wanted an emissions trading scheme—oh, that is right, except Mr Abbott, and he only just remembered that on 19 July this year.


He also previously said:


I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?


Who said that? Mr Abbott said that. When did he say that? On 29 July 2009, not long ago. What did he mean by that? He said:


I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?


In fact, that was not one year ago; it was two years ago that he said that. Here is another claim from Mr Abbott:


… climate change is real, humanity does make a contribution to it and we’ve got to take effective action against it. I mean, that’s my position and that’s always been my position …


That was on 19 July 2011, just this year. The fact is that Mr Abbott has previously said that the science of climate change was 'absolute crap'. One minute he thinks it is crap but a couple of years later he says that climate change is real. So those opposite have the audacity to want to come into this chamber and debate what our leader has said—a credible Prime Minister who is trying to forge a path in this country in tackling climate change, making a difference and being part of the rest of the world in having an effect—but are not prepared to have a really good look and scrutinise what their leader has said.


I note that, as I started to quote from Mr Abbott, those opposite have run away—like Shrek and the donkey. They have run out of the chamber because, when you turn the tide back on this party and start to light the fire under the Bunsen burner and turn a bit of heat up, they all disappear and dissipate. They do not like it and they all run away. 'We don't want to talk about it. Let's not talk about Mr Abbott's view on climate change. Let's talk about anything else.' Mr Abbott does not have a view about climate change that is consistent. From day to day, week to week and year to year Mr Abbott does not have a view that is consistent about climate change and what he would do about it.


Then there was a third claim. Should I keep going? We might be able to get the others opposite to run away as well if I keep going.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator CROSSIN:
  Yes, that is right, this is cruel and the Australian public need to know how cruel it would be if they had such a leader as Mr Abbott as Prime Minister. Mr Abbott said on 19 July:


... there is no doubt that this package, as it stands, is going to do terrible damage to the aluminium industry in this country.


That is exactly what he claimed. What is the fact of that statement? If those opposite actually grasped and read our policy and reiterated our policy accurately, they would see that aluminium in fact will receive significant assistance under the government's Jobs and Competitiveness Program. Alan Cransberg, the Managing Director of Alcoa of Australia said:


I am confident the government has heard our concerns and provided measures that can help our Australian facilities remain globally competitive.


That was in the Alcoa Community e-news of July 2011. Should I keep going? Probably not. We could spend all night talking about Mr Abbott and his inconsistent views about this tax and his inability to reiterate and articulate a policy that would be credible amongst the Australian public.


Let us just talk about what we are going to do and the positive impact that this government will make. With our plan to cut carbon pollution we are also planning to drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. We want to do two things. We want to cut the pollution, the emissions, that are out there in the atmosphere and we want to turn this country into a clean, green energy future; a clean, green future that drives energy using the likes of solar, gas and wind.


I hear some people say, 'I don't think we are going to have much of an impact here.' That is a claim you will hear often from the people opposite. 'Why are we doing this? If the rest of the world isn't doing it, why should we do it? It's not going to have any benefit.' Well, the rest of the world is doing it. The rest of the world is actually addressing this problem, but most people opposite do not want to acknowledge or accept that. They would like you to believe that we are standing on an island, literally by ourselves, compared to the rest of the world. It is not true. It is absolutely not true.


Over 89 countries, which account for over 80 per cent of the world's global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy, have pledged to reduce or limit their carbon pollution by 2020. In fact scores of countries have already started the transformation to a low-pollution economy. Some 32 countries and a number of the US states already have emissions trading schemes in place. Our five top trading partners—China, Japan, the US, Korea and India, and, among others, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands—have implemented or are piloting an emissions trading scheme or carbon taxes at the national, state, or city level. We are not alone.


The fact that we are moving now at such a late stage in this country's development means that we are lagging behind. We could have done this 18 months ago but, of course, all we could do then was stand back and watch the circus on the other side decide that climate change was so unacceptable and so intolerable to tackle that they dumped their leader in favour of someone who was an absolute sceptic about it. That is about all the contribution to climate change we have seen from the Liberal Party in this country. They just drop a leader who had some commitment to climate change and replace him with a leader who has no commitment to it. In fact he believes it is 'absolute crap'.


New Zealand introduced a trading scheme in 2008 initially covering only forestry but then, last year, it expanded significantly to cover liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy and industrial processes. And then there is China. We had questions today in question time about China. China has indicated that it will introduce an emissions trading pilot scheme in a number of provinces including the industrial centres of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. China is on the program. Mr Abbott is not, but China is on the program. The World Bank recently indicated that these regional schemes may be expanded to a national scheme by 2015. China has the world's largest installed renewable energy electricity generation capacity. In 2009 China added 37 gigawatts of renewable power capacity, more than any other country in the world.


If we want to talk about another country that is continually raised by those people opposite, let us move on to India. India has a tax on coal which is expected to generate over half a billion dollars annually to fund research into clean energy technologies. The US is committed to achieving its target to reduce its emissions by 17 per cent by 2020. We have countries that are acting and we have countries that are moving on climate change and are committed to it. Let us have a look very closely at exactly what people are saying about our package as we move to introduce this legislation. Professor Garnaut stated on 10 July:


This is a strong climate change policy package. It will allow Australia to do its fair share in an effective global effort to reduce the risks of climate change, and to do so at reasonable cost.


David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, in a letter to the Prime Minister on 31 July said this:


I was delighted to hear of the ambitious package of climate change policy measures you announced on 10 July and wanted to congratulate you on taking this bold step.


He must be a Conservative Party leader who does have a little bit of vision, unlike his comrade in the Liberal Party here in Australia. Geoff Garrett, Queensland Chief Scientist, said on 19 July:


The science indicates that we have anthropogenic (man-made) global warming and we need to reduce carbon emissions …


As such, I do support ... that in order to get the market forces going, you do need to put a price on carbon.


Many people have come out. I have sheets and sheets of them here, which I will not read out because I will not have enough time. We have an attempt by the people opposite to still pretend that we do not have to do anything to act on carbon. If we were to do something under their plan, households would pay and we would compensate polluters. We would provide them with incentives and at the end of the day householders would be far worse off under their plan.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-16,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (18:38):  It is a pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance on this very significant anniversary of the Prime Minister's most solemn election promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Perhaps she does not lead this government. Perhaps the leaders of the government are not in the chamber at present but are found over in that quarter of the Senate chamber. Perhaps they are the leaders of the government.




Senator Crossin:
  Who leads your party, Simon?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Thank you for the interjection, Senator Crossin. Let me deal with some of the things that you raised. You wanted to talk about Senator Abetz's comments on Qantas. You wanted to talk about Qantas and what the impact might be on them and on the aviation industry. Let us be very clear: the aviation industry is a shining example of why this is bad policy. Why is that? Because you are going to put up the prices for the aviation industry that is operating in Australia. It will be far more expensive as a result of the carbon tax for people to hop on a plane and go on holiday in North Queensland—




Senator McLucas:
  How much?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  In your home state, Senator McLucas, it will be more expensive for people to take a trip and holiday than to go overseas. Senator Crossin was right: flights out of Australia will not have the tax applied to aviation fuel, but flights in Australia will. So this is a tax that discriminates against domestic tourism. It is a tax that makes it more expensive for people to holiday at home and cheaper for them to go and spend their money overseas. That is what this government has set up. Just as the CEO of Coca-Cola Amatil highlighted some time ago, this is a discriminatory tax because it makes everything in Australia more expensive compared with things imported from overseas. That is the truth of it. There is no arguing about that. Imports do not face a carbon tax impost whatsoever, but locally produced goods and services do and the same applies for the tourism industry, which will be particularly hard hit.



Senator McLucas interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am sorry; I will have to be a little quieter to hear your interjections, Senator McLucas. Qantas was not the only company to announce job losses today. Unfortunately OneSteel joined Qantas in announcing 400 job losses. OneSteel is a major employer in the South Australian regional city of Whyalla in my home state. They announced losses of 400 jobs as a result of seeing an 11 per cent decline in their profit over the course of this year.




Senator McEwen:
  You are not going to blame that on the carbon tax, surely.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator McEwen, what I am going to do is quote OneSteel. I would not want to misrepresent their position at all. In terms of One Steel looking at their forward outlook and 'factors that could cause actual results or perform­ance to differ materially', they highlight 'legislative changes, regulatory changes or other changes in the laws which affect OneSteel's business, including environmental laws and the carbon tax'. They certainly see in their risk factors, in their profile for the future, the carbon tax looming large. That is unsurprising given that in the presentation they released today it states that the carbon tax, as we now know, will be $23 a tonne. It would be nice if the government did some Treasury modelling on that price rather than a made up price of $20, which the carbon tax is not. That is a different matter. OneSteel go on to say, 'Based on FY10 production expected tax for scope 1 and 2 emissions would be $18.4m'—$18.4 million off the bottom line. You would have to reconsider your employment and your outlook when you face an $18.4 million hit coming down the line at you. It is little wonder, especially in these times of such international uncertainty, the high dollar and the weakness in parts of the Australian economy. All of these things combine with an utter lack of comprehensive global action to demonstrate that this is the worst possible time to be contemplating something like this and inflicting it on companies like Qantas or OneSteel or anybody else within Australia.


Senator Crossin wanted to paint a rosy picture of international action. Here is a challenge for the government: does anybody in the government believe that when they go to the Conference of the Parties in Durban later this year to discuss climate change there will be a new legally binding agreement? Will there be something to replace Kyoto when it expires in 2012? That is right: the current legally binding agreement expires next year. The jig is almost up; time is almost out. Does anybody in this government actually think, after the debacle of Copenhagen, that they are going to get anything more than the flimsy pledges that are made, which are hardly worth the bits of paper they are written on given the utter lack of action by governments around the world to back them up? Most governments around the world could not even bring themselves to meet the allegedly legally binding com­mitments they made under Kyoto, so lord only knows what they are going to do when it comes to meeting these pledges that have been made to date.


Senator Crossin decided she wanted to highlight India putting a price on emissions in the coal industry or the use of coal. She said it is going to raise half a billion dollars. Isn't that exciting. It is going to raise half a billion dollars.




Senator Williams:
  A billion people, half a billion dollars.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  A billion people indeed, Senator Williams, and they are going to raise half a billion dollars from their carbon price. Well, our much smaller economy with a much, much smaller 22 million Australians is going to raise $9 billion. We are going to raise 18 times what the Indians are going to raise. And Senator Crossin thinks this is a good comparison and a good demonstration—




Senator McEwen interjecting
—





Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  You want to go to budget responsibilities, Senator McEwen? I do not have the time to go to budget and fiscal responsibility with you lot. I have the carbon tax to deal with first. Senator Crossin thinks that half a billion dollars raised in India is comparable and is justification for us to have a $9 billion slug on the Australian economy. It really is just remarkable.


Senator Cameron spoke earlier in this debate and he actually had a few things to say about me. I thank Senator Cameron for flattering me with his attention. It is nice to get that, even when you are not in the chamber at the time. He accused me of being tainted in this debate. 'Tainted' was the word he wanted to use. I would love to know, in a fair analysis, what on earth Senator Cameron thinks the Prime Minister is. If I am 'tainted', what is the Prime Minister? She is utterly compromised in this debate now. She stands with no credibility left, having convinced the former Prime Minister to ditch his ETS and having gone to an election. Let us be honest: she went to an election, and we would all be saying, hypothetically, that she lied at the election, were it not unparliamentary to do so. That is what people would be saying: the Prime Minister misled, led the Australian people up the garden path, told mistruths—however you want to put it. It is crystal clear what she did. We all know what the words were—'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'—one year ago today.


We know what Wayne Swan said one year ago yesterday: 'Well, certainly, what we reject is this hysterical allegation somehow that we are moving towards a carbon tax. We certainly reject that.' One year ago today it was an hysterical allegation. Not long after that, it was fact. It went from hysteria to fact because the government was misleading at every single step of the way. This govern­ment wants to come in here and try to debate everything and anything but the reality that they lied to the people at the last election, that they lied their way into office. As a result of that, they are now pursuing a policy that has absolutely no mandate, that was rejected by the Australian people, and they are not game to take it back. They are not game to go back and give Australians a fair chance, a fair choice to actually decide this. That is the challenge to them. Front up to the people. Let them have their say. Have courage in your convictions. That is when we might actually see a fair debate on this issue.

The documents read as follows—





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS REPORT ON ITS INQUIRY INTO THE AUSTRALIAN LAW REFORM COMMISSION 



The Government has repeatedly put on record its strong support for the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and agrees with the Senate Committee’s assessment that the ALRC's work is widely respected.


Since its establishment in 1973, the ALRC has concluded more than 100 inquiries and has made a substantial contribution to the public debate on issues as diverse as privacy, personal insolvency, the use of genetic information, admiralty law and the operation of the federal justice system.


This contribution continues, with the ALRC’s recent work with the New South Wales Law Reform Commission on family violence (ALRC 114: Family Violence – A National Legal Response (2010). The recommendations in this report are helping to shape the Government’s response to this complex issue, including by influencing the landmark Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 that is currently before this Parliament.


The ALRC is currently going through a period of transition. Reforms made to the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996 (the Act) by the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 give the ALRC greater flexibility in the way it goes about its work whilst providing an appropriate governance framework that preserves its independence.


The Government believes that the reforms will generate opportunities and ongoing benefits for the Commission, and is committed to working closely with the Commission as it adapts to these changes. 




Recommendation 1



6.1 The committee recommends that the Australian Government restore the ALRC's budget cuts for the period 2010-11 to 2013-14 as a matter of urgency.




Government Response to Recom

Not accepted


As with other Australian Government agencies, the Commission is required to meet the efficiency dividend. The Commission’s budget was also reduced in the 2009 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the savings from which are a key component of the Government’s commitment to returning the Budget to surplus and maintaining spending restraint to support long-term stability.


The Government is satisfied that the ALRC has sufficient funding to discharge its important statutory function – to conduct inquiries into matters referred to it by the Attorney-General.


The ALRC is implementing a range of measures that will provide substantial savings over time, but which will not compromise the delivery of its core work. These measures include relocating to more affordable premises.


In the interim, additional financial assistance is being provided to the ALRC through the Attorney-General’s Department to allow the appointment of a second full-time commissioner to assist for the duration of the review of the National Classification Scheme. Terms of reference for this inquiry were released on 24 March 2011.


The Government has full confidence in the ability of the President of the ALRC, Professor Rosalind Croucher, to manage the organisation within its appropriation.




Recommendation 2



6.2 The committee recommends that the ALRC Act be amended to provide for a minimum of two standing, fixed-term (not inquiry-specific), full-time commissioners.




Recommendation 3



6.3 The committee recommends that an additional full-time commissioner be appointed, for each additional inquiry referred to the ALRC, in circumstances where the ALRC already has two or more ongoing inquiries.




Government Response to Recommendations 2 and 3



Not accepted


A key aspect of the reforms contained in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 is the removal of mandated numbers of commissioners. The purpose of this reform is to allow the ALRC to use its appropriation more flexibly in responding to the work it has on hand. This revised structure takes into account the varied, and often highly technical, subject matters of inquiries.


As outlined in relation to Recommendation 1, the Government has appointed a second full time Commissioner, Professor Terry Flew, for the duration of the inquiry into the National Classification System. Professor Flew’s expertise in media and communications will be a great asset to the Commission for this review.


The Government anticipates that the second Commissioner position will continue to be filled beyond the inquiry into the National Classification System. In keeping with the Government’s desire for greater flexibility, the Government would look to fill the position in a way that best suits the ALRC’s program of work at the time of any appointment. 


The Attorney-General is committed to ensuring that consultation with the ALRC on its capacity to take on new work continues to occur before new references are given.




Recommendation 4



6.4 The committee recommends that the ALRC's public information and education services program be resumed immediately.




Government Response



It is a matter for the President to determine the best use the ALRC’s resources to undertake inquiries into matters referred to it by the Attorney-General.




Recommendation 5



6.5 The committee recommends that the ALRC be provided with all necessary resources to enable it to continue to travel to undertake face-to-face consultations as part of its inquiry processes.




Government Response



It is a matter for the President to determine the best use the ALRC’s resources to undertake inquiries into matters referred to it by the Attorney-General.


While the Government agrees that there is value in face-to-face consultations, the ALRC’s innovative use of online consultation practices demonstrates the variety of ways in which a law reform body can reach stakeholders.




Conclusion



As it approaches 40 years at the forefront of law reform in this country, the Government believes the ALRC is well equipped to respond to new challenges and opportunities.


The Government has an ambitious law reform agenda and is confident the ALRC will make a significant contribution to that agenda.


 




AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE


RELATIONS REFERENCES COMMITTEE
'
S REPORT OF THE 
INQUIRY INTO INDUSTRY SKILLS COUNCILS





JUNE 2011



The Australian Government has a continuing commitment to investing in the economy's productive capacity through better and more targeted skills and training, measures to boost participation, and improving the private sector's opportunities to invest in infrastructure.


Through the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, announced as part of the 2011-2012 Budget, the Government has invested in a new approach to deliver the skilled workers the economy needs. The package has four components:


placing industry at the heart of the training system


modernising apprenticeships


skills to support increased participation


reform of the national training system.


The package strengthens and extends the role of industry in the national Vocational Education and Training (VET) system. The involvement of industry in the Australian VET system has been a defining feature of vocational education and training in Australia for almost two decades, and has given rise to its high international standing.


Primarily, industry engagement is realised by representation of industry bodies on, and industry direct input to, the various formal committees and councils that guide the policy agenda for the national training system. This high level of engagement at all levels of decision making ensures that industry plays a leading role in driving training policies, priorities and delivery.


The core of industry's leadership of VET in Australia is also realised through its active involvement in the development of industry-validated Training Packages. Through a network of Industry Skills Councils (ISCs), industry has a direct say in determining relevant skills needs for the industry and defining the competencies required in the workplace.


Since ISCs were established in 2005, their role and responsibilities in the national VET system has been expanded and strengthened. ISCs are recognised and accepted as key organisations underpinning the effectiveness of the national VET system and key sources of advice regarding workforce skills and training needs.


The Building Australia's Future Workforce package reflects the significant role of ISCs in the national VET system. ISCs will be key contributors to the implementation of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package through participation and collaboration in all four of the package's components, for example, in the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, National Workforce Development Fund, Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programs and Apprenticeship reform.




Background





National Vocational Education and Training (VET) System



For more than 15 years, Australia's Commonwealth and state and territory governments have worked with industry to develop a national training system that provides the basis for high quality and nationally recognised training.


Under Australia's Constitution, primary responsibility for schooling and vocational education resides with the state and territory governments. In general, the Australian Government takes a national leadership role and works collaboratively with the states and territories, industry and the community to advance national consistency, coherence, quality and effectiveness of education and training in all sectors across Australia. It focuses on the development of national and international priorities, policies and strategies for education, while the states and territories are responsible for regulation and delivery within their borders.




National Skills Framework



The national VET system is underpinned by the National Skills Framework. The National Skills Framework provides the basis for high quality, flexible, nationally consistent vocational education and training which meets industry needs and which employers can trust. The framework has three components:


1. Australian Qualifications Framework (commonly known as the AQF) —establishes the appropriate level of qualifications according to broad vocational competency levels.


2. Training Packages — establish the competency outcomes from nationally recognised training.


3. Australian Quality Training Framework — sets the national standards for the registration and audit of training organisations and accreditation of courses.




Industry Skills Councils (ISCs)



ISCs, and a new national industry training advisory body for the automotive industry-Auto Skills Australia, are privately registered companies run by industry-based boards of directors (employer and employee representatives). Their funding is provided substantially by the Australian Government through the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR).


ISCs and Auto Skills Australia are independent of government, employer and employee bodies, regulators and licensing bodies, and Registered Training Organisations (ISCs and Auto Skills Australia cannot be Registered Training Organisations). ISCs bring together industries, peak bodies, enterprises, unions, training organisations and governments through a national system of industry advisory arrangements and structures based on industry-led boards of directors and committees. Thus ISCs are uniquely placed in the Australian VET system to:


develop nationally agreed qualifications;


provide independent advice on workforce and skills needs;


assist enterprises with workforce development and training needs.


The Senate Report of the Inquiry into ISCs reflects the overwhelming message of the 119 submissions to the Inquiry that:


the role and work of the ISCs was valued by VET stakeholders;


ISCs were operating well;


they were viewed as fundamental to the effective operation of the national VET system.


The Report's recommendations reinforce the message of the submissions and suggest some improvements in the operation and management of the ISCs. These have been considered by the Government and some have already been acted upon in the context of developing a new Funding Agreement between DEEWR and ISCs which is expected to be executed by the end of June 2011 and cover the period 1 July 2011 — 30 June 2014.


Following is the Australian Government response to each recommendation.




Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that all 11 ISCs review their activities to ensure that their primary focus is directed at training package oversight and strategy, and that this work remain separated from the work of RTOs in product development and training delivery.




Australian Government Response



This recommendation is supported and reflects current arrangements.


The following comments are offered in relation to:


The committee is strongly of the view that ISCs should use their government funding to pursue their core activities.'


The Australian Government provides core funding to the 11 ISCs and Auto Skills Australia to:


provide industry intelligence and advice to government and enterprises on workforce development and skills needs;


actively support the development, implementation and continuous improvement of high quality training and workforce development products and services, including Training Packages;


provide independent skills and training advice to enterprises, including matching identified training needs with appropriate training solutions.


Since their inception in 2005, ISCs have built on their role in the key area of developing and maintaining Training Packages and have grown into their strengthened role in workforce development under the Government's Skilling Australia for the Future policy announced in November 2007. The success of ISCs and recognition of the value of the ISCs contribution to the effectiveness of the national VET system has led to increased demands and expectations in relation to the range and volume of services that ISCs could provide under the core Funding Agreement.


The core Funding Agreement provides a strong framework that enables DEEWR to monitor and manage the ISCs' performance of their key roles and responsibilities and to ensure expenditure of government funding accords with these. However, the Australian Government recognises that the funding provided under the core Funding Agreement does not and cannot cover the range of all of the possible activities that ISCs could undertake as contributors to the national VET system. The scope of what ISCs can do is limited by the funding they receive under the core Funding Agreement and their related capacity. ISCs' Annual Business Plans provide a mechanism that enables DEEWR to ensure that funds provided through DEEWR-ISCs core Funding Agreements are spent in accordance with the purpose of these Agreements and Government priorities. Under the Funding Agreement ISCs, must provide an Annual Business Plan for DEEWR approval.


The following comments are offered in relation to:


'...The production of training materials should only be considered where there is a demonstrated. unmet need and any conflict of interest is avoided.'


ISCs are the only bodies that have a mandate to develop and maintain Training Packages. A Training Package is an integrated set of nationally endorsed units of competency, Australian Qualification Framework qualifications and assessment guidelines designed for a specific industry, an industry sector or enterprise.


Training materials are the materials or resources that are developed to support the delivery of and/or assessment of Training Package qualifications. ISCs do not have an exclusive mandate to develop training materials; these materials may be developed by other organisations.


While ISCs are allowed, and may, under the core Funding Agreement develop training materials, given the limitations of the funding available, the associated capacity constraints and the number of demands on these resources, ISCs have to carefully prioritise their activities and, as a consequence, the majority of ISCs do not develop training materials.


ISCs as independent companies are able to develop training materials from sources other than funds provided under the core Funding Agreement. Some ISCs do have a commercial `arm' of their organisation with which DEEWR has no contractual relationship.


Identification and management of Conflicts of Interest is addressed under the Corporations Act 2001 and in the core Funding Agreement. Management of Conflict of Interest is addressed in more detail in the response to Recommendation 6.



Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the ISC CEOs Forum examine the prospect of developing a template for environmental scans to foster greater consistency in the timing and reporting, and to encourage better utility of the scans for affected stakeholders.




Australian Government Response



This recommendation is supported and reflects current arrangements.


The requirement for ISCs to produce an annual Environmental Scan (E-Scan) was first introduced in 2008 by the National Quality Council (NQC) - a Committee of the Ministerial Council for Tertiary Education and Employment responsible, until 1 July 2011, when the National Standards Council becomes operational, for the Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy. The NQC's Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy provides the policy framework for the timing, style and focus of the E-Scan.


DEEWR has provided the ISCs with a template and guidelines to assist with the development of E-Scans. The guidelines and templates are regularly reviewed in


consultation with Skills Australia and with the ISCs' CEOs. The guidelines and template for the E-Scans are updated in response to the feedback and in alignment with the NQC's Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy.


The focus of E-Scans, as described in the Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy, is to provide a national high level snap shot of current and emerging skills needs based on industry intelligence. Thus the E-Scans do not purport to, and cannot provide an enterprise, jurisdiction or region with a detailed workforce and skills development plan.


The requirement to deliver an annual E-Scan is also a requirement of DEEWR-ISCs Funding Agreement, which stipulates its delivery date for each ISC as the end of February each year.


The productivity and participation focus of the Government has increased the need for a more systematic approach to workforce development and for matching skills and training delivery with the current and future needs of industry, sectors and regions. As a consequence, the expectations of E-Scans have increased over the last few years.


A new independent agency, the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, will be established under the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. Its role will include the development of sectoral skills and workforce development plans in conjunction with ISCs and industry. The provision of independent advice on sectoral and regional skills needs to support workforce planning and productivity, including small business, will be critical to this particular role.


In the context of the new Agency's roles and activities, the role and content of E-Scans may need to be reviewed, taking into account that ISCs are not research, or data gathering and analysis agencies and may have a limited capacity to develop E-Scans that may be needed in the future.


While the evolving and growing expectations of E-Scans and ISCs' role in this regard are acknowledged, the E-Scans, as a requirement of the Training Package Development and Endorsement policy, remain for now as specified by this policy.


The Senate Committee also recommends that the ISCs CEOs' Forum develops a template and mechanism to achieve greater consistency in the timing and reporting of E-Scans. However, given that these considerations are covered by current policy and that the CEOs' Forum is an informal body, the CEOs' Forum may not be the most appropriate body to consider the changes to the template and to E-Scans generally. Its advice and views on E-Scans may be sought in the future in the context of current policy review, when undertaken.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the government develops standard contracts with clauses detailing accountability and reporting requirements for all paid works undertaken by ISCs under contract to government agencies. These standard clauses should be incorporated into contracts between DEEWR and each ISC.




Australian Government Response



This recommendation is supported and reflects current arrangements.


DEEWR funded projects are contracted utilising DEEWR standard Funding Agreement templates. The templates meet the requirements of the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations, Commonwealth Grant Guidelines and the DEEWR Procurement Manual and, as such, provide a sound accountability and reporting framework.


The ISC core Funding Agreement incorporates the standard DEEWR contractual requirements and clauses and the same template is used for all DEEWR core Funding Agreements with ISCs.


Each DEEWR core Funding Agreement with an ISC details:


the project deliverables;


timeframes:


progress and financial reporting;


acquittal of funds and payments linked to the successful completion of contract requirements; and


key performance indicators and performance measures.


A key reporting requirement in the core Funding Agreement relates to financial accountability. It includes Annual Audited Financial Statements and a Final Audited Financial Statement and Acquittal of Funds.


The payment of instalments under the core Funding Agreement is linked to DEEWR's acceptance of satisfactory progress against requirements and deliverables described in the Agreement. DEEWR is able to withhold payments until satisfied with the quality and content of the reportable item. Thus ISC core Funding Agreements provide a strong and consistent reporting framework and mechanisms to ensure that ISCs are accountable for the expenditure of funds and the delivery of the project outcomes.


The existing DEEWR standard Funding Agreement and relevant clauses provide sufficient mechanisms and frameworks to ensure that legal and fiduciary requirements are followed and met. In recognition of the importance of accountability and reporting requirements, DEEWR in the new Funding Agreement with ISCs for 2011-2014 has further strengthened reporting requirements using the existing standard clauses.


While Government funding provided via the Funding Agreement is the main source of ISCs revenue as independent companies, ISCs also access funding from other sources. which may include other Australian Government Departments as well as state and territory governments. Contracts of all Australian Government Departments and Agencies are required to comply with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and promote the efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources, including contractual accountability and reporting requirements.


Within the boundaries of the legislative requirements, it is ultimately up to each Government Agency or organisation to determine the terms and conditions under which their financial support is provided.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that future contracts between DEEWR and ISCs require the holding of sufficient funds to comply with statutory obligations of directors under relevant corporate legislation, and prohibit the ownership by ISCs of physical assets, such as real estate, that are not directly related to the effective performance of their role.




Australian Government Response



This recommendation is supported and reflects current arrangements.


The following comments are offered in relation to:


DEEWR and Industry Skills Councils require the holding of sufficient funds to comply with statutory obligations of directors under relevant corporate legislation....'


The requirements of Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the current core Funding Agreement meet this recommendation.


ISCs are independent companies registered with ASIC and they are subject to the Corporations Act 2001 (Act). Under the Act, directors of a corporation must ensure that the corporation is trading solvently. A necessary corollary of solvency is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient reserves to meet existing statutory obligation. Additionally, the core ISC Funding Agreement requires that ISCs comply with all statutory obligations including the obligation to trade solvently. There is no need to duplicate ASIC requirements or to include additional clauses in the Funding Agreement to address the requirement to trade solvently.


The following comments are offered in relation to:


`.... prohibit the ownership by Industry Skills Councils of physical assets, such as real estate....'


Under the terms of the current Funding Agreement, ISCs could acquire physical assets as long as the asset was under $100,000 and as long as the asset was used for the purposes of the DEEWR-ISC Funding Agreement. Any purchase involving funds of $100,000 or over requires DEEWR's approval. This constraint clearly would not allow ISCs under the current funding arrangements to purchase any real estate from the core government funds.


As ISCs are independent legal entities, DEEWR is not in a position to prevent them from purchasing real estate with funds from sources other than those provided by DEEWR.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that DEEWR's contract with each ISC requires that directors receive no remuneration but that reasonable costs incurred for travel, accommodation and incidentals expenses incurred while exercising the role of director be reimbursed.




Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.


The payment of remuneration for directors is an internal issue for each ISC.


The governance arrangements of ISCs reflect their status as independent, not-for-profit companies. ISCs are incorporated as public companies that operate under the Corporations Act 2001. As such, each ISC operates under the rules of its constitution, is managed by a bi-partite (employers and unions) board of directors and is accountable to ASIC for the observance of its obligations under statute and common law.


Acceptance of this recommendation would potentially interfere with ISCs' internal corporate governance and potentially result in ISCs being unable to attract suitable directors especially from small business.




Recommendation 6



The committee recommends that any new contracts between DEEWR and the ISCs from June 2011 explicitly require ISC board directors to declare any simultaneous membership of RTO boards, regardless of whether there is a potential for any conflict of interest.




Australian Government Response



This recommendation is supported and reflects current arrangements.


ISCs are subject to the Corporations Act 2001 (Act). The core ISC Funding Agreement requires that ISCs comply with all statutory obligations; this includes the obligations and responsibilities of directors.


Under company law, directors must not allow a conflict of interest to compromise their position. Directors must not place themselves in a position where there is a real or substantial possibility of a conflict of interest. Sections 182 and 183 of the Corporations Act 2011 deal with improper use of information and improper use of position. These Sections identify that it is a director's obligation not to place his or her own interests or those of persons with whom a director is linked, ahead of that of the corporation. This applies not only to use of the position of a director, but also to the use of information that comes to the director.


The need to identify and manage circumstances where a real or perceived conflict of interest might occur is also included as a standard clause in the core DEEWR-ISC Funding Agreement. Under the terms of the core Funding Agreement, ISCs are required to ensure that to the best of their knowledge after making diligent inquires, no conflict of interest exists or is likely to arise in the performance of the obligations under the Agreement. In the event that a conflict of interest arises or is likely to arise during the term of the Agreement, ISCs are required to immediately inform DEEWR in writing of that conflict of interest and the steps proposed to resolve or deal with the conflict.


There is no need to duplicate the Conflict of Interest requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 or the core Funding Agreement to address the concern that directors may also be on Registered Training Organisations' boards.




Recommendation 7



The committee recommends that DEEWR include a clause in its new contracts with ISCs permitting the renegotiation of industry coverage and potential splitting of ISCs during the term of the contracts, were this considered desirable and necessary to better fulfil the role of the ISCs concerned.




Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.


In making this recommendation, the Senate Committee noted that most stakeholders who submitted their views to the Inquiry were satisfied with ISCs' effectiveness; however, there were a few stakeholders, albeit a minority, who expressed some criticism in relation to the current industry coverage of ISCs.


Realignment of an ISC's industry or sectoral coverage is not contingent on the inclusion of clauses in the core Funding Agreement; rather, it is a matter for Government to determine. The review and renegotiation of the sectoral coverage of ISCs can occur any time, through a variation of contract based on the Minister's decision.




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that contracts between DEEWR and the ISCs be standardised and made publicly available on the DEEWR website.




Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees in part with this recommendation and notes that the recommendation is already partially satisfied.


The following comments are offered in regard to:


The committee recommends that contracts between DEEWR and Industry Skills Councils be standardised.   '


DEEWR-ISC core Funding Agreements are already standardised. ISCs also enter into other individual contracts with DEEWR and standard contract templates are utilised for such contracts, which is a DEEWR requirement. ISCs may also enter into contracts with other entities, including other Commonwealth Government Departments, and it is ultimately up to each government agency or organisation to determine the terms and conditions under which their funding is provided.


The following comments are offered in regard to:


`....and made publicly available on the DEEWR website.'


The publication of the de-identified Funding Agreements on DEEWR website is not supported as it would go further than reporting requirements of the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines and the Government sees no reason for treating contractual information relating to its agreements with Industry Skills Councils differently to that of other grant recipients.


In compliance with the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines (CGGs), DEEWR publishes on its website information on individual grants, including the individual ISCs' Funding Agreements. DEEWR's grant reporting includes information regarding the grant's purpose, recipient, program title, value as well as the commencement date and duration of the grants. The Grants Register is publically available on the DEEWR website at:


httd://www.deewr.gov.au/department/Pades/Grants.aspx




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends that ISCs more regularly review their consultation practices and devise practical strategies to address concerns expressed by business, in particular small businesses.




Recommendation 10



The committee further recommends that DEEWR identify best practice consultation principles and seek ways to incorporate these into its next contract with the ISCs.




Australian Government Response





Recommendation 9 and Recommen
­
dation
 
10



The Australian Government supports these recommendations.


Industry engagement and involvement in the VET system underpins its strength. The ISCs provide a key point of contact for industry engagement and collaboration. ISCs, have over time, established extensive and effective industry networks and have articulated stakeholder engagement plans. Nevertheless, the capacity of ISCs to grow, review and refine their stakeholder networks, and review their consultation practices, is critical to the continued relevance and quality of industry advice and implicitly to the strength of the national VET system.


The following comments are offered in regard to:




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends the Industry Skills Councils more regularly review their consultation practices and devise practical strategies to address concerns expressed by business, in particular small business.'


The next Funding Agreement 2011-2014, to commence on 1 July 2011, has addressed this important stakeholder engagement issue by including a requirement that, as part of their Annual Business Plans, ISCs provide a Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Plan. This requirement will ensure annual reviews and revisions of Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Plan. The plan will be expected to include practical strategies to address stakeholders concerns and pay particular attention to consultation with small business and, where appropriate, with regional and rural stakeholders.


The following comments are offered in regard to:




Recommendation 10



The committee further recommends that DEEWR identify best practice consultation principles and seek ways to incorporate these into its next contract with the Industry Skills Councils.'


DEEWR is aware of some stakeholders' concerns regarding consultation practices and the ISCs' consultation practices are and will continue to be closely monitored by DEEWR. Additionally, DEEWR will identify best practice consultation principles in consultation with the ISCs and other stakeholders.


Consideration of this issue may also be included in a review of ISCs which is anticipated to be undertaken during the term of the next Funding Agreement 2011-2014. Once established, these principles could be included in the Funding Agreement at any time.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:11):  Tonight I want to talk to the Senate in relation to the green skills centre in Newnham, Launceston, in my home state. The Tasmanian Skills Institute has been in operation since 1 January 2009 as a training provider, emerging from TAFE Tasmania as part of the Tasmanian government's reform of the post-secondary education sector.


The Skills Institute's Green Skills Centre of Excellence was officially opened at the Alanvale training facility in Launceston on 22 July this year, although it began operating two months prior to the official opening and many of the employer clients have appreciated the potential benefits they can bring to their business by training their employees through this facility.


The Skills Institute is an experienced registered training organisation with around 400 employees operating from eight major training hubs in trade and technical training across Tasmania. The Skills Institute is dedicated to workforce development in partnership with employers. The client group of the Skills Institute is employers and their employees. This client group has differing needs and expectations from the traditional TAFE student group, who attend a campus of their own volition.


The federal government provided $6.4 million under the Training Infrastructure Investment for Tomorrow element of the Teaching and Learning Capital Fund for Vocational Education and Training to build the centre, and what a magnificent facility it is. The state government, through the Skills Institute, contributed $750,000 towards the cost of the facility, bringing the total investment to $7.15 million.


The Green Skills Centre of Excellence project provides a state-of-the-art, Green Star rated training facility for a combination of construction, allied trades, joinery and furnishings trades. The centre has been built to the latest technology standards and is in line with the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan 2009-2012. The project introduces and implements green technology not only in the infrastructure and fabric of the new building but also in the training programs delivered, which in turn influence attitudes and work practices in industry.


A highlight is the purchase of $650,000 worth of state-of-the-art woodworking machines, including a five-axis computer controlled work centre believed to be the first of its kind in the state. This means furniture trades apprentices now have access to machinery that is at the cutting edge of technology. Prior to this new facility being built, training facilities operated from a post World War II textile factory on the fringe of the Launceston CBD, with its most recent modifications carried out 30 years ago.


I would now like to turn to Scottsdale, which is in the north-eastern region of Tasmania and the centre of the Dorset region, which is approximately an hour north-east of Launceston. The region has been affected over the last eight years or so by downturns in the food industries and it has also been affected by the downturn in the forestry industry in Tasmania. The recently announced forestry agreement between the federal and state governments will assist in dealing with the effects of change within that industry. It would be very easy to believe that this community is depressed, downhearted and waiting for handouts. However, in my recent visits to the community, this is not what I found; in fact quite the reverse.


I visited the Dorset men's shed. As we all know, unlike women, most men are reluctant to talk about their emotions and that means that they usually do not ask for help. Probably because of this many men tend to be less healthy than women, they sometimes drink more, they take more risks and they suffer more from isolation, loneliness and depression. Relationship breakdowns, retrenchment or early retirement, loss of children following divorce, physical or mental illness are just some of the problems that men find hard to deal with on their own.


A good men's shed must have a good coordinator and the Dorset men's shed has one of those individuals. He has both the technical and the social skills to help develop a safe and happy environment, where men are welcome to work on a project of their choice in their own time, and where the only thing they must do is observe safe working practices. 


The Dorset men's shed is one of more than 30 men's sheds in Tasmania—and there are more than 500 across Australia. The numbers attending and the range of activities are impressive. Women are also attending some of the projects, and I witnessed some women at the leadlighting course and making things for their own homes. Local charities are also benefiting from the timber and metal items produced by the men's shed. The quality and range of articles produced for the annual challenge event is astonishing. This year's challenge was no exception, with many outstanding pieces of woodwork—dining settings, chessboards and lazy Susans, just to name a few. 


When I go to the north-east, I like to visit as many places as I can, including the high schools. But I also visited Aminya, which is a small nursing home on the edge of Scottsdale that is managed by Presbyterian Care. Like other organisations in Scottsdale, the facility continues to be improved. The recent internal modifications are excellent and it is an outstanding facility. They have plans to extend and are one of the big employers in that region, which is very important. 


More importantly, a community relies a great deal on their local council. The Dorset Council have been dealing with the challenges that the forestry industry have been going through. When I met with the general manager and the mayor, I was impressed by how positive they were about the future of their municipality. They talked about the benefits of the National Broadband Network. They talked about how businesses have moved from interstate and are being managed out of Scottsdale because of the NBN. They talked about their ongoing plans for the future development of tourism in the area. They talked about health services. Whether you talk about health, whether you talk about tourism or whether you talk about education, they will all benefit from the rollout of the National Broadband Network.


The Dorset Trade Training Centre, which is part of the Tasmanian Polytechnic, is another wonderful initiative. The sorts of subjects covered at the Polytechnic include primary industry and infra­structure, tourism and hospitality, health and wellbeing, build­ing and construction, childcare and com­munity services, and business. The Dorset Trade Training Centre was only officially opened late last year, but it already has a fantastic network because of the people working there. They are locals who know the networks, have a great working relationship with the men's shed and are working with the local high school. When I spoke to the young people who were doing courses such as carpentry or working on car engines, I found they were all enthusiastic. These young people see this as a great opportunity to help them on their way to a successful future.


Whether at the aged-care facility, the high school, the trade training centre, the men's shed or a meeting with the mayor and the general manager of the Dorset Council, their overall attitude was not about wanting a handout; it was about a helping hand. They have plans for their future. It is a lovely environment and it was refreshing to visit them all. They typify the Tasmanian spirit and can-do attitude. They reinforced once again what a huge benefit the National Broadband Network has been to the area, and having visited other areas in Tasmania I know how important it is for Tasmania generally. 


I do not have much time tonight, but I do want to touch on one other area that I have been involved in. One of the great delights during this winter recess has been to attend a number of Building the Education Revolu­tion openings. At the Invermay Primary School, a school which was built in 1889, you could see how it has been transformed and the benefits that has brought to the Invermay community. At St Finbar's Catholic primary school you could see how innovative they have been with their redevelopment. At the East Launceston Primary School, a school that has been established for many, many decades, you could see how they have really benefited from this investment into the future of our young people.
