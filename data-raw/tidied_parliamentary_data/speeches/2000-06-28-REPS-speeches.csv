"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I am pleased to see that the government is supporting amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party in the Senate relating to the family allowance income test. The government has agreed to omit schedule 4, item 22, page 134, lines 8 and 9. This amendment, which was supported by the Democrats in the Senate, was aimed at stopping the government from using the age of independence in a selective manner to reduce benefits to young unemployed people. Under the original legislation, the rate of family allowance is reduced when income exceeds $23,550 per annum, plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. Because under the government's legislation a young person is not independent until the age of 21, a `family allowance' child can be a child receiving youth allowance. The government wanted to stop this by altering the legislation so that a child receiving youth allowance was a family allowance child only if they were under 18 years of age. Thus the government was trying to make 18-year-olds independent for the purposes of calculating family allowance but dependent for the purposes of calculating youth allowance. A 19-year-old who received youth allowance would have had a reduced rate of youth allowance based on the income and assets of his or her parents, but his or her parents would not have been able to claim their 19-year-old child as a dependent child when calculating family allowance. It is a nifty trick and one the opposition was determined to prevent from happening.
The government's acquiescence to our amendment has come over three months too late. The introduction of the family tax benefit on 1 July will cause this amendment to become largely redundant. Labor originally moved the amendment to ensure that no-one was worse off in the interim period between the introduction of this bill and the introduction of the family tax benefit. This bill has been so delayed that this amendment, although now accepted by the government, will not have much impact on Australian families. Cast your mind back to last year when the government was introducing its youth allowance scheme. The government originally proposed that unemployed young people aged under 21 would be determined dependent for the purposes of calculating the young person's youth allowance but defined as independent for the purposes of the tax system. The government originally proposed that recipients of youth allowance not qualify for family allowance or for the family tax initiatives. Therefore, parents struggling to support their unemployed children would receive no compensation via the taxation system.
After much pressure from Senator Harradine and the Australian Labor Party, the government agreed to pay a maximum of $37.50 a fortnight to families earning roughly between $40,000 and $73,000 whose children were not eligible for youth allowance. The amendment Labor was forced to move three months ago and the negotiations that Senator Harradine was forced to undertake a year ago demonstrate the same basic fact. The fact is that this government is not about helping the unemployed and it is not about helping Australian families; it is about penny pinching, scraping and cutbacks—and the cost has been borne by Australia's young unemployed.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—I move:
That the requested amendment be not made.
In moving this motion, I want to point out to the chamber that excluding the DBA disability pension from the social security income test would cost about $23.5 million per year. It would include abolishing the special rent assistance income test for service pensioners so that they would not be disadvantaged. This would involve estimated administration costs for Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This second attempted amendment by the Australian Democrats, however, still does not resolve the issue surrounding the rent assistance income test for service pensioners, which would be an undesirable consequence if this amendment were passed. Veterans with a service pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and who rented would be disadvantaged because, although their disability pension would not be counted in the calculation of their service pension, it would be counted for calculating the amount of rent assistance. This was one of the problems highlighted by the government in the previous request, and it remains in this new attempt by the Australian Democrats.
Part B of the amendment is also a nonsense. Section 24 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act pays the special rate for `totally and permanently incapacitated' disability pension. The wording of this amendment means that all special rate disability pensions would continue to be counted as income. This is another failed and crude attempt at amending government legislation through an amendment which bears no relation to the bill. The government therefore opposes this latest crude attempt to amend this legislation.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—Labor disagrees with the government on this issue and we support the technical changes to this amendment regarding the payment of veterans' pensions. There was a technical difficulty with the original amendment that made it problematic. The amendment is now better drafted than the earlier amendment, which was too broad. We remain committed to recognising the contribution that veterans have made to the security of Australia and our region. As the member for Cowan so succinctly pointed out in this House last week, Australians who enlisted for active duty during the Second World War were fully committed to serving their country anywhere in the world for as long as they were needed. They were prepared to put their lives on the line for the security of Australia and the allied nations. These members of the armed forces deserve our recognition and our thanks. They underwent active training and lived in a state of preparedness to serve overseas at short notice. In fact, many did all in their power to get overseas and to serve on the front line. They also lived in a state of preparedness to defend Australia in the event of an invasion by a foreign power.
For Australians like me and my generation, who were born after the Second World War, it is difficult to imagine that Australia was under threat in the 1940s. However, of course, Darwin was repeatedly bombed. Japanese submarines made it as far south as Sydney Harbour. It was a frightening time for all Australians. Our sovereignty was under threat in a very real way and the members of the armed forces stationed in Australia were of vital importance to us.  
As the legislation currently stands, people who have a pension for problems that they incurred in the time of their service have that pension counted as income against social security benefits. Veterans who saw active service overseas, however, and have similar pensions do not have their pension treated as income against social security benefits. This is an anomaly that has been around for a very long time—for too long, in fact. Veterans groups have put this anomaly to the government, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Labor remains committed to supporting veterans' entitlements. It is vital the veterans' needs are addressed. 
This government is so penny pinching that it has made massive cuts to all areas of the social welfare safety net. It is not surprising, therefore, that it resists any attempts to broaden the net to include war veterans who have not seen active service. This is a government, however, that is prepared to spend $431 million of taxpayers' money on self-promotion. It is happy to throw away this money that could have covered the cost of this amendment and much, much more—more hospital beds, more schools, more support for the frail, the elderly, and the homeless. We remain committed to this amendment and indicate to the House our opposition to the government's actions with regard to this matter.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—There have not been many occasions in this House when I have felt so ashamed of the political system as I do today. After 18 months of debate and the constant raising in this House of matters to do with mobile homes, caravan parks and boarding houses, we are no closer to helping the people living in this situation than we were 18 months ago. Indeed, they are still going backwards, and they have every right to feel very discouraged. But this is just a metaphor for what is happening at a broader level in this country. As the divide between rich and poor grows wider, too many of our citizens turn away from politics and become disillusioned with the system. The more they turn away, the more the system is discredited and the more our society is pulled apart. This bill today pushes that divide further and entrenches a deep cynicism about the political process. Too many Australians are not getting their fair share of the gains of economic prosperity and are crying out for fairness—something that is completely missing from this bill. That is why we will be moving a second reading amendment in this House today to try to right the wrong that is perpetrated in this set of arrangements and that is why we reaffirm Labor's iron clad guarantee to remove the GST from the rents of mobile home, caravan park and boarding house residents. 
Before the last election, the Prime Minister promised that no Australian would be worse off as a result of the GST. At the election before that he promised that he would be a government for all of us. At the moment we have a political propaganda campaign running at public expense, costing $431 million, which sends out the message that we need a GST so as not to hold Australia back. Today this trilogy of deceptions is laid completely bare before us. The truth is that the provisions contained in this bill demonstrate that this is only a government for some of us. It will make the most vulnerable in our society even more worse off and it will continue to pull our society further apart. Therefore, it will send us backwards. That makes me both sad and angry. It makes me extremely sad that 160,000 innocent Australians will hurt and hurt some more, both financially and personally.
You only have to go to a mobile home or caravan park and talk to the elderly residents there to see how personally distressed, let alone financially distressed, they are by what the government is doing. This did not have to happen. It makes me angry because the government now knows, through the independent assessment of Econtech, that these people will be worse off. The government's own modelling shows that those people will be worse off, and nothing in this bill does anything to rectify that discrimination. Is it any wonder that the credibility of the political system and this government is at an all-time low? Those people will be worse off. 
This government has been caught deliberately misleading people regarding the compensation arrangements and future price increases. That is contained in the minister's second-reading speech: fewer than 200 words to respond to the debate we have had in this place and around the country over the past 18 months. What is the conclusion? The minister, Mr Anthony, states:
This 10 per cent increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance, on top of the 4 per cent increase in pensions and allowances, will ensure that low income members of the community will be protected from any price increases under the new tax system. 
That is simply untrue. Before I deal with the arrangements relating to rent assistance, I will deal with the minister's proposition of a four per cent increase in pensions, inadequate as that is. I refer to what the government had to say about a four per cent increase in one of its glossy brochures distributed in September last year. It states:
A 4 per cent up-front increase to pensions. 
Another brochure, distributed in March this year, states:
Pensions and allowances up 4 per cent.
Sadly, pensioners will discover this week that part of their first regular fortnightly pension payment due on 6 July will be stolen. It will not reflect the full up-front four per cent increase to offset the cost of the GST from 1 July. Ninety-nine per cent of pensioners will find that almost $10 of their $15 increase has been stolen;  it will be simply missing. Like thieves in the night, the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, will have taken $10 of that $15 increase. That is money that pensioners in this country could use to pay for the increased cost of fuel after 1 July, the increased bank fees and charges and increased supermarket prices. However, like thieves in the night, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have taken $10 of that $15 increase.  
How could a government do that? Do they really live in the real world? Do they understand how people live? Do they understand that people on low incomes live day to day and that $1 means a lot to them? If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer lived in the real world, they would understand that pensioners budget on a fortnightly basis, that they budget in advance from when they receive their payment and that they struggle from day to day. The government are actually saying that they are expecting pensioners to pay the GST on just about everything they buy for the whole fortnight following 1 July but compensating them for only four days. So pensioners get the price increases for 14 days, but get the compensation for only four days. 
Ten dollars might not seem a lot to the Treasurer in Paris, to the Prime Minister when he is visiting London, to anyone on the back bench opposite, or to any of the wealthy ministers on the front bench opposite, but it means a lot to a pensioner. This means that the increased pension payment, including this one for the GST, reflects only the proportion of the increase that falls after the day the increase is made. For pensioners, next Thursday's pension payment will include only four paid days at the four per cent rate and the remaining 10 days at the lower, existing rate. That is a classic case of the government giving a few crumbs with one hand and taking more with the other hand. 
Under the previous rules, pensioners were paid the full increase in the fortnightly pension on the first day after the increase was made. Of course, that rule was changed last year. The government argues that the rules are fair. They argue that pensioners are paid at a higher rate for each day for which they are technically entitled. How could the government even bother to argue that? The problem with this government is that it is so out of touch. It has lost contact with prices in the supermarket because it is concerned only with prices in the share market. It is concerned only with what is happening at the boardroom table; it has not a clue about what is going on at the kitchen table. 
None of this debate would be taking place if the government understood what was actually happening in mobile homes and caravan parks or if they understood how pensioners really lived. If they did, they could not possibly be out there claiming that those people are getting a four per cent increase in pensions for the first fortnight after the GST comes in when they are getting that increase for only four days of that fortnight. 
The government comes in here and talks about their wonderful social coalition and that they are compassionate conservatives. They are not compassionate conservatives at all; they are cold-hearted conservatives, they are callous conservatives and their arrangements for pensions prove that, as does the inadequacy of the compensation arrangements in this bill relating to rent assistance. Last year when the government changed the legislation regarding payments, they effectively saved around $25 million. That is $25 million that could be in the pockets of pensioners to offset the effects of this hideous tax. But what has happened to that $25 million? It has been spent as part of the $430 million GST propaganda campaign. 
Can the government get any lower than that? Sadly, I think they can, and they have. In another GST botch-up—and at this stage we will say that it is a botch-up—millions of families, pensioners and retirees stand to have their family payments and savings bonuses taxed when they are deposited in their bank accounts after 1 July. That has occurred because of a serious oversight by the government. It means that government financial institutions duty will be levied on these new payments. It was never done like that before. Previously, exemptions existed for payments made under the Social Security Act. However, the new payments to families and the bonuses for retirees are paid under tax law that will see them attract the duty. So this oversight will see over $6 million in family payments and over $1 million in bonus payments returned to Treasury coffers. 
Once again, this is a classic case of the government giving with one hand and taking with the other. This is money that would be better used if it were in the pockets of families and retirees. We should remember that this tax was one of the taxes that were supposed to be abolished when the GST came in. However, it has not been. While this tax is a state based tax, its maintenance was part of the final GST deal. Most importantly, it was not until this morning that this tardy, incompetent, callous government took it upon itself to actually write to the states about the problem of the imposition of FID on family payments and bonus payments. It was not until this morning that the government actually took some action. Of course, that will not necessarily have any effect for some time. So in changing the payments, the Howard government should have advised the states early, sorted out this problem and not left that impact.  
That brings me back to the compensation arrangements in this bill. I have dealt with the inadequacies of the four per cent increase. I have not even talked about the fact that when pensioners receive the four per cent increase it is gobbled up by an inflation rate of 6.75 per cent in the September quarter and 5.75 per cent for the whole year. So pensioners can do those sums. They can also do their sums and realise that, although they are getting an increase in their pensions of four per cent on 1 July, two per cent of that increase is taken back next March; they are constantly behind in terms of the compensation arrangements when compared with the inflation rate. Pensioners know that, too.
However, the thing that really sticks out in this bill is that battlers living in mobile homes, manufactured homes, caravan parks or boarding houses still have the imposition of the GST on their rent but millionaires living at Kirribilli do not pay any GST on their rent. That fundamental discrimination remains uncorrected by this bill. So it does not solve the problem; it merely confirms the problem.
What is the government's solution in this bill? What is this callous, cold-hearted government's solution to the final admission that these people would be worse off? What is their solution—because the bill being debated here is recognition that they are worse off; that is the one thing we have got out of the government. So what have they said the solution is? They said they are going to pay 16c a day to people living in mobile homes and caravan parks, manufactured homes and boarding houses if they receive full rent assistance. But of course there is no assistance—no additional money in this bill—for recipients who do not receive full rent assistance. So having admitted that people living in this situation across-the-board are going to be worse off, they have brought in a so-called compensation measure which goes to only a very limited number of them. When it goes to them, what do they get? Sixteen cents a day! So once again, like the previous measures I was talking about, this proves that the government only ever gives back a fraction of what it takes away. The aid, the meagre, paltry aid, for those living in this situation—mobile homes, caravan parks and boarding houses—goes only to those who receive maximum rent assistance. 
This has been an issue which has attracted a fair bit of debate in the government and I suppose we could say that that is something. What has the Liberal Party sought to do about it? They have done nothing. All the action has been with the Democrats and with the National Party. We know how callous and cold-hearted the Liberal Party are, but look at the record of the National Party on this. The National Party started huffing and puffing about this a few weeks ago. They went to Tweed Heads. Larry Anthony, the Minister for Community Services, said he was going to resign. The Deputy Prime Minister was going to come down to Canberra and get tough with John Howard; he was going to confront the Prime Minister. But nothing happened. All we got was some pathetic announcement from the National Party—some autobabble from the Deputy Prime Minister on AM—that they were going to have closer supervision. Nothing changed. Nothing changed at all.
We have had the National Party Minister for Community Services, who is the minister responsible in this area, huffing and puffing for some time. Up in Tweed Heads some months ago, when my colleague the member for Grayndler put him under a bit of a pressure, he admitted there was discrimination in all of this. He said, `I hope I can come back to you shortly through your representatives and hopefully there can be a change.' There has been no change. The minister has not resigned. The one thing we can say about the Minister for Community Services is that he is Canberra's mouthpiece in Richmond rather than Richmond's voice in Canberra, because he has toed the line. So there was no change, despite all of the pressure and all of the debate. The Nationals were publicly humiliated by the Prime Minister.  
Then we had the Democrats. They came out breathing fire and brimstone. They said suddenly, `This is unfair.' How did they discover it was unfair? They let it go through in the original package. Then they said, `We might commission some reports about the unfairness of it.' Some reports were commissioned but were never asked for by the Democrats. And then, suddenly, when Laurie Oakes gets a break on National Nine News and reveals that everybody is going to be worse off, the Democrats want to go out and change it.
So that is the origin of the bill that we have before us today, but it does not contain the proposals that the Democrats put up. They said that they had a proposal to halve the rate, which would have continued the discrimination. But even that got knocked over, and now we get the compensation measures contained in this bill. The Democrats' subservience was laid bare and it is there for everybody to see in the bill before the House today. They have come up with a beads and blankets deal that delivers the token assistance of 16c a day to some caravan, mobile home and boarding house residents. Only an arrogant and out-of-touch government and an arrogant and out-of-touch coalition partner like the Democrats could come up with 16c a day as some sort of a solution to the ongoing disadvantage caused by these arrangements for people living in this accommodation.
What is of concern about this whole fiasco is that the seriousness of the issue seems to be lost—completely lost—on the lemmings opposite. The fact that rents will rise causes hardship across-the-board. Rents are a very big-ticket item. For many average households, rent makes up more than 30 per cent of the expenditure of the weekly budget. As a result, even small increases in rent have a big impact on households. We should not forget that the current compensation package was designed by the government to compensate for an average 1.9 per cent GST price effect, let alone the 5.75 per cent or 6.75 per cent price effect at various stages of the year. But I will look further at the price effects. The government was talking about clothing going up by six per cent, footwear by six per cent and electricity by six per cent. What are the ACCC estimates here? What has Professor Fels had to say about all of those? We find clothing is to go up by between eight per cent and nine per cent, footwear by eight per cent to nine per cent and electricity by nine per cent to 9.5 per cent. So these people are getting a much bigger whack on the price rise.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The speaker is now going on about issues that are not related to the rent assistance or the caravan park issue. I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to draw his attention to the subject of the bill.
 (Hon. J.A. Crosio)—I take on board the honourable member for Page's point of order, but the shadow minister, the member for Lilley, was referring to caravan parks at the beginning of his speech and right through his speech, and he was then referring to comments made by other parties. I believe he is in order, but I will continue to listen to his words.
—I can understand why the member for Page does not want to discuss these matters, but the fact is that rents are a very substantial part of the budget of most families.
At the last election the government promised that rents would increase by no more than 2.3 per cent across-the-board. In fact, they argued that the real impact was going to be only 0.7 per cent. So what do we find in the Econtech report? It says that it will be 4.7 per cent for general rents and four per cent plus for residents living in the situation that we are talking about. In the case of boarding house rents, Econtech has assumed that a 5.5 per cent GST will lead to an increase in rents of only 4.4 per cent. The government's preferred modeller has said that a 5.5 per cent GST will lead to an increase of 4.4 per cent, regardless of whatever cost savings will be passed on—and we have had a very good example of all of that with petrol over the past few days. 
I think we should consider this very simple fact: to produce a 4.4 per cent increase assumes that boarding house operators will actually reduce their weekly rent this Saturday—and I do not know whether that is happening in the member for Page's electorate—before applying the concessional 5.5 per cent GST. Hardly! I would like the government to produce just one example of this, because we already have evidence of rents actually increasing by their full five per cent and more. While I would like to talk about the Econtech modelling in greater detail, there are other matters with which I need to deal.
We have already had the Treasurer confirm on AM last week that rents in general will rise by $8 to $10 on an average $200 a week rent. The Treasurer said that that was affordable. Consider this: for a dual income family on $45,000 with two kids, this rent increase will automatically wipe out almost half of the $25 per week tax cut and increase in family assistance. That will leave just $15 to pay for the GST on the rest of their spending—a grand total of just $3.75 for each family member. That hardly sounds affordable; it leaves the government's long overdue tax cuts completely in tatters.
Just imagine if this family is living in Sydney or on the Central Coast around Gosford, where rents for an average house are up to $350 per week. In this case the family will be paying up to $17 per week more, leaving just $7 per week to pay for the GST on the rest of their spending, a grand total of $1.75 per person per week. NATSEM estimates that the GST price impact on a family of this type will be around $20 a week. So it does not take a genius to work out that this family will be big losers, and there will be many losers out there. That is what the NATSEM work has demonstrated, and it is also what we find by having a good look at the Econtech report. That is absolutely why the government hid this report for six months, because it undermines the whole tax package, even if the Econtech report's optimistic assessments are accepted. It clearly shows that the dishonesty of this government knows no bounds. They were caught out on mobile homes, caravan parks and boarding houses, which is why there is this pathetic measure in the House today that goes no way towards solving the problem for these people, but it gives those opposite the ability to pretend that they are going to do something about this.
I note that the minister also said in his statement to the House that he was going to have an education campaign to go out and tell these people who are lucky enough to get the 16c a day how much better off they will be. I hope it does not follow the precedent of the rest of the television campaign—some $50 million—and the rest of the $431 million, because it will simply blow up in the minister's face.
The point that needs to be made is that battlers and working people will experience rent increases. With the GST and tax cuts, many will be substantially out of pocket. Something like five million Australians rent, but only 20 per cent of them get rent assistance. Therefore, the measures in this bill do not go to a large number of people. This bill does not solve the problem of vanishing tax cuts or compensation. As I said before, it does not even benefit everyone who gets rent assistance. Only one-third of the one million Australians who receive rent assistance get less than the maximum rate. As a result, they will all miss out. There is nothing in here for them. For these people, this bill does not give them one extra cent, because it is only the maximum rate that is being lifted. This is important because many people in caravan parks and mobile home parks fall into this category.
At the end of the day, who gets the 16c a day made available in this bill? Who gets it? It is possible that over half the people living in these situations will not get it—over half. I do not know if anyone has told the Democrats that yet, but over half of them will not get it.
—They haven't told him. 
—I have not told him, either. I am sure that is true. Consider this: to receive the maximum rate of rent assistance and thus get some benefit from these measures, residents would have to be paying the following weekly site fees: a single person, $88 a week; and a couple, $108.50 a week. Those people who have actually been to these places would know that site fees range in price from around $75 a week to $125 a week. For single people that means that only those paying mid-range site fees or more will benefit. For couples, only those paying site fees near the upper end will benefit from this measure. When that is taken into consideration, it is probably dramatically less than half who are going to get the 16c a day. We do not know. We would like members opposite to tell us. What is the government's figuring on this? Members opposite are also sitting on the modelling that looks specifically at mobile homes and caravan parks. I do not think we are ever going to see that in this House unless it appears on Channel 9.
This government does not even make a decent fist of assisting the people who started this whole debate. That is why I am sad that this bill is so pathetic. So many people out there have been completely dudded. They had their expectations raised by the Minister for Community Services, and he did nothing. They had their expectations raised by the Deputy Prime Minister, and he did nothing. They had their expectations raised by the Democrats, and they did nothing. All along the line members on the back benches of the government did absolutely zero. Did they get up and protest when the minister of the time came into this House and in answer to a question from me described everyone living in this situation as tourists? Did they go and have a quiet word to the minister then? Obviously not, because if they had we would not be here today. This matter would have been fixed over a year ago if those members opposite on the back benches were diligent and knew what was actually happening in their communities. It would have been fixed a long time ago.
I want to take some time to talk about the Econtech report. The thing that is so distressing about Econtech is that the government have known its findings for six months. When we questioned the government in detail in Senate estimates and the Treasurer in this House, they said nothing. But they did something. They went back and fiddled the figures in the Econtech report and changed them. Subsequently, they were sprung by Laurie Oakes on their claim that there was not much difference between a long-term and short-term effect. Well, I am sorry, but they have been caught, because the real Econtech report proves conclusively that these people will be substantially worse off. It is for all these reasons that we intend to move our amendment today. This is a government that does not defend battlers. They walked away from them years ago. Their sole task in life now is to create battlers, and this bill does that. It continues to add to the number of lower income people in this community who have been whacked by this government.
As we have said on so many occasions to do with so many measures in this house, this is a government that is strong on taxing the weak, and very weak on taxing the strong. Nothing that the government has done in this house demonstrates that point more than this bill. What is sad about it is that the member for Grayndler and I have been raising these issues in this House for over 18 months. We have used every legitimate measure known to parliamentary democracy in the Westminster system to talk about the needs of a group of vulnerable people in our community—160,000 of them who have been singled out to be the only renters in the country to have a GST placed on their rents. We have had nothing from the government. For the first 12 to 15 months, there was nothing.
—They laughed.
—That is right: cackling, laughter, dismissals! It was only when the political heat started to build that we saw some of those opposite pretend to do something. What is so sad about this bill is that we actually believed government backbench members had some concept of decency and that they might actually fix the problem. We would have been delighted to stand in this House today and say, `You've done the right thing. You've fixed the problem. You've ended the discrimination. You've ended the worry. You've ended the financial pressure on the people living in this situation.' But they have not. In a truly spineless performance, those on the back benches would not stand up to the Prime Minister. They would not stand up to the Treasurer. They would not do anything other than covet their seats in this House and say nothing whatsoever. 
I would like to compliment the member for Grayndler. He is an active parliamentary secretary on our side of the House who has done a fantastic job of getting out there with the people and raising this issue. It is a pity that there are some on the other side of the House who do not adopt the same approach to their parliamentary affairs. The hopes were raised. You cannot turn around and say they were raised solely by us on this side of the House. They were raised by the government. The park owners have told you this is unfair. The residents have told you this is unfair. Your own ministers have told you this is unfair. Your preferred modeller has told you this is unfair. Yet here we are in the House today giving one in three or one in four people 16c a day. That is why we are moving this amendment. I move: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for discriminating against caravan park, mobile home and boarding house renters by singling them out to pay upfront GST on their rents when it had promised prior to the last election that all rent would be GST free and again calls on the Government to honour its pre-election commitment and exempt such renters from the GST”.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000. It was with some disbelief that I sat here and listened to what the member for Lilley had to say. The member for Lilley was a minister in the Keating government. I think he believes that the Australian public have very short memories. They do not have short memories. They are very angered by the scare campaign run by the Labor Party on this issue throughout my electorate and amongst residents of mobile home and relocatable home parks throughout New South Wales.
I cannot believe that an opposition member would stand up here today and argue against a bill which proposes to give increased compensation to the most needy people in our community. I cannot believe that he would stand here and argue against a bill that provides an increase in rental assistance from seven per cent to 10 per cent for the battlers of Australia, the people who really do need assistance. In the whole tax reform debate, the Labor Party have never really stuck to the facts. They have always tried to run the scare campaign. They forget to mention the compensation package supplement for pensioners. I heard the member for Lilley talk at length about the supplement. He tried to accuse the government of taking some of that supplement back. We have to remember that that is in fact an up-front advance. It is not just part of the cost of living rise for pensioners; it is a 4 per cent supplement increase which will result in an extra $14.90 a fortnight for single pensioners. That will assist those pensioners greatly.
Not only will pensioners receive the supplement, but also pensions are indexed to the CPI and pensioners will still receive increases in March and September of each year. The 1 July increase of four per cent is extra. It is a supplement. It was the coalition government that changed the legislation to ensure that pensions increased truly in line with the cost of living. We indexed them to ensure that they remained at at least 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings—something Labor never did. We are very proud to be able to assist pensioners as best we can.
Members opposite always want to run the politics of, I guess, class warfare. They always maintain that they understand the needs of the battlers. They like to refer to ministers as being wealthy and they like to refer to backbenchers as being uncaring of people and caring only about the share market. I am here today to tell the opposition that the members of the coalition government do understand what it is like to struggle and to battle. Coalition members are making a contribution in relation to the needs of all Australians. 
I became involved in politics because I saw what the Keating government did over 13 years of government. I saw how it destroyed the dreams and hopes of so many people in Australia. I know how I was affected in small business. I know what it was like to struggle under a government that did not care about the average person in Australia, about people and about battlers. 
Today we heard a long tirade from the member for Lilley about these compensation packages. I say to the member and to the Australian community: I do not remember any compensation packages from Labor over its 13 years in government. There were always increases in taxes. There were constant increases in wholesale sales taxes—particularly after the 1993 election, when all of the wholesale sales taxes were increased—but there were no compensation packages for the battlers, for the pensioners and for the people who live in relocatable homes or boarding houses. There was no increase in compensation for those people. The Labor Party did not care about them. Labor was thrown out of government because it did not care about average Australians—the strugglers, the pensioners and the battlers. 
The coalition government does care about those people. It realises what they want to do. The government wants to provide compensation packages and assistance to those people. More importantly, the government wants to give those people hope and optimism, whether they be age pensioners or whether they be young people struggling to find a job. There is so much more optimism now on the part of older Australians about the opportunities that are there for their children and grandchildren and for the future of this country. Many of them say, `We have lived our lives and we are very happy in our retirement and in our relocatable home. Provided we have enough money to have a comfortable retirement, that is all we want. What we really want to do is make sure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have a future in this country.' That is what this coalition government has provided. 
I am very proud to be part of the coalition government under our Prime Minister, John Howard, and our Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, because we are a government that is prepared to make the hard decisions. We are prepared to bring about tax reform, which the Labor government never had the guts to do. Labor is having an easy time at the moment, because it can take the easy hits. I guess it is like when we first came to government in 1996. The first 12 months or so were fairly tough for us as a government because we went out there and made the hard decisions to get this economy back on track. We proposed things that were difficult. We did not have a track record as a new government, so the Labor Party could take easy hits at us and say, `You say these things, but where is the proof?' 
As I stand here now, in our second term, I can show the Labor Party the proof of things such as tax reform. I can compare Australia's current unemployment rate of around six per cent with what we were given by Mr Beazley as part of the Keating government—something like 11 per cent unemployment. Home mortgage interest rates are now running at about seven per cent. We have given the dream of home ownership back to so many people. The Keating government gave us home loan interest rates of something like 17 per cent and business loan interest rates of up to 23 per cent. Interest rates such as that destroyed families and destroyed lives. 
At that time inflation tore at the basic value of pensions. Those in the Labor Party say that they care about pensioners, yet they let inflation run riot in this country so that every time pensioners went into the supermarket they were faced with huge increases in their costs, week after week, month after month. Labor had no way of controlling the economy and its effects on this country. That was affecting the battlers and the pensioners. We in the coalition have made the hard decisions and have been able to give people hope for the future. We have been able to provide compensation packages that will ensure that the tax reform package, which is great for this country and will take this country forward, does not disadvantage those people. They will ensure that the battlers will be looked after.  
The member for Lilley criticised us for our compensation packages. He said that they really were pathetic and that it was not worth putting them in place. He should know about that, because he was part of a government that never gave any compensation. I was interested to go through some media reports that were on my desk. At a doorstop interview with the member for Lilley a journalist referred to compensation in relation to this bill. The journalist said, `I just want to clarify that that now remains your position on the election.' Mr Swan said, `There is an ironclad guarantee that we will remove the GST from site fees on mobile homes.' Ironclad! Okay, but then the journalist asked, `Will you leave the extra rent assistance in place?' Honourable members should listen to the answer from the member for Lilley. He said, `We have said that we will look at all the proposals for the roll-back of the GST and outline those proposals closer to the election.' That is right! Labor will roll back the compensation and assistance for the pensioners and battlers. There was no ironclad guarantee that Labor would not roll back the compensation, yet opposition members are in the House today arguing against this bill, which seeks to provide extra rent assistance for those people who really need it. 
When the next election comes around, when the Labor Party proposes its roll-back, I am afraid that its roll-back will roll right over it, because nobody can trust the Labor Party. Nobody will trust that it will not fiddle the books and change the tax system, because all it will be doing is rolling back the compensation and the benefits that come with tax reform for all people in Australia. They are for people with families, for people who are trying to buy homes, for people who are looking for work and for those who are really struggling; those people who are living in boarding houses and relocatable homes. This rent assistance increase will be of great benefit to those people. It will ensure that none of them is worse off.
The reason the government put in place the legislation that gave mobile home park owners the choice between charging half GST or not charging GST was that it wanted to provide a system which minimised the costs and enabled park owners to keep rents as low as possible for residents. That is what it was all about. The effect of the Labor Party's amendments, which will create more costs for the owners of mobile home parks, will be an increase in costs, and those costs will be put straight back onto the residents. So the Labor Party proposal is to create a system that will increase costs on those who can least afford it—those living in mobile home parks and relocatable homes. I am very pleased to stand in this House to support the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000.",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I am pleased to support the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000 because the Labor Party is happy to see extra funds going into rent assistance. An increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance is welcome. As members of the government have said, it will provide $33 million in additional rental assistance to low income earners, not that this will go very far. For a single social security recipient with no children, it is worth 16c a day, $1.12 a week. For a single person with no children sharing the rent, it is worth 11c a day. That is 77c a week. In fact, it is only those social security recipients receiving the maximum rate of rental assistance who will receive the increase. As my colleague the member for Lilley has pointed out, that means that fewer than half of the residents of caravan parks and boarding homes will get anything out of this package. 
The fact is that this is a dud deal. That is why I seconded the amendment moved by the member for Lilley. It is also consistent—unlike the member for Robertson, who could not last 20 minutes speaking to this bill. It is consistent not just with Labor Party policy, it is consistent with National Party policy. I am pleased that the member for Page is in parliament, because I might like to offer him the opportunity to second the amendment. I would be happy to withdraw my seconding rights to this amendment, because it is consistent with the resolution adopted unanimously at the National Party conference, to which the member for Page was a delegate. The member voted for this amendment in Tweed Heads, as did Larry Anthony and Gary Nehl. All of the National Party members voted for it at their conference but, in here, they are silent; they defend the government's position.  
The history of this grubby tax on the most vulnerable people in our community is one that is important not just for what it says about the government being prepared to attack residents of caravan parks and boarding houses but because of what it says about the government's attitude towards the most vulnerable in our community in general. This bill is a miniature replay of the first Democrat-government deal that ensured the passage of the GST. The Democrats got out of that the Econtech report, which they would look at and which the government would consider. An independent review was undertaken by Econtech to consider exactly the impact of the GST on boarding house residents. That was an interesting strategy of the Australian Democrats—to vote for an unfair tax on the basis that there would be a report published later on to show just how unfair it is. The fact is that we repeatedly asked for the Econtech report to be brought forward to us. I raised this issue on 16 February this year. I said in this House: 
The government knows that these tenants will be worse off. That is why it is sitting on the report by Econtech into people in boarding houses.
It was raised again on 17 February, 14 March, 30 May, 19 June, 20 June and, of course, we raised it again after the document was leaked on 26 June. We raised it in this House over and over again. My colleague the member for Lilley asked questions. We raised it in Senate estimates. Not once did the government release this report. Between 3 February and June, seven press releases were issued calling for this report to be released. However, the government sat on it, because it is a sorry tale. It shows that boarding house residents will be worse off. 
Now, as a result of this deal of extra rent assistance—a deal that leaves the discrimination intact—the Democrats came up with the stroke of genius of halving the GST so that it would be 2.75 per cent. However, that stance did not last long. Within 24 hours, the Democrats had once again folded to the government and settled for this inadequate package that leaves the discrimination. The only way to remove discrimination is to treat all tenants equally by abolishing the GST on all residential rents. Why is that such a radical proposal? After all, the National Party promised that at the last election. Mark Vaile, the member for Lyne, said:
This will be treated in the same way as rental of a house or unit and is GST free. 
That was in election material distributed to permanent park residents. 
Since then, the government has been in damage control. The fact is that, when the GST was introduced, the government simply forgot that some 160,000 Australians live in this form of accommodation and tens of thousands of Australians live in boarding houses. The government moved only when they realised that so many of those residents lived in marginal seats. 
We on this side of the house have other reasons for wanting this tax removed. We want it removed because it is discriminatory and because it affects some of the most vulnerable people in our community. How do we know that? Because the government says that is the case. The government's national homelessness strategy, launched on 25 May, identified families living in caravans and hotels and people living in boarding houses as being at high risk of homelessness. Labor simply believes that millionaires renting property in Kirribilli, Vaucluse or Toorak should be treated the same as people who live in caravan parks in Coffs Harbour, Grafton, the Tweed, Cairns or Kalgoorlie. Why should the only people who pay the GST up front—5.5 per cent—be the very people who are the most vulnerable? It is a fundamental Australian principle that we do not discriminate on the basis of wealth. 
In order for them to squeeze every last cent out of these vulnerable people we find that, under the Howard government, even half of 10 per cent—the concessional GST—is no longer five per cent; it is 5.5 per cent. They add on the 10 per cent and then charge the concessional tax of 50 per cent of the GST. So it is a tax on a tax by this miserable, discriminating, reactionary government in order to squeeze out an extra 0.5 per cent. However, no-one has held more positions on this issue than the Minister for Community Services, the minister who could manage to weasel out just 200 words. He had half an hour on the clock in moving this bill, but said only 200 words. And it is not surprising, because the minister has discovered that words can come back to bite him. He said on 7 October 1999: 
Site fees are not the same as rent. This whole issue is nothing new.
He kept defending it on 12 October. He said:
As you well know, prior to the last election we were very open and transparent about the GST, particularly the relationship it had to rent and particularly the relationship that it had to mobile home parks.
That is extraordinary when one considers the leaflet distributed by his colleague the member for Lyne and extraordinary given that residents in parks in his electorate were told by him in meetings that the GST would not apply. But then the pressure was put on so that by 9 February of this year he was saying to residents:
But I do hope there can be a change there ... and I hope I can come back to you shortly, and I will, through your representatives, and hopefully there can be a change.
In May he distributed a pamphlet to his electorate which acknowledged that he was aware that park residents are being treated differently from people renting outside parks. It stated:
He has taken this message to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Most recently he had a robust discussion on this issue with John Howard in his Canberra office.
But it gets worse, because on 15 June in relation to the urgency motion that was coming up before the New South Wales National Party conference he said:
Certainly if that does become policy by the party, then if the National Party have come out in that position, then I think it is appropriate for the government to seriously consider changing this policy. Then the party will be making decisions and so will I.
What courage we have seen from the member for Richmond! While the Labor Party stands for rolling back the GST through our amendment to this bill today, the National Party stands for roll-over, and they have rolled over on this issue. In spite of the rhetoric of the Leader of the National Party, in cabinet not a word was said. In the joint party room not a word was said by the member for Page or the member for Robertson; not one question was asked of the Prime Minister on this issue. What a disgrace! Black Jack McEwen would be rolling in his grave if he could see what the National Party have been reduced to today.
But we are giving them the opportunity. If the New South Wales Nationals—forget about the people in the other states—vote for their party policy and vote for our amendment moved by the member for Lilley, there will be a majority on this side of the House. We will be calling a division and if those eight Nationals vote with the ALP on this issue, they will have their platform adopted—unanimously adopted—by the rank and file. This is a true test of heart and courage. This is a test of whether they represent their electorates or whether they are merely an adjunct to the Melbourne and Sydney Liberal Party machine. We will see how much backbone they have got. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know how important this issue is. I cannot put it better than how you summed it up on 16 June—
 (Mr Nehl)—If the honourable member for Grayndler wishes to quote something said by the member for Cowper he should identify it, as the chair has said nothing on this issue.
—I cannot put it better than how the member for Cowper put it. On 16 June he made a great statement, a courageous statement. He said:
As far as I'm concerned there is one issue and it affects me very, very personally. But what affects me personally is that my integrity and honour is impugned, as is John Anderson and Larry's and Mark Vaile and the rest of us—everybody—because we went to the people of Australia at the last election and we said there'd be no GST on residential rents. It has an impact on John Howard's integrity and honour and that of the Liberal Party as well. 
How right the member for Cowper is. It took the National Party conference for the government to sit up and take notice at least for a couple of days.
—Hours.
—They said they would do something for a couple of days, but they said not a word in this House, not a word when they came to Canberra. Perhaps the most offensive comment on this issue came from Liberal Senator Ross Lightfoot, a Liberal senator representing Western Australia, including the electorate of Kalgoorlie, which has some 14,509 permanent park residents. He has not been chastised or criticised by the Prime Minister, by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party or by the member for Page. I call upon a single member of the government to come out and condemn this senator and dissociate themselves from these comments. Senator Lightfoot said:
These people are lucky. They are no more special than anyone else. It might be an incentive for them to get houses.
The arrogance of these people with their family trusts and their spiv mates from the big cities! They say, `We'll tax you. We'll discriminate against you. We'll put you at risk of homelessness because it is an incentive for you to get out there and get houses.' The fact is that these people do have homes; they are proud of their homes. When you go into residential parks, you do not see many wheels on caravans. What you see is homes with plumbing, with full facilities. This is a government that is totally out of touch.
The National Party concession was to say, `Oh, we're going to get the ACCC to monitor what's happening.' That was the concession from the National Party leader. I will tell members what the ACCC have to say. In a letter to the federal member for Chifley, my colleague Roger Price, Professor Fels said the following:
It is important to note with the second option the GST concessional rate will not apply to additional charges for goods or services provided as part of the accommodation. For example, electricity, gas, mini bar items, laundry bills, meals, phone calls, et cetera. These items will attract the full GST of 10 per cent.
This is how out of touch they are. They actually think that people in residential parks get mini bars filled up at night. They think they get food and phones provided. They get nothing of the sort. By and large, most of the services in these parks are provided by the residents themselves. But why wouldn't Professor Fels be out of touch on this issue, because the government is out of touch as well? On AM on 19 June when dismissing the National Party conference call, the Prime Minister said:
If you pay the half GST, the owner of the caravan park is then able to get a refund of all the input taxes he pays on things like carpets, airconditioning, heating and so forth.
That will be news to the residents. As well as getting their mini bars filled up at night and all these other services provided, they have benevolent owners of caravan parks coming in and putting carpet in their vans for them and providing airconditioning. What a nonsense! This government has no idea whatsoever about the lifestyle of ordinary Australians.
The second part of the deal from the National Party which is even more offensive is that, on top of the $431 million campaign to sell the GST to the electorate, they announced that they will run an education campaign. The money that owners will pay in GST on their site fees and their rent is actually going to be used by the government to send propaganda into residential parks to tell them that they are better off for it. It is no wonder that only one member of the government was prepared to put his or her name on the speakers list for this bill. The Deputy Prime Minister has not had anything to say because he knows that the National Party is completely out of touch on this issue. 
People who live in boarding houses are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I probably have more boarding houses in my electorate than there are in just about any other electorate in Australia. One of my constituents is a Mr Patrick Drage, who lives in Crystal Street, Petersham, in a row of six terraces containing 42 permanent residents. This is what a real battler has to say about the GST on rent:  
I go without meals as it is, if it goes up another $14 or so, that's meat and bread I'll have to go without. I go to the [Exodus] Foundation at Ashfield and pretty much everyone else here does, too. I can't read or write, I had silicosis all my life and I couldn't go to school. I didn't vote for the GST, it's going to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
Mr Patrick Drage of Petersham has got it right. This is an appalling cave-in by the Democrats. It is an embarrassment for the National Party, whose rank and file will wonder why they bother to go to conferences. 
I conclude by asking the National Party to find a spine and find eight of those New South Wales Nationals to vote for the policy that was adopted unanimously by the rank and file at its conference, at which they were all delegates. They voted for it in Tweed Heads. I say: if it is good enough to vote for it in Tweed Heads, it is good enough to vote for it in Canberra.
—Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A. The debate may be resumed at a later hour.",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I move:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for:
(1) deceiving the Australian community on tax - most recently exposed in relation to the impact of the GST on petrol prices;
(2) imposing a tax system on the Australian community from next Saturday which will result in higher prices, less compensation and more complexity than he promised at the 1998 election, and whose adverse impacts will be felt in the days, weeks and months to come; and
(3) wasting the opportunity, because of his personal obsession with the introduction of an old-fashioned tax, to help build the knowledge nation Australia requires for the new century.
I think the last person to be ambushed by the GST prior to its implementation—and there will be many ambushes after this—was the price watchdog himself, Allan Fels. He was the last person to find himself in a situation of embarrassment prior to the introduction of the GST—the man who is supposed to implement the Commonwealth's price controls. He was asked to comment on the following by Laurie Oakes:
The likely result is an increase of 1.4c a litre, contrary to the ACCC's GST price guide, which predicted no rise in petrol prices.
Mr Fels said:
Well, we took the government commitment at face value.
He took the government commitment at face value. The Australian people, in the last election campaign, took the government commitment at face value. Indeed the Australian people, before the 1996 election, took the government commitment at face value. I think it is worthwhile us now reviewing that particular undertaking before the 1996 election which was, if you like, from a person who is a serial offender on deceit about this taxation arrangement. This is where the serial offence began. It was the first commitment of the crime as far as the goods and services tax is concerned. I go to those various statements that were made to the media and to the Australian people through the media during the lead-up to the 1996 election. 
We know the infamous `never, ever' quote. But, like many things that are reiterated in public life, it enters into the lexicon of political discourse; it becomes a joke, it becomes deprived of its moral content and of an awful lot of its force. So many people have pointed out the Prime Minister's breach of his `never, ever' promise that we have lost the sense in which it was given—the fullness of it as a precedent for what has gone on in terms of the shrouding of this tax with lies ever since. These are his quotes of the time, taken from a press release dated 2 May 1995:
Suggestions in today's Australian that I have left open a possibility of a GST are completely wrong. A GST or anything resembling it is no longer coalition policy, nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australia. 
Then we go to a doorstop on the same day:
Journalist: So you've left the door open for a GST now, haven't you?
Howard: No, there's no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy.
Journalist: Never ever?
Howard: Never ever.  It's dead.  It was killed by the voters at the last election.
Journalist: Were you misquoted in today's Australian newspaper, then?
Howard: Well, any suggestion that I left the door open is absolute nonsense.  I didn't. I never will.  The last election killed the GST.  It's not part of our policy and it won't be part of our policy at any time in the future.
Then we went later on to Newcastle, a city that is truly beloved by me. The Prime Minister gave the electors of Newcastle on 11 December 1995 these responses when talking to a presenter:
Howard: Can I look you straight in the eye and say this, that if I state before an election that we're not going to do something and say it in concrete terms, I mean it.  One of the worst things about politics in Australia at the moment is that the public doesn't believe what its political leaders say.  Now I'm telling you . . . 
Presenter: But you had the wrong bloke flogging it before.  I mean, John Hewson wasn't good at selling it but—GST, I mean . . . 
Howard:  Mickey, it's not on the agenda, full stop.
Presenter:  Would you like it to be?
Howard:  No, it's not on the agenda, full stop.  Just not there.  Vamoose.  Kaput.
Presenter:  Well it would be political suicide, unfortunately.  This is a little touchy.  God, I wish I'd been the man to flog that . . . 
Howard:  I'm just telling you what is on the agenda, and what's not, and that's not.  I say to the people of Australia, there will be no GST, that it is not on our agenda and I mean it.  It's not, you know tiny...
Presenter: Cross your heart, type stuff?
Howard: Look, it's absolute (inaudible) and you know, you could bring me back here after the election when we've won and you can ask me again, you can ask me again in two years' time and you will find that I've kept my word on that.
Opposition members—Oh!
—I go back to the Prime Minister's earlier part of that particular quote:
Can I look you straight in the eye and say this, that if I state before an election that we're not going to do something and say it in concrete terms, I mean it.
What did he state before the last election in concrete terms to the Australian people? What did he state about the issue that triggered this debate, though it is a much broader debate than simply that about petrol? He said the following—and it was not as he tried to convey to Laurie Oakes the sort of odd misstep that occurs from time to time, the slip of a tongue when there is a debate going on; and occasionally from time to time it is true that politicians may well find themselves caught out and they are entitled to a bit of latitude on the subject when they get into that type of engagement—and this was a statement to the Australian people, a considered statement read from a script by the Prime Minister in his address to the nation on the tax plan: 
For all businesses the cost of petrol will fall by about seven cents a litre.
And then:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
He said that, and that proposition has been reiterated time and again by the spokesmen for the government ever since, one of the most recent times, of course, being by the Treasurer in November last year. He said this:
... when you equalise out the tax arrangements, you get the same amount of revenue anyway. The excise comes down and the 10 per cent goes back up. It is the same amount of tax. It just depends on whether you are taking it in a form of excise or whether you are taking it in the form of GST.
That beats the gobbledygook we heard from the Prime Minister in the answer to his last question, which was his cover for the fact that the GST is going to massively increase the price of petrol for the ordinary Australian at the bowser—and will do it from Saturday. He tries to hide behind this nonsense of some 90c a litre strike rate that he talks about. The simple fact of the matter is this: Australians will confront a price of petrol above 74c a litre around this nation on Saturday the 1st, and I would suggest that every single Australian will confront a price higher than 74c a litre. The government will be collecting more in tax from petrol than it collects now and the impact of the GST will ensure that. There has never been a proposition put before the Australian people so shrouded in deceit as this GST, so shrouded in deceit on the question of compensation, so shrouded in deceit on the question of its price effects and so shrouded in deceit on the question of its initial introduction—every single element of it shrouded in deceit. I ask: if something is good for the country, does it have to be introduced on the basis of deception? No, of course, it does not. The reward for this government, of course, has been a series of editorials today which have gone to point out the level of its deceit on this particular matter. The Daily Telegraph under `Price rises add to sense of betrayal' said:
No amount of sliding and dodging by the Federal Government will allow it to escape the abundantly plain fact that petrol prices will increase with the GST.
From the Sydney Morning Herald:
The argument over the cost of petrol can hardly be more confused and confusing. The motoring public feels cheated, with the prospect of a 1.4c or 1.5c a litre rise when the goods and services tax begins to apply on Saturday.
The West Australian:
It was he—
the Prime Minister, that is—
not the companies—who made what appears to have turned out to be an ill-advised political promise. And it is he—not the companies—who will be held accountable if the promise is not kept.
He will be held accountable for that. He will be held accountable by the Australian people. What we have seen from the government over the last few days is an effort at positioning this GST. A great erector of straw men is the Prime Minister, and the latest one he has erected is the notion that, somehow or other, the opposition has been in there claiming that the sky will fall in on Saturday the 1st. Like Chicken Little we are out there—though Chicken Little cooked, of course, will attract a GST; uncooked or cold it will not. `But the sky will cave in'—it is said by the opposition, according to the government, that this will occur on Saturday. Of course, we do not say that and never have. 
This GST will be a slow burn, a slow accumulation and the feeling on the part of the Australian people and the government's new tax collectors—small business in particular—that they have been dudded. It will not occur, apart from now, to the surprise of us all, in this area of petrol on Saturday. It will occur as the first bill starts to come in for your insurance, for your bank fees, for your housing rent, for your electricity, for your gas and for the charges on services that you have been used to getting—and it will come from companies that have employed vast numbers of Australians, be it for your haircuts or whatever else it is you need at different points of time. And it will come in gradually as those who have sought in the first instance to take it on board decide ultimately not to absorb its cost. There will be a large number of Australian operations—services, shops—which will absorb the initial impact of the GST and gradually extend it. You can see it, for example, with the Canberra Raiders, for which I give them a tick on this subject. They are going to absorb, in the prices of their tickets, the GST for the next three games, but not for next season. 
—Not the AFL.
—As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reminds me, neither will the AFL. The GST is going to come in slowly over time, in event after event in the lives of ordinary people. It will come in against a background of price rises and disappointments over the compensation packages, and it will mostly affect not well-off Australians but ordinary Australians—I will say something about that later on. Ordinary Australians will gradually get a handle on the fact that what has been taken out of their pockets is greater than what has been put in. 
The first to discover that will be the pensioners. I could not believe it today when the Prime Minister mocked the member for Lilley for pointing out that pensioners would find themselves short-changed by $10 in the first impact of the GST. For people of the wealth of the Prime Minister and his front bench, that is a bagatelle. But for people who count their lives in this community in cents rather than in $50 and $100 notes, it means everything. And from next March, the pensioners will see half of their increases get clawed back. Under the government's definitions, it appears that they are entitled to about eight months of bliss with this, and then it will be hauled back. I do not think that there is a single pensioner who will find a four per cent increase producing too much bliss around the place when they confront the sorts of price rises there will be under the GST.
Of course, everybody will confront the Christmas price rises. That is when you are going to see the genuine effect. Most Australians have been smart and have been buying up clothes. They have been buying up those goods which they know the GST will impact on immediately. But if they have kids, they know that their clothes last about 12 months before they outgrow them—12 months and that is it. Families understand that the GST is the family tax. Whenever you have a kid in Australia from this point on, you enter a new tax bracket. Your tax will go up as you pay for the nappies and as you pay GST on the baby carriage, because all the implements that were previously untaxed now carry a 10 per cent tag on them. As I said, this tax is a slowburn, and it will be a slowburn in the minds of the Australian people as they realise how massively they have been deceived.
And for what? The government's last defence, like the last refuge of any scoundrel, is bogus patriotism. They say to the Australian people, `Your family might be worse off. That is true. You might feel worse off. That may be true. You may object to now paying taxes on services. That may be true. But it is all for the good of the nation.' What in the government's figures actually demonstrates that fact? Have the Treasury's forward calculations on growth assumed that the economy is going to grow substantially or even marginally faster following the introduction of the GST? No. There are no figures from Treasury that demonstrate that. Let us take it a point further. There will be little impact on the macro economy, but what about on the micro economy? In the micro economy, in the lives of hundreds of thousands of businesses, the impact is going to be massive.
Not known by many people in this parliament or many people in the general public—apart from those who are in small business—is the conflict suffered by hundreds and thousands of small businesses in the community as they desperately try to get to grips with a tax which has baffled the Taxation Office. The government is paying a terrible price for the way it has treated the Public Service over the last four years. There are not enough properly trained public servants to implement this tax. That is simply a fact of the matter. Somebody was nasty enough to run a test across the Australian tax officials. I do not blame the officials for this, but the test showed that about one-third of them were not in a situation to answer effectively the questions being asked of them. About a third of the tax office is potentially giving misinformation to the people who phone them. On the logic of that, one in three phone calls are therefore likely to involve misinformation given to the collectors of that tax. 
Is there any mercy for anyone in this business as far as this government is concerned? Is there any mercy for those in the housing industry who have been overrun by petrified people confronting the possibility of thousands of dollars of increases in the cost of building, of providing themselves with shelter? Is there any mercy for those people who have found themselves in a situation where they are overwhelmed with orders. I feel sympathy for the people that the Acting Treasurer wanted to dismiss: the people who have been accepting contracts to build houses and do renovations, people who have been overrun and will not manage to complete the orders by 1 July. It does not mean that they are crooks and laggards by being in that position; they are in a situation somewhat worse than the one they are normally in with the amount of demand upon them, and they have not made the cut. They have not made the cut, but the government has. The government is straight in for its cut as far as the ordinary Australian building or renovating a house at this moment is concerned.
I now come back to the theme of the GST being `good for the country', as opposed to being good for anyone else. There is a group of people that will find themselves in a better position after these tax changes. High income earners in this country will be better off. There is no question about that. What they pay out in GST, they will get back, plus more, in income tax cuts. But it needs to be understood that these tax cuts did not come from the GST, though they will have a material effect on shifting the balance between indirect taxes, regressive taxes, and direct taxes in this country. There will be that imbalance. But the payment for the tax cuts has not come from the GST; it has come from spending the surplus. The Treasurer admitted only a couple of months ago that it would have been impossible to deliver most of the tax cuts without implementing a GST, but the government was also prepared to spend the surplus.
They made a point about having to cut programs to pick up what they felt was an unacceptable deficit when they came into office. Every single cent of those cuts, and more, has been spent now on the tax arrangements associated with this GST package. And at whose expense? It will be at the expense of the universities of Australia, at the expense of the public schools of Australia, at the expense of the public hospitals of Australia, at the expense of the pensioner dental program for the pensioners of Australia and at the expense of business doing essential research and development for the new products that the new economy needs. Those are the people who are paying for the only section of the community that will personally feel any benefit from that. How is that massive deterioration of public investment in the critical areas of the new economy supposed to be good for the country? How can that be good for the country as it comes to slide in a 1960s French socialist tax? The modern economy of Australia, brought to you by the French Socialist Party—that is what we have. It is not good for the country and not good for the people, and the government deserves censure.
 (Mr Nehl)—Is the motion seconded?
—We were waiting for the Prime Minister to come and defend himself, but I second the motion and reserve my right to speak, and I invite the Prime Minister to come in here and defend himself.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,20,1
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2000-06-28,"—The first point that has to be made is that the Leader of the Opposition, on this supposed censure motion, goes to the issue of `deceiving the Australian community on tax'. Those are the first words of the motion. I would have thought that the greatest and clearest deception of the Australian people in relation to taxation matters came from the ALP in the build-up to the 1993 election. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the build-up to the 1993 election some very explicit promises were made by the man who once upon a time not so long before that had been described as the world's greatest Treasurer. Remember him, the world's greatest Treasurer? We might even touch on some of his exploits again in a moment. But let us talk a little about what we were promised in the build-up to the 1993 election. The first thing we were promised was that we could have major personal tax cuts in this country without a GST. We were told we did not need a GST but we could have major tax cuts nonetheless. What happened to those major personal tax cuts? Were the Australian people deceived on that? They were deceived on that. So that is deception No. 1.  
At the same time we were told in that election campaign that, because the tax system was not broken, there was no need for any increases in indirect taxation. What actually happened to indirect taxation levels with the first Dawkins budget after the 1993 election? Were they kept static? Were the Australian people able to say, `We were told there would be no tax increases and there weren't'? Or were they deceived? Were they told the truth or were they deceived? This censure is about deceiving the Australian community on tax. Where did the rates of indirect taxation go in the first Dawkins budget in 1993, after that election on 13 March? Up. Wholesale sales tax rates went up. The rate went up by 10 per cent for all those items on 10 per cent. It went from 20 per cent to 22 per cent for items on 20 per cent. It went from 30 to whatever. It went up right through the range. What did they do with fuel? What had they promised on fuel? Fuel went up very significantly, despite the promises. As has been pointed out many times in this place, those were in direct contradiction of the promises made at the time. 
But there is another aspect to this. Remember that we were told as a basis for all this that the tax system was not broken, weren't we? That is what we were told. Despite all this, they still could not balance the books. During that five years or so that the man who had once been described as the world's greatest Treasurer was actually residing in the Lodge, what happened with that broken tax system? They could not balance the books. We not only had the Beazley black hole—I do not know where he is to respond to this; he has gone—but the cumulative effect of the Beazley black hole was an increase in taxpayers' debt. It is not our money; we as a government know that, unlike them. We do not claim it is ours; it is taxpayers' debt. It had blown from $16 billion to $96 billion—an increase of $80 billion in just five years, and on its way up at the rate of about $10 billion a year. What a spectacular record. They talk about deceiving the Australian people. What were they telling us in the 1996 election? That the books were balanced, that everything was okay. What did we find when we got into power? That we had to turn around and go through the agonising process of putting the nation's books back into some sort of order. 
I believe it has been very widely recognised that this government's economic management was outstanding, that it has put us on a financial, economic and social footing of a quality that we have not seen for decades in this country. In the build-up to the 1998 election, we were able to genuinely say we were winding back debt. We were able to say that we would put the country on a good enough footing to survive the Asian downturn. We were able to point to rising real wage levels. The ALP never want to talk about that. They and their union mates presided over a very long period of time when the workers they represent were suffering real wage declines. What was happening under us? Real wage increases. And I reckon it is eternally to the credit of the man who is Prime Minister of this country that he had the courage to say, `We need to lock it in. We need to take the next step. We need a world-class and competitive taxation system to deliver the benefits of ongoing reform to the Australian people.' So, unlike what we saw in 1993, when we were told we could have cake and eat it too, the Prime Minister told the truth about what he believed the government needed to deliver to the Australian people and gave the Australian people the chance to vote on it. And what happened? They returned us. That has been overlooked. They returned us. John Howard had the courage to say that we needed to progress what we had started, that we needed to lock it in and that we needed a new tax system. 
What have the ALP done since then? Where have they been constructive? Where have they actually made a contribution to the public debate? I often enjoy Paddy McGuinness's articles and I well remember him writing one day that the debate in Australia ought not to be about whether we have indirect tax reform, including a GST, but about who can do the best job of it. There is no doubt about what we need in this country. He rightly says that the question ought to be—
—What are you shouting for? Calm down!
—They never like hearing a few home truths, Mr Speaker. The question ought to be about who can introduce the best tax reform, not whether or not we need it. So what have the ALP done? They have obfuscated, they have obstructed and they have scaremongered. I even noticed some comments here about complexity. If there is any complexity that we would have preferred not to and in fact had not intended to introduce in the new tax system, whose fault might that be? Look what happened with fuel. When it came to the time to negotiate on commitments we had made on better fuel outcomes, who did I find myself negotiating with? Was it my opposite number from the ALP?
Government members—No.
—They had ruled themselves absolutely and totally irrelevant. I had to deal with the Democrats. We do not always agree on policy terms, but I have to say that it was a pleasure dealing with people who were actually attempting to make a contribution in terms of better outcomes for Australia, instead of simply resorting to scaremongering, obfuscation and obstruction.
Let me say a few things about those fuel reforms. Let me highlight the fact that what we are talking about here in terms of the totality of the package that was released the other day is an outstanding reform. There is no doubt about that. I remember a little branch of my own party saying 12 years ago, `It's crazy for us to impose diesel fuel excise on rail. Why can't it be removed?' Who removed it? Was it Labor? Never. It was us. Everywhere I go, I see people trying to export from this country and they are crippled by the amount of taxation that we put on haulage, particularly by heavy vehicles. What did Labor do about it? Nothing. What are we going to do about it? Put diesel down by 24c a litre and potentially more. We keep hearing about the fact that the Labor Party are going to roll back. You know what they are going to do with fuel, don't you? They are going to roll out. The shadow minister at the table, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, made that quite plain a little while ago. He said in relation to the cheaper fuel that we are delivering for transport in this country, which is so vital to our exports:
Well, what we've—basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes.
In other words, the current system. He continued:
We always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime. That wasn't the issue.
So they have been out there this week claiming that we are not delivering on massive fuel reform while their position is to roll out—not roll back. They are going to roll back out the very expensive taxation burden on transport fuel in this country. Of course, there is the $500 million that we have committed ourselves to ensuring that the differential between fuel costs in country and city areas in this great nation of ours is not exacerbated.
The NRMA put out a very interesting list which purports to show what the price increases in regional areas would be if the savings that the oil companies ought to and should pass on on Saturday are not delivered. It shows with our fuel grants system in place that in fact only very modest parts of those savings for the oil companies would have to be passed on to people in rural and regional areas to get a reduction in fuel prices. Putting $500 million towards the job of relieving pressure on the differential between country and city fuel prices reflects a commitment to rural and regional Australia that we simply never saw from these newfound friends of the bush over here who parade around the country talking about Country Labor. Talk about Country Labor delivering—it is a name and a name only; a very superficial one at that. Let me reiterate that in this case it is quite plainly the ALP that deserve censure, not the Prime Minister and not the government. They have no plan, no vision, no policy except roll-back, with the exception of fuel where it will be rolled out. It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition can only be described as having an unmitigated gall to launch a censure of this notion. 
The question of reform and its value to the regions is important. We hear that the system we are introducing is outmoded, that it is a French socialist model—that should appeal to the shadow minister sitting at the table, Mr Crean. We are an exporting nation. We heard in this place the other day that the Leader of the Opposition had conveniently lifted quite a snippet out of the Minister for Trade's recent speech to the Press Club in which he pointed out that the share of GDP contributed by exports in this country has risen from 10 per cent to 20 per cent and that many hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs depend upon it. There is no such thing as a level playing field. We all acknowledge that. We wish there was, but there is not. The point I want to make about that is that the ALP would leave the field tilted more against us by dint of our own actions rather than attempt to repair it. There are $4½ billion worth of embedded, largely hidden tax imposts on our export performance in this country a year. He talks about us wanting to pursue an outmoded tax system. We are the only one of our competitor nations—no-one else has a tax system like ours—with a tax system that ties one hand behind your back with a whole lot of embedded taxes.
—Botswana.
—We are told that Botswana is now moving to update. They are in front of the modern ALP. All of our competitor nations have put in place rebatable, indirect taxation regimes. Why? Because it helps boost their export competitiveness. It helps boost their export performance. The ALP want to leave us in the Dark Ages, claiming that we are talking about introducing an old fashioned tax system. It is the ALP who want to maintain support for an outmoded 1930s approach to taxation, one that will not deliver on what they claim are their cherished goals of things like social equity, a decent safety net, education in the future, the capacity of the states to meet health needs and so forth. That will not happen without indirect taxation reform.
And it ought to be noted again that, whilst occasionally the state premiers are out there—just occasionally; not very often—publicly backing that mob over there, privately, what are they doing? Who do they think dudded them on taxation reform? Who do they think deceived the Australian community on tax? It was not us. They reckon what we are doing is pretty good. They salute the Prime Minister and the government for what we have done.
Let us come to the issue of the value of tax reform. I often hear it said around the traps that some people seem, sadly, to have got to the point where they say, `I'm almost better off not working than I am working.' Have you ever heard that said in your electorate? That is a symptom of a broken tax system. That is a symptom of a tax system that the ALP support, that leaves people unable to receive sufficient remuneration and return for their hard work, particularly when they do better. We are going to fix it. We will be fixing it and people will shortly discover that in fact some 80 per cent of the nation's wage earners will now pay 30 cents or less in the dollar. That is a major and very worthwhile reform. Where is the ALP's response? They are just hoping that they can scaremonger enough. They talk about tax reform being a slow burn. They hope! `Amen!' they say quietly. They hope it is. It will not be, of course, because people will shortly realise that all of the scaremongering was just that and that they are better off. The ALP are hoping that the Australian people will not see through it and that they can just slide in somehow or other—which will not happen—so that they can then say, `Well, of course we can't really roll back. We can't really roll out. The previous government actually got it about right.'
This is a disgraceful censure. I say unreservedly that the Prime Minister and the government deserve credit for having the courage to tackle the reforms that this country needs. In contrast, it has to be said that the ALP have shown no leadership whatsoever on tax reform, and deserve condemnation for that. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,20,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I second the motion. We have the Treasurer in Paris and the Prime Minister in hiding. This is a disgraceful performance by a Prime Minister who has been asked half a dozen times in the last three days whether his decision on petrol is going to increase the price per litre of petrol and increase the tax. He refuses to answer it. He has a censure motion against him in this parliament today and he is in hiding. He squibbed it today. Do you know what the dictionary definition of `squib' is? It is `to desert someone in order to preserve one's own safety'. And well he might, because the Prime Minister has got a stinking skunk of a tax sitting in the middle of this table that is going to affect the whole Australian public come 1 July. He has been a serial deceiver in relation to this GST and he did it again today. He has broken promise after promise in relation to this tax. He refuses to release information on which he makes his claims.
This week we saw the example of petrol highlighted graphically in the parliament. Let me go to the Prime Minister's pathetic defence of what he is doing with excise on petrol. He said it today. We have heard the minister at the table, Mr Hockey, talk about comparing apples with apples. Let us compare apples with apples when it comes to fuel excise. Whether you want to take just the net Commonwealth fuel excise or whether you want to take that which is collected on behalf of the states, the figure is still the same: come Saturday morning, the government will be collecting another 1½c on every litre of petrol that you buy. Not only will John Howard and Peter Costello have their hands in your pocket for every item you spend money on everywhere around the country; they have grown an extra finger in the case of petrol to take another 1½c a litre out.
Today the Prime Minister referred to what the Commonwealth was now collecting in excise. He used the figure of 44.137c a litre, but that is a figure that includes 8.354c a litre on behalf of the states. What they are doing from 1 July is collecting 45.68c a litre, 37.48c direct for the Commonwealth but 8.2c on behalf of the states—their GST. Today they are collecting 44.137c a litre; on Saturday it will be 45.68c a litre. It sounds like a 1½c a litre difference to me. I would like to know how this minister is going to defend that; the Prime Minister refused to come into this House and defend it. Just take the netted out Commonwealth tax take. The Prime Minister wanted us to believe today that the Commonwealth would only collect 37.48c a litre after 1 July for themselves. The truth is that if you net out the state taxes they are only collecting 35.78c today—1½c a litre difference. They have put up taxes. They have broken a solemn promise that the GST would not increase the price of petrol.
The promises they have broken do not just stop at petrol. Beer is also going to have its excise doubled. It is nothing to do with the GST. We were told the GST would increase the price of ordinary beer 1.9 per cent.
—Wrong.
—It is not wrong. These came out of the Prime Minister's mouth. If he was in here to defend himself today, I would be interested to hear him deny those quotes. A 1.9 per cent increase? Beer is actually going up eight to nine per cent. It is not just beer being hit, either. Clothing, gas, electricity, public transport, football tickets, mobile phones and bank charges are all going up by more than the government said at the last election. We were told, when the deal was done with the Democrats, that food would be GST free—and now we have a publication that runs to a 29-page index explaining all the food that is still taxed.
—Thanks to the Labor Party.
—The minister who is interjecting from the table said nothing would go up by more than 10 per cent—that it was the law and he would see to it. But he still has not produced the law. We have heard examples time and again of prices going up by at least 10 per cent, if not more, on 1 July. They also know that prices have been going up already. 
The other point that I think it is important to know, from the words of the ACCC prices watchdog yesterday, is that implementation costs to business can be passed on to consumers. He has confirmed that those costs can be passed on to consumers and his guidelines say so. The implementation costs of the GST start-up alone are $4.3 billion—$2.8 billion to the private sector and $1.5 billion to the various levels of government—and the ongoing annual costs are somewhere between $380 million and $680 million. All of that can be validly passed on to consumers.
The Prime Minister says that he will not release his modelling on petrol, but do you know what the modelling that the Treasury has done assumes is the cost to business of the GST implementation? It is zero. It has wished away the $4.3 billion start-up and it is wishing away into the future somewhere between $380 million and $680 million. This is the other great scam that this government has pulled. It is no wonder it will not release its modelling. It is not just petrol that is exposed in this. Minister Hockey, release the modelling—I throw that challenge out to you again—not just on petrol but on all the other dodgy figures that you have given the Australian electorate. Your deceit knows no bounds.
We also have honest John still saying that petrol will not go up on 1 July, but what has he left to rely on? Not the oil companies, not the automotive association, not the national farmers—not the Business Council, not the Labor Party, not anyone. The only thing he is relying on is what? His word, and does anyone believe it? This was a man who went on radio and said, `Anyone who claims that the price of petrol will go up as a result of the GST is telling lies.' We now know who was telling the lies. It has been exposed and it is why this censure motion has been moved today.
We know about the bunker that the government were in yesterday—that happy little party room meeting that they always have—where the Prime Minister was giving his address to the faithful and saying, `Gird your loins, bear the scars when you come back.' It was likened to Henry V and King Harry, the Crispin's Day oration at Agincourt. This was supposed to inspire some dedication in the worthy troops to go out and defend and come back standing. I tell you what, the analogy of the Crispin's Day oration leaves me breathless. The outfit is more like that of Dad's Army. There was Captain Mainwaring—the Prime Minister, John Howard. We know that Captain Mainwaring wanted to take charge of this worthy band of troops because he claimed he had experience in the 1919 war. What were some of those famous quotes that Captain Mainwaring used to whip up the troops with? This was obviously the one that he got stuck with when people said, `What are we going to say when petrol is going up, Prime Minister?' This is what Captain Mainwaring would say, `I wondered who was going to spot that first.' I tell you what, it has been spotted. Then there is Wilson, his lieutenant—that is, Costello—missing in action. He comes in and says, `Did I miss something?' as the whole cacophony of dissembling goes around. We saw him in Paris yesterday, ringing the bells and saying, `I'm Peter Costello.' This is the hapless Wilson—Brother Costello. This is a man who, once this tax is in place, promises to go out and inform the regions. This is a guy who has spent more days in Paris in the last week than he has ever spent visiting the regions in the past. So do not hold your breath in terms of that commitment.
Then there is Jonesy—Joe Hockey, sitting opposite—the person who is always getting put back in his box because he is making mistakes, sticking up his hand and saying, `Permission to speak, sir. Permission to speak.' This is Joe Hockey after round-up, Joe Hockey after the Coca Cola incident, Joe Hockey when he is threatening the ACCC. What a threat. And then there is Joe Walker. I will let you guess this one. Joe Walker is the spiv. He is the person that can get anything off a truck. He is the person that will say anything and do anything. Who do you think Joe Walker is?
Opposition members—Peter Reith.
—Exactly. Peter Reith is there too. Then we have Jock Fraser, the person with the manic eyes, the person who sees a conspiracy in anything. That is Brother Abbott. We have just had, in place of the Prime Minister, who is not here to defend himself in this censure motion, Frank Pike—Anderson, the Red Hill squire, the obsequious one, always agreeing, always rolling over, never standing up for himself or for his party. And then there is Charles Godfrey, the doddery one, the one who has copped the hospital pass—John Fahey—as Costello heads off to Paris. What we have here is deceit revealed by a ragtag Dad's Army band, people who were not prepared to face the truth, people who were not prepared to have their leader come into this House and defend his honesty, his integrity and his tax. He cannot defend his honour and his integrity because they are in tatters. We saw them with this outrageous spend of $430 million on the chains ads. I understand they might be coming to an end this week, thankfully. But there are more. There are some more ads appearing next week from the tax office. They are producing ads to promote a helpline, which is typical of the tax office—they are doing it after the tax has been introduced. When you read the report in the Australian today you would have to be a bit concerned because a third of the tax office staff flunked the GST exam. They could not even give the answers. So complex is this tax that even the experts cannot work it out. If the experts cannot work it out, how do you expect ordinary Australians and businesses to cope with it? 
We heard the minister talk today about the ACCC hotline. I tell you what, I would love to be able to use a tape recorder in this House to demonstrate the stupidity of one of the helpful operations that the ACCC have put out. If you ring their hotline there is a tape recorded message that says, `Welcome to the ACCC's hotline. If you speak English, press 1; if you don't speak English, press 2.' What sort of help is that, Minister? What sort of a show are you running? It is truly a Dad's Army outfit, with poor old Jonesy over there saying, `Permission to speak'—but only if it is in English. The answers we have heard from you the last few days, brother, are not in English. They might be something else, but they are not making any sense to the ordinary punters out there.
The ACCC and the Taxation Office have been denied sufficient resources. They have not been given clear direction by this government—and no wonder we have the shambles and the chaos that we have. The Prime Minister stands condemned, but he is not here today to defend himself. He has squibbed the opportunity in this parliament to give the rallying call that he was supposed to have given his troops on Tuesday. He was given the opportunity in this parliament today to stand up and honour a solemn promise that he gave in relation to petrol. He stood in the electorate and he swore black and blue, hand on heart, that the GST would not lead to any increase in prices. Full stop. No qualification. That is what is going to happen. Yet, today and yesterday and the day before, he has been exposed as having deceived the Australian electorate on it. This is not just one deceit; it is a litany of deceit.
The Leader of the Opposition has outlined the solemn promises that the Prime Minister has made in other circumstances. The `never, ever' man is now the `serial deceiver' when it comes to taxation promises. The Australian electorate will remember him for it. They will know about it on Saturday when they go to fill up that car, when they take the kids to the swimming pool, when they go to the footy, when they buy a pie, when they go to the take-away at the end of the day. The government ought to be censured for this disgrace. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,20,1

—There must be just a touch of arrogance that is starting to pervade the attitudes in the Labor Party—a touch of arrogance with them thinking, `Well, if we just keep running on this issue, we'll have a hit.' That is what they think: `We will keep running on the GST issue, and we will have a hit.' It is starting to pervade every word that they mutter in this place. It is starting to pervade their attitude in question time; it is starting to pervade their attitude outside of question time in the House. The Labor Party are just starting to get a little bit arrogant about what they think is going to happen from 1 July. But isn't it interesting that for the first time today we have seen a change in the words used by the Leader of the Opposition? 
For the first time, instead of the opposition talking about the impact of the GST from 1 July, they started to talk about the `slow burn' of the GST. They want to stretch it out. Could it be that, all of a sudden, they have realised that Armageddon is not coming on 1 July? Could it be that the Labor Party are just starting to realise that on 1 July the sun is still going to come up? Could it be that the Labor Party are just starting to realise that on 1 July Australians will receive the biggest income tax cuts in Australian history? Could it be that from 1 July the Labor Party are just starting to realise that every business in Australia will have cheaper fuel? Could it be that from 1 July, the Labor Party are just starting to realise, pensioners will be better off, families will be better off, self-funded retirees will be better off, and the average Australian will have more money in their pocket after the introduction of the new tax system than they have today? Could it be that the Labor Party are just starting to recognise that? All of a sudden their rhetoric has turned from Armageddon on 1 July to the slow burn effects of the GST. And they have the gall to come into this place and move a motion to censure the Prime Minister about deceit on tax.
The Deputy Prime Minister has already talked about deceit on tax. If anyone is well qualified to talk about deceit on tax, it is the Leader of the Opposition. And I will tell you why he is well qualified: the Leader of the Opposition was part of a government that in 1993 promised l-a-w tax cuts. Do you know what the Australian people got after Labor were re-elected in 1993? There were no l-a-w tax cuts; there were tax increases. Wholesale sales tax went from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, from 20 per cent to 22 per cent, from 30 per cent to 32 per cent, without one dollar of compensation for Australians. Their tax increases were without one dollar of compensation for the average Australian family, without one dollar of compensation for pensioners, without one dollar of compensation for those most vulnerable—and the Labor Party talks about deceit when it comes to taxation!
This week we have had the Labor Party lecturing us about fuel excise. Let us talk about fuel excise. In 1993 the Labor Party increased fuel excise by 6c per litre. There was no compensation. Every business had to pay an additional 6c. Yet the Labor Party talk about deceit on tax. Do you know what, Mr Speaker? It is not just about the past; it is about the future. Because their deceit on tax extends to the here and now. The Labor Party are so opposed to the GST they are going to keep it. The Labor Party are so determined to see the death of the GST that, if they are elected to government, they will not repeal it. We can see that best exemplified in the attitude of the current state premiers. The Labor Party state premiers, who are so opposed to the GST—this outrageous tax that is going to penetrate every Australian family—signed on the dot and said, `We want in.' They said, `We want it now.' Have we heard Bob Carr talk about the terrible impact of the GST on Australians or on New South Welshmen? Have we heard Steve Bracks talk about the terrible impact of the GST on Victorians? Have we heard Peter Beattie talk about the terrible impact of the GST on Queenslanders? And the Labor Party come into this place and lecture us about deceit on tax! Yet the Labor Party state premiers will run around and receive every single dime of the GST. Do you know why we get angry on this side about the hypocrisy of the Labor Party? It is because we see so much of it. The irony is that the Labor Party keep coming into this place but do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha. They do not know whether they are defending business or whether they are attacking business. The only thing you can say that is consistent about the Labor Party is that they are hand in glove with and responsible only to the leadership of the trade union movement. 
There is one other thing you can say about the Labor Party, but it is really about the Leader of the Opposition: the Leader of the Opposition says no to no-one, except the government. He is the `Mr Yes' man—for interest groups? `Yes, we'll be there.' For special interest groups? `Yes, we'll be there.' For the trade union movement? `Yes, we'll be there for you.' The Leader of the Opposition says yes to every special interest group, every trade union leader and everyone in Australia, except the government. Yet the government are the ones delivering results through hard reform. It is a tradition of the Labor Party that they oppose us at every single point. They come into this place and use rhetoric and laughter, and attempt to intimidate people into doing what they want them to do. Well, we will not be there. We will not accept that because on this side of the House we believe in integrity. On this side of the House, we believe in honesty. On this side of the House, we believe in doing what is right for Australians, not what is right for the trade union leadership of Australia.
We believe in doing things that are right. So when it comes to the individual issues that the Labor Party want to talk about, I will address the key issues in this debate—the ones they have listed here. If they want to talk about tax, we will cover tax. From 1 July we are delivering a simpler system, a system that delivers benefits to those most in need—$12 billion worth of tax cuts. From 1 July, 80 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar in income tax. If you want to talk about lifting the burden off exporters, more than $2 billion worth of tax will come off Australian exports from 1 July. If you want talk about the impact on families, families will get the most substantial benefits they have ever enjoyed from 1 July. If you want to talk about pensions, there are real increases in pensions for every Australian pensioner from 1 July. If the Labor Party want to talk about a range of issues in relation to the new taxation system, let us talk about them.
Let us talk about complexity because that is what the Labor Party want to talk about. From 1 July, we are replacing 11 reporting regimes with one. I ask you, Mr Speaker: is replacing 11 reporting regimes with one reporting regime a more complex system? If you believe the Labor Party it is. But who believes the Labor Party? From 1 July, we are replacing 32 different payment periods with four. And the Labor Party say that is a more complex system! From 1 July, we are replacing multiple business numbers such as the PAYE registration number, the ACM, the ASFM, the ARBN, the wholesale sales tax number, the PPS, the RPS and company tax numbers with one number—the ABN. And the Labor Party say that is a more complex system than what they are trying to defend!
We had the extraordinary allegation from the Leader of the Opposition today that under this tax—this tax that he is so opposed to that he is going to keep—kids are going to be worse off. I put it to you that, under the current Labor Party defended wholesale sales tax system, baby powder is taxed at 22 per cent, but with the GST it will come down to 10 per cent. How is that worse? Rattles, currently taxed at 22 per cent under the Labor Party, will come down to 10 per cent. Toys, currently taxed at 22 per cent under the Labor Party, will come down to 10 per cent. Yet the Leader of the Opposition in his naive and simplistic way came into this place and argued that the GST is going to hit little kids. What about the wholesale sales tax regime that the Labor Party are defending? What about the wholesale sales tax regime that only the Labor Party and the government of Swaziland are defending. What does that say about the Labor Party? It says hypocrisy. It says that the Labor Party are so opposed to the new tax system that they are going to keep it.
The Labor Party are also defending all of their so-called friends. Friends come and go, especially for political parties, but we have heard the most extraordinary words from the Labor Party about petrol during the course of this week. The Labor Party are saying that every business in Australia should not have to pass on the full benefits of the abolition of wholesale sales tax from 1 July. The Labor Party are saying that the oil companies are entitled to keep the windfall benefit that they may receive as a result of the introduction of the new tax system. 
The Labor Party traditionally ignore the facts, and the fact is that from 1 July more than 70 per cent of the costs of production of petroleum and coal products, which are recurrent, are going to be affected either way by the new taxation system. But what is absolutely sure is that water transport will be cheaper, petrol supplies to the petroleum producers will be cheaper, wholesale repairing and servicing will be cheaper, sand will be cheaper, mining products will be cheaper, liquefied natural gas will be cheaper, and the plastic products associated with petroleum manufacturing will be cheaper. If you believe the Labor Party, petrol is delivered to each service station in a plastic bag—because under the Labor Party's rules, big business can keep all of the benefits of the introduction of the new taxation system. Under the Labor Party's rules, you screw the consumer.
The Labor Party have also raised the issue of honesty and integrity. I lay down this challenge to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are being honest with the Australian people, tell us what roll-back means. Tell us what it really means. Do not just react to every television camera and say, `We are so serious about rolling back fuel that we will have a good look at it.' Talk about squibbing. The Leader of the Opposition is not a squib, he is a squid. He has no backbone. The Leader of the Opposition talks about rollback. The Leader of the Opposition says, `We will have a serious look at caravan parks' and `We will have a serious look at boarding houses' and `We will have a serious look at the impact on housing.' `Oh, yes, we will look at that seriously,' says the Leader of the Opposition—so seriously that he will not make a commitment.
The only fact about the Labor Party is this: the Labor Party are hypocrites. They are arrogant hypocrites. They stand for nothing, they believe in nothing and they are deceiving the Australian people. They have a history of deceit when it comes to taxation. They have a history of deceit, and the worst part about it is that, as each day passes, we can identify the deceit in relation to the new taxation system.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the kingdom of Cambodia and the 20th General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation. The 20th General Assembly of AIPO was held in Manila, the Philippines, from 19 to 24 September 1999. The Australian delegation comprised me; the member for Swan; Mr Kim Wilkie, who is currently in Zimbabwe; and Senator Ross Lightfoot. Successive Australian delegations to AIPO have found it a valuable forum to initiate and develop good relations with countries in the South-East Asian region. This was the case for the 20th General Assembly. Full membership of AIPO is restricted to the members of ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations. In this respect, the 20th General Assembly of AIPO was significant because it saw Cambodia admitted to full membership. This followed Cambodia's admission to ASEAN in April 1999. Including Cambodia, ASEAN now comprises 10 member countries.
For the Australian delegation, Cambodia's admission to AIPO had added significance because it followed an official visit to Cambodia, from 13 to 18 September. The delegation's visit to Cambodia left us in no doubt that Cambodia is a country facing tremendous challenges. Years of conflict have taken their toll on the economic potential and social fabric of the country. Sadly, the problems continue. To this day landmines inflict harm and misery on an estimated 200 people a month. Even when medical services exist, it is often the case that poor roads prevent access to the services in sufficient time to be of any benefit. HIV-AIDS is endemic. Poverty is widespread, and corruption militates against economic development and prosperity. Despite these circumstances, we found the Cambodian people determined to overcome their adversity. We were heartened by comments made by Australian business representatives based in Phnom Penh. They suggested that there are real opportunities for those willing to invest and work in Cambodia. Similarly, we were encouraged by the development assistance being provided by various non-government organisations in Cambodia. We were made to feel welcome wherever we travelled. In our meetings with senior government and parliamentary representatives we found affection for Australia and gratitude for the way Australia has stood by Cambodia for many years.
The delegation's visit to Cambodia was the first from this parliament since 1996. On behalf of the Australian parliament, the delegation presented invitations to visit Australia to the President of the National Assembly, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and His Royal Highness Prince Sisowath Chivan Monirak, then Acting President of the Senate. I am advised that a Cambodian parliamentary delegation may visit Australia later this year. A highlight of this visit was an audience with the King of Cambodia, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. The audience with the king left no doubt as to the high regard in which Cambodia views Australia.
Before concluding my remarks, I would like to comment on the 20th General Assembly of AIPO. Australia's participation at AIPO is as an `observer nation'. This means attendance at some plenary sessions is precluded. However, observer status does require participation in dialogue sessions. Dialogue sessions provide an opportunity for AIPO member countries to direct questions to an observer nation delegation—a potentially daunting exercise for the observer nations. The timing of the 20th general assembly coincided with conflict in East Timor and announcements by the Australian government about Australia's response. This presented an uncertain and potentially difficult situation for the Australian delegation. I am pleased to say no difficulties were experienced. Perhaps to the contrary, we found a willingness to discuss issues amongst all AIPO nations and a generally positive attitude to Australia's role in the region. 
We found AIPO member nations had both a strong interest in Australia and a strong desire for Australian companies to invest in the region. Also of interest were education, trade opportunities and the sharing of information and technical expertise. Formal presentations and informal discussions suggested that countries in South-East Asia have renewed confidence following the problems associated with the Asian economic crisis. Keynote speeches highlighted the need for countries in South-East Asia to address cross-border issues in a cooperative fashion. A prime example is that of illicit drugs. From Australia's perspective, formal presentations provided an opportunity to reaffirm our long-term commitment to the region and our support for United Nations initiatives aimed at reducing the trafficking of people. Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to publicly recognise the support provided by His Excellency Dr Malcolm Leader, Australia's Ambassador to Cambodia; Ms Shennia Spillane, then First Secretary of Australia's Embassy in Phnom Penh; and His Excellency Mr John Buckley, Australia's Ambassador to the Philippines. I would also like to thank Trevor Rowe, who was the secretary accompanying the delegation, for the fantastic work he did in ensuring that this was a success for the delegation and for Australia. They all impressed us and have added greatly to Australia's contribution to South-East Asia.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's 16th report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—This report is being tabled as the result of a reference from the Senate on the compatibility of the amended Native Title Act with Australia's international legal obligations, in particular those arising under the CERD, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The reference was given on 9 December 1999. The committee was asked to inquire into and report on:
(a) whether the finding of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations in particular, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Of Racial Discrimination, is sustainable on the weight of informed opinion;
(b) what amendments are required to the Act, and what processes of consultation must be followed in effecting those amendments, to ensure that Australia's international obligations are complied with; and
(c) Whether dialogue with the CERD on the Act would assist in establishing a better-informed basis of the Act.
At the outset, on behalf of the committee I want to place on record our appreciation for the diligence, application, professionalism and sheer hard work of the committee secretariat. I refer to Mr Richard Selth, secretary, from 1 March 2000; Mr Peter Grundy, secretary, to 29 February 2000; Ms Anne De Soyza, principal research officer; Ms Suzanne Wood, senior research officer; Ms Rosalind McMahon, executive assistant; and Ms Bethwyn Morris, research assistant. I want particularly to make special mention of Anne De Soyza and Suzanne Wood, who have had the principal task of writing the report and without whom the work would simply not have been done. 
The parliamentary joint committee was, after an extensive inquiry, unable to come to a unanimous view on the issues referred to it. In my remarks I will be addressing the findings of the non-government members of the committee, which are contained within the dissenting report to that of the government members. In 1998, the CERD, which comprises a body of international law experts, decided that the amendments to the Native Title Act might not be compatible with Australia's obligations under the CERD. The CERD places an obligation on Australia to ensure racial equality or, conversely stated, to prohibit racial discrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The prohibition on racial discrimination—or the obligation to ensure racial equality—is enshrined in the CERD and it is a fundamental principle of international law.
Equality at international law requires Australia to ensure that its citizens enjoy substantive, real or actual equality in the enjoyment of their human rights. This means: (1) measures which are intended to address the disadvantage of a particular group; and/or (2) measures which are intended to protect the distinct culture or rights of a minority group. The original Native Title Act sought to provide a form of protection to native title that would take into account the unique nature of indigenous traditional title and its central importance in maintaining their distinct cultural identity. Of critical significance to the CERD committee was that the provisions of the original Native Title Act were seen to be implemented with the agreement of representatives of indigenous Australians, led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC.
In 1994 the CERD committee found that the original Native Title Act was consistent with Australia's obligations under the CERD, despite the fact that the original act continued some provisions which were adverse to indigenous interests. This was primarily because the original Native Title Act was enacted with the consent of indigenous representatives. One of the justifications advanced by the Commonwealth government for the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act was that the Native Title Act was `unworkable'. It was argued that the dearth of agreed determinations of native title and delays in the granting of mining and exploration tenements—which, it was alleged, were due to the right to negotiate procedure in the original act—were examples of the `unworkability' of the act.
However, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that these apparent problems with the Native Title Act can be directly linked to the bad faith of some state and territory governments in implementing the original act. The report of the non-government members shows how governments have, in the past, approached their obligations under the act with a view to deliberately creating a situation where the legislation was unworkable. Let it be clearly understood that no legislation is workable or effective in achieving its aims when there is a lack of commitment by governments to its implementation. Let it also be clearly understood that the non-government members of the committee have found, after considering the weight of informed opinion, that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is racially discriminatory. We are of the view that it is, as the CERD committee found, in breach of Australia's international obligations, in particular those obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The amendments to the Native Title Act were mainly discriminatory amendments in that they specifically targeted native title for extinguishment or suspension for the benefit of non-indigenous title holders and governments.
The CERD committee identified four sets of provisions of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 that discriminated against indigenous people. These provisions were: amendments to the rights to negotiate; the provisions which purported to `confirm' the extinguishment of native title; provisions which allowed for primary production `upgrades', essentially allowing for the expansion of the rights of those with grazing leases at the expense of native title holders; and provisions for the validation of acts done by government in breach of the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. 
The non-government members found in support of the CERD committee in relation to these issues and, in addition, have identified other provisions in the amended Native Title Act which have an adverse impact on the rights of native title holders. A matter of particular concern to the CERD committee was that, while the original act constituted agreement between the Commonwealth government and indigenous representatives, the largely discriminatory amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 were imposed on indigenous Australians. The non-government members have shown clearly that the Commonwealth government not only failed to secure the consent of the indigenous community to the amendments but never genuinely attempted to negotiate with indigenous Australians. This is a matter of grave concern to the non-government members, as it was to the CERD committee, which is of the view that at international law it is important that indigenous people are able to effectively participate in making decisions which affect their rights and that they give their informed consent to these decisions.
The requirement of effective participation and informed consent has also been identified in the non-government members' report as being of critical importance in framing legislation, or amendments to legislation, which affects the rights of indigenous peoples. All governments must be on notice that before legislating for changes that will impact on native title there is a fundamental requirement to negotiate with, and to obtain the informed consent of, the native title holders so affected. It is worth noting that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs came to grips with this issue in its unanimous report of August 1999 titled Unlocking the future: the report of the enquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The first and central recommendation of that report was:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (`the Act') not to be amended without:
traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their view.
That recommendation and the findings and recommendations of the non-government members on the native title committee provide a beacon, a signpost, as to where governments must head if they are to operate in a manner consistent with our international obligations in relation to the Native Title Act. The decision of the CERD should be a matter of concern to Australia, which has established itself as a leading member of the international community. The decision constitutes a warning to this country that it has committed an act of racial discrimination against the most disadvantaged group of it citizenry. The dissenting report of the non-government members on the committee makes 10 recommendations arising out of consideration of the issues in this inquiry. They are:
Recommendation 1
In the light of evidence presented to this Committee, the non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ... is an expert and independent body, competent to receive and consider complaints regarding violations of rights protected under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Recommendation 2
The non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that individuals and groups in Australia had, and still have, the right to bring to the attention of the CERD Committee alleged violations of Australia's undertakings as a signatory to the CERD, such as those inherent in both the substance of the amended Native Title Act and in the process through which it was drafted.
Recommendation 3
The non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that the evidence presented to this Committee clearly shows that the weight of informed opinion supports the finding of the CERD Committee, that the Native Title Act, as amended in 1998, conflicts with Australia's international legal obligations. The non-Government members also find, and recommended that the Government acknowledge, that the inconsistency of the Native Title Act with Australia's international legal obligations is a matter of fact. 
Recommendation 4
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in responding to court decisions and the practical experience of the operation of the Native Title Act across Australia, amend its substantive and procedural provisions to render the legislation non-discriminatory and consistent with Australia's international obligations.
Recommendation 5
The non-Government members find that the requirement to obtain the informed consent of Indigenous Australians to legislation affecting their rights is, as a matter of fact, an obligation under our international undertakings, and recommend that the Government, in amending the Native Title Act, do so through a process of negotiation with Australia's indigenous peoples with the aim of gaining their informed consent to any such amendments, and to the amended Act as a whole.
Recommendation 6
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in amending the Native Title Act, implement uniform, decent and enforceable national standards for dealing with native title, consistent with the Commonwealth's responsibility for the protection of the rights of Australia's Indigenous peoples. They further recommended that these standards be applied to any State native title regime presented to the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Parliament for approval under the present Native Title Act.
Recommendation 7
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in acknowledging the Native Title Act as simply one of many legislative or administrative instruments that have the potential to impinge on the rights of Australia's indigenous peoples, apply the principles underpinning its international and constitutional obligations to the drafting of any statutory instruments or administrative procedures that have any such effect.
Recommendation 8
The non-Government members acknowledge that native title, as recognised by Australian common law and as dealt with in statute, is capable of, and is vulnerable to, extinguishment. They contrast this with the fact that extant traditional title emerging from, and contained within, the laws and customs of indigenous Australians remains for so long as those people and their beliefs survive. They therefore recommend that the Government enact legislation that recognises and respects that fact, irrespective of findings that courts may make from time to time.
Recommendation 9
The non-Government members recommend that the Government acknowledge that its native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time as a part of the process for a lasting settlement or accord between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
Recommendation 10
The non-Government members of the committee recommend that the Government, consistent with its obligation to protect Australia's international reputation, desist from any attacks on UN expert bodies, and renew positive dialogue with them on a range of matters, including Australia's native title legislation.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—This report, framed, written and tabled here in accordance with the statutory responsibilities of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, marks a significant advance in the understanding of the relationship between Australia's domestic legislation and administrative procedures dealing with indigenous rights and the framework of relevant international law and treaties to which Australia is a signatory. The report of the non-government members upholds the findings of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 was developed in a manner, and contained provisions, inconsistent with Australia's international legal obligations. 
The fact that the non-government members of the joint committee have been unable to present a report based on consensus with the government members is regrettable but not surprising. The Howard government have publicly rejected the CERD committee's findings and have attempted to systematically undermine public confidence in the competence and independence of that body. One can see a pattern in the government's approach to dealing with potential criticism. We remember well their attempts to discredit Sir Ronald Wilson and his report on the stolen generations. They started that campaign even before that report was handed down. It was an easy leap to later deny that such a generation even existed.  
This reveals a disinclination of the government to take on board the pressing social issues of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians resulting from our history. Both the complexity of the issues and the impetus to timely and compassionate action are beyond them. Instead, they prefer to discredit the bodies which try to represent these social justice and human rights concerns in a thorough and measured way. Of course, responding to these issues entails developing a process to deal with them. Governments are under enormous pressure to state that they have all the answers. To prove to people that they do have all the answers means that a quick fix is put in place. Quick fixes almost never work. We continually go back to the same issue instead of moving ahead.
This report of the non-government members shows that the amendments to the Native Title Act are racially discriminatory and a breach of Australia's international obligations. The report refers to discrimination in relation to various issues such as the validation provisions, confirmation of extinguishment provisions and the right to negotiate provisions. The report also provides an understanding of traditional title as opposed to native title. Native title is vulnerable to extinguishment and governments can attempt to extinguish native title in the courts. Traditional title emerges from the laws and customs of indigenous Australians and remains so long as indigenous people and their beliefs survive. This report of the non-government members recommends that the government not only respect that fact but enact legislation in recognition of it. 
The member for the Northern Territory has read the recommendations of the non-government members to the chamber. However, it is important for the government to come to grips with what this report stands for. The government must comprehend that this report puts to bed their obstinate argument that their amendments to the Native Title Act provide a solution to native title in this country. The original Native Title Act was always going to be continually refined in response to developments in case law and practical difficulties in implementing legislation. It was also designed to put a stop to the adversarial nature of native title conflicts by forming a framework for negotiating native title matters between parties in a simple and cost-effective manner. As we have seen, the Howard government's Wik amendments resulted in the return to an adversarial and divisive debate on native title in this country. This has not contributed to resolving native title issues across Australia. It has not helped reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians so desperately wanted by the people of this country, as shown so vividly over the past months through the reconciliation marches in capital cities.
We have seen what this quick fix has resulted in. It has resulted in a division between black and white over indigenous issues and a setback to reconciliation. It has resulted in attempts to discredit a reputable international body of experts such as the CERD committee in a way that has been praised by countries which, it could be said, are not the holders of an enviable human rights record. It has resulted in the shaming of Australia's international reputation and the validation of extinguishment in a manner that is not only legally risky but is without informed consent.
The report of the non-government members offers the opportunity to put a stop to this division and dissent. It draws on evidence given by a range of experts and its recommendations provide a blueprint for this and future governments to proceed with indigenous native title rights. I draw attention to recommendation 9 in the report at page 95, which states:
The non-Government members recommend that the Government acknowledge that its native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time as a part of the process for a lasting settlement or accord between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians. 
Let the government acknowledge that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is racially discriminatory and results in a significant setback to indigenous rights in Australia. Then let us work on ways to amend the legislation through genuine consultation with all stakeholders and with the informed consent and acceptance of all the legislative and procedural outcomes.
This report has uncovered substantial and authoritative criticism of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. This report attempts to present a blueprint for the government of the day. It is not a partisan document but is designed to enable us to break out of the repeated cycles of the native title debate. Let us close this destructive debate on the existence and extent of native title in this country and move on to working as a nation for improvements in indigenous wellbeing, as well as improvements in relations between black and white, by adopting this report's recommendations and framing a flexible process open to continued dialogue. Undertakings freely given by the national government should be honoured. Australia has international obligations to protect indigenous rights and should do so.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I thank the honourable member and the chair for the opportunity to comment on this report, although briefly. Let me first say that the government welcomes the 16th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Land Fund, on this occasion entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. In accordance with the usual practice relating to parliamentary committee reports, the government will carefully consider the committee's report. Accordingly, while I will not be delivering a formal government response to the committee's report today, I will make some brief points about the issues raised.
Having served on many parliamentary committees, I am familiar with the way in which they operate.  It is of interest to me to see the committee report with a substantial dissent, in this case by non-government members, and to see the comments from the committee being largely at this point in relation to the dissent rather than a report on the committee's view as concluded.  Therefore, I feel I emboldened to read what the committee had to find. Page 54 of the report says:
The amended Native Title Act strikes a balance between native title interests and other interests. It provides protection to native title that is at least the equivalent of the protection provided to comparable non-Indigenous interests, and provides significant benefits to native title holders which non-Indigenous title holders do not enjoy.
In relation to the four contentious sets of provisions, the Government acted to balance competing interests and to provide certainty. The amendments do not breach the Government's obligations for a range of reasons, including the fact that they are within the Government's margin of appreciation, that there is little or no impact on native title and that there are countervailing beneficial measures for any effect these provisions have on native title, including compensation.
Prior to Wik, the assumption that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished native title was valid, and informed the drafting of the  Native Title Act. The Commonwealth, States and Territories acted on the balance of legal opinion on the state of the common law regarding extinguishment. In the light of the Wik decision, however, steps had to be taken to resolve the uncertainty created by the fact that the original Act had not addressed the possible existence of native title on pastoral leases. The amendments introduced to address this issue were appropriate and reasonable and more limited in scope than the  related provisions in the original Act.
I think that is a balanced and sensible conclusion for the committee to reach. It is one which we as a government think reflects the real position. In 1998, the government made amendments to the Native Title Act which were necessary to deal with a number of practical issues arising out of court decisions, such as the High Court's decisions in Wik and Brandy. In particular, the uncertainty that was created by Wik in relation to pastoral leases needed to be addressed. It would not have mattered who was in office—those issues needed to be addressed. 
The government engaged in very extensive consultation on the amendments with major stakeholders, including indigenous people. Australia has a very strongly democratic system which enables all of its citizens, regardless of race, to participate in political life. Indigenous people can and do participate fully in the political and cultural life of our nation. This is what the CERD convention requires. Mention has been made of the CERD committee. On behalf of the Australian government, I led a delegation to that committee to put our report in relation to issues arising out of the need to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. I spoke very comprehensively about a range of issues relating to programs that we put in place to create living in harmony and to address racial discrimination where it might be evident in the Australian community. I talked about the native title legislation. I talked about our legislation dealing with racial discrimination and the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to those matters.
I also had to explain to them—this is an expert body, but it had very little understanding of the nature of the Australian federation—the way in which our democratic system works. In a sense, if you look at some of the countries that these people, as experts, come from, it would be fair to conclude that they may have had little experience with democratic institutions. When you have experts from Cuba, for instance, telling you about democratic institutions and how they should operate, you start to have some question marks over the process. As one who had to respond to the questions that were asked, I have to say that people who come together a couple of times a year for several weeks to receive reports from a whole range of countries regardless of their expertise need to put a lot of work into getting up to and addressing these sorts of issues. I have to say, quite frankly, the system does not provide for that to occur. Many of the people who are involved in it are admirable people. I met them and had an opportunity to engage and talk to them. But in terms of dealing with these issues in relation to amendments to the Native Title Act, I do not believe the committee was in a position to put and develop an informed—and I use the word `informed' advisedly—view about whether or not Australia was in breach of its obligations under the convention.
Clearly, we take advice in relation to these matters. All the advice that we had as a government from the government's legal advisers in these matters was that the Native Title Act, when looked at as a whole, continues to provide significant benefits to native title holders and that the amended Native Title Act achieves a successful and appropriate balance between competing interests. You cannot look at it in part; you have to look at in whole. What it delivers are positive advantages, overall, to native title claimants. The government has previously addressed the issues concerning the parliamentary joint committee and its inquiry before the CERD committee and we maintain our position in relation to the CERD committee's findings in 1998. That is, we consider that the committee's report is unbalanced and is a wide ranging attack that intrudes unreasonably into Australia's internal affairs. We consider that the CERD committee failed to consider the Native Title Act as a whole and focused on the amendments in isolation. We are well aware of our obligations under the convention. We take our deliberations in relation to these matters—the role of the parliamentary committee as well as the CERD—very seriously. This is demonstrated by the fact that we have made extensive submissions to and appeared before the committee as well as the CERD committee. As I mentioned earlier, the high level delegation to attend the hearings of the committees dealing with Australia's periodic reports was further evidence of the seriousness with which we undertake these measures.
I was interested in the way in which the report of the opposition members of the committee dealt with the issue of where we ought to go in the future, because it raised the very important question that Laurie Oakes raised when he interviewed the honourable member for Banks. That is, if we are dealing with legislation which the opposition in principle believes is racially discriminatory, what is the opposition going to do about it? I have read the conclusions that the honourable member for Northern Territory read to us, and I still do not find it. What we find is that there is a view that there should be `further discussions'. I do not know what those discussions mean, and I guess we will probably raise some of these questions when we look at the report more comprehensively. But when you put whatever amendments you might have in mind in an environment in which one group of people are essentially—it appears to me—going to have a very significant role `through a process of negotiation with Australia's indigenous peoples with an aim of gaining their informed consent to any amendments and to the amended act as a whole', is that a veto? Does that mean that the opposition is saying, `We will only propose amendments that are acceptable to indigenous people'? Is that what you are saying? Or are you saying that if we can't get amendments that are acceptable to indigenous people, then the present act will stay? Is that what you are saying? 
I think the opposition still has a long way to go in terms of articulating its position if it is really thinking about these issues in the context of ever being a government. The hard work of policy development means that you have to sit down. You have sat down and drafted a report. It covers a lot of ground, but at end of the day it does not reach any conclusions about how the hard issues are going to be addressed. That is the reality of it. You are not informing the public as to the proposals that you have in mind. What you are wanting to do is to leave it vague, to leave indigenous people believing that they are going to have sway in relation to the way in which these matters might be addressed. But if they do not get their way, then it is quite clear that the only outcome you have got left is the law as it is at the moment. If you have another view, you should tell us. It is the same as it is in relation to the position relating to the Queensland delegated legislation in relation to native title. Are you intending to disallow that measure? If you are serious about being a government, you have to reach some conclusions about these matters. These issues are complex, they are unique and they are difficult—and we recognise that.
We do not want to reopen a divisive debate in relation to these matters, but all Australians are entitled to know whether the opposition is of the view that the uncertainty on native title issues had to be addressed and whether the approaches which the government has taken were reasonable or unreasonable. If you are of the view that they are unreasonable—as you seem to be in this minority, or opposition, report—we need to know what you propose as an alternative. We do not have that before us in the document that you have outlined. That is really the beginning and the end of the substantial issue. This government remains committed to fostering healthy and productive relationships between all Australians, of all racial backgrounds. The government is committed to achieving a lasting reconciliation with indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, but we believe that these issues can be most effectively addressed by having a constructive discussion, by putting forward practical amendments which involve reaching conclusions after extensive consultations. We do not think it is appropriate to reopen the divisive debate on native title that we had before. We are, I would suggest, disappointed that this is not a unanimous report in favour of the conclusion that is outlined as the majority view on page 54.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title>,Committees,27,1

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's 16th report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—This report is being tabled as the result of a reference from the Senate on the compatibility of the amended Native Title Act with Australia's international legal obligations, in particular those arising under the CERD, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The reference was given on 9 December 1999. The committee was asked to inquire into and report on:
(a) whether the finding of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations in particular, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Of Racial Discrimination, is sustainable on the weight of informed opinion;
(b) what amendments are required to the Act, and what processes of consultation must be followed in effecting those amendments, to ensure that Australia's international obligations are complied with; and
(c) Whether dialogue with the CERD on the Act would assist in establishing a better-informed basis of the Act.
At the outset, on behalf of the committee I want to place on record our appreciation for the diligence, application, professionalism and sheer hard work of the committee secretariat. I refer to Mr Richard Selth, secretary, from 1 March 2000; Mr Peter Grundy, secretary, to 29 February 2000; Ms Anne De Soyza, principal research officer; Ms Suzanne Wood, senior research officer; Ms Rosalind McMahon, executive assistant; and Ms Bethwyn Morris, research assistant. I want particularly to make special mention of Anne De Soyza and Suzanne Wood, who have had the principal task of writing the report and without whom the work would simply not have been done. 
The parliamentary joint committee was, after an extensive inquiry, unable to come to a unanimous view on the issues referred to it. In my remarks I will be addressing the findings of the non-government members of the committee, which are contained within the dissenting report to that of the government members. In 1998, the CERD, which comprises a body of international law experts, decided that the amendments to the Native Title Act might not be compatible with Australia's obligations under the CERD. The CERD places an obligation on Australia to ensure racial equality or, conversely stated, to prohibit racial discrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The prohibition on racial discrimination—or the obligation to ensure racial equality—is enshrined in the CERD and it is a fundamental principle of international law.
Equality at international law requires Australia to ensure that its citizens enjoy substantive, real or actual equality in the enjoyment of their human rights. This means: (1) measures which are intended to address the disadvantage of a particular group; and/or (2) measures which are intended to protect the distinct culture or rights of a minority group. The original Native Title Act sought to provide a form of protection to native title that would take into account the unique nature of indigenous traditional title and its central importance in maintaining their distinct cultural identity. Of critical significance to the CERD committee was that the provisions of the original Native Title Act were seen to be implemented with the agreement of representatives of indigenous Australians, led by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC.
In 1994 the CERD committee found that the original Native Title Act was consistent with Australia's obligations under the CERD, despite the fact that the original act continued some provisions which were adverse to indigenous interests. This was primarily because the original Native Title Act was enacted with the consent of indigenous representatives. One of the justifications advanced by the Commonwealth government for the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act was that the Native Title Act was `unworkable'. It was argued that the dearth of agreed determinations of native title and delays in the granting of mining and exploration tenements—which, it was alleged, were due to the right to negotiate procedure in the original act—were examples of the `unworkability' of the act.
However, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that these apparent problems with the Native Title Act can be directly linked to the bad faith of some state and territory governments in implementing the original act. The report of the non-government members shows how governments have, in the past, approached their obligations under the act with a view to deliberately creating a situation where the legislation was unworkable. Let it be clearly understood that no legislation is workable or effective in achieving its aims when there is a lack of commitment by governments to its implementation. Let it also be clearly understood that the non-government members of the committee have found, after considering the weight of informed opinion, that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is racially discriminatory. We are of the view that it is, as the CERD committee found, in breach of Australia's international obligations, in particular those obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The amendments to the Native Title Act were mainly discriminatory amendments in that they specifically targeted native title for extinguishment or suspension for the benefit of non-indigenous title holders and governments.
The CERD committee identified four sets of provisions of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 that discriminated against indigenous people. These provisions were: amendments to the rights to negotiate; the provisions which purported to `confirm' the extinguishment of native title; provisions which allowed for primary production `upgrades', essentially allowing for the expansion of the rights of those with grazing leases at the expense of native title holders; and provisions for the validation of acts done by government in breach of the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. 
The non-government members found in support of the CERD committee in relation to these issues and, in addition, have identified other provisions in the amended Native Title Act which have an adverse impact on the rights of native title holders. A matter of particular concern to the CERD committee was that, while the original act constituted agreement between the Commonwealth government and indigenous representatives, the largely discriminatory amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998 were imposed on indigenous Australians. The non-government members have shown clearly that the Commonwealth government not only failed to secure the consent of the indigenous community to the amendments but never genuinely attempted to negotiate with indigenous Australians. This is a matter of grave concern to the non-government members, as it was to the CERD committee, which is of the view that at international law it is important that indigenous people are able to effectively participate in making decisions which affect their rights and that they give their informed consent to these decisions.
The requirement of effective participation and informed consent has also been identified in the non-government members' report as being of critical importance in framing legislation, or amendments to legislation, which affects the rights of indigenous peoples. All governments must be on notice that before legislating for changes that will impact on native title there is a fundamental requirement to negotiate with, and to obtain the informed consent of, the native title holders so affected. It is worth noting that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs came to grips with this issue in its unanimous report of August 1999 titled Unlocking the future: the report of the enquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The first and central recommendation of that report was:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (`the Act') not to be amended without:
traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their view.
That recommendation and the findings and recommendations of the non-government members on the native title committee provide a beacon, a signpost, as to where governments must head if they are to operate in a manner consistent with our international obligations in relation to the Native Title Act. The decision of the CERD should be a matter of concern to Australia, which has established itself as a leading member of the international community. The decision constitutes a warning to this country that it has committed an act of racial discrimination against the most disadvantaged group of it citizenry. The dissenting report of the non-government members on the committee makes 10 recommendations arising out of consideration of the issues in this inquiry. They are:
Recommendation 1
In the light of evidence presented to this Committee, the non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ... is an expert and independent body, competent to receive and consider complaints regarding violations of rights protected under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Recommendation 2
The non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that individuals and groups in Australia had, and still have, the right to bring to the attention of the CERD Committee alleged violations of Australia's undertakings as a signatory to the CERD, such as those inherent in both the substance of the amended Native Title Act and in the process through which it was drafted.
Recommendation 3
The non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that the evidence presented to this Committee clearly shows that the weight of informed opinion supports the finding of the CERD Committee, that the Native Title Act, as amended in 1998, conflicts with Australia's international legal obligations. The non-Government members also find, and recommended that the Government acknowledge, that the inconsistency of the Native Title Act with Australia's international legal obligations is a matter of fact. 
Recommendation 4
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in responding to court decisions and the practical experience of the operation of the Native Title Act across Australia, amend its substantive and procedural provisions to render the legislation non-discriminatory and consistent with Australia's international obligations.
Recommendation 5
The non-Government members find that the requirement to obtain the informed consent of Indigenous Australians to legislation affecting their rights is, as a matter of fact, an obligation under our international undertakings, and recommend that the Government, in amending the Native Title Act, do so through a process of negotiation with Australia's indigenous peoples with the aim of gaining their informed consent to any such amendments, and to the amended Act as a whole.
Recommendation 6
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in amending the Native Title Act, implement uniform, decent and enforceable national standards for dealing with native title, consistent with the Commonwealth's responsibility for the protection of the rights of Australia's Indigenous peoples. They further recommended that these standards be applied to any State native title regime presented to the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Parliament for approval under the present Native Title Act.
Recommendation 7
The non-Government members recommend that the Government, in acknowledging the Native Title Act as simply one of many legislative or administrative instruments that have the potential to impinge on the rights of Australia's indigenous peoples, apply the principles underpinning its international and constitutional obligations to the drafting of any statutory instruments or administrative procedures that have any such effect.
Recommendation 8
The non-Government members acknowledge that native title, as recognised by Australian common law and as dealt with in statute, is capable of, and is vulnerable to, extinguishment. They contrast this with the fact that extant traditional title emerging from, and contained within, the laws and customs of indigenous Australians remains for so long as those people and their beliefs survive. They therefore recommend that the Government enact legislation that recognises and respects that fact, irrespective of findings that courts may make from time to time.
Recommendation 9
The non-Government members recommend that the Government acknowledge that its native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time as a part of the process for a lasting settlement or accord between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
Recommendation 10
The non-Government members of the committee recommend that the Government, consistent with its obligation to protect Australia's international reputation, desist from any attacks on UN expert bodies, and renew positive dialogue with them on a range of matters, including Australia's native title legislation.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—This report, framed, written and tabled here in accordance with the statutory responsibilities of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, marks a significant advance in the understanding of the relationship between Australia's domestic legislation and administrative procedures dealing with indigenous rights and the framework of relevant international law and treaties to which Australia is a signatory. The report of the non-government members upholds the findings of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 was developed in a manner, and contained provisions, inconsistent with Australia's international legal obligations. 
The fact that the non-government members of the joint committee have been unable to present a report based on consensus with the government members is regrettable but not surprising. The Howard government have publicly rejected the CERD committee's findings and have attempted to systematically undermine public confidence in the competence and independence of that body. One can see a pattern in the government's approach to dealing with potential criticism. We remember well their attempts to discredit Sir Ronald Wilson and his report on the stolen generations. They started that campaign even before that report was handed down. It was an easy leap to later deny that such a generation even existed.  
This reveals a disinclination of the government to take on board the pressing social issues of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians resulting from our history. Both the complexity of the issues and the impetus to timely and compassionate action are beyond them. Instead, they prefer to discredit the bodies which try to represent these social justice and human rights concerns in a thorough and measured way. Of course, responding to these issues entails developing a process to deal with them. Governments are under enormous pressure to state that they have all the answers. To prove to people that they do have all the answers means that a quick fix is put in place. Quick fixes almost never work. We continually go back to the same issue instead of moving ahead.
This report of the non-government members shows that the amendments to the Native Title Act are racially discriminatory and a breach of Australia's international obligations. The report refers to discrimination in relation to various issues such as the validation provisions, confirmation of extinguishment provisions and the right to negotiate provisions. The report also provides an understanding of traditional title as opposed to native title. Native title is vulnerable to extinguishment and governments can attempt to extinguish native title in the courts. Traditional title emerges from the laws and customs of indigenous Australians and remains so long as indigenous people and their beliefs survive. This report of the non-government members recommends that the government not only respect that fact but enact legislation in recognition of it. 
The member for the Northern Territory has read the recommendations of the non-government members to the chamber. However, it is important for the government to come to grips with what this report stands for. The government must comprehend that this report puts to bed their obstinate argument that their amendments to the Native Title Act provide a solution to native title in this country. The original Native Title Act was always going to be continually refined in response to developments in case law and practical difficulties in implementing legislation. It was also designed to put a stop to the adversarial nature of native title conflicts by forming a framework for negotiating native title matters between parties in a simple and cost-effective manner. As we have seen, the Howard government's Wik amendments resulted in the return to an adversarial and divisive debate on native title in this country. This has not contributed to resolving native title issues across Australia. It has not helped reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians so desperately wanted by the people of this country, as shown so vividly over the past months through the reconciliation marches in capital cities.
We have seen what this quick fix has resulted in. It has resulted in a division between black and white over indigenous issues and a setback to reconciliation. It has resulted in attempts to discredit a reputable international body of experts such as the CERD committee in a way that has been praised by countries which, it could be said, are not the holders of an enviable human rights record. It has resulted in the shaming of Australia's international reputation and the validation of extinguishment in a manner that is not only legally risky but is without informed consent.
The report of the non-government members offers the opportunity to put a stop to this division and dissent. It draws on evidence given by a range of experts and its recommendations provide a blueprint for this and future governments to proceed with indigenous native title rights. I draw attention to recommendation 9 in the report at page 95, which states:
The non-Government members recommend that the Government acknowledge that its native title legislation is only one early element of a range of instruments to be drafted over time as a part of the process for a lasting settlement or accord between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians. 
Let the government acknowledge that the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 is racially discriminatory and results in a significant setback to indigenous rights in Australia. Then let us work on ways to amend the legislation through genuine consultation with all stakeholders and with the informed consent and acceptance of all the legislative and procedural outcomes.
This report has uncovered substantial and authoritative criticism of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. This report attempts to present a blueprint for the government of the day. It is not a partisan document but is designed to enable us to break out of the repeated cycles of the native title debate. Let us close this destructive debate on the existence and extent of native title in this country and move on to working as a nation for improvements in indigenous wellbeing, as well as improvements in relations between black and white, by adopting this report's recommendations and framing a flexible process open to continued dialogue. Undertakings freely given by the national government should be honoured. Australia has international obligations to protect indigenous rights and should do so.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I thank the honourable member and the chair for the opportunity to comment on this report, although briefly. Let me first say that the government welcomes the 16th report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Land Fund, on this occasion entitled CERD and the Native Title Amendment Act 1998. In accordance with the usual practice relating to parliamentary committee reports, the government will carefully consider the committee's report. Accordingly, while I will not be delivering a formal government response to the committee's report today, I will make some brief points about the issues raised.
Having served on many parliamentary committees, I am familiar with the way in which they operate.  It is of interest to me to see the committee report with a substantial dissent, in this case by non-government members, and to see the comments from the committee being largely at this point in relation to the dissent rather than a report on the committee's view as concluded.  Therefore, I feel I emboldened to read what the committee had to find. Page 54 of the report says:
The amended Native Title Act strikes a balance between native title interests and other interests. It provides protection to native title that is at least the equivalent of the protection provided to comparable non-Indigenous interests, and provides significant benefits to native title holders which non-Indigenous title holders do not enjoy.

I talked about our legislation dealing with racial discrimination and the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to those matters.
I also had to explain to them—this is an expert body, but it had very little understanding of the nature of the Australian federation—the way in which our democratic system works. In a sense, if you look at some of the countries that these people, as experts, come from, it would be fair to conclude that they may have had little experience with democratic institutions. When you have experts from Cuba, for instance, telling you about democratic institutions and how they should operate, you start to have some question marks over the process. As one who had to respond to the questions that were asked, I have to say that people who come together a couple of times a year for several weeks to receive reports from a whole range of countries regardless of their expertise need to put a lot of work into getting up to and addressing these sorts of issues. I have to say, quite frankly, the system does not provide for that to occur. Many of the people who are involved in it are admirable people. I met them and had an opportunity to engage and talk to them. But in terms of dealing with these issues in relation to amendments to the Native Title Act, I do not believe the committee was in a position to put and develop an informed—and I use the word `informed' advisedly—view about whether or not Australia was in breach of its obligations under the convention.

You cannot look at it in part; you have to look at in whole. What it delivers are positive advantages, overall, to native title claimants. The government has previously addressed the issues concerning the parliamentary joint committee and its inquiry before the CERD committee and we maintain our position in relation to the CERD committee's findings in 1998. That is, we consider that the committee's report is unbalanced and is a wide ranging attack that intrudes unreasonably into Australia's internal affairs. We consider that the CERD committee failed to consider the Native Title Act as a whole and focused on the amendments in isolation. We are well aware of our obligations under the convention. We take our deliberations in relation to these matters—the role of the parliamentary committee as well as the CERD—very seriously. This is demonstrated by the fact that we have made extensive submissions to and appeared before the committee as well as the CERD committee.

I do not know what those discussions mean, and I guess we will probably raise some of these questions when we look at the report more comprehensively. But when you put whatever amendments you might have in mind in an environment in which one group of people are essentially—it appears to me—going to have a very significant role `through a process of negotiation with Australia's indigenous peoples with an aim of gaining their informed consent to any amendments and to the amended act as a whole', is that a veto? Does that mean that the opposition is saying, `We will only propose amendments that are acceptable to indigenous people'? Is that what you are saying? Or are you saying that if we can't get amendments that are acceptable to indigenous people, then the present act will stay? Is that what you are saying? 
I think the opposition still has a long way to go in terms of articulating its position if it is really thinking about these issues in the context of ever being a government. The hard work of policy development means that you have to sit down. You have sat down and drafted a report. It covers a lot of ground, but at end of the day it does not reach any conclusions about how the hard issues are going to be addressed. That is the reality of it. You are not informing the public as to the proposals that you have in mind. What you are wanting to do is to leave it vague, to leave indigenous people believing that they are going to have sway in relation to the way in which these matters might be addressed. But if they do not get their way, then it is quite clear that the only outcome you have got left is the law as it is at the moment. If you have another view, you should tell us. It is the same as it is in relation to the position relating to the Queensland delegated legislation in relation to native title. Are you intending to disallow that measure? If you are serious about being a government, you have to reach some conclusions about these matters. These issues are complex, they are unique and they are difficult—and we recognise that.
We do not want to reopen a divisive debate in relation to these matters, but all Australians are entitled to know whether the opposition is of the view that the uncertainty on native title issues had to be addressed and whether the approaches which the government has taken were reasonable or unreasonable. If you are of the view that they are unreasonable—as you seem to be in this minority, or opposition, report—we need to know what you propose as an alternative. We do not have that before us in the document that you have outlined. That is really the beginning and the end of the substantial issue. This government remains committed to fostering healthy and productive relationships between all Australians, of all racial backgrounds. The government is committed to achieving a lasting reconciliation with indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, but we believe that these issues can be most effectively addressed by having a constructive discussion, by putting forward practical amendments which involve reaching conclusions after extensive consultations. We do not think it is appropriate to reopen the divisive debate on native title that we had before. We are, I would suggest, disappointed that this is not a unanimous report in favour of the conclusion that is outlined as the majority view on page 54.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2

"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2000-06-28,"—It is a great pity that the conclusion of this debate did not happen before question time because we would then have had the honour of having the member for Lilley and the member for Grayndler, who were making such outrageous statements to the House, present in the chamber when we replied. In my 16 years in politics, between the New South Wales parliament and the federal parliament, rarely have I seen such an action by an opposition designed purely to scare vulnerable people. There is no doubt that these people, who are mostly old and frail in retirement, do feel very vulnerable. They are being used by the Labor opposition for political means. It is a great pity. It is probably the second time that we have seen this from the opposition. We all remember the nursing homes saga where, again, the government tried to address a particular issue and all the opposition wanted to do was to score political points and scare vulnerable people. This is another example of what it will do to try and get some political advantage. 
We can remember in a discussion of a matter of public importance—I do not want to go over too many of the issues that were raised last week—that the member for Grayndler and the member for Lilley were canvassing, yet again, some of the issues that they were putting forward. We now have the infamous photograph which was in the Tweed daily paper where the member for Grayndler, the member for Lilley and others tried to get some political advantage out of a situation such as this and were not telling the full truth; they were just using some of the truth. They were posing as residents. They claimed to be residents in the photograph, but not until it was revealed later—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. At no time did the honourable members referred to claim to be residents.
 (Mr Andrews)—Order! That is no point of order.
—I indicate to the honourable member for Paterson that in the newspaper there was no indication as to who the people were in the photograph. They all claimed to be angry park residents. We now know they were not. This was a deliberately orchestrated event. When you look at the photograph you see some two or three dozen people. There were at least five or six that we know are directly linked with the Labor Party and we suspect there were other members of the Labor Party within that group—one in particular being a person who has been up there trying to gain Labor Party preselection for the seat of Richmond and who used to work for the honourable member for Grayndler. I suppose she was trying to claim that somehow, at election time, she will be a local, but of course she was just trying to use this issue.
The honourable member for Lilley also mentioned that he had spoken to some caravan park owners who also believed the situation was unfair. It is in the hands of the caravan park owners to do something about. It is completely flexible. It is a choice that they can make. I know of some park owners who have clearly identified the areas of their parks that have these long-term mobile park owners on them where they do not have any input costs. In fact, the electricity, the water and the other services are paid for by the owners of the dwellings. They are clearly not going to charge GST on that section of their park. They do not have any input costs in that section and they are not going to charge GST. Quite frankly, I have never seen any hard evidence to suggest that someone has come forward as a park owner and said, `We are going to charge this GST.' It has all been speculation. It has been speculation by the member for Grayndler.
We know the member for Grayndler is a very active member of parliament and he has spent a lot of time on the North Coast. I am sure the honourable member for Paterson would have been witness yesterday to how active the member for Grayndler was. Of course, the member for Grayndler has been stacking branches around Sydney for some years. Attempts by the left-wing faction to overpower the right-wing faction all boiled to the surface yesterday when the deputy leader of the party had to make them toe the line. The member for Grayndler is very reactive in these areas and he is showing his skills. He tries to manipulate, and he is trying to manipulate this particular process. 
As I said in the debate last week, the member for Grayndler shows no knowledge of the complexity of these parks. Members of the government have been aware for some time of some concerns in this area; but it is the complexity that makes it difficult. The mix in these caravan parks makes this issue very difficult to address. I think that there is no doubt that many caravan park owners are trying—again, as I say, there is no evidence that they are not—to come to terms with how they address their short-term residents and their long-term residents. Of course, there is a lot of competition in this particular area, so people will soon come to know which park owners are treating their residents correctly and which are not. It is a very competitive area along the coast of New South Wales. While it would be difficult for people already in those areas to change, anyone new arriving would be able to choose a park where those fees were not applied.
I want to associate myself with the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000, because I think it is a very good outcome. I want to clearly say, too—as the National Party has been attacked on several occasions by the speakers opposite—that, if this issue had not been raised so strongly at the National Party conference, the Democrats would never have blinked. They knew all about it. They knew about it for months and months and months but, unless the concerns of these residents had been raised strongly by the member for Richmond and other members of the National Party, this issue would never have surfaced, because the Democrats only blinked when it became an issue. So, rather than criticise the member for Richmond,  I think the residents in that area should thank him very much for speaking up about this concern, despite his being a government minister, which makes it very difficult for him to raise issues such as this.
The Prime Minister has always been sympathetic to this issue. He has looked very closely at it on several occasions. His considered opinion has always been that it is fair. If you look at the complexity of it, it is; there is no doubt about it. Yet, when you get this knee-jerk reaction from the Labor Party, you start to see how they do not understand the complexity of it. It has been clearly shown that, if you deny the park owners the right to claim back their input costs, the rents will rise anyway. There are no free lunches in this world, unfortunately. If there are extra costs on the owners of these parks, they are passed on. I am pleased to see the member for Grayndler returning, because I really did want him to hear some of the things that I have to say. Maybe we can educate him on some of these areas. The particular issues involved here—
—Listen to your own party.
—The member for Grayndler used this debate to try to ridicule the government on some of the inputs that park owners can claim back. He does not understand, of course, the differences in some areas. In fact, in some of the mobile park homes people rent the entire house. They do not just bring their own house and put it on a block and pay the rent for the block; they rent the whole house. Of course there are input costs involved there. As I said, you have to understand the complexities of this. There is a whole range of people who live in this type of accommodation.
—We have seen the flexibility of the member for Grayndler. I am sure that people opposite understand that he is misinterpreting some of these areas.
—We have the chatterer over here, again. She cannot help herself. She has to come in here and chatter away innocuously about it. As I said, the member for Grayndler has been trying to impugn the National Party on this particular issue by putting across to us that we should support the amendment that he has put forward because it is National Party policy.
—That is right.
—I have had people try to put words into my mouth before, but I am certainly not going to accept what the honourable member for Grayndler says on this issue. Quite frankly, the amendment is nowhere near National Party policy. What you are trying to do will in fact increase the costs on these particular people, and we want nothing to do with that. What the government is giving is an increase in rent assistance, which we applaud, because obviously these people need this particular support and it would help them. 
—How many will get it—25 per cent?
—Of course, the member for Paterson and his colleagues are one-eyed: they have very narrow vision and do not look at the broader picture. They do not want to because it does not suit their argument. Let us look at the increase in pensions and the support that has been given to superannuants in the ANTS package. We should all recall that in the original ANTS package these payments given to the pensioners and superannuants were calculated on the basis that there would be a 10 per cent GST on food. But that had to be changed because of the deal with the Democrats. One thing that the Labor Party will never accept is that, if they had been responsible to the nation, looked at the original package and accepted that it was better for Australia—instead of just taking this absolutely negative, opposing position—we would not have this additional complication in the tax. Nevertheless, because of the agreement with the Democrats, the allowances calculated in the original tax package have not been reduced. The pensioners and superannuants will still get the payments that were in the original package—in particular, pensioners will always be two per cent ahead of the CPI.
I know many speakers in this House have clearly outlined the difference between the position of the government and the Labor Party in these areas. As I said, I have been in politics for quite some time, watching the federal scene as well as the state scene, and I do not ever recall a tax cut from the Labor Party, nor can I ever recall any compensation for actions taken by them in government. This is the first government to have brought in a total change to the tax system, admit that there might be some areas that would disadvantage people in the community and try to do something about it and give them some support. We are saying that we will increase rent assistance from seven per cent to 10 per cent. That has to be a good position but, of course, the Labor Party cannot accept that. We believe that, given the fact that people have been alarmed, scared and deliberately deluded by the Labor Party, we can do something to at least overcome their fears. This must go a long way towards helping, because there is no doubt they will get that extra benefit.
I think the member for Grayndler raised the issue, and has mentioned it before in the House, of a quote by Senator Lightfoot. I do not know what the question to Senator Lightfoot was, but I suspect that he has been selectively quoted, as usual, by the Labor Party. I say very clearly to the member for Grayndler that, as far as I am concerned and I am sure as far as most of my colleagues are concerned, we would dissociate ourselves with that particular limited quote, if it is correct. We would dissociate ourselves from it. I am sure that is more than what the people of Grayndler would say about the fact that the member for Grayndler went up to the North Coast and said, `I'd prefer to live up here than represent my electors in Grayndler.' He is a regular visitor at the present time. He made it very clear that he would prefer to live up there than—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.
—On that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Grayndler should be speaking from his place.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order raised by the member for Cowper. I am speaking from the position as the parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for family and community services in relation to this bill we are debating. When I speak on the community services legislation, of which I have had carriage, and we have heard from the member for Page—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt my colleague who had the call but, on my point of order, the reality is that the member for Grayndler is a shadow parliamentary secretary; he is not a real parliamentary secretary. The parliamentary secretary seated at the table would only have the right to speak from the dispatch box when he has carriage of the legislation or government business. Equally, in the debate today—and I must say to the member for Grayndler that I deliberately did not embarrass him by getting him to return to his seat—the shadow minister who had carriage of the bill for the opposition has spoken. In that case the member for Grayndler, as shadow parliamentary secretary, did not have carriage and, just as the Chief Opposition Whip as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business is not entitled to speak from the dispatch box when the Manager of Opposition Business is here, because the shadow minister was here, he is not entitled to speak, either. 
—Further on that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would have thought that it is fairly obvious that the shadow minister for family and community services is not in the chamber and that he has deputised me as parliamentary secretary on this issue. That is why I am in the chamber, just like the parliamentary secretary opposite. I simply want to say that the point of order originally—
—I will deal with the point of order before the chair before I move to the one the member for Grayndler wishes to raise.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to speak on the point of order as the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. The opposition put out an office holders list and a shadow ministerial list at the beginning of the term. On that it says that the member for Grayndler is the parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for family and community services, and he has designated him to deal with housing matters. The parliamentary secretary has spoken in this chamber, I think, three times so far today on these issues, and for the member for Cowper to stand up there and try to change these rules by way of intervention I find very interesting. If the parliamentary secretaries sitting opposite tried to intervene in this debate later on if there were a minister in the House, that would be an absurd situation.
My memory goes back, for instance, to when Mr Miles was the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet and used to come in here all the time and do financial legislation. I do not know whether the Treasurer had designated him to do that. I do not think any of us saw any piece of paper that said that. What we saw was a government ministerial list which said that Mr Miles was the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet, and everyone took it with good grace that he was a parliamentary secretary and he got up and spoke to legislation that he said he had carriage of in the chamber. For the member for Cowper to suggest that we should turn this into some sort of a barney now, when events have overtaken whatever specious point of order he was trying to make earlier, is a bit silly. The government have changed the Ministers of State Act to provide that parliamentary secretaries on the government side have a little more authority than they used to. The same goes for this side. If we have decided that Mr Albanese is in charge of this legislation for us, that is our business. We have decided that.
—On the point of order, I understand that. The member for Grayndler did speak from the dispatch box when he made his contribution to this debate. I also understand that the member for Lilley had charge of the bill and spoke from the dispatch box. Had I been in the chair then I would have required the member for Grayndler to speak from his seat. If the member for Grayndler wishes to raise a point of order, as I understand he does, I invite him to do so from his seat.
—Could I speak on the point of order again, Mr Deputy Speaker?
—I have ruled on the point of order.
—I guess, then, you would put me in a position where you might encourage me to dissent from your ruling.
—It is always open to a member to do that, as the Chief Opposition Whip well knows, but I am not sure that that will aid the procedures of the House this afternoon. I think the member for Grayndler has accepted my ruling and is happy to raise a substantive point of order— 
—He most certainly has not, and that is my point.
—I have certainly not accepted your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I merely deferred to my much more experienced and knowledgeable colleague, the Chief Opposition Whip, on this issue. The substantive point of order—
—I understand he has a more substantive point of order. Would he come to that.
—The substantive point of order was that, once again, the member for Page has misled the House by saying that I would rather live in the Tweed. The fact is that I, as shadow parliamentary secretary for housing, have visited the electorate—
—The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. There are procedures of the House to make that point. The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I call the member for Page.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—In typical fashion, we can see how disorganised the government of Australia really is. I rise to speak to this legislation today because we have a Prime Minister who loves to tell the people of Australia that his never ever tax, his beloved GST, has been debased and the argument has been confused by the mischievous actions of the Australian Labor Party. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a government that does not need any assistance whatsoever to confuse the Australian people. Whether it be statements on petrol pricing or whether it be what will be affected by the GST and what will not, right from day one this government has gone from blunder to blunder. Without doubt, the position of the government on rent has been at worst a deliberate lie and at best ambiguous and misleading. 
The people of Australia were given many promises by John Howard at the last election. We find out now that many of them were non-core promises and a few were core promises. But the promise that rent would not be affected by the GST was accepted as a core promise by many Australians, who now find that they were deceived. Members on the other side cannot cry `foul'. We have two ministers on record as saying that this tax on rent would not be levied, and they were wrong. Admittedly, those ministers were both National Party ministers—Mark Vaile and Larry Anthony—and therefore not necessarily privy to the machinations of the government. From the government response to their demands, it appears they were not privy to those decision making processes. 
Then, only two weeks ago, we had that famous National Party conference at Tweed Heads, where a unanimous motion by the National Party conference called on the Prime Minister to overturn the tax on residents in manufactured home estates. How long did it last? It lasted about 24 hours, and then we saw it disappear forever from the coalition promise list. We had the member for Page, who has left the House now, tell the House that the Prime Minister should be congratulated for refusing to remove the impost. We had a statement from Senator Ross Lightfoot that, I would suggest, rivals Marie Antoinette's `Let them eat cake' statement for insensitivity. He said:
These people are lucky. They are no more special than anyone else. It might be an incentive for them to get houses.
That just about sums up the arrogance and the ignorance of this government. The very point is that we are talking about houses. In many cases, tens of thousands of cases, we are talking about very substantial houses. Sure, the estate may be called a caravan park. I have them in the electorate I represent, and they are called caravan parks. But try to take your caravan in there for the Christmas holidays. You will not be allowed. They do not have facilities. We are talking about homes that have been pre-constructed, they arrive on the back of a number of trucks, they are assembled, they are constructed on concrete or brick piers, they are fully plumbed, they are connected to electricity, they have verandahs around them, they have concrete footpaths, and they have gardens and garages adjacent to them. 
The thing that is different about these homes is that the owners rent the land; they do not own the land. That is the difference. They own the whole of the home and all the fittings in it. They are very proud of it, and for many of these people it is the first home they have ever owned. It is their choice. They chose to live that lifestyle. Many of them are older people. They have chosen to live that lifestyle because the homes are modern and the maintenance is less, and they live in a community where they have a very good network of friends. They realise they are aging and there are days when they might not want to get out of bed. They can assist each other if there is a chore or some shopping to be done. That is the sort of network that exists in these places. And they were promised by John Howard at the last election that there would be no increase in their rent. How wrong they were.  
It was brought up by the Nationals at their conference and they then rolled over. But the government has made a change. They have convinced the National Party that these residents will be better off paying a 5.5 per cent GST, and the National Party have accepted it. 
That tells you something else about the GST. If the Prime Minister was able to convince the National Party members, who voted exclusively to get the GST removed from this rent, by telling them, `Well, actually, because of the complexity of the GST, these people—they don't know it yet—are going to be better off paying 5.5 per cent,' it makes you wonder how the rest of us are going to fare. Are we all going to be better off paying 5.5 per cent?
—What a worry!
—It is a major worry. The argument must have been very compelling because all the National Party members have said, `Hey, we did a great thing. You're going to be better off now. You're still paying the 5.5 per cent, but you're better off.' Sure, there was an increase in rent assistance of 10 per cent, but the survey that I have done shows that only about one in four of these people will get rent assistance at all. Many of them do not get it. One in four will get it, but for many there will be no difference. What does that do? It exaggerates the difference that was already there, but for 75 per cent it will make no difference at all. For those who will get it, it means a difference of about 16c a day.
I have been running this issue for well over 12 months in the electorate of Paterson, because there are between 3,000 and 4,000 people there who live in this environment. It is a major concern to them. I certainly resent the member for Page saying that it is scaremongering. Nothing could be more a case of scaremongering than a government promising there would be no rent increase at all under the GST, and tenants suddenly finding out that there will be a 5½ per cent increase. Many of them are pensioners, and many of them are on fixed incomes. They know that, at the end of a pension fortnight, there is nothing left in kitty. If they are going to pay 5½ per cent more, they know that, to pay that 5½ per cent, something else has to go.
It is all right to talk about the compensation measures. The compensation measures are there because of the increased costs that these people will experience with the GST. According to the government's promises, rent was not one of those things that would increase, and now it is. They also know that rent is one of their major costs, and it is going up by 5½ per cent. That is the scaremongering. That did not come from this side of the House. That is a statement of fact that has been inflicted upon these people by the Howard government and its new tax system. There are 160,000 people around Australia who resent that this was a non-core promise. They resent the fact that, after next Saturday, they will be worse off—they will have less disposable income.
I will say one thing in conclusion. We have been lobbying this issue with all of the housing estates in the electorate of Paterson, and I have found 10 home estates that will not be charging the GST. I congratulate those owners. They are trying to be fair—by not putting a GST on their rents, they are trying to ensure that the GST will have a minimal effect on their tenants. I advise the government that I will be monitoring what happens in those places because, according to the government, if the estates do not charge the GST, the residents will be worse off. It will be very interesting to visit these places over the coming weeks and to find out exactly how much worse off they are by not paying the GST, compared with those where the GST has been levied. I look forward to the opportunity to report back to the parliament when we come back in August, or at a later stage, on how they have been affected. 
Mr Deputy Speaker, that is my contribution to this argument. That is my contribution to this debate which really should not have taken place at all if the government had respected the needs of the needy and honoured the promises it made at the last election. Unfortunately, they have done neither.",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—This Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000 is doomed to failure, just as the government's never, ever GST is doomed to failure. It is an absolute debacle that we are debating this legislation in this House tonight. It is a testimony to the government's failure right up until now to address a very important issue. Right at the last minute, we have been delivered legislation to consider, because the government have been caught out. It is not because they genuinely want to help people, but because they have been caught out.
This tax that our 1950s style Prime Minister is about to slug the Australian people with is doomed in every possible respect. If the government have any honour or integrity whatsoever, they should accept the opposition's amendment, which will remove one of the inequities of this draconian tax. Unfortunately, I suspect that this government will ignore the amendment and push through this legislation that was rushed into the House at the last minute. This legislation has been formulated on the run, and only because the government have been caught out.
If the Econtech report, a report that this government sat on for six months, had never surfaced—if Laurie Oakes had never brought it out into the public arena—we would not even be looking at the legislation today. There were repeated calls for the report to be released but, no, this government refused. When it was finally released, it showed the real impact that the GST would have on residential rentals. Now the government has been forced to act. It was deceitful in the way it sought to hide it from Australia, and it was deceitful in the way it sought to have this hike in rent thrust upon the Australian people without any compensation whatsoever. It knew about it, it hid it and ignored the impact.
The only thing that forced the government to act today is the simple fact that their partners in the coalition, the Democrats—their partners in the Senate—demanded that the government act. At first the Democrats were about trying to create some equity for people who live in parks—an issue that I will touch on in a moment—but they rolled over, as they always do for the government, and came up with this very second-class package. You only receive compensation if you receive maximum rent assistance. Even if you do receive maximum rent assistance, you will receive only 16c a day compensation—and that is not much. If you are working or are a self-funded retiree, you will not receive any compensation. It is very inequitable for people who live in residential parks, mobile home parks and caravan parks. The majority of these people are on some sort of fixed income. About 20 per cent of them receive pensions. Not all of these people will be eligible to receive any of this increase in rental assistance. 
The members on the other side have gone to great lengths to say, `If they didn't have to pay the GST they'd have to pay more on rent.' I thought I would just give them a little example of one of the parks in the Shortland electorate, and that is the park at Redhead. The people in that park are going to be charged a 4.7 per cent rent increase and, on top of that, they are going to be charged the 5.5 per cent GST. They are going to get a 10.2 per cent rental increase. Even making an allowance for the 10 per cent increase in rental assistance, there is absolutely no way that it lines up. This government is failing these people dreadfully. These people will be faced with not only the GST but also, in most cases, a rental increase. It is similar at the Heritage Park in Toukley and many other parks throughout the Shortland electorate.
I think part of this comes from ignorance. I do not think there are many people on the other side who really understand the lifestyle of people who live in parks. The Prime Minister said on AM a week or two ago that, if you pay half the GST, the owner of a caravan park is then able to get a refund on all the input taxes he pays on things like carpet, airconditioning, heating and so forth. What the Prime Minister does not understand is that these people own their own homes. They pay their own electricity, gas and water rates. They are responsible for the maintenance of their home and do their own gardening. I thought I would just describe some of the features of a couple of homes in the park at Redhead: garage built into the house; two storeys; house with large verandah and double garage; triple-wide house with glass verandah at the rear; a garage built into the side of the house; cement pad and tool shed. There are many examples of the type of permanent dwellings that these folk who live in residential parks have. They are not caravans. They are not buildings that can be moved at a moment's notice. Senator Lightfoot said on 19 June that if people pay the GST, it might be an incentive for them to get a house. Senator Lightfoot was obviously ignorant of the fact that these people own their own homes. These people are in a worse position than most other renters. They cannot just get up and say, `Okay, I'm going to move,' because they own the home. They have to sell the home before they are able to move to other accommodation. 
I would now like to move to some of the statements made by the members of the National Party—none of whom are here at the moment. The member for Page was quite vocal when he was here, but he obviously did not listen to his colleague on the North Coast, the state member for Coffs Harbour. After the National Party conference, the state member for Coffs Harbour, Andrew Frazer, said:
I believe that the federal government gave an assurance prior to the last election that no-one would be disadvantaged by increased rents. Mr Howard has increased the rent of people living in caravan parks. I cannot support that, and I will not. I stated clearly and loudly at the National Party Conference last weekend that I did not support it. 
The conference stated unanimously `We do not support the GST on caravan parks.' 
What has happened to Mr Causley? Why won't he support his colleagues in the National Party in the state parliament? One after another they stood up and spoke to a motion in that parliament saying that residents of caravan parks and residential parks should not have to pay a GST. I have to agree with the member for Coffs Harbour when he described Mr Howard as being bloody-minded—and so he is. He is bloody-minded in forcing this GST on residents of caravan parks.
Mr Nehl, the member for Cowper, has made a number of statements on this. He feels that his integrity is being impugned by the fact that the government is going to force residents of caravan parks to pay the GST. The member for Page talked about the photo that appeared in the paper. The thing is that residents of parks have come to us on this side of the House. They spoke to the member for Page and the member for Richmond and asked them to help. They asked them to listen to what they had to say. They asked them to go to the Prime Minister, to represent them, and to ask for the GST to be removed from their rental. But those members failed. They did not listen to their constituents. So those people had no choice but to come to us. We listened and we are in there fighting for them because we believe that they should not have to pay the GST on rental. 
I would like to add that the residents park group has come out very strongly and said that they do not accept this; they feel that it is still very inequitable. If the ACCC is to monitor the GST and its impact on rentals, I am really very worried about how it will go. Through my office I have contacted the ACCC about one case in particular in which the GST was charged on rent of a hospital television set. On 29 February I wrote to the ACCC about that. This particular company charged patients in hospital the GST on their television hire. I have received letters from the ACCC saying they are investigating it. We ring them weekly. They say, `We are investigating it'. They say, `Yes, it was charged on rental of the television set,' yet they have not acted on it. Is this the kind of assistance that the ACCC is going to give residential renters and people who are paying the GST in Australia after 1 July? I think it is. I think the ACCC is a toothless tiger that will not stand up for the people and will do nothing to help people who live in caravan parks. People who live in caravan parks and boarding houses will be hardest hit by the GST. They have limited income and this tax is going to impact on them negatively, leaving aside the fact that they will have to pay the GST on rent. It cannot be condoned. The government really stand condemned for forcing residents of caravan parks and hostels to pay the GST.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—The Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000 is just another example of the government coming up with a half-hearted and insufficient response to the real injustice of the GST package. I do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, whether you are a regular watcher of television, but it reminds me of putting Mr Burns and Homer Simpson in charge of our tax system. You have the government, Mr Burns, doing their very best to screw every last cent out of the most vulnerable Australians. We have heard example after example of building works that will not be finished, petrol prices going up and all sorts of items going up in price that Australians were led to believe would be GST free or would drop in price under this new tax system. In this instance, rent is being paid by the most vulnerable members of our community when the government promised that rent would not be affected by the GST.
Of course, the government's partner in this new tax system is the Democrats, or Homer Simpson. What happens time after time is that the Democrats slap their foreheads and say, `Doh! We missed that one. That one went through to the keeper.' It has happened with tampons. Meg Lees had to come out and say, `I am sorry, it was not in the original package that we agreed to. We just missed it. We overlooked it.' It has happened with beer. The Democrats are now supposedly leading this charge against the unfair impost on beer drinkers. Beer is going up by more than 1.9 per cent. You have to ask the Democrats: were they paying attention at all when they signed off on this agreement? The Labor Party have been saying for years, since before the last election, `Don't trust this government on tax reform. Things will go up when the GST is introduced.' The Democrats are saying, time and time again, `Doh! We missed that.'
GST being paid on rent by caravan park dwellers and people who live in boarding houses is just one more example, and it is a particularly tragic example because these people are amongst the most vulnerable people in our community. The compensation is much too little too late for residents of boarding houses and caravan parks. The government originally said that the four per cent pension increase—if you can call it a four per cent pension increase when two per cent was coming anyway—and the seven per cent rent assistance increase only for those who are on the highest amount of rent assistance would compensate those people living in boarding houses and caravan parks. I think that this legislation shows exactly what that compensation is worth. It is an admission by this government that those people will be worse off and that they would have been worse off under the package, despite the denials that have been going on for months now from the executive of the government. Of course, we have had various backbenchers and even some ministers admitting that this is not a fair package and that it will disadvantage caravan park dwellers. This bill proves that the statement was never true.
Our amendment is about saying that a few extra cents a day of rent relief does not deal with the fact that it is fundamentally unfair that the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community are the only ones who are going to pay a GST on their rent. The Econtech report that the government received in January but would never have released if they had had their way, by the government's modeller of choice, Chris Murphy—whom some of my colleagues last night were saying was like the Leni Riefenstahl of this government—is further proof that this group of people, the most vulnerable in the community, are clearly going to be worse off under this new tax system. The report clearly shows that rents in boarding houses will be going up by 4.4 per cent. The government's own estimate for other types of rent is a rise of 2.3 per cent. 
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 2,597 boarding houses in Australia in 1996. Estimates of how many people live in those boarding houses vary but the 1996 census had a figure of 23,999 while, in that same year, National Shelter suggested the figure was something closer to 57,561. Either way, that is an awful lot of boarding house residents. In my electorate the 1996 census showed that there were almost 2,000 people living in boarding houses in my area, which is an enormous number of people living in boarding houses. They are often elderly. They are often frail. They sometimes have physical and intellectual disabilities. Certainly, they are generally unemployed and are relying on an unemployment, aged or disability pension. Several years ago, in 1992 in fact, the Victorian Rooming House Tenants Association found that 87.7 per cent of people living in boarding houses were social security recipients. Most of these people spend at least half of their weekly income on paying their rent to the boarding house. Many of them spend more than half of their weekly income in rent. Rents are often in excess of $110 a week, which is an enormous amount of money if you have $160 a week or even less coming in.
There are many and varied reasons, of course, why people choose to live in boarding houses in Sydney but it is mostly because they are unable to afford more secure accommodation. Because they are living such a hand to mouth existence, they are often unable to afford a bond; they are not able to save a bond. Sometimes they do not have particularly good independent skills; they find it difficult to organise people to share accommodation with, particularly at short notice and in an area such as Sydney, where there is a very low vacancy rate for rental accommodation and where rental accommodation is extremely expensive. There is no doubt that for these people, who are amongst the most vulnerable in our community, this government's position, even with an increase in rental assistance, will lead to higher levels of homelessness.
The government's own report into homelessness, the highly publicised National homelessness strategy, cites caravan park dwellers, particularly families living in caravan parks, and boarding house residents as amongst those who are most vulnerable to becoming homeless. Under this government's current proposal, these people are still the only people who will pay a GST on their rent. This has not changed under this proposed legislation. It is only the Labor Party that proposes to change that situation. This is, of course, in contrast with the best waterfront apartments in Sydney with the best harbour views and the best amenities. People can be paying $2,000 or $3,000 a week rent in Sydney for a particularly good apartment or a good house. These people do not pay GST on their rent. There is just no way that this sort of legislation, this tinkering around the edges, deals with that fundamental inequity between the highest income earners not having to pay GST on their rent and the lowest income earners, the most vulnerable people, having to pay that GST. Labor believes that there should not be a GST on boarding house and caravan park rents for long-term residents and that this tax is unfair. Tinkering at the edges will not solve that unfairness.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—This is quite an amazing debate in which to be participating because the issues that we are raising here today, the important issues we are discussing, are not new. Many of the speakers before me have paid attention to that and I want to reiterate that point. We on this side of the House have been raising the inequity of these decisions affecting long-term tenants of caravan parks and boarding houses due to the effect of the GST. We have been raising these issues for 18 months or more and, I have to say quite sadly, have been ridiculed badly by the people opposite for all of that time. We have been labelled as scaremongering and frightening the poor people in the community when, in actual fact, what we have been doing is highlighting the very problem that we are talking about here today. So much for that ridicule. The government now believes, apparently, that the issue is of some significance; it really has come to the point where the bill that it has brought to the House is a result of the concern that we have all been claiming and speaking about for all of those 18 months. I want to take the time to pay tribute to our shadow minister, the member for Lilley, and also to the member for Grayndler, who have tenaciously shown their belief in this issue for so many months despite the accusations from the opposite side of the parliament that they were doing nothing more than stirring up the scaremongering storm. 
What a situation you have with the new tax system. A piece of legislation comes into this place, is voted on, the tax system legislation has enormous implications for many, many people throughout our community—in fact the overwhelming majority of people are going to feel the implications of this new tax system—we go ahead and point out the inequities in that new tax system, a report is commissioned by the government—after all the legislation has been passed—to see whether in fact there may be a problem and when that report is received the findings are kept under wraps. This is after everybody has been told, as the government say, `Trust us—we're the government. We are here to help you. We have a new wonderful tax system that everybody is going to think is the best thing ever, not just better than sliced bread but better than anything, and it is all going to be okay.' Then, of course, we saw the commissioned report—the report having come out and been held under wraps—and what does it say? It actually says that the projections by the government in relation to the effect of GST on rents, particularly those of caravan park tenants and those in boarding houses, and all that we have been saying is not quite true; the report says it is going to be worse than what we have been saying. The reality that we are facing here is that the government continually call for all of us to have regard for the national interest. They say it may be problematic for some people in the community, that the impact may have a slightly detrimental effect on them, but really the national interest is so big and so important that they should not worry about the detail.
We have seen confusion over food. We have seen the cost of schooling question. We have seen the cost of the large list of health products that are going to be affected. We have seen the fiasco about petrol in the last few weeks. We know very well the problems that are going to occur in the private rental market. We have seen confusion throughout so many levels of our community, and yet we are told again and again, `Don't worry about the detail; the national interest is what is important.' The government and the Prime Minister simply have to understand that the detail does matter. It does matter to the tenant or the person in a boarding house. It does matter to the family that is attempting to maintain sporting activities for the kids outside school. It does matter to the small business person who is attempting to continue to survive against the amazing tide of paperwork and bureaucracy associated with this so-called simpler tax system. And it matters incredibly to the people who have set up their homes in a caravan park as permanent long-term residents. The detail does matter. It is wrong for the Prime Minister to say to individuals in our community, `Put that aside and think about the national interest,' when, as the Leader of the Opposition very clearly pointed out today, we are yet to see proof that the national interest will be enhanced by this whole new tax system. I find it quite sad and I am concerned for the future when I hear that the detail is an irrelevancy to the individuals we all represent. We represent these people, and it does matter to them.
In moving against this bill today, we have been accused of voting against the very people that we are supposedly helping. That is just vacuous nonsense. We have been defending those people; for months and months, in the middle of ridicule and accusations of scaremongering, we have been pointing out the inequities and the basic unfairness that the tax system is going to impose on them. You cannot say that because we are standing up here today we are somehow being hypocritical about our position and that we are not defending the people affected by this bill. This bill is an insult to those who are going to be affected by the imposition of the GST on their lifestyle in a long-term caravan park or in a boarding house, and I find it an insult to be told that for some reason I am moving against those very people today. 
Taking the risk of sounding quite cynical, I believe that this is all being done because of a sudden focus on this issue. The National Party conference a few short weeks ago gave the government its first opportunity to see without its bifocals. It has seen the reality; it has seen that this may be a problem. Members of the coalition partner party stood up at their national conference and said that they simply must address this problem. The cynic in me says, `Maybe all that we've said is still being disregarded. This issue is only now being attended to because of political expediency.' The government thinks, `We've got to somehow calm down the nervous Nellies on our back bench and in our coalition partner party to somehow get through the next few weeks of the GST.' I stand very strongly by the comments that we have been making. I stand very strongly by the amendments we are moving to this bill.
I represent the electorate of Canberra. Some people may not realise that I have a number of constituents who live in long-term caravan parks, albeit a smaller number than in other areas. The Canberra South Motor Park is one place that comes to mind. I have spoken to those people in recent weeks and months, and I know how they feel. Even though they may be smaller in number than the 11,000, 14,000 or 6,000 residents in other members' electorates, they are no less important. I have concern for them, and today I have the opportunity to represent them here, to stand up and say on their behalf, `Enough is enough.' The government is bringing down a piece of legislation which is going to give basically no financial recompense to these people. I think a single person sharing the rent will get 11c a day. This rent assistance will only help in a minuscule way. You could count the amount of money that is going to be of assistance to some of these people in cent pieces if they still existed. I very strongly support our amendment. I maintain my rage on behalf of my constituents and all others affected by this government's decision to continue blindly down the path of the GST the way they have done. For the sake of the people we represent, I hope that the government sees more clearly without its bifocals and that it suddenly starts to realise the reality of the impact of its deeds.",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000. I wish to bring into this parliament the voice of the people in Stirling who are affected by the GST on site fees in permanent parks, mobile homes, caravan parks and boarding houses and to ask why the coalition parties and the Democrats cannot grant an exemption to these people. It strikes my constituents as being very unfair that private rent is exempted from GST and yet these more disadvantaged people have the GST on their site fees or other arrangements.
Not only do the residents affected in Stirling think it is unfair and unreasonable; many people across Australia do. As other members have said, not only the over 160,000 people who live in permanent parks, mobile homes and the like are affected but a broader number of people are affected; the people in boarding houses are probably the most disadvantaged group whatsoever. I am not sure if it has come out clearly to the coalition parties during this debate that about 5.5 million people pay rent but only 20 per cent get rent assistance. This bill, which amends the original compensation bill, is to increase the rent assistance to 10 per cent. In the original bill, the rent assistance was going to be increased by seven per cent. That may seem very generous, but when you analyse it you see that it is not very generous. A lot of people are not on a Centrelink or veterans benefit or on a pension, and they are not going to benefit from getting an increase in rent assistance because they do not get rent assistance.
I have three caravan parks in the electorate of Stirling and all these caravan parks have people who live there long term or permanently. About 50 to 60 per cent of them are on the Centrelink benefit but not a full Centrelink benefit, and there are two impacts of this amending bill on them. Some will not get the increase in rent assistance. They do not get rent assistance because their site fees paid are so low that they fall under the Centrelink definition of being eligible for rent assistance. Some of the other people living there are either on fairly low wages or are on payments from insurance companies because they have a workers compensation injury or, because of the split-up of a marriage or relationship, they have ended up moving out of the family home. Because the family home often is a public housing Homeswest place, their only option for housing is a permanent park or a mobile home. So they are not going to get rent assistance either. Then there are the people who are on some kind of overseas pension topped up with a small Centrelink pension. They also will not benefit or will benefit minimally from this increase in compensation or with rent assistance.  
My residents and constituents say that this is unfair and unjust and that it discriminates. My residents were appalled when they found out that they would have to pay GST on their site fees. Residents from the park approached my office for help because they were so confused about the issue. The reason that everyone was confused is that people renting houses do not have to pay GST on their rent but people renting a caravan park site or a permanent home park site do pay GST on their fees. It is one of the many strange inequities that have come out of the GST legislation. 
A couple of months ago I took the federal shadow minister for finance, Lindsay Tanner, to Carine Gardens to talk to the residents, and about half the residents came to talk to us because they are the permanent people. It was clear from talking to the residents that they felt discriminated against because they find themselves living in a caravan park. Some choose to live there, others live in caravan parks because they cannot afford private rent and yet others are waiting for a spot in a Homeswest property. Homeswest is the Western Australian public housing instrumentality. Clearly these are the people who can least afford to pay more for the same service. Residents were shocked to find that under the government legislation they would pay 10 per cent GST on the first 27 days of their stay and five per cent thereafter. It is not just people in Carine or in the electorate of Stirling who are angry about this. 
What do I say to my residents when they come to me with their concerns on the issue? And, now that they know about this additional compensation bill going through the parliament, what more can I say to them? I say to the residents, `There are things you can do. You can petition the government, you can join a lobby group, something like the Self-funded Retirees Association or the Pensioners and Superannuants Association, and join in their interest to bring their voice to government. You can write to your senators, write through me, your MP, organise rallies, ring talkback radio and write letters to the editor of the West Australian or your local community newspaper.' I tell my residents that in many ways they have got to get their voice up so that this government can hear their concern about the promise it broke that no Australian would be worse off. 
As the member for Sydney said, rents make up 30 per cent of the weekly budget of low income people, but that is only people in public housing. For people in other arrangements, including boarding houses and accommodation projects, the proportion of their budget going on rent can be up to 50 per cent because they are on a low income. Their accommodation options, as the member for Sydney pointed out, are very limited. These residents say to me that it is not too late to bring their voice to the government to say that the GST should not be applied to caravan parks, mobile homes, permanent parks, boarding houses and accommodation projects. I bring their voice to this place. I hope the coalition parties and the Democrats hear it and I hope I have a better result in the next little while.",REPS,<title>COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RENT ASSISTANCE INCREASE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2000-06-28,"—in reply—I would like to thank members for their contributions to this debate on the Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment (Rent Assistance Increase) Bill 2000. In particular I would like to thank the member for Page and the member for Robertson for their expressions of support in relation to the bill, and I would like to also thank other members for their contributions to the debate. The opposition has not been able to avoid the temptation of making cheap political points out of some positive reforms that we are doing to increase rent assistance. The amendments put forward by the opposition are certainly not substantive amendments; they are no real amendments whatsoever.  
The A New Tax System (Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment) Act 1999, the compensation measures act, amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to provide a seven per cent increase in the maximum rent assistance rates available to social security and veteran pensioners and other social security recipients. The increase applies from 1 July 2000. This bill amends the compensation measures act to ensure that a 10 per cent, instead of a seven per cent, increase applies to the maximum rent assistance rates from 1 July 2000. This change will provide extra assistance for people with low incomes in rental accommodation, including caravan park, mobile home and boarding house residents. The maximum rent assistance rates for the family tax benefit are also to be similarly increased by disallowable instrument made under subclause 8(1) of schedule 4 to A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999. 
The estimated cost of the further increases in the maximum rent assistance rates applicable to social security, veterans' affairs and family assistance customers is $33 million in each year. I certainly welcome the announcement of an extra $33 million per year in the maximum rate of rent assistance paid to pensioners and low income earners. Currently one million Australians receive $1.5 billion in rent assistance. The $33 million increase means that the government will provide an additional $100 million per year in rent assistance after 1 July under the new tax system. The decision to increase the maximum rate of rent assistance by another three per cent to 10 per cent will help renters across the board, whether they be in private accommodation, relocatable homes or boarding houses. The government's thorough education program for relocatable home residents and relocatable home park owners will ensure that both are aware of the pricing implications of the tax options.
When coupled with the government's decision to monitor and consult on the concessional GST rate on relocatable homes, working with park owners and residents, and providing funding to ensure the smooth implementation of the new tax system, relocatable home residents are ensured of fair treatment under the tax system. The government has provided unprecedented compensation for the introduction of the new tax system. These rent allowance increases are part of the compensation package that includes the four per cent increase in pensions, increases in the pension asset test threshold and taper rates. That is compensation that Labor never provided when they increased taxes. Instead, Labor ditched the l-a-w income tax cuts that they had promised.
I feel quite strongly about this issue. As we have seen in the past, the member for Lilley, along with the member for Grayndler, is only concerned about raising his profile. If he is not interested in raising his profile, he is obviously only interested in scaremongering pensioners. The member for Grayndler, who is in the chamber, has certainly adopted the same policy as the member for Lilley, that is scaring people—not just pensioners but some of the most vulnerable in our relocatable home parks across the country. Indeed, in the Sydney Morning Herald a couple of weeks ago we saw these two clowns masquerading as caravan park residents. There is nothing that the gremlin from Grayndler will stop at to invoke fear in a lot of great people, very good people who live in the northern part of New South Wales. The bottom line is that you certainly cannot trust the Labor Party on this issue. Certainly, the members for Lilley and Grayndler are using this only as a beauty contest to promote their own image.
The government is about protecting a group of people. While the government believes that its GST compensation measures will more than cover cost increases, we are prepared to take extra measures to reassure renters that they will not be worse off under the new tax system. For this reason, the government announced that rent assistance will be increased from seven per cent to 10 per cent, an additional three per cent in maximum fortnightly rent. That is an increase in additional assistance from $5.40 to $7.70 per fortnight for singles, meaning the new maximum rate is $85, and from $5 to $7.25 for couples, meaning the new maximum rate is $79.80. The ACCC will be monitoring prices in relocatable home parks and boarding houses to ensure that the margins have not been increased. They have a very rigorous regime to ensure that there is no price discrimination. 
—Like they did with the mini-bar.
—I think the member for Grayndler has been spending a bit too much time at the mini-bar! When the ALP bumped up wholesale sales tax, they never had proper price surveillance mechanisms in place. We know that. On top of the four per cent increase in pensions and allowances, these measures will ensure that low income members of the community will be protected from any price increase under the new tax system. A thorough education strategy will ensure that operators and tenants in caravan parks and boarding houses are fully aware of both tax options and their pricing implications.
Labor has misrepresented this issue and has spent much time putting fear into some of the most vulnerable people in our community. It has no genuine aim; it is just for the purposes of pure political point scoring. The bottom line is that you cannot trust Labor. Unlike the Labor Party, the government is acting responsibly. Those people receiving the maximum rate of assistance will see an automatic increase in assistance from 1 July. For those who receive rent assistance below the maximum rate, as some of them do, the assistance will increase 75c for every dollar increase in their rent. This means that if rents go up $8 they will receive $6 extra rent assistance. I think even the member for Lilley would agree with that arithmetic. Additional pensions and other social security payments will be increased by four per cent.
I would like to take the opportunity to speak on some of the issues that were raised during the debate by the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley's stock in trade is to scare the most vulnerable in our community. That is exactly what he has done with many of these people in relocatable home parks. You cannot trust the figures that the member for Lilley uses. The member for Lilley claims that the September CPI will be 6.75 per cent. The budget forecast is for 4.5 per cent for September 2000, with 3.75 per cent attributed to the GST. For low income earners, this increase will be covered by a four per cent increase in pensions and other social security payments. The member for Lilley continues to misrepresent the government's achievements in protecting the value of pensions. Pensions have been maintained at CPI or better than CPI thanks to the government taking the initiative and legislating to increase pension rates to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That was never done by the Australian Labor Party. The four per cent increase in pension payments on 1 July will take pensions above the CPI. Even the member for Hotham agrees with the government that pensioners will be two per cent better off in the long term.
The government has brought forward two per cent of the March 2001 increases to make sure that pensioners have the money available at the time of the increase in prices from the GST. The government has also legislated to ensure that the maximum single rate of pensions is at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. As a result of this legislation, since March 1998 the maximum single rate of pensions has increased by $13 a fortnight, more than it would have done under Labor, and the maximum partner rate for each member of the couple has increased by $11 a fortnight more than it would have under Labor for the same period. If Labor were still in power and still indexing the pension to CPI, a single pensioner would have been $13 a fortnight worse off. After 1 July 2000, pensioners will receive an extra $15 per fortnight. Add to this an extra $13, which they would never have received under the Labor Party, and that makes a total of $28 a fortnight, effectively an increase of $700 per year. 
The member for Lilley claims, falsely, that pensioners are going to be worse off because they will have changes to their payday introduced by the government. They will be better off. All pensioners and allowees will have more money in their pocket after the new tax system begins on 1 July 2000. They will be paid on each and every day that they are entitled to it. Pensions and allowances will increase by four per cent. This will be $15.10 each fortnight for a single pensioner and $12.50 for each member of a couple. These payments are made on a daily basis at the end of each fortnight. That means that people are paid the amount that they are entitled to—fairly elementary, but the member for Lilley cannot comprehend it. The historic tax reforms that this government is putting in place will help pensioners and allowees. Under the old system, people who lost entitlements the day before a payday received no payments for the period at all. Labor supported our payment cycle legislation and has indicated no plans to change it. Once again, I can only say that the Australian Labor Party and the member for Lilley are only interested in scaring pensioners.
Finally, the other point raised by the member for Lilley is concerning the FID—the financial institutions duty—which is a state tax. FID is not and will not be levied on social security payments made under the Social Security Act. I would expect that the states and territories would extend this existing policy to the new social security payments from 1 July 2000. All states and territories have a FID and have committed to abolishing it on 1 July 2001. Ironically, again the stock in trade of the member for Lilley is to just use scare tactics. If he is so concerned about the FID, why don't he and the member for Grayndler convince the state ALP governments to remove it? I reiterate that states and territories should adapt the same principles as those applying to payments under the Social Security Act.
There has also been lots of mischief. I would not like to leave out the Marrickville maverick. The member for Grayndler prefers to spend more time in my electorate than in his. I know he likes holidaying up there. He has often said to his own members that he would prefer to represent there than Marrickville, so maybe he should be the new preselection candidate. The member for Grayndler spends an enormous amount of time spreading fear and loathing among pensioners.
—I welcome him contesting. The member for Grayndler never mentions his own party's record and what Labor would do to the children and grandchildren of the good people he is trying to con. He does not tell them that Labor hate the GST and because they hate it so much they are going to keep it if they get elected—if they get elected. He does not tell them that their kids can look forward to rampant inflation, three times the current home loan interest rates and double the rate of unemployment, which is the past record of the Labor Party. This was the case under 13 years of Australian Labor Party stewardship. He forgets to mention that the tax changes under Labor would not be revealed until after the election and that there is zero compensation—absolutely zero compensation. What we are seeing here by Labor is a cynical, opportunistic and gutless performance—
 (Mr Quick)—I remind the member for Shortland that if she wishes to refer to members she must do so by their electorate, not by their Christian names.
—Order! The honourable member for Grayndler is warned.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister at the dispatch box has referred to me in the House in a number of ways by—
—There is no point of order.
—My point of order is that I ask you to be consistent.
—There is no point of order. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member concluded his intervention by saying that he required you to be more consistent. I regard that as a reflection on the chair, and it should be withdrawn.
—It is all right.
—The increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance in this bill will benefit those who need the help the most. These are people, especially single, elderly people, who currently spend the greatest proportion of their pension on rent. What is wrong with that? Helping those least able to help themselves has always been a foundation of this government's philosophy. Having said that, the government recognises that some rents will go up under Australia's new tax system, whether through input taxation or the concessional GST in parks where owners choose that option. That is precisely why the government has made available these compensation measures. For most low income renters, inside or outside parks, the government will pay the increased rent assistance payments. This is an additional three per cent increase in the maximum fortnightly rent assistance. As I mentioned before, this means additional assistance of $5.40 to $7.70 for singles, putting the maximum rate at $85, or $5 to $7.25 for couples, meaning the maximum rate is $79.80. Combine this with the ACCC's monitoring of the pricing of all caravan parks and boarding houses to ensure that the margins have not been increased. This is on top of the four per cent increases in pension allowances, to ensure that low income members of the community will be protected from any price increases under the new system. As I have mentioned before, we will engage in a thorough education strategy to ensure that operators and tenants in mobile home parks or boarding houses, whether they are in Sydney or Brisbane, are fully aware of both the tax options and the price implications. The amendment that the Australian Labor Party has moved is not a substantive amendment. It is not a real amendment at all. It is a political tactic with no real policy implications. I commend my comments to the House.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 75, page 18 (line 6), after “infringed”, insert “in the circumstances described in subsection (3B)”.
(2)	Schedule 1, item 75, page 18 (after line 15), after subsection (3A), insert:
(3B)	The circumstances in which the copyright in the original artistic work is not infringed because of subsection (3A) are that either:
(a)	the work has been lost, or has deteriorated, since the preservation reproduction of the work was made; or
(b)	the work has become so unstable that it cannot be dispalyed without risk of significant deterioration.
These amendments relate to the circumstances of archives and libraries displaying material and the copyright attaching to it. The rationale for these amendments is that cultural institutions should not be allowed to make a digital reproduction of a work for display without reasonable remuneration to the copyright owner. To achieve that purpose, the ALP recognise that there will be a need in circumstances where the work has been lost, where the work has deteriorated since the digital copy was made and where putting the work on display would cause significant deterioration.
The circumstances that these two amendments relate to are when cultural institutions want to display a work to the public. The bill already provides that such a display in electronic form will take place on a discrete unit which will not be connected to a printer, will not be connected to online facilities and will not have any copying facilities attached. So it will be a straight-out case of a person having access on a screen. We recognise that it will be appropriate to have that access without any breach of copyright in those circumstances to which I have alluded, and that is the purpose of our amendments.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,30,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—The government is prepared to accept these two amendments that, as the member for Barton has indicated, deal with libraries and archives in section 51A of the Copyright Act, which allows the reproduction and communication of works for preservation and other purposes. As it currently stands, the bill would allow institutions to make preservation reproductions available on their premises on terminals from which users could not copy or communicate the works. This exception is designed both to facilitate the preservation of artistic works through their digitisation and to enhance public access to such works. The opposition amendments would mean that a gallery could only make a preservation reproduction of an original artistic work available where the work had been lost or had deteriorated since the preservation reproduction was made, or where the original work had become so unstable that it could not be displayed without risk of significant deterioration. This is essentially consistent with the policy of the government that preservation reproduction should be made available to the public only in certain defined circumstances. As I said, the government accepts these amendments.

	(9)	The defendant bears the burden of establishing the matters referred to in subsections (3), (4) and (4A).
These amendments relate to the use of circumvention devices. While the bill contains a procedure by which persons who seek to use a circumvention device are required to complete a declaration setting out that they are doing so for a permitted purpose, it is our view that that is not sufficient to protect the underlying rights of copyright owners. We recognise that the declaration is an appropriate mechanism by which people who have a legitimate interest in accessing a copyright work—for example, a computer programmer who needs to decompile a work to find out the background to a computer program in accordance with the existing exemptions for computer programmers—can do so by means of a circumvention device.
However, we believe that stronger safeguards are needed to ensure that circumvention devices are not used in a widespread fashion to defeat legitimate copyright protection. So the opposition amendments substantially increase the requirements of this declaration mechanism to use circumvention devices. Our amendments require that only a qualified person should be entitled to use a circumvention device, and that is somebody who has a legitimate reason for using a circumvention device by virtue of the exemptions currently in the act, and they are set out in our amendments. Circumvention devices will only be lawfully used where the work or other subject matter is not readily available to that person in a form that is not protected by a technological protection measure. For instance, this will allow computer programmers to take advantage of the computer program decompilation exemptions passed through the parliament late last year without necessarily having to approach a software company. That would avoid the situation where, in approaching the software company, they may, if you like, be required to give away a trade secret or the nature of the reason they want to have access to the particular software program, which could impede their ability to develop their intellectual technology. We have set out in our amendments that the person will be required to provide a number of additional items in a declaration, and these are set out in the terms of our amendments.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,30,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—In responding to the amendments now moved by the honourable member for Barton, the government accepts these amendments as well. They deal with aspects of the new enforcement measures for circumvention devices and services in proposed section 116A of the bill. These amendments will provide additional safeguards for copyright owners in relation to the manufacture and supply of circumvention devices for legitimate permitted purposes by ensuring the effectiveness of declarations made under the new provisions.
The opposition amendments are consistent with the policy of the government underpinning the new enforcement measure provisions. That policy has always been to provide copyright owners with effective tools to combat online piracy while still enabling reasonable access to copyright users under the recognised exceptions to copyright owners rights. I understand that my friend the honourable member for Barton will move similar amendments in relation to the criminal offence provisions in subsections 132(5A) and 132(5B) of the bill, as amended by amendments Nos 41 and 44 standing in my name. The government accepts these amendments moved by the honourable member for Barton.

This amendment is designed to recognise directors' copyright interests in films. Currently, section 90 of the act provides that the owner of the copyright in a film is the maker of the film, which is the producer or production company. We note that the United Kingdom and a number of European jurisdictions have already recognised directors' copyright, and we believe it is appropriate to recognise that the contribution of directors should be recognised so that they are included among the group of underlying rights holders who are remunerated for the retransmission of free-to-air broadcasts. So the opposition's amendments will provide that, in relation to films, the principal director is deemed to be a joint owner of any copyright subsisting in the film, together with the person owning any such copyright under section 90 of the act.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (DIGITAL AGENDA) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,30,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—The member for Barton will be disappointed to know that the spirit of bipartisanship spreads only so far in this place. This particular amendment proposes to include directors as joint owners of copyright subsisting in films for the purposes of remuneration under the proposed statutory licence for the retransmission of broadcasts, the part VC scheme. While the government is sympathetic to the arguments for recognition of directors as owners of copyright, we are not prepared to accept the opposition amendment at this time.
The government's proposed scheme, under part VC, will provide for the payment of equitable remuneration to all recognised copyright owners, including owners of copyright in film. Under the current law, the maker of a film is generally deemed to be the copyright owner. This is usually the producer. These arrangements are long standing and well recognised in the film industry. Given that directors are not specifically recognised as copyright owners, it would be premature for the part VC scheme to provide for their remuneration.
More importantly, the issue of directors' ownership of copyright in films is much broader than one of remuneration for the retransmission of films included in free-to-air broadcasts. For example, the Copyright Law Review Committee, in part 2 of its report on the simplification of the Copyright Act 1968, addressed the broad issue of ownership of copyright in different forms of copyright material, including films. It is clear, therefore, that this issue goes well beyond the scope of the digital agenda reforms. Accepting this proposal in relation to remuneration under the retransmission statutory licence would pre-empt a more comprehensive consideration of the issue of directors' copyright. For these reasons, the government does not accept amendment 8.

The government has closely considered the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and it has proposed a number of amendments to the bill in response to the committee's recommendations. Changes have also been made to the bill as a result of further consultation with key copyright interests, in addition to minor technical amendments. 
The committee's key recommendation was that the bill incorporate a right of first digitisation with limited exceptions. This was based upon the committee's concern about the ease of infringement of copyright material that has been converted from print to digital form. The government proposes to accept, in principle, the committee's key recommendation. This will be achieved through a package of amendments based on strengthening the enforcement regime for copyright owners in the digital domain. However, the government's response will address the recommendation without substantially limiting access to information by copyright users. 
The amendments include clarification of the bill so that the right of first digitisation is explicitly recognised as an economic right of copyright owners. The criminal penalties will be substantially increased where the offence involves the digitisation of copyright material. Further, the amendments will provide an explicit power for a court to award additional damages in a civil action where the infringement involves digitisation.
In addition, libraries will be required to provide notices which specifically refer to the increased criminal penalties and civil damages, so as to limit their authorisation liability. These changes will provide a greater disincentive to undertake infringing activity involving digitisation, in addition to sending a strong message against piracy. Another of the key recommendations of the committee was for the removal of the proposed definition of `library' under the bill. The definition currently excludes libraries owned by for-profit corporations from using the library exceptions. The government accepts the recommendation and believes that this issue requires further examination to assess the impact of the proposed definition on the ability of private libraries to participate in the inter-library network. 
Other amendments to the bill arising from the committee's advisory report include finetuning of the library and archives exceptions, the extension of the statutory licence under part VA of the act to enable educational and other institutions to communicate copies of broadcasts, the finetuning of the technological protection measure and electronic rights management information provisions, and the extension of the enforcement measures under the proposed part VAA to encoded free-to-air television broadcasts.
I present the explanatory memorandum for the government amendments. I have had to reduce the size of my speech due to the exigencies of time, but I do commend these amendments to the House.
—The opposition will agree to these amendments.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—The Australian Law Reform Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released a report in 1997 called Seen and heard: priority for children in the legal process. While a significant amount of the report's focus is on the juvenile justice system, it also deals with children as consumers in the justice system, the issue of abuse and particular responsibilities relating to children in care. It also advocates setting up an office of the child to coordinate the Commonwealth's approach to matters affecting the child. The report was tabled in this House in November 1997, and the government is yet to respond to it—three years later, no response and none imminent.
The victims and survivors of child abuse suffer a great deal, and over a lifetime. This is manifested in many ways. A great abuse has been perpetrated and the pain is horrible. Unfortunately, secondary suffering can occur because of the processes of disclosure. Finding and achieving justice for the victims and survivors of child abuse is often as painful and difficult as the primary suffering. Society acknowledges the rights of children and abhors any pain or suffering visited upon them, but try getting justice and support within the judicial system itself!
The legal processes appear to have failed young people. Admittedly, there have been improvements to the laws that govern children and child abuse, but these still lack a national uniformity. They tend to penalise retrospectivity, and definitions of a legally recognised and actionable harm resulting from the infliction of trauma are so specific, such as to result in a diagnosable medical condition or illness, that they make the process too difficult in the first place.
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which came into force in Australia in 1991, specifically sets out in Article 19 the Commonwealth's responsibility in relation to the protection of children from all forms of abuse and to follow up instances of maltreatment. Children and young people are frequently denied access to and appropriate participation in the legal processes that affect them. To address this, changes are urgently needed across all levels of government and across all jurisdictions. The Commonwealth must take on a leadership and coordination role in what is after all a national problem with national social and economic costs.
The recommendations of the 1997 national inquiry into children and the legal process are designed to give full effect to the right of children to be seen, heard and protected in the legal process, and with the full might of the law. Our children are our future. Abused children have an abused future. Australia's legal processes have consistently failed to recognise this fact by often ignoring, marginalising and mistreating children who turn to them for assistance. The 1997 report makes 286 recommendations to address disparities in the status of children before the law. Many of these recommendations are urgent and compelling. They affect children who are being abused or are exhibiting behaviours indicative of the pain which is often the result of being abused. They are breaking out rather than breaking free.
Mr Antrum of the New South Wales Law Society has written and campaigned extensively on the issue of child abuse and the legal rights of children. He wrote:
Neglect for children can start at home and work its way through all of our institutional and government frameworks because we do not give children a real voice. 
Victims of child abuse, their supporters and loved ones do not accept the traditional view of children—that they should remember their place, and that they should not make any sort of contribution until they are earning a wage and casting a vote. In short, they do not accept that children should be seen and not heard.
This positive view was shared by members of the 1997 inquiry. The report was deliberately and specifically titled Seen and heard: priority for children in the legal process. The law, whether it be in criminal, civil or family jurisdictions, makes the task of achieving justice for survivors and victims of child abuse very difficult. Michael Longbottom, of Advocates for Survivors Against Child Abuse, poignantly argues of the legal system, and particularly in relation to my home state of Tasmania:
Sadly the law by its nature can only be reactive not proactive in relation to sexual abuse. There is little evidence that punishment of criminals and awards of civil damages against perpetrators will deter offenders. The law provides some degree of justice for those who have been harmed but does little to prevent harm occurring in the first place.
A survivor once wrote:
I've looked the memories in the face and smelled their breath. They can't hurt me any more.
We must help other survivors be able to reach the same conclusion.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Child Abuse</title>,Adjournment,31,1
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—Today I want to raise the impact of this government's stance on the GE issue and the dangers to our export trade from introducing genetically modified organisms, GMOs, into our agricultural systems. I am especially concerned by the potential for damage to Tasmania's international clean green reputation and niche market advantage. Apart from the serious questions raised by sectors of the scientific community about food safety hazards and potentially catastrophic environmental damage as a consequence of unleashing the GE genie, the immediate concern for Australia, and Tasmania in particular, is that approval and release of GMOs into our backyard destroys our clean green marketing advantage and access to the escalating market demand for clean, safe products.
There has been widespread publicity concerning negative European reaction to GE produce, with GE bans implemented in Germany and France. Recent surveys in Japan reveal that two-thirds of Japanese trading houses do not want GE produce. The big multinationals who invest heavily in the GE technology, and are now under some threat, have initiated a highly coordinated campaign and have applied a great deal of pressure to attempt to influence state and federal governments.
Tasmania's reputation and vast economic potential in clean green produce exports is under threat not only from this government's GE policy but also from the activities of agents of the multinationals in Tasmania which are being kept secret from the public. It is very perplexing indeed that Buz Green, the chief executive of Serve-Ag, Tasmania's major supplier of agricultural chemicals and the company overseeing trials of GMO crops at secret locations in Tasmania, is also a member of the Tasmanian Development Board, which oversees the direction of Tasmania's Department of State Development.
Under the Bacon government, Tasmania has an active policy for organic industry development. The primary industry minister, David Llewellyn, has made it clear that the introduction of GMOs threatens clean food industry development. To me, it seems a blatant conflict of interest for Buz Green to provide a board advisory role to the department while leading the charge for GMO technology in Tasmania. It was only recently revealed that trials of GMOs on department of primary industry research farms were being conducted without the knowledge of the minister. Buz Green has led the pro-GMO public campaign in Tasmania, arguing that GE technology and organic or clean green production can coexist. What absolute rubbish that is.
Tasmanian food industry leaders have taken a strong stand against GE products. The Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, the Viticulture Association and the Tasmanian Beekeepers Association have declared support for a GE-free Tasmania. The success of Tasmania's niche market dairy produce for companies like King Island Dairies has been severely threatened by the introduction of GMOs, with customers demanding GE-free verification. I would urge all Tasmanians to work to ensure that our great state becomes a GE-free bastion.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Gene Technology: Tasmanian Food Production</title>,Statements by Members,33,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—I would like to take this opportunity to speak to the House on an issue which affects a large proportion of people in Townsville and Thuringowa in my electorate of Herbert. Many of you will know that within my electorate I have Australia's ready deployment force. It is my people who go when we need to go quickly, and we are very proud of that. It also happens to be the largest defence base in the Commonwealth of Australia, and of course Townsville is widely known as a garrison city. It has enjoyed that reputation since the time of World War II when there were 100,000 Americans based in Townsville in relation to the Coral Sea battles. 
There are units in Townsville which are exceedingly interested in the Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000. Apart from 3 Brigade and 11 Brigade, we have the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, 3 Brigade Administrative Support Battalion, 4 Field Regiment, 3/4 Cavalry Regiment, 5 Aviation Regiment—the celebrated Black Hawks who will be in the forefront of maintaining security at the Olympic Games—10/4 Four Support Battalion, 103 Signal Regiment and so on. We have a very large concentration of members of the ADF, and of course we cannot forget the 500 men and women at RAAF Townsville.
In accordance with the government's intentions to introduce flexible practices for members of the Australian Defence Force, this defence legislation amendment bill amends defence legislation to extend the limited tenure promotion scheme to the promotion of officers of the Army to the rank of lieutenant colonel and to the promotion of officers of the Navy to the rank of commander. The legislation also allows the rejection of a resignation of an officer of the Army or Navy which is tendered during an initial minimum period of service, and there have certainly been some difficulties associated with that, and this legislation will clarify that within the ADF. Finally, this legislation allows members of the Army and the Navy to change the nature of their appointment, whether they be officers or soldiers and sailors, from open-ended to fixed, and I think that that will certainly be welcome.
These amendments are part of a strategy to develop flexible employment practices to provide service chiefs with an enhanced ability to shape the defence uniformed workplace. I think that it is Defence following what is happening in the private sector. It is Defence making sure that it is up with modern business practices and certainly, in this sense, we will go forward to achieve those goals. I certainly know from my direct dealings with the ADF at Townsville's Lavarack Barracks that this sort of legislative amendment will free up the bureaucratic process of progress. More broadly, the bill supports the process of creating a more flexible employment environment in the Australian Defence Force.
I see the Navy has now joined us, and I welcome Townsville being made a home port base for the Navy where we can put the Tobruk, the Manoora and the Kanimbla—move them out of Sydney and up to where they are really needed. Instead of having a forward base in Townsville to support the 3rd Brigade, I think we should have a home port base. And to the Army, which have just joined us now as well, the ADF at Lavarack Barracks do a wonderful job for Australia out of Townsville, and it is great to see.
The bill has its origins in the 1995 Personnel Policy Strategy Review—the Glenn review. This report noted that the changes in the demographic and social trends needed to be matched by new personnel strategies in the Defence Force. The coalition government has delivered on its 1998 election undertaking to increase standards within the Australian Defence Force. We have maintained defence spending in line with forward estimates in the 1999-2000 budget. Indeed, Defence was the only element in the coalition's first budget which escaped any cuts to cover the deficit that was left by the previous government. That was warmly applauded by members in Townsville and Thuringowa.
I see too, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as you will have seen, yesterday's announcement by the government in relation to the consultative process that we are now going to go through in the lead-up to the white paper. The Prime Minister has said—and he has said this now on a number of occasions—that, in his view, we need to significantly increase funding in the defence forces. I see in this morning's press an amount of about $500 million was flagged for the next budget, and that will be welcomed by officers and men of the Australian Defence Force. Not many people will know that we gave an undertaking in 1998 to create an Office of the Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, and to provide $10 million to the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation to conduct research into RMA. 
The government also indicated an undertaking to invest in chemical, biological and radiological defence, as well as addressing the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar and Collins class submarine projects. It is a matter of history now that the Defence Minister, John Moore, who I think is probably one of the best defence ministers this country has had, has faced up to the problems with those projects and, in a proper businesslike manner, has indicated quite clearly that it is the government's intention to get those things back on the rails, to get them fixed and not let them bump along the bottom as they had been doing. It was a breath of fresh air when the minister looked at the Collins class submarine project and indicated that he was not going to take any nonsense on what was going on. He wanted to know what the situation was and he wanted to get it fixed. The government is certainly going in that direction.
It is interesting that, in 1996-97, we were able to redirect $125 million of Labor's administrative waste towards capability related initiatives, including the acquisition of night fighting equipment, additional Harpoon missiles and air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons. I believe $125 million is quite a bit of money to do that; and that was in relation to our vision that the resources of the ADF had to be where the action was. An efficiency review of defence was commissioned and led to the announcement of the Defence Reform Program in April 1997. On maturity, the DRP will realise ongoing efficiency in excess of $900 million every year and a one-off saving of $500 million to be redirected to combat capability. 
I know that there was some cynicism about that in the ADF, but currently the DRP is ahead of schedule in its task of achieving those savings and those savings are being redirected to the sharp end. By the end of 1998-99 there were accumulative achieved ongoing savings of something over a quarter of a billion dollars per annum and that was ahead of the schedule that the government expected.
Under Labor, Australian Defence Force personnel numbers were cut and little was done to increase combat capability. In fact I think it is fair to say, and any reasonable person would draw the conclusion, that under the previous government combat capability was certainly run down. That is the advice that I received time after time. The Army's self-assessment after the previous government was that units were not adequately prepared for combat, the Army lacked sufficient combat power and, with some exceptions, units were understaffed, poorly equipped and had a low readiness level. Of course, that is not taking into account where the morale was.
This bill addresses some of the fundamental problems that were created and it is good to see that the government is moving forward in being proactive in relation to the ADF. Commonwealth expenditure on defence, of course, was steadily reduced in the time of the last government. Defence outlays as a proportion of total budget outlays declined from 9.4 per cent to eight per cent. I think that that was noted by the ADF and, of course, administrative inefficiency was rife. Not wanting to be unkind, many used to say that the most bureaucratic organisation in the country was the ABC. That has certainly changed these days. Some have then said that it is CASA. I have just been with Mick Toller and I think that his organisation is changing—
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the flow of eloquence of the member for Herbert but, apart from one glancing reference to the subject of the bill, he has spoken now for 11 minutes and has not mentioned flexible career practices. I encourage him to spend some of his time at least on discussing the subject of the bill. 
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will conclude on that point, with your indulgence, by saying that perhaps the most inefficient organisation may now be the Australian Defence Force. In relation to the issues we are speaking about today, they will enable the ADF to get the efficiencies that they need. They will allow for flexibility in the nature of appointments to the ADF. They will prevent the problem which arises where an officer wants to resign from the service during the initial minimum period of service. The extension of the limited tenure promotion scheme to officers in the Army must also be commended. This bill has the support of members of the ADF in my patch. They have asked me to relay that to the parliament. I indicate my strong support as well.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FLEXIBLE CAREER PRACTICES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I am pleased to follow the previous speaker, the member for Herbert, who gave a very wide ranging address in relation to Defence Force matters, some aspects of which, as you rightly pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, did not have anything to do with the defence forces. I will make my contribution relevant to the defence forces. I acknowledge that the purpose of the Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000, as outlined in the Bills Digest, is to amend the legislative conditions governing the appointment and retention of Army and Navy officers and enlisted members by, firstly, extending the limited tenure promotion scheme to ranks of lieutenant colonel in the Army or commander in the Navy, or higher ranks; secondly, permitting Army and Navy officers and enlisted members to voluntarily change their appointment from open-ended to a fixed term; and, thirdly, allowing the rejection of the resignation of an officer who has not served a minimum period after appointment to that rank.
As the Digest points out, one of the issues confronting the Defence Force at the moment is the question of separation rates. In 1998-99 the separation rate was 14 per cent. Those of us who have been following issues related to the defence forces will know of the difficulties that the defence forces have had with recruitment, and now with this question of retention. There is a question relating to the levels at which people can be recruited. Those are issues which are being confronted in this parliament by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its inquiry into the Army. 
I am pleased to support the amendments that are before the Main Committee today. I acknowledge that they are as a result of the inquiry which was undertaken by Graham Glenn in 1995. He conducted a comprehensive review of trends and factors which influence and impact upon defence personnel policies. I think this is very important. Defence personnel policies are something which I am acutely aware of, and something which I have raised in this House as recently as last week. I will come back to it in a moment.
The Defence Personnel Policy Strategy Review—the Glenn review—made a large number of recommendations, as the Bills Digest describes, relating to employment, work practices, pay entitlements, family support, training, education and the reserves. Several of these recommendations related to flexible work practices, a fundamental change from the notion of a lifetime military career. The Glenn review stated:
We favour greater choice, flexibility and options ... We are proposing a fundamental shift away from traditional (reactive) recruiting practices and from what for many members is an undertaking of a lifetime career from the outset. In this context, we favour a system of constant recruitment and what we have called phased careers with Fixed Terms of Employment to stabilise the recruitment of people and permit more effective management and control of separations.
That is fine but, as I have had reason to observe in recent days, there appears to be a great deal of rhetoric coming from senior levels of Defence and, indeed, from this government about the importance of defence personnel issues. I note the contribution of the previous speaker, in which he commented on the state of affairs when this government came to office. Among other things, he talked about low morale and said that, in his view, the defence forces were poorly equipped and had low levels of readiness. I can say to him that that has very clearly been the case. It has been demonstrated very clearly that in terms of a review to our operations in East Timor what we have demonstrated is clearly how this government has dropped the ball in relation to the defence forces. The questions of readiness, recruitment, separations and morale are issues which have not been properly addressed by the current government. 
There is a great deal of independent advice and of work which has been done to analyse our engagement in East Timor. There is absolutely no doubt that those Defence Force personnel who have been involved in that deployment have given exemplary service to this nation and the East Timorese community. But the defence forces could have given it a hell of a lot better had they been properly kitted, had the defence personnel issues been properly and adequately addressed and had the morale issues, which are significant in defence forces currently, been properly addressed.
In this chamber last week, on that very issue of morale in the defence forces, I raised with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence a significant issue which is confronting Defence Force personnel in northern Australia currently and which has not been addressed: remote locality leave and fringe benefits as they affect armed forces personnel. On 21 June the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in his contribution to this chamber, said:
I thank members from the other side of the House for their contributions. They raise important issues in relation to the operation of the Defence Force—both civilian and defence personnel matters. As to remote locality leave travel, the FBT and housing relocation, those are issues of which I have been made aware. I thank the member for Reid for his contribution about defence civilians and the operations in East Timor.
I will be taking these issues up with the head of the Defence Personnel Executive because they are issues that I take seriously. I know you want answers as soon as possible. I flag that this is something that I will take up at a serious level and get back to you as soon as we can get the head of the Defence Personnel Executive in to discuss these important issues. You have raised some very genuine concerns which we will have investigated as soon as possible.
He went on, after I made another contribution to the debate, to say:
I inform the member for the Northern Territory that I certainly will get back to you as soon as I can get a response from the head of the executive in personnel. Since coming to this office this government has been committed to ensuring veterans receive proper recognition for their service to our nation in times of war and also conflict.
I have yet to hear from the minister. I do not know if it has taken him eight days to get the head of the Defence Personnel Executive in to discuss these issues, but I have had no response.
—There is nothing new in that.
—As my colleague and comrade has said, there is nothing new in that—I am not surprised. On 26 June, I wrote to the Hon. Bruce Scott, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, saying:
I refer to matters I raised during the Main Committee deliberations on the Appropriations Bill last Wednesday. I again raise the question of the remote locality leave travel and the question of FBT.
It is important that we understand the context of this, because the signals that have been sent to Defence Force personnel indicate that they will materially have their entitlements affected as of 1 July with the implementation of the GST. This will affect their remote locality leave travel in a way which I know will seriously undermine the morale of Defence Force personnel in Northern Australia. It seems to be of no consequence to this government that this issue has been around for some weeks and yet they have done precious little to address the consequences of it. 
Last week in the chamber I referred to a couple of signals which had been made available to me. One came out a couple of days prior to my contribution and gave an update on the remote locality leave travel issue and said that it would be impacted upon by the GST. Previously, I had been informed that due to the contracting arrangements with Qantas—because this was the issue—Defence Force personnel would be left with a 32 per cent decrease in the payment equivalent of their remote locality leave travel entitlement. I addressed this issue—again, in this parliament—to Major General Willis at a joint parliamentary committee hearing, and he said that he would see to it that it was fixed. 
I am sorry to say that, despite the good intentions of Major General Willis and the undertakings given by Minister Scott, nothing has been achieved to date. I had said previously that, if you cashed out the remote locality leave travel, you would get the equivalent of 68 per cent of an economy airfare between Darwin and Adelaide. But the new signal, which I quoted last week in the parliament, informed us all that in fact that figure would be 62 per cent because you had to also allow for the GST.
I raised significant issues in relation to those issues, and they are on the record. I have, in light of my statements to the minister, this letter which I have written which goes to 2½ pages. I will not regale the Main Committee with the details in this document, but suffice it to say that I have made it readily available to the following people: the Minister for Defence, John Moore; the shadow minister for defence, the Hon. Seven Martin; the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson; Major General Simon Willis; Brigadier Robert Brown; and all Northern Australian Defence Force personnel. This letter has been liberally sprinkled throughout Northern Australian Defence Force bases so that they can be aware of the issues I have raised on their behalf in this place and formally in correspondence with the minister responsible for assisting the Minister for Defence and involved in personnel issues.
It is incumbent upon the government to deal with this issue now. It is not an issue which can go beyond Saturday because the entitlements of Defence Force personnel, as I have pointed out, are going to be materially affected come 1 July. I say to the Minister for Defence, the minister assisting him and the ADF executive that they have to fix this problem now. They should be in no doubt, despite the rhetoric of the member for Lindsay, that the morale levels of Defence Force personnel in Northern Australia are plummeting. They are plummeting because they have been done over by this government. 
It is all very well for the minister to this week release his good governance document to underpin defence renewal. I read through the documentation that came out with this material, and the only reference I could find to defence personnel issues was a diagrammatic representation under the heading `Defence Matters', where `defence strategy' is sitting at the top and there is a big arrow coming down to `people matter'. Too right they matter!If we want effective strategy, if we want effective implementation of defence policy, then we need a defence force which has high morale, not low morale. We need a defence force which is being properly and adequately treated by this government in relation to Defence Force personnel matters. And these are not the only issues.
I say to the government, that if they are pretending that somehow or other they are adequately and appropriately managing Defence Force personnel issues, they are clearly wrong. I note the fanfare with which the Defence review 2000—Our future defence force document was released yesterday. I note the fanfare with which the document on the organisation of defence was released earlier in the week. No such fanfare is given to addressing the key fundamental, basic and important issues of Defence Force personnel. I say to the minister: it is time action was taken. I know the Armed Forces Federation have been vocal in raising these issues but, unfortunately, despite their input, despite the fact they have been showing the warning signs and flying the flag, the warning signs have not been seen or read, and they certainly have not been properly understood. 
Separation rates are an issue—of that there is no doubt. Recruitment is an issue—of that there is no doubt. If you want to retain people in the Defence Force and if you want to recruit people to the Defence Force, you must provide the best possible conditions of service. Despite what this bill before us aims to do, we are not going to impact positively on retention rates in a way which will materially affect their performance to date unless and until you address these key issues of Defence Force conditions. If you do not believe that there will be an increase in separation rates if this question of remote locality leave travel is not fixed, then you are sadly mistaken.
This is a very important issue. Whilst this bill aims to address at the margin some personnel issues, it seems to me that key and fundamental questions about how we deal with our Defence Force personnel have slipped. We have seen statements about numbers of personnel being cut and the question of priorities for defence purchases—capital equipment. It is all very well having the really smart technology but, if the troops in the field are unhappy, it will not work. I am pleased that we have this Defence Force discussion process in place. I hope the government understands that I am raising these issues not for any political partisan purpose but simply to assure that Defence Force personnel in this country are properly and adequately dealt with.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FLEXIBLE CAREER PRACTICES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—It is a pleasure and an honour to follow the honourable member for the Northern Territory in this debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000 as no-one more fearlessly, ruthlessly and relentlessly pursues the interests of so many ADF members who are proud to call the Territory home. As the shadow minister said, it is a rare honour to participate in a defence debate in this House and I do not want to miss the opportunity.
The member for the Northern Territory touched on morale. Let me just say that John Moore, the Minister for Defence, is in a way our wartime minister. The thing he is consistently and constantly doing is declaring war on his department. The secretary of his department receives a bonus for good performance but the minister demands that he be sacked. The minister is unhappy and dissatisfied with the hierarchy at Russell; he declares war on them. The key feature of his ministry is his often-declared declarations of war. The same minister cannot be trusted to make a ministerial statement after the lodging of the green paper yesterday. He cannot be trusted to participate in an MPI without a written speech. And, if the questions he is asked are not covered by his brief, he gives a frivolous answer—all this at a crucial time for Defence.
Australia has celebrated the performance of our troops in East Timor. They performed superbly well, and it should come as no surprise to any Australian that that was the case. But where has the minister taken the Australian people into his confidence by talking about all the difficulties that East Timor potentially posed for us? Remember when the opposition—who gave unqualified, bipartisan support to that operation—raised the issue of troop rotation. What did the minister say? `Don't you worry about that.' What did the junior minister say? `Don't you worry about that.' It was only when the public relations spokesman for the ADF blew the minister out of the water that we got a serious response and that need was covered with an additional 3,000 full-time troops. 
The member for the Northern Territory talks about morale. It is true that we managed that well. I am not so sure how we would have gone had the deployment to East Timor, in its initial phases, been not a short period but much longer. We are not able at this stage to say and talk realistically about what our Army contains. The Army will not, as far as this parliament or parliamentary committee is concerned, take us into their confidence and tell us how stretched they were in East Timor: the hollowness of the formed units of the Army. A lot of coalition members have said that they are delighted about the extra $20 million that is being spent on reserves, but we do not know what the government envisages as the structure of reserves. We know that there are two cabinet submissions languishing there, not publicised, no minister taking us into their confidence, notwithstanding the green paper being issued. We know that reserves were used to slot in vacancies in the Regular Army, but is that what we have got a reserve for, to plug the holes? Or should we have a reserve capable of being deployed into formed units?
The Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000 is an utter betrayal of the serving men and women of the armed forces. The member for the Northern Territory referred to the Glenn report of a review of personnel practices within the ADF. It was tabled in 1995, if my memory serves me correctly. When the coalition took over, they demonised not only the Glenn review but also Army 21 and the restructuring of the Army. The report of the Glenn review has a host of recommendations to deal with the future structure of the ADF. And what are we getting? One paltry, lousy element of it.
What about the issue that we should continue to promote on the basis of rank, but that we may need to reward people not by promotion of rank? Where is the flexibility that the Glenn review sought for ADF careers? Being part of a war fighting machine—and that is what our ADF is—is a young person's game. Gone are the days when we can think in terms of 25- and 30-year careers in the ADF. Young people frankly do not want it. Where is the flexibility that Glenn envisaged about being able to put young people into full-time service, allowing them the flexibility of part-time service and even, in some cases, being able to opt out?
Quite rightly the ADF should be proud of the level of recruitment of females serving in other ranks and at officer level. We invested a lot of money in them and, of course, they naturally want to have families. How is this bill about careers and the Glenn review and its host of recommendations accommodating that fact? We invest thousands of dollars in their training, but how can they opt out for a period of time to have a family and then have the ADF and the Australian people not lose that investment? This bill is called `flexible careers' and there is not one mention of it.
If you talk to serving men and women in the ADF, they will tell you that family considerations rate highly. Whether that is the employment opportunities of a spouse or whether that is the education of their children, these things are very important, but where in this flexible careers bill is there any mention of that? There is absolutely none. That is why I say it is a betrayal of serving men and women. Admittedly, this was a Labor government document. Just because it is a Labor government document we should not react in an ideological way and say there is nothing worth while in it. But after six years, when you bring in a bill called flexible careers, wouldn't you think that some of the Glenn recommendations might be embraced? Well, they are not. And who are the losers? As the honourable member for the Northern Territory said, it is the serving men and women. In fact, it is Australia really, but it is also the serving men and women.
To move on to the reserves, it is an absolute tragedy that we have a white paper coming out and we are saying we are going to ask the people of Australia to consult and we are going to look at their views, but the reserves at the moment, as everyone knows, are a phantom army. The recruitment problems are horrific. In fact, the only person who has come to us in the current inquiry into the preparedness of Army with a bit of new thought and innovation has been a brigadier from Victoria. And what has he done? He has tried to target school leavers and university students to fill up the reserves. But there is nothing in here, notwithstanding a whole chapter devoted to the reserves, notwithstanding $20 million allocated to the reserves in the budget, where we get a clue of what the government's thinking is about the reserves. 
Indeed, the crucial issue about reserves is entry level training. How much can employers afford to have their reserves away from work, for how long? And what were we told? Yes, there was a special committee advising Defence and one of the people on it was a representative of the chamber, but the chamber had never been asked what its opinion was and it disagreed with the position the ADF currently has. They moved to a block of six weeks training. I thought that was a good idea. They are now going to move to break it up into two lots of three weeks. There is a big issue here. Is it better to spend more time initially and maybe compensate employers, but get a whole raft of training in and then go out to your unit, or can the Australian economy no longer bear it? The other thing I might say, again in a bitter ideological way, is that the first thing this government did was to get rid of a very successful system, the Ready Reserves. And had we had the Ready Reserves, guess what? We could have actually deployed reserves in formed units over to East Timor, something that we could not do notwithstanding the 18,000 reserves that we have currently on our books—this phantom army.
When I say it is a phantom army, I do not want to reflect on individual reservists. They are dedicated people. They are actually making a commitment for Australia. The only thing that is absent is a bit of leadership. And if you are talking about leadership, does it not go to the Prime Minister and the minister? Can we sustain, under current structures, the reserves that we have today? It is a big question. You will not find it in the white paper. You will not find a decent discussion on it. Do we need to return to something like a Ready Reserve scheme? You will not find that in the white paper either. What is the proper role for the reserves? Is it merely to slot in the gaps? If it is, this is new defence theology. I say that there is an acid test. Yes, we have got the glamour reserve units—the doctors, the dentists and the lawyers. We have got our northern surveillance forces, all doing an excellent job, and they fit in and mesh into the ADF very well. But for the rest of the reserves, this is the acid test: if you cannot be deployed into formed units, then forget about it. We need to come to another structure. 
I want to make another point. This parliament had a report into officer training. That report recommended that the ADFA undergraduate program be abolished because it is the costliest undergraduate program in Australia, maybe in the world, but certainly in Australia. They are well above their peer group. The report proposed that we should encourage about 1,000 people spread over about 34 universities to undertake their undergraduate training. Maybe I am reading it wrong, but I never thought that undergraduate training was a core business of defence. 
The point is this, that when people join the ADF they really want to do things like driving tanks, flying planes, driving ships, as soon as possible. I know that the Navy has changed its approach and will get ADFA undergraduates out to sea for a period. But this is the big point, that you cannot afford to have young people tied up for four years in training, or as much as six years in training, before they get to do the things that they want to do. It is a much better system to have people under a scholarship basis while they are at universities, and then have them undertake their rigorous military training. That is a much quicker way of getting them out to their particular units, doing the things that they want to do. It was true when I brought the report down in 1995, and it is still true today. But again, if we are looking at flexible careers, there is not a mention of it is in this bill.  
Of course, the other penalty you pay is this: admittedly, the recruitment level is absolutely down for ADFA, but you are spending more than half your professional development budget on the most junior officers. I have forgotten the numbers, but there used to be about 13,000 officers. In other words, 1,000 junior officers at ADFA get more than 50 per cent of the budget. The other 12,000 officers only get 50 per cent. Increasingly, not only will we have to invest in young people in the ADF for our own purposes, but we will need to think of what they require when they finish their careers and go out into the world of work. We need to have money in things like professional development that not only looks at their career in the ADF but also assists them in transitioning into the workplace. That is true about officers, but it is also true about the ordinary men and women in other ranks.
As I said at the beginning, we are not going to be able to keep young people for extended periods of time—the luxury the ADF used to have. I think it is entirely appropriate, if someone has given sterling service in an infantry unit or at an RAAF base on the ground, that towards the end of their career we spend some Commonwealth dollars in preparing them for the world at work once they leave the service. There is not a thing in this bill about it. Six years the parliament and ministers have had—four years of conservative ministers—to absorb this Glenn report and do the decent thing not only by the ADF to secure its own future but also by the people who sign up to serve. You have done very little. I could use some colourful language that I regret would be unparliamentary, but in deference to the Deputy Speaker I will try and exercise some control. 
This is a severe time of change for the ADF. As we ponder the difficulties of issues like obsolescence, what is the appropriate force structure, where should we be operating, where should we have our strength, the real goal in the ADF is its people. The ADF not only believes so but says, `Our people give us an edge on the battlefield.' We just should not sit back and cop it. We have to give them things. There has to be some reciprocity. We cannot have them enmeshed in legislation, in regulations, in practices that are outdated.
So do I support this bill? Of course I do. It is an important change. But when you look at the Glenn review, it is but one change. What about all the other recommendations? Will we get a statement from the minister saying whether any progress has been made and, in particular, when the government intend to bring the legislation forward? It is a great irony that the government—I think around November or January—announced that they were going to change the legislation in regard to the call-out of reserves. I support it very strongly. But where is the legislation? We can get this bill up—as insultingly small as it is—about the call-out of the ADF because of the Olympics, but we cannot tackle the really hard issues. 
I will finish where I started. If this is supposed to look after the serving men and women in terms of providing a career service, this legislation represents a betrayal of them.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FLEXIBLE CAREER PRACTICES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—Firstly, I thank the members for Herbert, the Northern Territory and Chifley for their contributions. The member for Herbert spoke on the government's commitment to restructuring and improving readiness of the ADF. Certainly, as is indicated by this bill, the Defence Legislation (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000, the member for the Northern Territory focused particularly on issues relating to the ADF in his home state. The member for Chifley, while covering some broader issues, focused specifically on the ADF. He also raised concerns about the suggested inadequacy of what we are proposing today. But I suggest to the member for Chifley that consultation is continuing. That will be used in a further refinement of a personnel policy, which will, of course, be enabled by proposed amendments that we are putting through at the moment in this legislation.  
With regard to the reserves, our government is very much committed to enhancing the reserves as part of integrated ADF legislation which it is aimed will be introduced into the parliament during the spring session. Those on the other side have seen the reserves very much as a cost-cutting measure, not as an enhancement of the ADF's capabilities. The Australian Defence Force commits significant resources to training its personnel and therefore has a responsibility to retain them in service. On the other hand, the Defence Force must also ensure that personnel are not retained in service simply because of their seniority. From my experience during a number of years in the services back in the 1970s, one of the complaints was that people seemed to be retained very much on the basis of the time that they served rather than their ability to do the job that they were employed to do. I think this is a great change in focus and something that will enhance the capability of the ADF.
In order to manage these sometimes competing requirements, the Australian Defence Force uses a number of flexible employment practices. These include limited tenure promotion, whereby personnel are offered promotion on the basis that they will retire at the end of a period of service in a higher rank or they will revert to their previous rank; enlistment of personnel for an initial minimum period of service in order to recover investments in the entry level training of personnel; and the Defence Force now makes greater use of fixed periods of service rather than permanent appointments for personnel in some occupations. Taken together, these provisions assist the Australian Defence Force in balancing the need to retain personnel in some occupations while maintaining healthy rates of turnover in other occupations. These provisions are already used sparingly but with good effect in the Australian Defence Force. 
The bill amends the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act in order to extend or facilitate the application of these provisions. In particular, the bill will extend the application of limited tenure promotion to the promotion of officers of the Army to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and officers of the Navy to the rank of Commander. It will allow Defence Force personnel to transfer from permanent appointments to fixed periods of service and it will allow rejection of an officer's resignation tendered during their initial minimum period of service.
I would like to elaborate on this final provision in relation to questions raised in the House on 26 June by the member for Reid. The initial periods of service referred to in the legislation have been discussed by ADF policy stakeholders and agreed as follows: four years for most officers; a shorter period, or waived altogether, for some direct entry officers, such as doctors and lawyers, et cetera. In addition it should be noted that the fixed periods of service referred to in existing policy on this issue, introduced on 1 July 1998, will become redundant when the legislation and consequential policy are implemented. These fixed periods of service served an interim administrative purpose only. Existing return of service obligations—ROSO—will continue to be used for officers who undertake long periods of entry training, such as the Australian Defence Force Academy. ROSO will be acquitted concurrently with an officer's initial period of service; that is, once the initial period of service has been completed, any outstanding portion of the ROSO will still need to be acquitted.
I am pleased to note that ADF personnel have been advised and consulted about details of the proposed changes. The proposal has been developed following a very long process of consultation with stakeholders. There has also been an extensive program of consultation across Australia, reaching 6,000 personnel directly, in addition to focus group discussions involving a further 600 personnel. Consultation, as I said earlier, continues, and is being used to further refine the personnel policy covered by the proposed amendments in the legislation. 
In conclusion, the enhancements introduced by the bill will create opportunities for the advancement of specialist personnel who might otherwise not have been considered widely employable enough to merit promotion. This should assist in retaining those skilled personnel. It will allow the Australian Defence Force to ensure that the right person is placed in the right job at the right time, rather than simply because they are at the head of the promotion queue. Finally, the bill will assist the ADF in recovering its investment in the training of its personnel by ensuring that officers serve for an initial period of service after their appointment and training. In short, these changes are sensible and useful enhancements to the way the Defence Force does business.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I rise to address the government's response to what is known as the Neville report, entitled Planning not patching. In doing so, let me quote from the first paragraph in the preface to the report: `Planning not patching is essential if Australia is to have the best possible transport system to service industry and community needs.' I also quote from a media release which was issued when this report was tabled in the federal parliament on 24 November 1997. Mr Paul Neville, the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, said:
The Commonwealth needs to place a greater emphasis on strategic planning in the provision of transport infrastructure. The call for a national strategic plan for transport is not new but it is overdue.
In the almost three years since that report was tabled, we have seen the government's response. We have seen the written response—the document which we are considering today. More importantly, we have seen the response of the government in its budgetary allocations for road funding for transport infrastructure. In particular, we have seen in the past week that Australia has a government which really does not understand the transport problem. This was evidenced particularly by the Prime Minister's response when he tried to explain why petrol should not get dearer under the GST. He said, `There will be a huge saving of 24c a litre for diesel.' If the Prime Minister had done his sums correctly, he would have found that that equates to a saving of about 12c a kilometre for a B-double; less for a semi-trailer. It should be noted that a B-double carries in the order of 65,000 litres of petroleum product. By way of example, for a 500 kilometre haul from a fuel port that accesses 95 per cent of the Australian population, the maximum saving per litre is less than one-tenth of a cent per litre. This means that your fuel price goes from, say, 95.9c to 95.8c—if you can pass it on. That is meaningless in a tank of fuel for the consumer.
Let us extrapolate it a little further because we are not always talking about litres of petrol. We might be talking about cans of soup. We might be talking about cartons of apples or kilos of beef. In every situation the saving is minimal and it really does not address the problem that transport in this country is facing. Yet the government persists. We had a minister in question time yesterday in answer to a question say that regional and rural Australia is going to experience massive benefits from this government's policy of cutting fuel excise. It is not going to happen, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly. You know that in your electorate, I know that in my electorate and the whole of regional Australia is starting to get the picture now. In fact, as a result of the new tax system and GST, transport will get dearer, not cheaper.  
The response by the transport industry to the government's action shows how little support there is for the government's policy. We need to look at improving infrastructure, reducing haul times, reducing turnaround times and allowing the size of loads to increase. These factors have already yielded significant reduction in haulage rates. As a matter of fact, I have a table here that shows the reduction in haulage rates between Newcastle and Melbourne. In 1990 trucking costs were about $37.50 an hour and the cartage rate per tonne between Newcastle and Melbourne was $49.10. Now, although costs have increased enormously to $72 per hour, haulage rates are $47.50.
The government comes along and says that reducing diesel by 24c a litre is going to bring about another massive reduction. It will not. Those rates have dropped because the time for a trip from Newcastle to Melbourne has been reduced by the building of a you-beaut highway and because of the increase in weight of loads that can be carried by trucks, so you carry more tonnes per trip and you reduce time. They are the factors that have reduced transport costs, not fuel costs because we have seen fuel costs virtually double in that period of time and yet the haulage costs have still gone down.
I elected to speak on this issue today because the report does recognise the importance of upgrading infrastructure and I support that. The shame is that we have a government that does not recognise the importance of the upgrade of infrastructure. The Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, certainly does not recognise it. How do I know? The budget tells me so. 
Where was the money to improve road infrastructure in this year's federal budget? It was not there. There was no new money for the Sydney to Brisbane upgrade of the Pacific Highway which is now stalling in many places. The funding was withdrawn from the Karuah bypass in the northern part of my electorate by former Minister Vaile in a fit of pique prior to the last election. To my knowledge that funding has not been reinstated by the federal government and we now find that the construction of that vital bypass which is necessary to get rid of a major bottleneck on the Pacific Highway will not start for two years. The ridiculous situation is that there will be, within a few months, a non-stop four-lane divided highway from Sydney to Karuah, which will then close down to a two-lane bridge and two lanes of tar-sealed road through to Bulahdelah, and which will spread out again to four lanes of concrete divided highway. This is the sort of ridiculous stop-go policy that is evident in this government today and it is the sort of thing that is driving the transport industry absolutely mad. The transport industry cannot cope with that. They need first-class highways and, where we have them, we have already seen that costs have dropped. That is the sort of support that we need from a government. 
I am very pleased that, in my first term in the federal parliament, I was heavily involved in convincing Minister Brereton that the upgrade of the Pacific Highway should happen. At that stage, the federal government's contribution was going to be $1 billion. We now find that that has shrunk to $600 million. We also find that funding for the national highway has shrunk. There is a concept that there is a national highway right around Australia and that the funding for that is the responsibility of the federal government. That funding has also shrunk under this government. My office is currently located in the major regional city of Maitland. This city is divided by the national highway. The highway passes right through the middle of it, cutting that major city into two. The turmoil that creates for a city is ridiculous. We have been planning, planning, planning. There is always money for planning, never money for construction. We are never prepared to take the action and build the road, and that is the ridiculous situation we are in. 
We had the ludicrous situation in the budget this year where $8.3 million was provided for the whole state of New South Wales to upgrade bridges to allow them to take heavy loads. I represent five local government areas. Every one of these areas could spend that money each year for the next 10 years and, at the end of 10 years, they would still not have all their bridges upgraded to a satisfactory standard. It is a major problem. We are talking about timber bridges that are nearly a century old carrying modern semitrailers in rural and regional Australia. Where does $8.3 million to replace them go? It certainly will not do the job. It is ludicrous and members here know that it is ludicrous.
This report ignores the nature of our trucking industry, its composition and its make-up. We have some large operators—the Linfox type of operation. Those organisations own their own trucks and employ their drivers. They run very good businesses and do very well. There are also large operators such as Toll and K&S that own some trucks but use large numbers of subcontractors—owner-drivers—and, of course, the primary contractor sets the rate. The subcontractor has to accept that rate, and this is where the problem is. In Australia today, we have in the order of 25,000 owner-driver operators who work as subcontractors, and the problem is that these people are hurting the most. They are being screwed by the major contractors. They are being told that, with the advent of the GST, their costs will have to come down. I have one such letter here. It is a GST bulletin that has gone out from one of those major contractors that I have identified. It shows that the supposed cost reduction of fuel between Melbourne and Newcastle will be $178. It shows that the supposed reduction in cost of tyres will be $15.40. However, it does say that the cost of administration by the major contractor will go up. The subcontractor is being told that the net cost to be passed on to the major contractor is $183.
The situation is this: two months ago tyres went up by 15 per cent; that is not accounted for. Over the last 18 months, the price of diesel has escalated by more than the 23c that it is now going to drop; that is not accounted for. We have 25,000 owner-driver operators in Australia that are currently working on virtually zero margins. I talk to the trucking industry and they tell me that, if they take a load of steel to Queensland, they often bring back a load from Queensland without recovering costs. They do it just to pay for the fuel to get home so they can get another load that pays. That is the sort of principle that our transport industry is currently operating on, and it will not work.
There is going to come a point in the near future when these people will be insolvent. It has been suggested to me that many of our transport operations are currently operating insolvently. The owner-drivers have put forward a four-point plan. While it does contain some areas of state jurisdiction, it also contains some areas of federal jurisdiction. It is a worthy proposal and it should not be dismissed. I know that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Deputy Prime Minister, has dismissed a number of the points that have been made, such as a base floor rate for transport. If we are going to have any certainty in our transport industry, if we are going to have an industry that allows us to move forward as a nation, then people in this business have to be guaranteed the right to make a living.
In conclusion, if Australia is going to have a transport system that will generate competitiveness in rural and regional areas, we must have a massive injection of funding into infrastructure. I believe the way we look at infrastructure expenditure in Australia is wrong. We look at money spent on upgrading major highways, road and rail interchanges and port facilities to increase handling rates as a cost. We should not look at it as a cost. We should look at it as an investment that yields enormous dividends. There are examples around Australia. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway has already shown the development, the relocation of industry and the creation of jobs that that infrastructure creates. Until we have a government that is prepared to be objective and to look positively at infrastructure expenditure we will be condemned to having a second-rate transport system from the last century.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—In July 1995, the standard gauge was completed and I was honoured to be at the ceremony when the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, opened that standard gauge from Brisbane to Perth. I put on the record that that government achieved that outcome and I commend them for that because the objective of standardising the gauge from Brisbane to Perth had been on the books since 1923. That government invested $440 million to achieve that outcome. We know that parts of the track were not properly done, especially in parts of the electorate of Corangamite, but I do record the outstanding achievement of actually standardising the gauge across Australia. The new concept that was developed during that time was the ARTC with rail access, and I will talk more about that. The regulations that had historically been state based now moved to a more nationally based operation. During that time, of course, there were also safety concerns.
The government's response this morning is to three reports. The first is the Neville report—I personally participated very vigorously in every inspection and in questioning every witness. The second is the Smorgon report which, it is fair to say, took a number of the recommendations from the Neville report. The third is the Productivity Commission report, which again was a fairly independent assessment of the rail industry, but utilised some of the evidence of the Tracking Australia report. Certainly the harmonisation of the state based rail operations was a key feature. The Neville report and the other two reports focused on that possible outcome.
The sale of the rail operations of AN now means that a number of those operations—the Ghan, the IndianPacific and the Melbourne to Adelaide run—are moving towards profitability, having more passengers and becoming much more commercial. The sale of the freight operation in Victoria, V/Line, to Freight Australia has opened up remarkable new opportunities in terms of timber, wheat and other merchandise. Tasrail has been a remarkable success—an operation which was fundamentally broke for 100 years is now operating in profit.
The fundamental thing we should address is that the federal government has allocated $250 million to rail operations upgrade and yet, on a year by year basis in Australia, the federal and state governments allocate $6 billion to road construction. It is very important, in this whole discussion, to recall that. We need an upgrade of the basic rail network structure. Governments, both state and federal, have failed to invest for all kinds of historical reasons. The sale of National Rail—which, in my assessment, has done a remarkable job of connecting capital cities, by means of the standard rail gauge and the National Rail operations—to the private sector will be another step in the right direction. Remembering that National Rail had to overcome the culture of every state government and, given the difficulties, I think its results have been commendable.
I turn now to some brief comment on the specifics of the recommendations. On the national transport policy: this is an argument about rail versus road. There is some reluctance by the road operators to allow the rail industry to get a fair go. The road industry has had a very strong lobby, as members present would be aware, and is very keen to maintain its strategic advantage. The important things in recommendation 3 are a balance between rail and road and the need for a genuine cost-benefit analysis of which goods ought, in the long haul, to be carried by the rail network instead of the road system, rather than decisions being made because of the power of the road lobby. 
The next few recommendations concern project development processes. Particular reference is made to Canberra-Sydney and the response suggests that there be no restriction of future operations between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. I accept that. I raise the issue of the number of passengers between Canberra and Sydney, however, and I have raised that with the project developers on numerous occasions. I also raise the issue that government has indicated that it hopes there will be no further cost to government, but there are subtle pressures that governments provide support for these very big projects. Again I put on the record my concern about the Alice Springs-Darwin freight line: what are the numbers for the amount of freight that will move both ways between Alice Springs and Darwin? Can that be sustained by the private sector without heavy government involvement? I challenge the proponents of that rail to come up with the figures. I am a supporter of rail and I hope that that project is sustained in the long term and is not just a short-term, big wonder project.
It is suggested that there be neutrality in charges and modes. In simple terms, that means that the tax regime for rail and road are reasonably neutral. Roads would just pay a registration sales tax, some tolls, some local government rates and, of course, fuel excise—which other motorists pay as well and which contributes to the road maintenance. Rail, on the other hand, is now paying for accreditation and track access, which is something that has not been sorted out, and pays considerable fuel excise. As the report suggests, we need to make sure that we have some neutrality between those two operations.
In terms of the comparison between the road and the rail network, the response observes that there is private capital in the road operations, where trucking companies and private cars use what I call the free public road network. There is enormous political pressure for voters to maintain that road network and improve it forever, almost on a yearly basis, for those transport operators. In my view, they exert undue political pressure to upgrade the Australian road system. On the other hand, the rail system does not enjoy that level of political support. In fact, some state governments are subsidising their urban passenger systems by up to $1 billion per state. The investment in track upgrade for the access of rail operators is very much behind the investment in the road network. Again I emphasise that $6 billion a year is invested in the road network, as compared with the small investment in the rail network throughout Australia.
All three reports recommend that privatisation take place, the Smorgon report suggesting that all federal and state rail operations be privatised. I entirely agree with that suggestion. The Productivity Commission's interesting suggestion is that the BOOT type operation—build, own, operate and transfer—be looked at that all freight operations be privatised and that there be a commercial approach to the rail operation. The federal government, I am pleased to see, is wholeheartedly accepting the recommendation on privatisation.
Access to the ARTC is another important aspect in terms of policy. The ARTC should be a one-stop shop so that those operators who wish to go on the national track are able to deal with an authority that will give them access at a price and under conditions that are fair to all operators. The ARTC should control and maintain the operation in a fair manner and the interface between urban systems and country tracks should be one of equity and fairness. We see a problem in the Sydney operations where the one freight line is overcome by the priority given to urban city rail traffic. The integrity of the national track is important to the federal government. I particularly note the Kalgoorlie to Perth section which could be sold with the sale of the Western Australian Transrail. 
The important arguments that we face in the parliament in terms of the ARTC and the access regime relate to the commercial rate of access by private rail operators and to the methodology. Should they be paying a market rate or should they be seeing what the market will bear? Should it contain an upgrade? What is the relativity with respect to those road operators who enjoy national highways like the Hume Highway which have basically been paid for by taxpayers and private motorists?  
Let us move on to investment, about which the Neville report made very strong comments. As I have alluded to before, the Neville report commended the $250 million to be invested in the ARTC. It was suggested that another $750 million be allocated and that over 10 years a mere $2 billion be invested in the rail system. I emphasise `a mere $2 billion' because of the relativity between the road and rail systems. We need to make that sort of investment to ensure that the rail network, both state and national, maintains a position in the transport task.
The Smorgon report suggested a figure of $250 million, and another $470 million on improving the national track. The Productivity Commission emphasised the importance of the freight route through Sydney to ensure that the national track was effective between Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and that there was not a bottleneck. We see that there is support across the board for this investment, which would ensure the operation of the rail system. Certainly, some investments have been very cost effective. I note that the Ararat/Pura Pura line was upgraded in recent times. There was good cooperation between the Victorian state government and the federal government in upgrading that piece of track, which was done poorly under the One Nation program.
With respect to operational uniformity, harmonising the operations is fairly straightforward. But when you look at the rail systems, you note the difference between Queensland, which runs a good rail system; New South Wales, which is fair; Victoria, which is different; and South Australia, which has a different operation. It is a remarkable situation in this modern day and age. Rail safety always gets a very big run. People are overly concerned, in my view, regarding safety of rail operations compared to road safety. I think there is a lack of consideration in both modes of transport. I accept the view that we need to ensure that rail is safe. I think we have one of the safest systems in the world, but we should not overdo it in terms of maintaining manpower and other issues.
I will conclude by referring to the overview comments by the Productivity Commission. I think they summarise the position very clearly as to what is happening in rail in Australia. Some very exciting things are happening. I quote: 
Reforms in the 1990s have transformed the structure and operations of Australia's railways. 
My personal experience supports that. The overview states that there is now greater competition between railways and more private sector participation. That was never the case before 1990. It is also stated that productivity has increased remarkably in a number of those. The overview continues:
Most government-owned railways are still not viable: 
—they face increasing competition from other transport modes; 
particularly road—
—suffer from inadequate investment—
which I have referred to—
and require significant government subsidies. 
That is especially the case with urban transit systems. The overview goes on:
Greater commercial focus is needed...by:
— contracting out, franchising or privatising existing government-owned railways.
Again, I commend those policy changes that have taken place, particularly in Victoria:
— the entry of new owners and further investment—
Again, we have seen in Tasmania the remarkable change that has brought about. It continues:
—rigorous application of contracts between governments and railways to meet non-commercial objectives. 
That is the CSO—again, an important policy judgment to be made with a reality and a commercial consideration. The overview says that there are different mixes of structural, access and ownership arrangements. That is something that has been a quite exciting change in the attitude of governments and railway operators that was just not possible in the last 100 years. The overview goes on:
The Commonwealth has an important role in:
— developing a national transport framework;
—facilitating ongoing harmonisation of the regulatory arrangements—
so that the state regimes are as one, as has happened in the road transport system—
— establishing a single manager for the interstate network—
ARTC is hopefully doing that. It continues:
— ensuring a more commercial approach to road provision.
That is, they do not always get the money when they provide a political lobby. The overview says the Commonwealth also has a role in financing freight bypass lines to Sydney. I support that as very important, although it would appear not as significant to the layman. Finally, it says:
The suggested reforms have greatest relevance to Queensland, NSW and WA.
Further reform is essential for the survival of most Australian railways. 
I commend those points. My close association with the railway network gives me great encouragement that railways do have a future in Australia, especially for the long haul west-east, from Perth to Melbourne. The east coast is a bit more difficult because of the terrain. With support from government on both sides, I am confident that over the next 10 years we will have a rail network that will work. This vast country will have a mode of transport that will be second to none and in 2020 railways will be efficient.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—In speaking on the response of the federal government to the reports Planning not patching, Tracking Australia, Revitalising rail and Progress in rail reform, I would like to talk about the very high speed train proposal being considered by the federal government which is highlighted in the Revitalising rail report. The preferred option being considered by the federal government, the Speedrail consortium, is to use the TGV technology that is currently operating in eight European countries. This project has the potential to lift the Australian passenger rail network into the 21st century and provide interstate travellers with an alternative to air transport. There would be a further spin-off in that interstate air movements into Kingsford Smith airport would be reduced considerably and the noise and air pollution surrounding the airport would be reduced.
For the VFT project to be successful, it has to adopt some of the efficiencies and sophistication of the European rail networks, particularly the Swiss system. To be an alternative to air transport, rail needs to jump ahead of air in terms of technology and service to the general public. It needs to deliver passengers into the central business districts of Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane at comparable times to air and it needs to compete with air in terms of cost.
A private sector task force set up by the federal government to report on how to revitalise rail in Australia has presented its report—the one that I am speaking to now entitled Revitalising rail—which, in reference to the very fast train concept, states:
The taskforce considers that very high speed trains have the potential to make a major contribution to Australia's long term transport needs and that this potential must be assessed as part of the development of a national transport strategy.
If very high speed trains are found to have the potential to make a significant contribution to a national transport strategy, then the Canberra-Sydney V.H.S.T project represents a major opportunity to turn this potential into a reality. However, the government's handling of this proposal has suffered from the lack of a national approach to major interstate rail proposals. 
While there have been some encouraging statements made by the Prime Minister concerning the very fast train proposal, I think the government's official response still lacks a sense of urgency. I think it can be summarised by simply saying that the outcome of the Sydney-Canberra very fast train proposal has not yet been determined.
With the estimated capacity of Kingsford Smith airport of 360,000 aircraft movements per year likely to be reached by the year 2009 or 2010—if nothing is done to either increase the capacity or to reduce the number of aircraft movements—there is a need to consider the impact of the Speedrail proposal on Kingsford Smith airport's capacity in the context of airport congestion. My comments are based on information provided by the Sydney-Canberra Speedrail Consortium. We should consider the full completion of the Speedrail proposal from Brisbane to Melbourne, via Sydney and Canberra, in three stages. If only one stage—Sydney to Canberra—were completed, the need to expand Sydney's airport capacity could be put back by some two years. If stages 1 and 2 were completed—Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne—the need to expand Sydney's airport would be put back by eight years. However, if the Brisbane-Melbourne link were completed, the need to expand Sydney's airport would be deferred by at least 20 years.
The interesting point made by Speedrail is that the major proportion of aircraft diversion would result from the Sydney-Brisbane sector. This sector includes the three large urban centres of Brisbane, Coolangatta and Newcastle as well as significant regional centres such as Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Taree and Lismore. This would suggest that this sector should be considered prior even to the Canberra-Melbourne link. The overall impact of the Speedrail proposal within stages or on completion of the project will result in a reduction in the number of aircraft using Kingsford Smith airport, with a corresponding reduction in pollution.
Mr Wal King, who is Leighton Holdings' chief executive, recently addressed the ACT regional chamber of commerce and industry dinner, and he predicted that the Sydney to Canberra journey could be completed within 90 minutes. Mr King predicted that the project would create 15,000 jobs during the construction stage and a further 2,400 permanent jobs once the rail link was completed. Hourly services are planned, with stops at Canberra, Goulburn, the Southern Highlands, Macarthur and Sydney domestic and international airports. There would be considerable benefits to these regional locations through improved accessibility. Improvement in public transport systems would encourage more businesses to locate in these regions, therefore increasing economic growth and local employment. There would also be considerable environmental benefits resulting from the Speedrail concept such as reduced aircraft movements and the corresponding reduction in noise and air pollution.
The future of Kingsford Smith airport and the possible development of Badgerys Creek airport are linked very closely with the very fast train proposal. A recent report released by Access Economics Sydney gateways in the 21st century states:
2016 is the earliest possible timing for the Badgerys Creek Airport assuming the most favourable economic circumstances.
I think this is an important timetable to consider when we are looking at the integration of air and rail transport. There would be some people who would see the building of Badgerys Creek airport as a fairly quick solution to our air pollution in Sydney. However, that independent report indicates that it would not be economically viable to have an airport at Badgerys Creek at least until 2016 and possibly later. This framework, however, does allow for the speedy development of the Speedrail proposal and would allow for a better integration of rail and air transport over the next five to 10 years. 
I would like to finish by summarising some of the advantages of  stage 1 of the Speedrail proposal between Sydney and Canberra. Speedrail's TGV technology will link Sydney and Canberra in about 80 to 90 minutes at a phenomenal speed of 320 kilometres per hour, or one kilometre every 11 seconds. Speedrail will offer a range of fares, Qantas service and even Frequent Flyer points, as well as the ability to use mobile phones and computers—which I think we would all agree is rather a drawback when one is travelling by air. Stops at Sydney and Canberra airports will create significant efficiencies in aircraft movements, particularly in Sydney, and will also take an estimated one million cars per year off the Hume Highway.
Speedrail will be investing an estimated $3.7 billion into the economy, creating 15,000 jobs during construction and over 2,000 permanent jobs. Many of these will be in the regional areas. Experience from France indicates development along the route will generate another 4,000 jobs. TGV technology is clean, electric technology, which uses significantly less energy per passenger than either planes or cars. There will be access across the line for people, native animals and livestock, and farming will not be disturbed. Speedrail will create a job corridor, reversing the steady decline of rural employment in the region. It will also enhance the tourist potential of towns and cities along the route.
I will conclude by highlighting what I believe to be the big advantage of rail to our economy: the creation of jobs. I have a bit of a vested interest because my first job was as a railway apprentice. If you look at the situation today and the number of people and the apprentices who are being trained in industry, you will see a decline in the training of apprentices in the aircraft industry, as we have all seen in relation to Qantas. However, I do believe that rail has the potential and the willingness to train more apprentices.
If you look at the technology in comparing the two forms of transport, you will see we do not build any major aircraft in Australia. For that reason, I suggest that most of the repairs, parts, et cetera, come from overseas; aircraft can be, and are, flown overseas for repairs. Take these points into consideration and then look at the rail industry, where you will see that most of the work for this new project would have to be performed in Australia. That would create a pool of employment which, in the long term, would be to the great advantage of the people of Australia and to the economy in general. I am happy to speak on this report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Committee</title>",Committees,35,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2000-06-28,"—What a pleasure to be surrounded by three of my colleagues, including your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, in responding to the government's response to the reports Planning not patching and Tracking Australia. I will not speak about Planning not patching today. I think the more important topic before us is rail. Few things I have done in this parliament have excited my imagination so much and given me so much personal satisfaction as being associated with Tracking Australia. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your service on the previous committee as well as the current one—including your time as deputy chairman of this very fine committee—would share those sentiments too.
It was very much a hands-on inquiry that we participated in. We went to see the track and saw what the problems were in order to gain a feeling for the very nature of what we were dealing with. As we look over the landscape of existing infrastructure, we cannot but be impressed at the extent and penetration of our rail system. But, sadly, it is being viewed in the negative by several states and federal governments. It has been seen as a necessary evil and sometimes as a tolerated relic of the past. Of course, none of these things is true. It is a massive resource, it is an underutilised asset and, quite frankly, it is a huge opportunity.
With the completion of the standard gauge links between the various capitals two decades ago, we sat back, believing that all the transport sins of pre-Federation had been solved and forgiven. That is a myth. This myth disguises the failings of the rail system on the one hand and its potential on the other. It is like bringing a veil down over the stage so that you cannot see any of the players. When my colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Microeconomic Reform—now the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts—started on this endeavour we could scarcely have envisaged the interest that Tracking Australia would generate. It attracted 147 submissions. We took evidence from 84 organisations, held 14 public hearings and carried out a number of inspections. They were very much hands-on type inspections.  
The seminal findings of the committee revolved around the principle that there is a role for rail in the national transport system. If we could not have established that, the rest would have been an exercise in futility. Therefore, it followed from that that the Commonwealth has a national leadership responsibility role in relation to rail transport. It should declare the national track for interstate rail services in conjunction with the states and territories. It must address the chronic deficiencies in the national track infrastructure. It must, as a matter of urgency, invest in the national track. The sum of $250 million is welcomed by the committee, I am sure, but it is only a drop in the bucket. 
The individual issue that the inquiry threw up was the need for an integrated national transport strategic plan. I am saddened that it has been rejected in the response because I do not think we can go on throwing money at a road problem here and a rail problem there and never look across the two of them to say, `What is the cost-benefit analysis, firstly, on the individual projects and, secondly, as they integrate?' It just seems a terrible waste. You can drive now from the Gold Coast to Brisbane and see eight lanes and know that, within a decade or so, that probably will not be enough. Yet the high speed suburban rail from Brisbane, which is very good, has been slowly creeping down the coast. I think it should have an injection of funds and go straight through to Murwillumbah. That is my view of it. You really have to make these assets work instead of pouring countless dollars—not millions, not tens of millions but literally hundreds of millions and billions of dollars—into the road system.
We need to look at national infrastructure standards and consistency in safety standards and practices. We need a one-off grant to standardise communications equipment and safety operations. These are fundamentals, yet we are overlooking them all the time. We need national training courses at approved educational centres, establishment of a national regulatory authority and national consistency in accreditation practices. We need a more focused look at part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act to create greater certainty, transparency and accountability. We do have the ARTC. Although the states are supposed to be cooperating through that, we found evidence during that inquiry that it was not exactly what was happening. We need access pricing that is transparent and accountable. We need an examination of public liability insurance—and this is very difficult for small niche operators like the ones in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. What we are doing by not addressing that is squeezing out all the small niche players. Then we need the control and management of the national track. I mentioned in my earlier comments my disappointment that we were not going to have a national land transport commission.
As we went around Australia we found that there were many things that could be fixed and fixed properly. These included double-stacking through the Adelaide Hills and the upgrading of the track into Adelaide. A lot of this has already happened near the electorate of the member for Corangamite. It was a sad thing when we were on that inquiry to know that when we inspected the track in his area, the train from Adelaide to Melbourne travelled the distance in 13 hours when 60 years ago it also took 13 hours. You just cannot have that sort of thing and have an efficient system. 
The whole thing, as I see it, really gets down to the track, and in the parlance of the industry, below track and above track. The committee was essentially interested in the below track operation, that is, the permanent way—the sleepers, the track, and the basic infrastructure that goes with that. It is the operation on which the thing runs. If you like, we were saying to the government, `We believe that the line from Brisbane to Perth, both through Broken Hill and Melbourne, should be treated like a national rail highway, and it should be of a standard commensurate with that.' 
This is not just a pipedream or people throwing ideas around in a flurry of rail excitement. In Queensland, two Labor and two coalition governments have had a focus on upgrading the north coast line, and especially the section from Brisbane to Rockhampton. Ten years ago it took 14 hours for a train to go to Rockhampton from Brisbane, and now it takes seven hours. You can get a train from Bundaberg to Brisbane at 5 o'clock in the morning and it gets you into Brisbane at 9 o'clock, faster than you can drive your car. In my own electorate it takes me 2¼ hours to drive from Bundaberg to Gladstone. The train does it in 1½ hours. These are not pie in the sky concepts, they can be achieved. 
I commend governments of both political colours in Queensland for their approach. They know you have to get the track right—the big eight-inch tracks, taking out all the crook curves, and being game enough to scrap metal bridges and put up modern concrete ones. And I might say that these concrete ones are built to standard gauge so that in years to come, when the track has to go to standard gauge, all the bridges are in place. It requires that sort of vision. That is what we have to have: a vision of rail in Australia. 
It is going to require a leap of faith by government. For example, we said we should spend $250 million a year in getting the preliminary bugs out of the whole system and then $202 billion over 10 years. That is only $200 million a year. Look at what we spend on roads. It is unbelievable that governments of both political persuasions in this country cannot see past that veil that I spoke about before. It is interesting that Smorgon was fairly complimentary, but I thought the Productivity Commission lacked a bit of vision when it came to this particular issue.
We believe, too, that there has to be operational uniformity. You cannot have a system where you have got signals meaning different things in different states and different safety standards. At the time we were doing the inquiry there were 14 different radio systems running across Australia. That meant more than one system in some states. That has to be taken out of the system, that is just absolutely fundamental, and a one-off grant could have done that. 
We tried to take a practical look at things. You do not have to have an inquiry every time you do something. For example, we said that in matters of safety we need first to have a rail safety regulator—this was a concern expressed by speakers—particularly in Sydney at present. But, broadly speaking, first we need to have such a safety regulator, and the states would probably need to surrender some authority to that. Then you need a rail accident investigation unit, quite separate from the regulator, as we have in aviation. The model is already there; it is just a matter of paralleling those procedures. That would make a huge difference. It would be an incentive to the state rail authorities to come up to a national standard knowing that if there were accidents they were going to be scrutinised to a very high degree. 
Training is very important. We said that there should be a curriculum for train drivers. They should not just be seen as people in sooty overalls, which is the vision of other people. These are young, well-trained men who can be the young technocrats of today's society. I am not suggesting they all have to traipse off to university, but I am saying that you could have a number of designated TAFE colleges in Australia that were delivering a standard training system. If you get in a plane in Cairns, Fremantle or Hobart, you know the pilot has been trained to the one national standard. That is what it should be in rail. It is a nonsense to think that you have got to change drivers at borders. If we are going to have a national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth, then we need to make sure that the training is uniform. 
There is a fair degree of unanimity between Tracking Australia and the Smorgon report. I found the Productivity Commission report a bit too hard-nosed and a bit impractical. You cannot solve all these problems simply by saying that private industry will solve it. We have a huge deficit that has to be made up. I am a great states righter where states rights need to be sandbagged—I will not have any intrusion of the Commonwealth into it. But I believe the national rail system, by its very name, invites the surrender of some authority from the states to the Commonwealth—not in their intrastate rail system, but purely in the interstate system, the national highway idea. It has been done for roads. The state road authorities quite often do the work for the Commonwealth; they are quite often the contractors for the Commonwealth. It could be just the same for rail. It does not mean the states have been cut out of it; it means they are becoming more integrated players.
The other thing that comes through very clearly is that Smorgon also had a vision for rail not unlike the one we had ourselves. I am accused sometimes of being a bit of a socialist—I know that offends my colleague the member for Corangamite—but my personal view is that the ARTC needs—
—I would be a socialist to the extent that I would like to see the ARTC become either a total Commonwealth instrumentality or an instrumentality to the states where it had full and unbridled control. If it was privatised after it had done its preliminary work of getting the rail track in Australia into order, I would not be so upset. I do not think we are ever going to catch up unless the funding can be poured, in a focused way, into a national rail system. As I said before, that means getting out the curves, redoing the bridges, double stacking on the east-west corridor, extending the loops so the trains can pass—all those sorts of things. It is all a matter of efficiency. 
Some of the items in this response I am disappointed with, some I am heartened with. I continue to call on government for a greater national vision for the Australian rail system. I commend our original report which we will follow up in the future. (Time expired).

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—I rise to address the government's response to what is known as the Neville report, entitled Planning not patching. In doing so, let me quote from the first paragraph in the preface to the report: `Planning not patching is essential if Australia is to have the best possible transport system to service industry and community needs.' I also quote from a media release which was issued when this report was tabled in the federal parliament on 24 November 1997. Mr Paul Neville, the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, said:
The Commonwealth needs to place a greater emphasis on strategic planning in the provision of transport infrastructure. The call for a national strategic plan for transport is not new but it is overdue.
In the almost three years since that report was tabled, we have seen the government's response. We have seen the written response—the document which we are considering today. More importantly, we have seen the response of the government in its budgetary allocations for road funding for transport infrastructure. In particular, we have seen in the past week that Australia has a government which really does not understand the transport problem. This was evidenced particularly by the Prime Minister's response when he tried to explain why petrol should not get dearer under the GST. He said, `There will be a huge saving of 24c a litre for diesel.' If the Prime Minister had done his sums correctly, he would have found that that equates to a saving of about 12c a kilometre for a B-double; less for a semi-trailer. It should be noted that a B-double carries in the order of 65,000 litres of petroleum product. By way of example, for a 500 kilometre haul from a fuel port that accesses 95 per cent of the Australian population, the maximum saving per litre is less than one-tenth of a cent per litre. This means that your fuel price goes from, say, 95.9c to 95.8c—if you can pass it on. That is meaningless in a tank of fuel for the consumer.
Let us extrapolate it a little further because we are not always talking about litres of petrol. We might be talking about cans of soup. We might be talking about cartons of apples or kilos of beef. In every situation the saving is minimal and it really does not address the problem that transport in this country is facing. Yet the government persists. We had a minister in question time yesterday in answer to a question say that regional and rural Australia is going to experience massive benefits from this government's policy of cutting fuel excise. It is not going to happen, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly. You know that in your electorate, I know that in my electorate and the whole of regional Australia is starting to get the picture now. In fact, as a result of the new tax system and GST, transport will get dearer, not cheaper.  
The response by the transport industry to the government's action shows how little support there is for the government's policy. We need to look at improving infrastructure, reducing haul times, reducing turnaround times and allowing the size of loads to increase. These factors have already yielded significant reduction in haulage rates. As a matter of fact, I have a table here that shows the reduction in haulage rates between Newcastle and Melbourne. In 1990 trucking costs were about $37.50 an hour and the cartage rate per tonne between Newcastle and Melbourne was $49.10. Now, although costs have increased enormously to $72 per hour, haulage rates are $47.50.
The government comes along and says that reducing diesel by 24c a litre is going to bring about another massive reduction. It will not. Those rates have dropped because the time for a trip from Newcastle to Melbourne has been reduced by the building of a you-beaut highway and because of the increase in weight of loads that can be carried by trucks, so you carry more tonnes per trip and you reduce time. They are the factors that have reduced transport costs, not fuel costs because we have seen fuel costs virtually double in that period of time and yet the haulage costs have still gone down.
I elected to speak on this issue today because the report does recognise the importance of upgrading infrastructure and I support that. The shame is that we have a government that does not recognise the importance of the upgrade of infrastructure. The Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, certainly does not recognise it. How do I know? The budget tells me so. 
Where was the money to improve road infrastructure in this year's federal budget? It was not there. There was no new money for the Sydney to Brisbane upgrade of the Pacific Highway which is now stalling in many places. The funding was withdrawn from the Karuah bypass in the northern part of my electorate by former Minister Vaile in a fit of pique prior to the last election. To my knowledge that funding has not been reinstated by the federal government and we now find that the construction of that vital bypass which is necessary to get rid of a major bottleneck on the Pacific Highway will not start for two years. The ridiculous situation is that there will be, within a few months, a non-stop four-lane divided highway from Sydney to Karuah, which will then close down to a two-lane bridge and two lanes of tar-sealed road through to Bulahdelah, and which will spread out again to four lanes of concrete divided highway. This is the sort of ridiculous stop-go policy that is evident in this government today and it is the sort of thing that is driving the transport industry absolutely mad. The transport industry cannot cope with that. They need first-class highways and, where we have them, we have already seen that costs have dropped. That is the sort of support that we need from a government. 
I am very pleased that, in my first term in the federal parliament, I was heavily involved in convincing Minister Brereton that the upgrade of the Pacific Highway should happen. At that stage, the federal government's contribution was going to be $1 billion. We now find that that has shrunk to $600 million. We also find that funding for the national highway has shrunk. There is a concept that there is a national highway right around Australia and that the funding for that is the responsibility of the federal government. That funding has also shrunk under this government. My office is currently located in the major regional city of Maitland. This city is divided by the national highway. The highway passes right through the middle of it, cutting that major city into two. The turmoil that creates for a city is ridiculous. We have been planning, planning, planning. There is always money for planning, never money for construction. We are never prepared to take the action and build the road, and that is the ridiculous situation we are in. 
We had the ludicrous situation in the budget this year where $8.3 million was provided for the whole state of New South Wales to upgrade bridges to allow them to take heavy loads. I represent five local government areas. Every one of these areas could spend that money each year for the next 10 years and, at the end of 10 years, they would still not have all their bridges upgraded to a satisfactory standard. It is a major problem. We are talking about timber bridges that are nearly a century old carrying modern semitrailers in rural and regional Australia. Where does $8.3 million to replace them go? It certainly will not do the job. It is ludicrous and members here know that it is ludicrous.
This report ignores the nature of our trucking industry, its composition and its make-up. We have some large operators—the Linfox type of operation. Those organisations own their own trucks and employ their drivers. They run very good businesses and do very well. There are also large operators such as Toll and K&S that own some trucks but use large numbers of subcontractors—owner-drivers—and, of course, the primary contractor sets the rate. The subcontractor has to accept that rate, and this is where the problem is. In Australia today, we have in the order of 25,000 owner-driver operators who work as subcontractors, and the problem is that these people are hurting the most. They are being screwed by the major contractors. They are being told that, with the advent of the GST, their costs will have to come down. I have one such letter here. It is a GST bulletin that has gone out from one of those major contractors that I have identified. It shows that the supposed cost reduction of fuel between Melbourne and Newcastle will be $178. It shows that the supposed reduction in cost of tyres will be $15.40. However, it does say that the cost of administration by the major contractor will go up. The subcontractor is being told that the net cost to be passed on to the major contractor is $183.
The situation is this: two months ago tyres went up by 15 per cent; that is not accounted for. Over the last 18 months, the price of diesel has escalated by more than the 23c that it is now going to drop; that is not accounted for. We have 25,000 owner-driver operators in Australia that are currently working on virtually zero margins. I talk to the trucking industry and they tell me that, if they take a load of steel to Queensland, they often bring back a load from Queensland without recovering costs. They do it just to pay for the fuel to get home so they can get another load that pays. That is the sort of principle that our transport industry is currently operating on, and it will not work.
There is going to come a point in the near future when these people will be insolvent. It has been suggested to me that many of our transport operations are currently operating insolvently. The owner-drivers have put forward a four-point plan. While it does contain some areas of state jurisdiction, it also contains some areas of federal jurisdiction. It is a worthy proposal and it should not be dismissed. I know that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Deputy Prime Minister, has dismissed a number of the points that have been made, such as a base floor rate for transport. If we are going to have any certainty in our transport industry, if we are going to have an industry that allows us to move forward as a nation, then people in this business have to be guaranteed the right to make a living.
In conclusion, if Australia is going to have a transport system that will generate competitiveness in rural and regional areas, we must have a massive injection of funding into infrastructure. I believe the way we look at infrastructure expenditure in Australia is wrong. We look at money spent on upgrading major highways, road and rail interchanges and port facilities to increase handling rates as a cost. We should not look at it as a cost. We should look at it as an investment that yields enormous dividends. There are examples around Australia. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway has already shown the development, the relocation of industry and the creation of jobs that that infrastructure creates. Until we have a government that is prepared to be objective and to look positively at infrastructure expenditure we will be condemned to having a second-rate transport system from the last century.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2000-06-28,"—In July 1995, the standard gauge was completed and I was honoured to be at the ceremony when the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, opened that standard gauge from Brisbane to Perth. I put on the record that that government achieved that outcome and I commend them for that because the objective of standardising the gauge from Brisbane to Perth had been on the books since 1923. That government invested $440 million to achieve that outcome. We know that parts of the track were not properly done, especially in parts of the electorate of Corangamite, but I do record the outstanding achievement of actually standardising the gauge across Australia. The new concept that was developed during that time was the ARTC with rail access, and I will talk more about that. The regulations that had historically been state based now moved to a more nationally based operation. During that time, of course, there were also safety concerns.
The government's response this morning is to three reports. The first is the Neville report—I personally participated very vigorously in every inspection and in questioning every witness. The second is the Smorgon report which, it is fair to say, took a number of the recommendations from the Neville report. The third is the Productivity Commission report, which again was a fairly independent assessment of the rail industry, but utilised some of the evidence of the Tracking Australia report. Certainly the harmonisation of the state based rail operations was a key feature. The Neville report and the other two reports focused on that possible outcome.
The sale of the rail operations of AN now means that a number of those operations—the Ghan, the IndianPacific and the Melbourne to Adelaide run—are moving towards profitability, having more passengers and becoming much more commercial. The sale of the freight operation in Victoria, V/Line, to Freight Australia has opened up remarkable new opportunities in terms of timber, wheat and other merchandise. Tasrail has been a remarkable success—an operation which was fundamentally broke for 100 years is now operating in profit.
The fundamental thing we should address is that the federal government has allocated $250 million to rail operations upgrade and yet, on a year by year basis in Australia, the federal and state governments allocate $6 billion to road construction. It is very important, in this whole discussion, to recall that. We need an upgrade of the basic rail network structure. Governments, both state and federal, have failed to invest for all kinds of historical reasons. The sale of National Rail—which, in my assessment, has done a remarkable job of connecting capital cities, by means of the standard rail gauge and the National Rail operations—to the private sector will be another step in the right direction. Remembering that National Rail had to overcome the culture of every state government and, given the difficulties, I think its results have been commendable.
I turn now to some brief comment on the specifics of the recommendations. On the national transport policy: this is an argument about rail versus road. There is some reluctance by the road operators to allow the rail industry to get a fair go. The road industry has had a very strong lobby, as members present would be aware, and is very keen to maintain its strategic advantage. The important things in recommendation 3 are a balance between rail and road and the need for a genuine cost-benefit analysis of which goods ought, in the long haul, to be carried by the rail network instead of the road system, rather than decisions being made because of the power of the road lobby. 
The next few recommendations concern project development processes. Particular reference is made to Canberra-Sydney and the response suggests that there be no restriction of future operations between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. I accept that. I raise the issue of the number of passengers between Canberra and Sydney, however, and I have raised that with the project developers on numerous occasions. I also raise the issue that government has indicated that it hopes there will be no further cost to government, but there are subtle pressures that governments provide support for these very big projects. Again I put on the record my concern about the Alice Springs-Darwin freight line: what are the numbers for the amount of freight that will move both ways between Alice Springs and Darwin? Can that be sustained by the private sector without heavy government involvement? I challenge the proponents of that rail to come up with the figures. I am a supporter of rail and I hope that that project is sustained in the long term and is not just a short-term, big wonder project.
It is suggested that there be neutrality in charges and modes. In simple terms, that means that the tax regime for rail and road are reasonably neutral. Roads would just pay a registration sales tax, some tolls, some local government rates and, of course, fuel excise—which other motorists pay as well and which contributes to the road maintenance. Rail, on the other hand, is now paying for accreditation and track access, which is something that has not been sorted out, and pays considerable fuel excise. As the report suggests, we need to make sure that we have some neutrality between those two operations.
In terms of the comparison between the road and the rail network, the response observes that there is private capital in the road operations, where trucking companies and private cars use what I call the free public road network. There is enormous political pressure for voters to maintain that road network and improve it forever, almost on a yearly basis, for those transport operators. In my view, they exert undue political pressure to upgrade the Australian road system. On the other hand, the rail system does not enjoy that level of political support. In fact, some state governments are subsidising their urban passenger systems by up to $1 billion per state. The investment in track upgrade for the access of rail operators is very much behind the investment in the road network. Again I emphasise that $6 billion a year is invested in the road network, as compared with the small investment in the rail network throughout Australia.
All three reports recommend that privatisation take place, the Smorgon report suggesting that all federal and state rail operations be privatised. I entirely agree with that suggestion. The Productivity Commission's interesting suggestion is that the BOOT type operation—build, own, operate and transfer—be looked at that all freight operations be privatised and that there be a commercial approach to the rail operation. The federal government, I am pleased to see, is wholeheartedly accepting the recommendation on privatisation.
Access to the ARTC is another important aspect in terms of policy. The ARTC should be a one-stop shop so that those operators who wish to go on the national track are able to deal with an authority that will give them access at a price and under conditions that are fair to all operators. The ARTC should control and maintain the operation in a fair manner and the interface between urban systems and country tracks should be one of equity and fairness. We see a problem in the Sydney operations where the one freight line is overcome by the priority given to urban city rail traffic. The integrity of the national track is important to the federal government. I particularly note the Kalgoorlie to Perth section which could be sold with the sale of the Western Australian Transrail. 
The important arguments that we face in the parliament in terms of the ARTC and the access regime relate to the commercial rate of access by private rail operators and to the methodology. Should they be paying a market rate or should they be seeing what the market will bear? Should it contain an upgrade? What is the relativity with respect to those road operators who enjoy national highways like the Hume Highway which have basically been paid for by taxpayers and private motorists?  
Let us move on to investment, about which the Neville report made very strong comments. As I have alluded to before, the Neville report commended the $250 million to be invested in the ARTC. It was suggested that another $750 million be allocated and that over 10 years a mere $2 billion be invested in the rail system. I emphasise `a mere $2 billion' because of the relativity between the road and rail systems. We need to make that sort of investment to ensure that the rail network, both state and national, maintains a position in the transport task.
The Smorgon report suggested a figure of $250 million, and another $470 million on improving the national track. The Productivity Commission emphasised the importance of the freight route through Sydney to ensure that the national track was effective between Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and that there was not a bottleneck. We see that there is support across the board for this investment, which would ensure the operation of the rail system. Certainly, some investments have been very cost effective. I note that the Ararat/Pura Pura line was upgraded in recent times. There was good cooperation between the Victorian state government and the federal government in upgrading that piece of track, which was done poorly under the One Nation program.
With respect to operational uniformity, harmonising the operations is fairly straightforward. But when you look at the rail systems, you note the difference between Queensland, which runs a good rail system; New South Wales, which is fair; Victoria, which is different; and South Australia, which has a different operation. It is a remarkable situation in this modern day and age. Rail safety always gets a very big run. People are overly concerned, in my view, regarding safety of rail operations compared to road safety. I think there is a lack of consideration in both modes of transport. I accept the view that we need to ensure that rail is safe. I think we have one of the safest systems in the world, but we should not overdo it in terms of maintaining manpower and other issues.
I will conclude by referring to the overview comments by the Productivity Commission. I think they summarise the position very clearly as to what is happening in rail in Australia. Some very exciting things are happening. I quote: 
Reforms in the 1990s have transformed the structure and operations of Australia's railways. 
My personal experience supports that. The overview states that there is now greater competition between railways and more private sector participation. That was never the case before 1990. It is also stated that productivity has increased remarkably in a number of those. The overview continues:
Most government-owned railways are still not viable: 
—they face increasing competition from other transport modes; 
particularly road—
—suffer from inadequate investment—
which I have referred to—
and require significant government subsidies. 
That is especially the case with urban transit systems. The overview goes on:
Greater commercial focus is needed...by:
— contracting out, franchising or privatising existing government-owned railways.
Again, I commend those policy changes that have taken place, particularly in Victoria:
— the entry of new owners and further investment—
Again, we have seen in Tasmania the remarkable change that has brought about. It continues:
—rigorous application of contracts between governments and railways to meet non-commercial objectives. 
That is the CSO—again, an important policy judgment to be made with a reality and a commercial consideration. The overview says that there are different mixes of structural, access and ownership arrangements. That is something that has been a quite exciting change in the attitude of governments and railway operators that was just not possible in the last 100 years. The overview goes on:
The Commonwealth has an important role in:
— developing a national transport framework;
—facilitating ongoing harmonisation of the regulatory arrangements—
so that the state regimes are as one, as has happened in the road transport system—
— establishing a single manager for the interstate network—
ARTC is hopefully doing that. It continues:
— ensuring a more commercial approach to road provision.
That is, they do not always get the money when they provide a political lobby. The overview says the Commonwealth also has a role in financing freight bypass lines to Sydney. I support that as very important, although it would appear not as significant to the layman. Finally, it says:
The suggested reforms have greatest relevance to Queensland, NSW and WA.
Further reform is essential for the survival of most Australian railways. 
I commend those points. My close association with the railway network gives me great encouragement that railways do have a future in Australia, especially for the long haul west-east, from Perth to Melbourne. The east coast is a bit more difficult because of the terrain. With support from government on both sides, I am confident that over the next 10 years we will have a rail network that will work. This vast country will have a mode of transport that will be second to none and in 2020 railways will be efficient.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-06-28,"—In speaking on the response of the federal government to the reports Planning not patching, Tracking Australia, Revitalising rail and Progress in rail reform, I would like to talk about the very high speed train proposal being considered by the federal government which is highlighted in the Revitalising rail report. The preferred option being considered by the federal government, the Speedrail consortium, is to use the TGV technology that is currently operating in eight European countries. This project has the potential to lift the Australian passenger rail network into the 21st century and provide interstate travellers with an alternative to air transport. There would be a further spin-off in that interstate air movements into Kingsford Smith airport would be reduced considerably and the noise and air pollution surrounding the airport would be reduced.
For the VFT project to be successful, it has to adopt some of the efficiencies and sophistication of the European rail networks, particularly the Swiss system. To be an alternative to air transport, rail needs to jump ahead of air in terms of technology and service to the general public. It needs to deliver passengers into the central business districts of Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane at comparable times to air and it needs to compete with air in terms of cost.
A private sector task force set up by the federal government to report on how to revitalise rail in Australia has presented its report—the one that I am speaking to now entitled Revitalising rail—which, in reference to the very fast train concept, states:
The taskforce considers that very high speed trains have the potential to make a major contribution to Australia's long term transport needs and that this potential must be assessed as part of the development of a national transport strategy.
If very high speed trains are found to have the potential to make a significant contribution to a national transport strategy, then the Canberra-Sydney V.H.S.T project represents a major opportunity to turn this potential into a reality. However, the government's handling of this proposal has suffered from the lack of a national approach to major interstate rail proposals. 
While there have been some encouraging statements made by the Prime Minister concerning the very fast train proposal, I think the government's official response still lacks a sense of urgency. I think it can be summarised by simply saying that the outcome of the Sydney-Canberra very fast train proposal has not yet been determined.
With the estimated capacity of Kingsford Smith airport of 360,000 aircraft movements per year likely to be reached by the year 2009 or 2010—if nothing is done to either increase the capacity or to reduce the number of aircraft movements—there is a need to consider the impact of the Speedrail proposal on Kingsford Smith airport's capacity in the context of airport congestion. My comments are based on information provided by the Sydney-Canberra Speedrail Consortium. We should consider the full completion of the Speedrail proposal from Brisbane to Melbourne, via Sydney and Canberra, in three stages. If only one stage—Sydney to Canberra—were completed, the need to expand Sydney's airport capacity could be put back by some two years. If stages 1 and 2 were completed—Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne—the need to expand Sydney's airport would be put back by eight years. However, if the Brisbane-Melbourne link were completed, the need to expand Sydney's airport would be deferred by at least 20 years.
The interesting point made by Speedrail is that the major proportion of aircraft diversion would result from the Sydney-Brisbane sector. This sector includes the three large urban centres of Brisbane, Coolangatta and Newcastle as well as significant regional centres such as Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Taree and Lismore. This would suggest that this sector should be considered prior even to the Canberra-Melbourne link. The overall impact of the Speedrail proposal within stages or on completion of the project will result in a reduction in the number of aircraft using Kingsford Smith airport, with a corresponding reduction in pollution.
Mr Wal King, who is Leighton Holdings' chief executive, recently addressed the ACT regional chamber of commerce and industry dinner, and he predicted that the Sydney to Canberra journey could be completed within 90 minutes. Mr King predicted that the project would create 15,000 jobs during the construction stage and a further 2,400 permanent jobs once the rail link was completed. Hourly services are planned, with stops at Canberra, Goulburn, the Southern Highlands, Macarthur and Sydney domestic and international airports. There would be considerable benefits to these regional locations through improved accessibility. Improvement in public transport systems would encourage more businesses to locate in these regions, therefore increasing economic growth and local employment. There would also be considerable environmental benefits resulting from the Speedrail concept such as reduced aircraft movements and the corresponding reduction in noise and air pollution.
The future of Kingsford Smith airport and the possible development of Badgerys Creek airport are linked very closely with the very fast train proposal. A recent report released by Access Economics Sydney gateways in the 21st century states:
2016 is the earliest possible timing for the Badgerys Creek Airport assuming the most favourable economic circumstances.
I think this is an important timetable to consider when we are looking at the integration of air and rail transport. There would be some people who would see the building of Badgerys Creek airport as a fairly quick solution to our air pollution in Sydney. However, that independent report indicates that it would not be economically viable to have an airport at Badgerys Creek at least until 2016 and possibly later. This framework, however, does allow for the speedy development of the Speedrail proposal and would allow for a better integration of rail and air transport over the next five to 10 years. 
I would like to finish by summarising some of the advantages of  stage 1 of the Speedrail proposal between Sydney and Canberra. Speedrail's TGV technology will link Sydney and Canberra in about 80 to 90 minutes at a phenomenal speed of 320 kilometres per hour, or one kilometre every 11 seconds. Speedrail will offer a range of fares, Qantas service and even Frequent Flyer points, as well as the ability to use mobile phones and computers—which I think we would all agree is rather a drawback when one is travelling by air. Stops at Sydney and Canberra airports will create significant efficiencies in aircraft movements, particularly in Sydney, and will also take an estimated one million cars per year off the Hume Highway.
Speedrail will be investing an estimated $3.7 billion into the economy, creating 15,000 jobs during construction and over 2,000 permanent jobs. Many of these will be in the regional areas. Experience from France indicates development along the route will generate another 4,000 jobs. TGV technology is clean, electric technology, which uses significantly less energy per passenger than either planes or cars. There will be access across the line for people, native animals and livestock, and farming will not be disturbed. Speedrail will create a job corridor, reversing the steady decline of rural employment in the region. It will also enhance the tourist potential of towns and cities along the route.
I will conclude by highlighting what I believe to be the big advantage of rail to our economy: the creation of jobs. I have a bit of a vested interest because my first job was as a railway apprentice. If you look at the situation today and the number of people and the apprentices who are being trained in industry, you will see a decline in the training of apprentices in the aircraft industry, as we have all seen in relation to Qantas. However, I do believe that rail has the potential and the willingness to train more apprentices.
If you look at the technology in comparing the two forms of transport, you will see we do not build any major aircraft in Australia. For that reason, I suggest that most of the repairs, parts, et cetera, come from overseas; aircraft can be, and are, flown overseas for repairs. Take these points into consideration and then look at the rail industry, where you will see that most of the work for this new project would have to be performed in Australia. That would create a pool of employment which, in the long term, would be to the great advantage of the people of Australia and to the economy in general.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2000-06-28,"—What a pleasure to be surrounded by three of my colleagues, including your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, in responding to the government's response to the reports Planning not patching and Tracking Australia. I will not speak about Planning not patching today. I think the more important topic before us is rail. Few things I have done in this parliament have excited my imagination so much and given me so much personal satisfaction as being associated with Tracking Australia. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your service on the previous committee as well as the current one—including your time as deputy chairman of this very fine committee—would share those sentiments too.
It was very much a hands-on inquiry that we participated in. We went to see the track and saw what the problems were in order to gain a feeling for the very nature of what we were dealing with. As we look over the landscape of existing infrastructure, we cannot but be impressed at the extent and penetration of our rail system. But, sadly, it is being viewed in the negative by several states and federal governments. It has been seen as a necessary evil and sometimes as a tolerated relic of the past. Of course, none of these things is true. It is a massive resource, it is an underutilised asset and, quite frankly, it is a huge opportunity.
With the completion of the standard gauge links between the various capitals two decades ago, we sat back, believing that all the transport sins of pre-Federation had been solved and forgiven. That is a myth. This myth disguises the failings of the rail system on the one hand and its potential on the other. It is like bringing a veil down over the stage so that you cannot see any of the players. When my colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Microeconomic Reform—now the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts—started on this endeavour we could scarcely have envisaged the interest that Tracking Australia would generate. It attracted 147 submissions. We took evidence from 84 organisations, held 14 public hearings and carried out a number of inspections. They were very much hands-on type inspections.  
The seminal findings of the committee revolved around the principle that there is a role for rail in the national transport system. If we could not have established that, the rest would have been an exercise in futility. Therefore, it followed from that that the Commonwealth has a national leadership responsibility role in relation to rail transport. It should declare the national track for interstate rail services in conjunction with the states and territories. It must address the chronic deficiencies in the national track infrastructure. It must, as a matter of urgency, invest in the national track. The sum of $250 million is welcomed by the committee, I am sure, but it is only a drop in the bucket. 
The individual issue that the inquiry threw up was the need for an integrated national transport strategic plan. I am saddened that it has been rejected in the response because I do not think we can go on throwing money at a road problem here and a rail problem there and never look across the two of them to say, `What is the cost-benefit analysis, firstly, on the individual projects and, secondly, as they integrate?' It just seems a terrible waste. You can drive now from the Gold Coast to Brisbane and see eight lanes and know that, within a decade or so, that probably will not be enough. Yet the high speed suburban rail from Brisbane, which is very good, has been slowly creeping down the coast. I think it should have an injection of funds and go straight through to Murwillumbah. That is my view of it. You really have to make these assets work instead of pouring countless dollars—not millions, not tens of millions but literally hundreds of millions and billions of dollars—into the road system.
We need to look at national infrastructure standards and consistency in safety standards and practices. We need a one-off grant to standardise communications equipment and safety operations. These are fundamentals, yet we are overlooking them all the time. We need national training courses at approved educational centres, establishment of a national regulatory authority and national consistency in accreditation practices. We need a more focused look at part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act to create greater certainty, transparency and accountability. We do have the ARTC. Although the states are supposed to be cooperating through that, we found evidence during that inquiry that it was not exactly what was happening. We need access pricing that is transparent and accountable. We need an examination of public liability insurance—and this is very difficult for small niche operators like the ones in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. What we are doing by not addressing that is squeezing out all the small niche players. Then we need the control and management of the national track. I mentioned in my earlier comments my disappointment that we were not going to have a national land transport commission.
As we went around Australia we found that there were many things that could be fixed and fixed properly. These included double-stacking through the Adelaide Hills and the upgrading of the track into Adelaide. A lot of this has already happened near the electorate of the member for Corangamite. It was a sad thing when we were on that inquiry to know that when we inspected the track in his area, the train from Adelaide to Melbourne travelled the distance in 13 hours when 60 years ago it also took 13 hours. You just cannot have that sort of thing and have an efficient system. 
The whole thing, as I see it, really gets down to the track, and in the parlance of the industry, below track and above track. The committee was essentially interested in the below track operation, that is, the permanent way—the sleepers, the track, and the basic infrastructure that goes with that. It is the operation on which the thing runs. If you like, we were saying to the government, `We believe that the line from Brisbane to Perth, both through Broken Hill and Melbourne, should be treated like a national rail highway, and it should be of a standard commensurate with that.' 
This is not just a pipedream or people throwing ideas around in a flurry of rail excitement. In Queensland, two Labor and two coalition governments have had a focus on upgrading the north coast line, and especially the section from Brisbane to Rockhampton. Ten years ago it took 14 hours for a train to go to Rockhampton from Brisbane, and now it takes seven hours. You can get a train from Bundaberg to Brisbane at 5 o'clock in the morning and it gets you into Brisbane at 9 o'clock, faster than you can drive your car. In my own electorate it takes me 2¼ hours to drive from Bundaberg to Gladstone. The train does it in 1½ hours. These are not pie in the sky concepts, they can be achieved. 
I commend governments of both political colours in Queensland for their approach. They know you have to get the track right—the big eight-inch tracks, taking out all the crook curves, and being game enough to scrap metal bridges and put up modern concrete ones. And I might say that these concrete ones are built to standard gauge so that in years to come, when the track has to go to standard gauge, all the bridges are in place. It requires that sort of vision. That is what we have to have: a vision of rail in Australia. 
It is going to require a leap of faith by government. For example, we said we should spend $250 million a year in getting the preliminary bugs out of the whole system and then $202 billion over 10 years. That is only $200 million a year. Look at what we spend on roads. It is unbelievable that governments of both political persuasions in this country cannot see past that veil that I spoke about before. It is interesting that Smorgon was fairly complimentary, but I thought the Productivity Commission lacked a bit of vision when it came to this particular issue.
We believe, too, that there has to be operational uniformity. You cannot have a system where you have got signals meaning different things in different states and different safety standards. At the time we were doing the inquiry there were 14 different radio systems running across Australia. That meant more than one system in some states. That has to be taken out of the system, that is just absolutely fundamental, and a one-off grant could have done that. 
We tried to take a practical look at things. You do not have to have an inquiry every time you do something. For example, we said that in matters of safety we need first to have a rail safety regulator—this was a concern expressed by speakers—particularly in Sydney at present. But, broadly speaking, first we need to have such a safety regulator, and the states would probably need to surrender some authority to that. Then you need a rail accident investigation unit, quite separate from the regulator, as we have in aviation. The model is already there; it is just a matter of paralleling those procedures. That would make a huge difference. It would be an incentive to the state rail authorities to come up to a national standard knowing that if there were accidents they were going to be scrutinised to a very high degree. 
Training is very important. We said that there should be a curriculum for train drivers. They should not just be seen as people in sooty overalls, which is the vision of other people. These are young, well-trained men who can be the young technocrats of today's society. I am not suggesting they all have to traipse off to university, but I am saying that you could have a number of designated TAFE colleges in Australia that were delivering a standard training system. If you get in a plane in Cairns, Fremantle or Hobart, you know the pilot has been trained to the one national standard. That is what it should be in rail. It is a nonsense to think that you have got to change drivers at borders. If we are going to have a national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth, then we need to make sure that the training is uniform. 
There is a fair degree of unanimity between Tracking Australia and the Smorgon report. I found the Productivity Commission report a bit too hard-nosed and a bit impractical. You cannot solve all these problems simply by saying that private industry will solve it. We have a huge deficit that has to be made up. I am a great states righter where states rights need to be sandbagged—I will not have any intrusion of the Commonwealth into it. But I believe the national rail system, by its very name, invites the surrender of some authority from the states to the Commonwealth—not in their intrastate rail system, but purely in the interstate system, the national highway idea. It has been done for roads. The state road authorities quite often do the work for the Commonwealth; they are quite often the contractors for the Commonwealth. It could be just the same for rail. It does not mean the states have been cut out of it; it means they are becoming more integrated players.
The other thing that comes through very clearly is that Smorgon also had a vision for rail not unlike the one we had ourselves. I am accused sometimes of being a bit of a socialist—I know that offends my colleague the member for Corangamite—but my personal view is that the ARTC needs—
—I would be a socialist to the extent that I would like to see the ARTC become either a total Commonwealth instrumentality or an instrumentality to the states where it had full and unbridled control. If it was privatised after it had done its preliminary work of getting the rail track in Australia into order, I would not be so upset. I do not think we are ever going to catch up unless the funding can be poured, in a focused way, into a national rail system. As I said before, that means getting out the curves, redoing the bridges, double stacking on the east-west corridor, extending the loops so the trains can pass—all those sorts of things. It is all a matter of efficiency. 
Some of the items in this response I am disappointed with, some I am heartened with. I continue to call on government for a greater national vision for the Australian rail system. I commend our original report which we will follow up in the future. (Time expired).
