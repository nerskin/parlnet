Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (12:01):  I move:


That: 


(1) the House invite the Honourable Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, to attend and address the House on Tuesday, 8 July 2014, at 10.50 am; 


(2) unless otherwise ordered, at the sitting of the House on Tuesday, 8 July 2014: 


(a) the proceedings shall be welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and an address by the Prime Minister of Japan, after which the sitting of the House automatically shall be adjourned; and 


(b) the provisions of standing order 257(c) shall apply to the area of Members' seats as well as the galleries; 


(3) a message be sent to the Senate inviting Senators to attend the House as guests for the welcoming remarks by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and address by the Prime Minister of Japan; and 


(4) any variation to this arrangement be made only by an action by the Speaker. 


On 8 July, Tuesday week, at 10.50 am the Prime Minister of Japan will be attending the parliament to address a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. We envisage that that will take an hour or so and other invitations may be issued to members for the rest of the day. We are very much looking forward to the Prime Minister of Japan visiting Australia and we are privileged and honoured that he will accept our invitation to address the parliament on 8 July at 10.50 am.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (12:02):  The opposition supports the motion, welcomes the opportunity that Prime Minister Abe will be addressing the parliament and provides full support for this. It is a great thing for this parliament when we have leaders of other countries come and address us. We look very much forward to it, and I have no doubt that this would be the best of the resolutions moved by the Leader of the House today.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business for such an accord of welcome being made on this occasion. The question is that the motion be agreed to.


Question agreed to.

Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (13:56):  The Abbott government has demonstrated since its election that it does not care about the welfare of everyday Australians. The Abbott government's cruel and irresponsible policies will hit local communities hard. Pensioners, low-income earners and families with school-aged children will be particularly hard hit. 


Before the election, Tony Abbott promised elderly Australians that there would be no changes to pensions. Come the budget, this promise was forgotten. The changes made to pensions will mean that more people are likely to be bumped off the pension or incur a lower rate of pension. Making ends meet is already a tough job for many pensioners, and these harsh measures will make it near impossible in the future. In Batman, this will mean over 24,000 pensioners will be worse off. 


This situation is made even more dire by the unfair GP tax. This ideological tax affects the most vulnerable people in our nation—low-income earners, the elderly and the sick. Everyday Australians should not have to pay for the Prime Minister's phoney economic crisis. Eighty-seven per cent of doctor consultations in Batman are currently bulk-billed. The new GP tax will force those residents who have relied on bulk-billing services in the past to now fork out to see a doctor. This new tax will cost the residents in Batman over $6 million a year. 


The Abbott government's decision to cut the schoolkids bonus betrays the young people of Batman and their families. (Time expired)

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (13:59):  I want to make it very clear that the Australian government respects the legitimacy of the Egyptian government and its legal system, but we are shocked and dismayed by the Greste decision. We understand and support the Egyptian government's crackdown on extremist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, but we fail to see how this is helped by a very harsh sentence that has been directed to people who were reporting on the brotherhood, not supporting it.


Some weeks ago, I spoke to the Acting President of Egypt, Mr Mansour. Over the weekend I spoke to the newly elected President of Egypt, President al-Sisi. I want to assure the House that the Australian government will continue to make intercessions at every level with the Egyptian government and elsewhere to try to ensure that Peter Greste and his colleagues are swiftly released.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:01):  Like all Australians, I and Labor are appalled by the grievous decision dealt to Peter Greste last night. Our first thoughts today must be for Peter Greste and the entire Greste family. The family was shocked by the totally devastating news. Peter's parents, Juris and Lois, have won a nation of admirers for their optimism and stoicism through this ordeal. His brothers Mike and Andrew have been strong and were among the throng in an Egyptian courtroom yesterday to hear their worst fears confirmed.


All the Grestes should know that the Australian parliament will stand with them however long it takes to resolve the decision about their beloved son and brother. We believe fundamentally in the freedom of journalists to be able to do their work. It was Thomas Jefferson who said that liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost. No journalist should be imprisoned for doing their job—for reporting the news. As long as Peter Greste and more than 200 journalists around the world languish in jail the freedom of us all is diminished.


I agree with the Prime Minister on the need for a calm approach. Moments like this stir something elemental in the spirit of all free people. These are times when passions run high but the best interests of Peter and his two colleagues will not be served by inflammatory rhetoric. It is a time for diligent, calm and focused diplomacy. That is what Australia owes the Greste family. It is the duty of all us—what we owe to a fellow Australian unjustly imprisoned far from home.


This morning I wrote to the Prime Minister to advise that Labor will be taking an entirely constructive and bipartisan approach to this most important situation. I say to the members of the government, on behalf of the Labor Party: we are ready and willing to assist your every effort. We will do what we can to assist. 


I also recognise that for all our fine words, Peter Greste is still in jail in Egypt. The real challenge is to bring him home.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:14): Last night we received the second decision in just a fortnight from the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO to reflect on this government's environmental record and it is high time for this House to debate what has emerged in nine short months to be an appalling record on our protection of the natural environment. Recently—and I think I had occasion to say this this morning—the Prime Minister in his new habit of modest self-deprecation, talking about himself, started to describe himself as a conservationist. Up there with his self-description as the best friend pensioners have ever had and the best friend that Medicare ever had, he started to talk about himself as a conservationist.


He road-tested this new self-deprecating moniker in Canada. We had occasion earlier this morning to talk about his trip to Canada and to other places to test the temperature of other nations as we build to the Paris Conference on Climate Change next year. As I said, he luxuriated in the warm embrace of the Canadian Prime Minister in a bout of climate scepticism and, after that experience, he let it be known quietly to Australian journalists that he was going to build a coalition. He was going to set about building a coalition of the unwilling to start to fight the Americans, the Chinese, the French, the Brits, the Germans, the Koreans, all those other nations who had indicated an intention, domestically and internationally to start to build the mood for change, to start to build momentum for climate action. 


So confident was the Prime Minister that he would be able to do this that he even let it be known to these Australian journalists who the members of this coalition for the unwilling would be. He let it be known that New Zealand will join and that United Kingdom would join. The problem was of course that he did not actually go and consult with the UK Prime Minister or the New Zealand Prime Minister, and the New Zealand Prime Minister had to admit only hours later that he was caught completely unawares about this new coalition of the unwilling announced by Prime Minister Abbott to Australian journalists in the warm embrace of the Canadian Prime Minister. The New Zealand Prime Minister confirmed that they were still committed to taking strong action on climate change in New Zealand domestically and to being a responsible partner in the lead-up to the Paris conference. The UK Prime Minister and his spokespeople also confirmed and touted their strong record—a Tory government this is, Madam Speaker—on climate change domestically, within Europe and internationally.


After seeing this road-testing, this new moniker of conservationist over in Canada and here, I think, in parliament as well, the Australian people could see clearly what was what. The Australian people are wise people and they judge their leaders and their politicians on their actions not on words, and this Prime Minister is no more a conservationist than John Howard was a Communist. The United Kingdom Independent newspaper got much closer to the truth earlier this year when in February they asked a question on the lips of so many Australians. On 4 February they asked:


Is Tony Abbott's Australian administration the most hostile to his nation's environment in history?


This question has been on the lips of so many Australians for the last nine months. 


It must be said that the last nine months have been nine months of unwinding environmental protections and unwinding programs that are targeted at the conservation of Australia's beautiful natural environment and extraordinary biodiversity. In Australia, it must be said, a continent with a beautiful natural environment but extraordinary natural resources as well, there is often a fine line between being the Minister for the Environment and being the Assistant Minister for Resources. For too long over this nine-month period this minister, this Prime Minister and this government have been way, way on the wrong side of that fine line.


I have had occasion to talk about a number of the decisions that this government has made in these nine short months and I want to go through a few of them before I address the one that was reflected in the decision of the World Heritage Committee last night. Very quickly, the government decided to delist the Murray below Darling as a Threatened Ecological Community, a decision that had been based on the advice of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee that had been working on this matter for some years, a decision based on a groundless scare campaign that had been run in the Murray-Darling Basin. 


They have also decided in the budget to cut almost $500 million from the Landcare program, a program that results from the merger of the old Landcare program and Caring for Our Country, two programs that deliver extraordinary outcomes particularly to Australia's land sector through revegetation and a whole range of other programs led by farmers and conservationists across our continent. This cut has been made in spite of a clear promise made last year that the Landcare budget would not be cut.


We have seen the rolling back of management plans for the world's largest system of marine reserves, an extraordinary reform driven, as so many of these reforms were over the last few years, by my friend the Manager of Opposition Business, and, again, the decision has been based on the most groundless scare campaign. All around the country, and particularly in Queensland, we saw these scare campaigns about the interruption that these reserves would have to recreational fishing, notwithstanding that off the Queensland coast these reserves were several hundred kilometres away. 


Again, we have seen so many different ways in which this government in nine short months has started to attack clean energy programs. We saw again from the member for Higgins over the course of the last 24 or 36 hours, the brazenness, the openness with which backbenchers are now quite happy to talk down the very clear commitments that the minister, his parliamentary secretary and other spokespeople within the coalition parties made in the lead-in to the election campaign about the bipartisan nature of the core components of Australia's clean energy program. Quite openly the backbenchers do not even bother to background journalists anymore. They quite openly and brazenly talk down the government's quite clear commitments made before the election campaign to continue Australia's proud record on clean energy. And I do not have time to address the debacle that is the solar roofs plan.




Mr Frydenberg:
  What about the pink batts?




Mr BUTLER:
  The minister says that he will mention that because he has no record of his own in environmental protection to talk about. It is going to be a very long 10 minutes for this minister to try and talk about environmental protection over nine very short months.


This government is not content just to shut down environmental programs. It is also intent on shutting down community voices. We have seen this in so many different forums. This government is absolutely committed to shutting down strong, independent, expert and community voices. One of the first decisions that this government took was to entirely defund, from a Commonwealth perspective, the Environmental Defenders Offices. This was a program that endured right through the Howard government. These offices are made up essentially of volunteers who provide legal advice to community groups who wish to object to developments in their community. What did this government do? It completely defunded them because the last thing this government wants—the last thing this Prime Minister wants—is a strong, independent, community voice voicing opposition to something that this government wants.


This fortnight, in the World Heritage Committee, we have seen the culmination of a couple of very serious problems that this government has around environmental protection. I am sure the member for Watson will address one of these issues in far more detail than I have time to. Last night, we saw the World Heritage Committee dismiss out of hand one of the most bizarre applications we have ever seen from the Commonwealth of Australia, a country that has been a responsible, leading citizen of the World Heritage system for the 40 years since it became only the seventh nation to join the World Heritage convention. It is a bizarre application to delist 70,000 hectares, which rightly has been dismissed out of hand by the World Heritage Committee, and it follows on from a decision by the World Heritage Committee only last week which called on this government to postpone and to hold back on the handover of environmental protection powers to state and local governments because it might impact on the Great Barrier Reef. This government has not even bothered to respond to that decision by the World Heritage Committee. There has been no response that I have seen to the World Heritage Committee's call to postpone the handover of environmental protection powers to state and local governments. Instead, what we saw was this government persisting in bringing forward legislation in blatant disregard of the committee's recommendation—an ultimate decision to push legislation through to hand over the environmental protection powers. It is the culmination of an appalling record on environmental protection.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-06-24,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (15:24):  Let me begin with two words: pink batts. If you want to define the record of environmental incompetence under the previous government, just start with two words: pink batts. It was a $2 billion catastrophic failure. There were over 100,000 roofs that had to be fixed. There were over 200 house fires. What we also saw during that time was a $500 million bill just to fix their own program. It was a $500 million bill just to fix the roof. That was the reality. These are not our figures; these are Labor's own budget figures. This is the level of incompetence that we saw. They may have airbrushed history, but those of us who have watched with interest the passage of the royal commission have witnessed a litany of catastrophically foolish ignorance with regard to the inevitable consequences of a dumb design. It was a dumb design and you know it, and it came, sadly, with the most catastrophic of human consequences.


Let me run through the litany: pink batts, Green Loans, Green Start, 'cash for clunkers'. We loved 'cash for clunkers'! It summarised the entire ALP approach to the environment. This is not to mention the citizens' assembly. That was another beauty. That was, in fact, the climate policy they had before they had the carbon tax, and it was the policy they took to the 2010 election. Then there was the wondrous carbon tax, but I will come back to that in a minute, because let us just remember Green Loans. Green Loans was another signature policy which ended up at an average cost of $100,000 per $1,000 loan. It may sound extraordinary, but the average price per loan distributed was about $100,000. They spent $100 million. They issued just over—just over, I will concede that—1,000 loans. Therefore, the program, on average, cost $100,000 each for loans which were just over $1,000 each. It is a level of incompetence rivalled and surpassed only by the Home Insulation Program.


Then we go from Green Loans to 'cash for clunkers'. This was, of course, the signature program. It was going to be a giant. It was going to transform the automotive sector—except that it never happened. They were so moved by the beauty and the glory of the 'cash for clunkers' program that, in the end, it collapsed. In the end—



A government member:  It crashed.




Mr HUNT:
  it crashed. In the end, they could not even bring it to bear.


The citizens' assembly, of course, was going to be the parliament you have when you are not having a parliament. This was because, leading into the 2010 election—members of this House may remember—the policy was: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead; instead, there will be a citizens' assembly under a government I lead.' They did not have the citizens' assembly; they did introduce a tax for which they had no mandate. Then they went to the last election, as everybody knows, pledging to terminate that tax.


So what is the consequence? The consequence is that we now know that Australians have faced just over $15.4 billion in taxes over the last two years which they pledged we would never have. If this tax is not repealed, they are set to face an additional $550 a year of household costs over and above that which they would ordinarily face. This is, again, in breach of an election promise from last year. And the litany goes on, whether it is the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, which crashed, or the Green Car Innovation Fund, which was going to be a multimillion-dollar program. They took $400 million out of it one day and then they took $400 million out of it another day. The effect was nothing. The effect was a grandly announced program which ended up being slashed and destroyed.


What we saw throughout the last government was a very simple pattern: grand announcement and then catastrophic failure. Let me just remind the House of some of these grand announcements. There was the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, which they were going to keep. They then slashed $135 million and $65 million from it. In the Green Car Innovation Fund, I pointed out a $400 million cut then another $400 million cut. The National Solar Schools Program, one of their signature initiatives—gone. Retooling for climate change, at $37 million—gone. The Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program was a beauty; it was going to be an absolute corker. They sunk $420 million from it, and then there was another $60 million, and then the Carbon Capture and Storage Institute was a catastrophic failure. One of their favourites was the Solar Flagships Program, which was allocated $1½ billion five years ago. You would remember that then Prime Minister Rudd made a grand announcement. But, in five years, how many watts of energy have been introduced? Zero, nix, nada—not one. It is a $1½ billion program that, to date, has produced precisely nothing. However, Ian Macfarlane is going to make sure that the contracts that are being delivered under the ARENA program will deliver real value for money.


This brings me to the comparison with what we are doing. We have set out four areas—clean air, clean land, clean water, and heritage protection. In terms of clean air, we will get rid of a carbon tax which does not work, which had a 0.1 per cent decrease in emissions for a $7½ billion tax in year one. Instead, we will directly focus on cleaning up power stations. We will not give brown coal power stations $5½ billion to do nothing. We will clean up waste coalmine gas, we will clean up waste landfill gas, we will capture methane emissions and we will encourage energy efficiency and improvement in the land sector. We are already delivering, in terms of clean air, a supercomputer for the Bureau of Meteorology—which was meant to have been funded by the previous government but was not—to monitor what this country is doing, to deliver forecasts of a much higher standard, and to deliver early warnings for cyclones, bushfires and floods.


In terms of clean land, we have already passed through the Senate—and I thank the opposition for their help on this—a half a billion dollar Green Army program. This will put 15,000 young Australians into paid training over the coming years. It will ensure that we improve our local environment. It will clean up riparian areas. It will allow us to engage in revegetation, the removal of blackberries, the planting of native species, the installation of boardwalks, the recovery of mangroves, the recovery of foreshore areas—real work which actually provides real environmental outcomes at a local level, delivering what local communities want, with training that leads to certificates, employment and a sense of self-worth. That is what we are delivering through the Green Army.


We are also delivering $2 billion in natural resource funding as set out at page 27 of the portfolio budget statement. There will be $1 billion for the National Landcare Program. There will be a small grants program, to be announced before the commencement of August, as both the Minister for Agriculture and I had committed to. We are delivering half a billion dollars for the Green Army. In addition to that, there is Working on Country funding and a $40 million Reef Trust to deal with the highest priority threats to the reef. This is exactly what we are doing.


In terms of clean water, we have completed the work of the Murray-Darling Basin agreement. The parliamentary secretary, Simon Birmingham, has done a brilliant job in helping complete the work of three governments and protecting the Murray-Darling Basin for the long run—along with what we are doing for the Reef Trust and coastal river recovery initiatives which will help the Torrens, Swan, Yarra and Tamar rivers and the Tuggerah Lakes.


I want to deal with some of the claims made in relation to World Heritage. As members opposite would know, in 2011, under their watch, the World Heritage Committee raised questions about the status of the reef—and in 2012 and 2013. This year they made a finding that there had been significant work and progress. They made a finding that they were moving towards a positive outcome. In other words, after three years of failure, we have had the most significant improvement yet in the findings of that body. In relation to the decision last night, we had a mandate; we took it to the people and we were given that mandate. We then took it to the international body. We accept the umpire's decision, as does the Tasmanian government. Yes, there is disappointment in that, but let me be clear: we accept the umpire's decision there. Do you accept the umpire's decision in terms of the Australian people and the carbon tax? If you do, get out of the way! (Time expired)

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:34):  There have been questions in the parliament for some time as to whether we had an energy minister or an environment minister. I was wondering during the MPI speech we have just had from the minister whether he might name a single living thing. With 1½ minutes to go, he said the word 'reef'—so there was a moment in his speech where he named a living thing. But what we have seen from the environment minister is that, every time he has stood up, he has wanted to answer energy questions. He has not wanted to talk in any way about what is core business for an environment minister—certainly one of his predecessors, Robert Hill, regarded it as a core business—and that is to actually take a level of responsibility for the environment of Australia and its conservation.


What happened last night is no small deal. What happened overnight at the World Heritage Committee cannot in any way be simply overlooked. What happened at the World Heritage Committee last night was that Australia made an application to join the ranks of Oman and Tanzania, the only two countries that have sought the de-listing of an area of natural heritage. In doing so, they had an extraordinary response from the World Heritage Committee. I was watching it online last night. We had a speech from Colombia and a speech from Germany. But the speech from Portugal was extraordinary—and I quote:


The justifications presented for the reduction are to say the least feeble. Accepting this de-listing today would be setting an unacceptable precedent impossible to deny in similar circumstances in the future. If this committee cares for conservation according to responsible engagement of states parties to the convention when they submit their nominations, we cannot accept this requested delisting.


Last night the chair, having heard three speeches opposing what the Australian government was wanting to do, then asked if any of the representatives on the World Heritage Committee wanted to amend the draft recommendation to in any way support Australia's position. And there was silence.


Algeria, Colombia, Croatia, Finland, Germany, India, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Senegal, Serbia, Turkey and Vietnam are all doing more to protect the environment of Australia than the Australian government. All of them are doing more to protect the environment of Australia than Australia's own environment minister.


And let us not forget the significance of the Tasmanian Forestry Agreement and the way it came together. Because let's face it: both sides of politics for years played the same game with Tasmanian forestry and Tasmanian conservation. John Howard did it in 1996 and we, the Labor Party, did it on occasions, that is, they sat down and did deals directly with NGOs, to trade for election pamphlets that they then took to the election that stated that certain areas would be put into conservation and other areas would not. Instead, for the first time the then government decided—it did not work to political advantage, that is true, but it was the right thing to do—to sit down and to say to the forestry sector: 'If you reach an agreement with the environmental sector, we will back it in.' There were times during that process when we were bagged by the Greens. Please do not tell us that the Greens were backing us the whole way through that, because anyone who looked at the news knows that that is not true. We said that if the parties reach an agreement, we will back it in. That is exactly why it happened and for very good reason.


Those who understand modern forestry industries understand that you need your export markets, which, increasingly, require certification. The key to certification has been saved for export markets for Tasmanian timber, because the World Heritage Committee had a level of responsibility that the Australian government did not have. It had a level of responsibility of ensuring that the long-term interests of the Tasmanian timber industry to keep that agreement in place did remain in place. That is why the forestry industry themselves wrote to the World Heritage Committee pleading to reject what the Australian government were trying to do. They had done the right thing by the Australian environment. The tallest flowering plants in the world get protected, the forestry industry gets protected out of this and the political game that the government tried to play is at an end. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-06-24,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:40):  I am pleased to make my contribution to this MPI about protecting Australia's natural environment. I would like to start by suggesting that the most important part of our natural environment is the air that we breathe, because we all have to breathe that air. I would also like at this time to explain how the carbon tax not only damages exports, the economy and job creation; it actually damages our natural environment through damaging the air that we breathe. 


To start with, we all know that the carbon tax increases electricity prices. That is what it is designed to do. We know that those on the other side are quite happy to see electricity prices increase because it gives them that warm inner glow. They believe that it will stop the seas from rising, will stop fires and floods and will prevent bad weather. But it also has an effect in New South Wales of increasing electricity prices for consumers. In 2012-13, 24,888 families had their electricity disconnected. In the last six months it has actually got worse. In the first half of this year, in New South Wales alone, 25,900 families had their electricity disconnected simply because they could not afford to pay those increasing bills. That is 25,900 families in New South Wales alone that are seeing their electricity cut off because the electricity prices are too high. 


So what happens in parts of Sydney as we move into winter, when the temperatures fall in many parts of Sydney to zero or below, if people have their electricity cut off? They have to find alternative ways to warm their home. One way in which they can warm their home is to burn wood. Today on the radio in Sydney people are advertising wood for sale, for delivery. If you go to almost any garage in Western Sydney, there, piled up at the petrol station, are bags of timber, all cut up, which you can take home and burn. Of course, if you are fortunate enough to live next to some bushland, it is quite easy to go to the bush and collect a bit of wood to take home, to burn to keep your house warm. That is what we see happening.


When people burn wood, yes, you release carbon dioxide. But you also release, of much greater concern, particulate matter. That is the dust, soot and the particles that come out. While we know that CO2 makes plants grow, particulate matter is deadly. The World Health Organization has designated particulate matter as a carcinogen. It is our deadliest form of air pollution because it actually penetrates deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. Our most eminent scientists have told us that it causes lung cancer, heart disease, premature death and asthma in children. A Danish study in 2003 found there were simply no safe levels of particulate matter and that, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre of increase in PM10, lung cancer rates increased 22 per cent. It is even worse for the smaller particulate matter 2.5. For every 10 micrograms increase, that study found a 36 per cent increase in lung cancer. A more recent study done earlier this year, reported in the British Medical Journal, estimated that an annual exposure of PM2.5 of just five micrograms per cubic metre is linked to a 13 per cent increase in heart disease.


So we are making electricity dearer, we are forcing people to burn wood, because that is all they can afford—they cannot afford to turn on their heater—and that is releasing particulate matter in Western Sydney. It is of particular concern in Western Sydney because of the unique nature of our topography. We know that particulate matter gets trapped in there for days and days. In fact, over the last few years we have seen a significant and dangerous increase in particulate matter in Western Sydney. In fact, last year in Liverpool we were above the World Health Organization's recommended standard of PM10. We were also above the World Health Organization standard of PM10. This is simple. The major component of that particulate matter as measured by ANSTO is people burning wood from their fireplace. There is a clear link. As we increase electricity prices through the carbon tax we find more people burning wood to keep themselves warm and we are getting more particulate matter in the atmosphere. That is causing death and disease; it is harming the environment. That is why the carbon tax must go.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (15:45):  Providing appropriate environmental protection is one of the Australian government's core responsibilities and, sadly, it is already emerging as one of the Abbott government's starkest failings. As I have said before, the national government is in the best position—indeed, the only position—from which to have holistic regard to the health of Australia's forests, rivers and oceans; our rainforests, temperate coastland and deserts; and the incredible but fragile cornucopia of flora and fauna that our ancient continent supports. The Australian government is also charged with the serious responsibility of leading our engagement with other nations and in multilateral fora that exist to ensure the planet we all share is properly protected. 


Unfortunately, the abdication of this core responsibility is fast becoming a dominant theme in the coalition's approach to government. Those opposite seem to believe that our environment is an endlessly resilient and endlessly exploitable resource whose welfare can be left to the enlightened custody of those whose primary interest is profit, and, in many cases, whose long-term connection to Australia is tenuous. I am not someone who believes that farmers and miners and commercial fishers are ignorant or ambivalent when it comes to the environment—in fact, I know that workers and business owners are often acutely aware that sustainable economic activity only exists on a foundation of vigorous and high-standard environmental regulation. They know, as any sensible person knows, that an effective and robust system of environmental protection requires that government applies its resources, its scope of oversight and its regulatory mechanisms to guarantee the conservation and wellbeing of our natural world. 


The greatest harm to the environment is currently being done through the coalition's approach when it comes to climate change—which itself represents the greatest danger to both our environment and our economy. Climate change, for those of a rational mind, is the ideal prism through which to see once and for all the false dichotomy that regards the environment and the economy as opponents or competing interests. It reminds me of the Simpsons episode that features a Troy McClure documentary titled 'Man versus Nature: The Road to Victory!' Is that the road we're on now? Is it really possible that a government led by a self-proclaimed conservationist is set on tearing down the environmental protection framework of the last 30 years en route to a victory against nature, against sharks, against the Beeliar Wetlands and the Great Barrier Reef and the Tasmanian forests? Is that the kind of road-building Prime Minister we now have? Only the most dangerously foolish of fools could take the view that degrading the environment, threatening the climate and taking species to the brink of extinction is justified by some localised, limited economic benefit—especially in a country like ours that is particularly susceptible to a warming, drying climate; in a country that has so much invested in agriculture, fisheries and tourism; in a country that has only recently begun to explore and leverage our enormous potential in renewable energy and energy efficiency. To go right back, as this government seems intent on doing, to a kind of mindless 'rip-it-up', 'anything-goes', 'take-what-you-can-while-you-can' mindset is not only environmentally negligent, but also an act of social and economic negligence. 


I hope that all members in this place give due regard to the Climate Institute's Climate of the Nation 2014 survey released this week. Some of its most salient findings include the fact that 70 per cent of Australians recognise that climate change is occurring, 61 per cent want Australia to be a leader in pioneering climate change solutions, 57 per cent want the Abbott government to take climate change more seriously, more Australians support carbon pricing than oppose it, 70 per cent agree that tackling climate change creates economic opportunities, and 71 per cent believe the renewable energy target should be 20 per cent or higher. This is a message that I hope those opposite are starting to heed, because it is not too late. 


I want to acknowledge yesterday's decision by UNESCO at its World Heritage Committee meeting in Doha to reject the Australian government's attempt to have 74,000 hectares of the Tasmanian Wilderness Heritage Area delisted. The committee apparently took 10 minutes to dismiss what one member described as a 'feeble' proposal. The decision follows the UNESCO consideration of the Great Barrier Reef's status in light of the government's move to amend the EPBC Act. There is some likelihood that the government's move to devolve its responsibility for environmental assessment to state and local governments will cause UNESCO to reassess the reef as being 'in danger'. That would not be unexpected but it would be an eye-watering embarrassment for this government.


The Prime Minister has recently described himself as a conservationist and I am sure the overwhelming majority of Australians would like him to make good on that claim. But actions speak louder than words, and on the evidence before us the Prime Minister and the government he leads are now seeking to accelerate down the road to long-term environmental harm.

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-06-24,"



Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (15:50):  The member for Port Adelaide said that we could not find 10 minutes to talk about our environmental record. I just wish we had 20 minutes each, because when you set the hypocrisy of the motion that has been moved today against the extraordinarily bad record of the Labor Party over six years, it must be with a sense of shame that the member for Port Adelaide stood up to talk about environmental management issues. Unlike those opposite, we are taking real action to address environmental issues in our community. That is clearly evidenced by the commitment of $2 billion in the recent budget, in tight financial times, for a broad range of natural resource management and environmental initiatives across Australia. That is $2 billion for things like $1 billion for Landcare, as the minister said; $2.55 billion for the Emissions Reduction Fund; a supercomputer for the Bureau of Meteorology to provide improved delivery of forecasting and warning; $50 million over the next four years for the 20 Million Trees program; a coastal river recovery initiative to protect our waterways; and a whale and dolphin protection plan. Our Antarctic strategy is back on track with a plan to replace the Aurora Australis and maintain our Antarctic bases, and there is some $68 million to maintain our important Antarctic bases. 


The member for Port Adelaide talks about real projects. Let me talk about some of the regional things that are happening that he might be interested in. There is a multiplicity of projects delivered through 15 regional natural resources management organisations across the country. They will ensure that that important nexus between community needs and resources is as strong as it can be, where those community level priorities are the things that drive project deliver That is unlike those opposite, where you had a thought bubble, a rollout of incredible amounts of taxpayer money and then very little policy effect resulting from the extraordinary expenditure. If he wants some examples I will give him some.


The member for Flinders, the environment minister, came to Tasmania about a year before the election and committed to $3 million of funding for a healthier Tamar River. That is going to do some important things for my community. It will fund a three-year program of raking to control silt in the Tamar River. Some form of silt removal has been a feature of that river's management strategy for over 100 years. So this is real money for a real effect. Compare and contrast that with the promises made by the state Labor government. I will not talk about my Labor opponent in the last election; he made no promises for the Tamar River. But the state Labor government, prior to the 2010 election, promised $6.65 million for the Tamar and delivered absolutely nothing in terms of a silt mitigation effect. We also have some money put aside to see how we can turn the current archaic sewerage system around Launceston into something that is more First World so that, when there is a heavy rain event, sewage does not pollute the Tamar River. Some quick wins are going to be achieved there and we have a critical path to turning the current infrastructure of that sewerage system into something that is much more First World.


We have two valuable Green Army projects—one from King's Bridge to Duck Reach and another from King's Bridge to the Tailrace, to do things like biodiversity audits, seeding, fencing and making sure that young people who do that work gain some valuable skills they can use for their own purposes and future careers. We have a project that has been proposed by the George Town Council to capture stormwater before it goes into the rivulet and direct it, using a mixture of solar and wind power, to irrigate the playing fields in George Town. That is what you call a real local project. 


There are so many good projects for my community that have both strong interest and support, and these things are long overdue. So how dare those opposite, like the member for Port Adelaide, come in here and engage in such rampant hypocrisy after six years of their policy record: the train wreck of waste and thoughtless ideology over substance; the carbon tax which cost $15.4 billion over two years, yet emissions go up; the Home Insulation Program, which resulted in four deaths, 224 home fires, 70,000 repairs and $500 million to fix the problems it caused; the bungled Green Loans program—and I can go on and on. What I ask the member for Port Adelaide and those opposite to do is spare us the lectures and hypocrisy, get out of our way and let us fix your mess. (Time expired)

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (15:55):  I am proud to speak on this matter of public importance about the Minister for the Environment's abysmal record for defending the Australian environment. I know the member for Bass, who has just delivered a speech, is only going to be here for a short time but at least when he is looking for a job in two years time he will have the record for giving the worst environmental speech ever from a Tasmanian. He did not mention in his speech the fact that the budget ripped half a billion dollars away from Landcare programs. I thought he might mention that. He did not mention the environment minister's promises of $600 million for solar roofs, solar towns and solar schools—a pre-election comment that was forgotten straight after the election. Only $2.1 million remains for solar towns. The member for Bass did mention some scientific research. However, the budget saw environmental research cut by $21.7 billion.



Government members interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  They can bray all they like over there. The reality is that I am quoting from their budget paper. I know, coming from Queensland, how important the environment is. I grew up at a time when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was the premier and was dedicated to doing sandmining on Fraser Island. It was the then Commonwealth government and a Liberal minister, in fact the now Premier Newman's father, who stepped up to defend Fraser Island. So I know the conservative side of politics does have some runs on the board for protecting the environment. Sadly, we saw in December 2009, when the member for Warringah became the leader, the polarisation on the environment when suddenly we saw the start of appeals to the selfishness that is inherent in some people. Rather than appealing for people to use their wallets and make a small change in their behaviour—putting out the lights, changing how things are done in factories and with transport—that will be to the benefit of the country, instead the Liberal Party has appealed to selfishness, to those lesser angels. It has been an incredibly effective campaign and some of them have swallowed it hook, line and sinker.


Sadly, it is the more moderate voices among those opposite who understand the economies of direct action—which, let's be honest, is an absolute dog of a policy. No economist in the world can support direct action. Why? Because it will not work. Because we have already put a price on carbon, emissions have dropped; it has changed behaviour. We do believe in scientists and we would actually have a science minister. We are not trying to shut down and sack scientists; we believe in the science. Those opposite are environmental vandals, sabotaging the future and our economy. Remember, by putting a price on emissions we will be better prepared to sell our services and our green products to the world.



Government members interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  Those opposite are braying unnecessarily, like in a scene from a Banjo Paterson poem. They have wrapped themselves around this husk of a policy but we know that the costs associated with direct action will be all but a waste of money. Their magic dirt policy will not create any reduction in emissions because all the good achievements have already been rolled out. Let's look at what has been happening. In Queensland, Jeff Seeney, the day after the election, suddenly said the Great Barrier Reef should be a smaller marine park. We have seen the incredibly shameful situation where the member for Flinders's feeble attempt to shrink the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area by 150,000 football fields was shown on the world stage to be sabotage.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2014-06-24,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia) (16:00):  It is funny that Labor claims that the Liberal-National government fails to protect Australia's natural environment.



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for Bass is testing my patience.




Ms LANDRY:
  It is funny because their matter of public importance today really is a joke. It is a joke like one of those appalling jokes that you get inside a Christmas bonbon. Let me explain.


I live in Yeppoon, on the beautiful Capricorn Coast. It is a great place with a great view of the Keppel island group, which sits off the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. Yeppoon is a great place to holiday, and in fact I invite all Australians to book a holiday and come to Yeppoon. You will love it. My position on living near the Great Barrier Reef is quite clear. There must always be balanced consideration for industry growth and job creation, our coastal lifestyle and the conservation of the reef itself.


When it comes to looking out for the Great Barrier Reef, a great natural wonder, this government has been working hard. We are doing what UNESCO asked us to do by limiting port development to key existing ports along the Queensland coastline. At the Abbot Point coal terminal in North Queensland the federal government has applied the strictest environmental standards in Australian history with regard to any future expansion activity. When they were in power, Labor wanted to dump 38 million cubic metres of dredging sand from Abbot Point into the water at the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. Our government, however, is far more responsible in caring for Australia's natural environment. The coalition government has limited such activity to three million cubic metres in the interest of the reef. Let's do the sums: Labor wanted to dump 38 million cubic metres of dredge near the reef; that is 35 million more than we will allow. What a joke!


But we are not the only ones that see Labor's bungling of the environment as a joke. Let me refer you to a brilliant article in a recent online edition of London's Daily Telegraph. It was written by Andrew Critchlow. It appeals to the British Prime Minister not to make the same mistakes on climate change as the Australian Labor Party. Let me quote directly from this article:


As flood waters across Britain continue to rise the calls will inevitably grow louder for Prime Minister David Cameron to take … action on climate change by imposing tougher green taxes on business.


In the current circumstance it would be easy for Mr Cameron to make a knee jerk response and fall into the political trap of raising taxes on emissions to counter global warming, which many experts already blame for causing the current deluge.


Before acting the prime minister would be wise to draw on the experience of Australia, where the call for major policy changes to counter adverse weather cycles have spectacularly backfired.


A series of environmental disasters Down Under coupled with the Australian Labor Party's reliance on an uneasy coalition with the Greens forced former Prime Minister Julia Gillard … to press ahead with a controversial so called ""carbon tax"" on emissions.


The tax—which almost cost the Australian government more to collect than it raised in actual revenue, or achieved in terms of a better environment—was … poorly thought out …


…   …   …


The tax was designed to hit the country's biggest emitters of carbon pollution such as mining and energy companies. Instead it added to the uncertainty hanging over the resources boom, the main driver for the Australian economy.


…   …   …


Ultimately, the tax failed in its political objective of holding together Labor's fragile minority government with the Greens, or winning over voters who faced higher costs passed on by the companies that had to pay it.


The London Telegraph went on to describe Labor's carbon tax as 'perhaps the most unsuccessful and ineffectual policy in the country's history'. It warned the British Prime Minister not to go down the same path as the Australian Labor Party.


Let me get back to the very first point I raised—that Labor's matter of public importance today is a joke. It reminds me of the last lines of a song. I will not sing it, but it goes like this: 'Send in the clowns, send in the clowns. Don't worry, they're here.'

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:04):  What a pleasure it is to rise in this place to speak about the environment. I see that the purported environment minister is in the House with us today. Wouldn't it be nice if the purported environment minister ever got up and spoke about the environment in question time. Wouldn't it be nice if in question time there was ever a question about the environment to the so-called environment minister, but there is not. As I have said before, one day the purported environment minister will come in here and talk about the environment, and I am pretty sure that everyone will fall over in shock because here we have an environment minister who would rather speak about anything else but the environment. We have an environment minister who has been unable to deliver the solar policy that he spoke about, and we have an environment minister who is making some questionable decisions when it comes to climate policy.


Let's have a think about the Emissions Reduction Fund—what an amazingly ridiculous policy we are talking about. Here is a fund where polluters will be paid to pollute, where there will be no cap on pollution—



Mr Hutchinson interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Lyons is grossly disorderly.




Ms BUTLER:
  and where there will be no requirement on any single person or any single company. There will be no requirement to reduce emissions. There will be no cap on emissions. There will be payments to polluters.


Why would the so-called Minister for the Environment want to introduce such a policy when the obvious difficulties with it are there for everybody to see? For example, how on earth could we be persuaded of the additionality of the measures that will be brought in and funded under the ERF? How on earth could we be persuaded that that is good value for taxpayer money? How on earth could we be persuaded that the same companies that are benefiting from the ERF would not be taking the same mitigation actions as they otherwise would be were it not for the taxpayer subsidising them?


Of course, the biggest question of all when it comes to the Emissions Reduction Fund is: why replace the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a spectacularly successful policy, with an Emissions Reduction Fund where taxpayers pay polluters? Why not keep the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a commercial lending operation where moneys are lent to people who want to take action to mitigate pollution and want to reduce emissions? And it is a win-win because the Clean Energy Finance Corporation runs at a profit. Money is made by lending money on appropriate terms to companies that want to reduce pollution and mitigate emissions. Why not have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation instead of this ridiculous ERF policy that has been universally panned? No-one in this place and no-one outside this place thinks that this government has any credibility whatsoever when it comes to the environment. We have seen the lack of credibility. You just have to look as recently as yesterday when the bizarre application to the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO was quite properly knocked back by the World Heritage Committee.




Mr Hutchinson:
  Have you ever been to Tasmania?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyons!




Ms BUTLER:
  Yes, I have been to Tasmania. And, like the previous Labor speaker, I am from the bush as well.




Mr Pasin:
  Have you ever met a timber worker?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Barker!




Ms BUTLER:
  I am from up north. I know all about the environment, and that is why I am so shocked by this mob and what it is prepared to do when it comes to the environment. Not only was this mob prepared to make an application to the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO to seek to delist 74,000 hectares of forest from World Heritage but also, had the application been accepted, it would have made us only the third country to actively seek to delist World Heritage. It is ridiculous! And it is making Australia a laughing stock. All I can say is: thank goodness for the World Heritage Committee and the sensible decision that it made not to allow the application to delist those 74,000 hectares of forest.


We know that we have a lot of work to do when it comes to the World Heritage Committee. We have had to have the World Heritage Committee give the Queensland government a rap over the knuckles and give the federal government a rap over the knuckles when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:09):  It is a pleasure to rise on this occasion. I speak to the gallery and to yourself in particular, Deputy Speaker Scott, and to those listening to the debate. You would think from the speeches that I have heard today, from the shadow minister through all the speakers, that the governments of today and governments in the past have served the nation poorly—and, actually, that is not the case. 


In my experience, from when the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke said we were going to plant a billion trees until today, I have seen the nation, when it has had the money to do it, invest heavily in the environment for the betterment of the people—your children and the children to come. I have seen it in my own district. I was reminded yesterday by the Millennium Goals people how beautiful my electorate was. They had had dealings in Gippsland. They then began to describe my electorate to me. They described Wilsons 'Prom'; they described Mount Baw Baw and the hills; they described the farmland; and they described all the work that Landcare had done over many years that has transformed areas of the Strzeleckis. Through all of the governments down the ages, especially the Howard government, do you know what we saw? Because they had the money to do the job, as you would know, Deputy Speaker Scott, they poured money into the environment. We had the money to do it.


The difference with the previous government that we have just experienced is that the money was blown. It was gone. You cannot be green when you are in the red. Having said that, as a community, and, obviously, from the speeches that you have heard today, we care about the environment on both sides of the House. I am disappointed in some of the remarks that came from the Labor people today, because—and I say to the gallery—they are actually not true about this government. I would say about the previous government it was a good idea to put pink batts into houses across Australia, but the delivery turned into a monumental horror story and into sadness for the families that were directly affected.


Are some of the things that we do as a community good ideas? Yes, they are good ideas. We do not build houses now without insulating those houses. We make sure that there has been a massive change in the way that we build houses here, the way farmers think about their property, the way we have non-till ploughing, the way we have non-till sowing, and all the changes that have been made in Tasmania. It is one of the most beautiful places in Australia. One of my reps in the shop used to come in and say, 'Tasmania, mate, it is Australia's, if not the world's, best kept secret—Tasmania.' I know the three representatives that sit close by me here are passionate about their community. They show it in everything they do and in every approach they take. I want you to be proud of what has happened.


Now, you are going to say that I am right out of order here but I actually do not like international bodies making decisions about what happens here in this country. I really do not like it. I like the fact that local government makes decisions about what they do with their dogs and where you can walk them. I like the fact that state governments make decisions about how they are going to manage their police force. I like the fact that we make decisions here about defence and social security. I would like to think that the Australian government actually is clear about its responsibilities and how they are delivered. I really do not like somebody in an international body deciding what we do here, even though we have made application to that body. It is important that we keep, always, the responsibilities for the environment of this nation in Australian hands, in local hands, in state hands and in federal hands. I commend all of you speakers to the House and I look forward to the next speaker, if there is one.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (16:15):  by leave—I present the report of the Parliamentary Delegation to the 130th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Geneva, Switzerland; bilateral visit to the United Arab Emirates; and visit by the Deputy President of the Senate to Singapore from 9 to 23 March 2014, and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Ms MARINO:
  I am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation that participated in the 130th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Geneva, Switzerland from 16 to 20 March 2014 and the associated bilateral visit to the United Arab Emirates.


The delegation was led by the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Stephen Parry, who represented the President of the Senate at the IPU Assembly; Senator the Hon. Ursula Stephens; Senator Sue Boyce; Senator Lin Thorp; and me. As this report attests, this was a hardworking delegation, with all members playing an active role throughout the assembly. The delegation attended all formal meetings of the assembly and its governing council, and participated in meetings of the Asia Pacific and Twelve Plus geopolitical groups, the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians as well as attending panel discussions and field visits.


One of the key benefits of the assembly was the opportunity for delegates to participate in bilateral discussions with delegations from other parliaments. By assembling representatives from such a large number and diverse range of parliaments in one place, the IPU offers a unique opportunity for delegations and individual parliamentarians to meet to discuss issues of mutual interest, to develop an understanding of different parliamentary models and to strengthen parliament-to-parliament relationships. The Australian delegation capitalised on this opportunity to hold discussions with members of delegations from Bahrain, Bangladesh, Canada, Ethiopia, Great Britain, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Thailand, and Tonga. The Australian delegation found these discussions extremely valuable.


The Australian and New Zealand delegations facilitated a meeting of Pacific Island parliaments during the assembly. Since the 122nd IPU Assembly in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 2010, the Australian and New Zealand delegations have sought to facilitate a meeting of delegations from the Pacific to discuss issues of mutual interest, including key items on the assembly agenda, and build on capacity-building activities undertaken through regional parliamentary forums. This latest meeting agreed that there is significant value in organising a meeting of Pacific Island parliaments immediately prior to the commencement of each IPU Assembly.


I would like to congratulate the executive committee of the IPU and the IPU secretariat for their effective organisation of the 130th assembly. This assembly provided an effective forum for parliamentarians to engage and increase their understanding of a range of issues of global interest and concern.


The Australian delegation recognises efforts undertaken over the course of recent assemblies to improve the effectiveness of the assembly's committees. I note recent changes to the rules of the assembly's four standing committees that seek to increase the level of debate and encourage the bureau of each committee to play a more active role in planning and guiding committee work. The delegation notes that there is still some scope for improvement in the implementation of these changes. I look forward to contributing to this process of improvement through my position on the bureau of the Second Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade.


The delegation's visit to the UAE immediately before the IPU Assembly underscored the significance of Australia's relationship with the UAE and the Gulf region. Australia's longstanding commitment to the region and its contribution to international campaigns against terrorism and countering piracy, and its involvement in the United Nations' operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan is widely recognised and respected. 


The delegation was grateful for the opportunity to visit the headquarters of Joint Task Force 633 at Al Minhad Air Base, where it received a comprehensive briefing from Major General Craig Orme AM, CSC and senior officers of the Joint Task Force. What in impressive group they are! The delegation was particularly pleased to visit the memorial to Corporal Cameron Baird VC MG, in whose memory the Australian compound at Al Minhad Air Base is named, and pay its respects to the 40 Australian soldiers killed in active service in Afghanistan.


The delegation also noted the strong and multifaceted bilateral and parliamentary relationships between Australia and the UAE. The expansion of air links between the two countries has provided much needed impetus, and there are positive signs for further strengthening of trade, business and investment links. The delegation commends Australia's representatives in Austrade and the Australian Embassy on the key role they continue to play in supporting Australian businesses seeking to expand their operations into the region.


On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank all the individuals who contributed to making this a successful delegation. I would like to acknowledge the support and time devoted to the delegation's visits by Australia's missions in Abu Dhabi and Geneva. Particular thanks are due to Ambassador Pablo Kang and Deputy Head of Mission Kim Debenham for the time they devoted to the delegation's visit to the UAE; and to Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations and to the Conference on Disarmament, Peter Woolcott; Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organisation, Hamish McCormick; and First Secretary Jeffie Kaine for the advice and practical assistance they provided to the delegation throughout the 130th IPU Assembly.


I would like to extend the delegation's thanks to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and to staff of the Parliamentary Library for providing very comprehensive and timely briefing materials prior to the delegation's departure. Thanks are also due to Mr Andres Lomp, Mr Geoff Barnett and other members of the International Community Relations Office for the high standard of support provided to the delegation—something we certainly do not take for granted.


Finally, I thank my fellow delegates for their thoughtful participation in the delegation's meetings and their commitment to our program of work. I also want to thank the officials who accompanied us: Ms Talitha Try from the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives; Mr Brien Hallett, from the Department of the Senate; and Jeanette Radcliffe, the delegation's secretary from the Department of the Senate. This was her final delegation in her role as secretary and Jeanette provided us all with outstanding service. Her knowledge and experience was extraordinary and of great value to this parliament and the members of the delegation. I commend the report to the House.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:24):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Today I bring forward a package of four bills to support the implementation of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act).


The PGPA Act will replace, from 1 July 2014, the existing model for Commonwealth financial management established through the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act). The PGPA Act will become the primary resource and governance legislation for Commonwealth entities and companies.


The PGPA Act marks an important evolution in public sector management, in the same way that the introduction of the FMA Act and the CAC Act did, more than 15 years ago.


The PGPA Act was passed in the last days of the last Parliament. While the government, then the opposition, supported the aims of the reform process enshrined in the PGPA Act, we understandably had concerns about how its underlying principles would work in practice.


The government continues to support the aims of the PGPA Act and places great importance on ensuring it is properly implemented.


The PGPA Act consolidates under one law the governance, performance and accountability framework for the Commonwealth and relevant entities. Detailed arrangements on how these principles will be applied are to be set out in the PGPA rule.


The package of bills I am introducing today involves:


the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014 (the PGPA C&T bill); and


three bills to modify the application of the annual Appropriation Acts for 2014-15 (once passed by the parliament) and for the two previous financial years.


The PGPA C&T bill would, if enacted, amend more than 250 acts across the Commonwealth to support the implementation of the PGPA Act and its related rules and instruments.


As you can see from the sheer size of the legislative package the effect of these amendments goes across all of government and is essential to effective implementation of a new resource and governance framework.


The legislation affects every portfolio, covering amendments ranging from the Auditor-General Act to the Water Act and many in between.


The legislation covers the details of when certain provisions of the PGPA Act start and when certain provisions of the FMA and CAC Acts cease operating.


It is extensive and wide-ranging in its coverage and ensures that legislation currently based on the working of the FMA and CAC Acts can work under the PGPA arrangements.


This includes clarifying where Commonwealth entities should operate in a consistent fashion and where, as a result of decisions by parliament, an entity has particular obligations that depart from the standard approach—as in the case of the parliamentary departments or the Reserve Bank or the Research and Development Corporations.


The bill would also amend the Public Service Act 1999 to address a recent recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (the JCPAA).


In considering the development of draft rules under the PGPA Act, the JCPAA recommended that the Department of Finance and the Australian Public Service Commission work collaboratively to develop amendments to the PGPA Act and the Public Service Act to reduce potential confusion regarding the duties for public officials and the Australian Public Service (APS) Code Of Conduct for APS employees. This is being achieved through making amendments to the code of conduct to align the wording of the code with the general duties of officials in the PGPA Act.


To ensure continuing alignment with the Public Service Act, the bill also proposes making amendments to the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 and its code of conduct similar to those proposed for the PS Act.


I wish to thank the Speaker and the Senate President for their prompt consideration of—and support for—these proposed changes.


The amendments to these two acts will complement amendments to the duties of officials under sections 25 to 29 of the PGPA Act that were moved on the floor of this House on 4 June 2014 to amend the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment Bill 2014, and would ensure an improved alignment of the duties of officials under the PGPA Act with the corresponding duties under the PS Act and the Parliamentary Service Act.


The other three bills in this package modify the application of the annual appropriation acts for 2014-15 (once passed by the parliament) and for the two previous financial years. These bills are designed to change the terminology in existing appropriations acts from the current financial legislation to the equivalent PGPA Act terminology.


Separate bills are needed, rather than just making the amendments through the PGPA C&T Bill, as an appropriation act can only be amended by a subsequent appropriation bill. 


These bills are split to cover appropriation acts across the three years dealing with:


the ordinary annual services of government contained in Appropriation Acts (No. 1), (No. 3) and (No. 5), 


other amounts included in Appropriation Acts (No. 2), (No. 4) and (No. 6); and 


the parliamentary departments.


They confirm the continuing ability of entities to access the appropriations approved by the parliament.


The package of bills I am introducing today would, if enacted:


update references in Commonwealth legislation from the FMA Act and CAC Act to the new financial framework, 


simplify enabling legislation where provisions of the PGPA Act cover an issue previously dealt with in enabling legislation, and 


provide a more streamlined approach to resource management and governance matters across government.


These bills arise from the development of the detail needed for the implementation of the PGPA Act. 


While the changes are technical in nature they provide greater certainty in relation to the operation of the act as well as supporting the design of more operationally effective supporting rules.


The bills, if enacted, will support the PGPA Act and simplify the regulatory requirements and contribute to long-term efficiencies, in terms of achieving improved governance, transparency and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth entities (including both non-corporate Commonwealth entities and corporate Commonwealth entities) within the Australian government.


They are part of a broader public management reform agenda which is intended to support the government’s deregulation agenda and the active management of risk in delivering services to the Australian community. 


Officials who are better able to engage with risk are less likely to develop regulatory frameworks which are unnecessarily prescriptive and out of step with commercial practice. 


These bills represent, accordingly, another crucial step to help ensure the smooth transition to a more effective financial framework for the Commonwealth.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (21:11):  These bills introduce a range of 2014 budget measures in the Social Services portfolio. Under these budget welfare reforms, the government will continue to provide assistance for families, seniors, people with disability, carers and those most in need. Importantly, we are targeting assistance towards supporting the most vulnerable Australians while encouraging those who are able to work or study to do so. Our welfare system must be fair, but it also must be sustainable. The budget measures introduced by these bills will help make our welfare system strong for the future. I commend the bills to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Pursuant to the resolution agreed to earlier, I will now put the question on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No.1) Bill 2014 and the related bill. The question is that these bills be now read a second time.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,"<title>Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014, Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014</title>",BILLS,15,1
"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (21:23):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this part of the debate, given that I was next on the list to speak before the government gagged those on this side of the House from contributing on this bill. I have a question for the government in this part of the debate. We have heard a lot of talk about the supposed welfare crisis that is the justification for this bill and an unsustainable welfare system in Australia. We have heard the talk about ending the age of entitlement. My question for those opposite is: where is this crisis?


We can see clearly, when you consider the entire OECD, that Australia spends less on welfare as a proportion of GDP than any other country except Iceland. That is less even than the notoriously parsimonious United States. In fact, we could spend up to $60 billion more on our welfare system and still not meet the US spend as a proportion of GDP. When welfare expenditure in Australia accounted for just 8.6 per cent of GDP in 2013, significantly less than the OECD average of 13 per cent, those on the side of the House ask: where is the welfare crisis?


The Melbourne Institute recently released a report demonstrating that reliance on welfare amongst Australians has been decreasing over the last decade and that the percentage of people of working age receiving a welfare payment each week declined from 23 per cent in 2001 to 18 per cent in 2011. Further, it demonstrated that the number of households that are almost entirely dependent on welfare payments has decreased by almost 30 per cent since 2001. Again I ask: where is the welfare crisis?


These figures deal with the total quantum of welfare. But, if we look at where welfare payments go in Australia, we see a healthy, effective and targeted welfare system in this country. To quote from my good friend Matthew Cowgill at the Australian Council of Trade Unions, ABS figures from 2009-10 show that the poorest 20 per cent of Australian households received an average of $323 a week in cash benefits while the richest received just $22 per week—a ratio of $14.7 to a poor household for every dollar that goes to the richest. 


Peter Whitford from the Australian National University has shown that a far larger proportion of our cash benefits go to the poorest households than in any other advanced economy. Not only do rich Australians receive a tiny share of welfare spending but their share is smaller than it used to be in the 1980s and early 1990s. The idea that Australia is a land of rampant middle- and upper-class welfare is a myth. 


The next question I have those opposite is: how are the vulnerable in our society supposed to survive if they are unable to find a job in the cruel world created by this bill? The learn or earn policy detailed in this bill is, perhaps, one of the cruellest cuts outlined by the Abbott government in the budget. It is no secret that youth unemployment in segments of Australia is reaching a crisis point. Figures released by the Brotherhood of St Laurence earlier this year indicate that around Australia around 12.4 four per cent of our young people are unable to find work—a figure that is rising. In Melbourne's west, in my electorate, the figure is even higher—13.6 per cent of young people in Melbourne's west are not able to find employment to support themselves. These youth need all the help they can get to get back into the workforce. They should not be punished for not finding jobs that simply do not exist. The changes in Newstart and Youth Allowance in the bills under consideration will do this. If after six months of income support a young person has not yet found a job they will be required to take part in the Work for the Dole scheme. If after this period of time they are still unable to find work, they will lose all welfare payments for a further period of six months. That is six months without any form of income support at all. It is not so much ripping a hole in the social safety net as throwing it away altogether. 


I further ask the minister: is it not true that they know what the impacts of these cruel budget cuts will be on people in electorates like my own? The fact that the budget includes money to cover the, quote, 'additional emergency services' required due to this learn-or-earn budget is a dead giveaway. The government is allocating additional money in the budget for the poverty that they are, in fact, creating. It would be funny if it was not so horrific for thousands of young Australians in Australia. There will be thousands of people affected by these cruel changes. The Department of Social Services admitted that they were expecting 500,000 new claims for emergency assistance as a result of these measures—half a million Australians abandoned by the Abbott government all for the sake of an extreme, factless ideological attack on Australia's effective and efficient welfare system. These are measures that will fall hard upon unemployed youth in our country. 


The next question I have for those opposite is: how can they look Australian families in the eye after going to last election promising to ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian families and then, after the federal budget,  ripping $7.5 billion from family payments? These bills contain freezes on the rates and thresholds of family tax benefits A and B. They also include a freeze on the low-income area for tax benefit A. According to the Department of Social Services, this will see more 370,000 Australian families around $750 a year worse off. So I ask those opposite, who promised to ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, how they look Australian parents in the eye.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (21:28):  The bills that we are considering in detail today have been the cause of incredible fear in my community in Hotham, and it is with an incredibly heavy heart that I rise to speak against these bills that will really, sadly, see the worst fears of those people in my community realised. If there is one question I have for the minister today it is: how could you do this to people who trusted you so much during the election? 


These bills let Australians know how cruel this government is. For those of us who are looking this evening for a silver lining, if there is one out there it is that it exposes the values that sit in the hearts of the decision makers that we sit opposite. What I am coming to realise after a few months in this parliament is that the Australia that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister for Social Services live in is a very different Australia to that which I see my neighbours living in around East Bentleigh, right in the heart of Hotham. 


The Australia that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister live in is a place where poor people go to the doctor too frequently just because they do not have anything better to do. It is where unemployed young people are getting plenty of great job offers but are just too fussy to accept any of them. It is a nation where $800 that many pensioners used to pay their electricity bills is seen as a cash splash. It is a nation where young Australians are simply not paying enough for their university education.


But this is not the Australia that I live in, and I do not believe that these values reflect the values of the Australian people. I believe that as a country we rise together. As our economy grows we should all benefit from it, and that sits at the heart of the welfare system that we have.


There are so many truly devastating changes in the bills that are before us today that I do not have time to talk about all of them. But there are three big areas that I want to touch on, which will particularly affect the people that I represent in Hotham. The first is the change to pensions. I looked, for a while, in the Real Solutions document before I came to the chamber this afternoon, desperately looking for the sentence which talked about the changes that would be made to seniors' supplements and the changes that would be made to pensions. But, alas, all that I found was empty rhetoric about how concerned this coalition was about the living costs of seniors.


The Prime Minister misled and betrayed millions of Australians who rely on government for part or all of their incomes: 2.3 million people are already trying to make ends meet on the age pension. I want to remind the House that when Labor was in government we legislated for the biggest increase to pensions in 100 years, and tonight that increase is being lost. 


I want to talk a little about changes to family tax benefits A and B, which will affect many families in my seat of Hotham. I was contacted, quite soon after the budget, by a mother in my electorate—Stephanie. She was recently widowed and is trying to raise two daughters by herself on a part-time public service income. She is a very smart, very motivated woman, and she is trying to plan for her daughters' futures. She contacted me because she genuinely could not understand what the government was trying to do to her family with the changes to the family tax benefits and what this would mean for her and for her girls. 


As a result of the budget, including the measures in the bills that are before us, a single-income couple on $65,000 with two school-aged children will be about $6,000 worse off, every year, by 2016. So I ask the minister, in this consideration in detail: how could you do this to families who trusted you during the election? How could you possibly justify these changes?


It is difficult, amongst a bevvy of absolute nasties in these bills, to single out the cruellest measure but I believe that it is the change that is being made to New Start. What Australia are these people living in that would made them think that they can take unemployment benefits from young people for six months? I do not understand what the plan is here. What do they want these young people to do? Perhaps in the world of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister young people who are in these positions live in family homes with families that can support them, but in my electorate and in many parts of the country that is simply not the case. We are facing crises of youth unemployment around the country. At the same time the government has cut training and apprenticeships it tells young people to earn or learn. I just cannot believe the gall.


The context for this has been fabricated from the very beginning. I do not have time to go into it. We are not in a budget emergency. The Australian budget is in ship shape. Labor took us through a financial crisis and left our economy in great condition. These bills are totally unjustified.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (21:33):  It is a pleasure, in this debate, to follow the contributions of the member for Jagajaga, the member for Gellibrand and the member for Hotham—three Labor members whose careers in politics have been founded on the notion that we must work for those more vulnerable than ourselves.


It is a pleasure for me to follow them because the legislation we are debating tonight goes to the heart of the Australian social contract—a social contract that says that an egalitarian tradition is something that Australians hold dear. Australians believe in a fair go. You can see that if you go to any institution in the land. The AFL, for example, manages to be a highly interesting sporting code, where teams go from rags to riches to rags, from the bottom to the top and back to the bottom of the table. Take the military as an example. Its great success has been in its egalitarian engagement. In places like Somalia, it is our military that gets out and talks with common folks rather than standing back and just listening to tribal leaders. 


That egalitarian Australia is under threat due to a rise in inequality over the last generation so that inequality is now the highest it has been in three-quarters of a century. We have seen earnings for the top 10 per cent go up three times faster than earnings for the bottom 10 per cent. The income share of the top one per cent has doubled. The top 0.1 per cent income share has tripled. The wealthiest three Australians, who can, together, sit in the back seat of a limousine, have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians—the population of Adelaide.


In that environment you would think that a government should be working to look after the most vulnerable, yet we have a Treasurer who believes that half of all Australians are leaners. I challenge the Treasurer to identify those leaners. Are those leaners aged pensioners like the aged pensioner who contacted me and told me about her life of contribution to the nation, her four working children and her six grandchildren? She said to me, 'I am one of those pensioners whose sole income is the pension. I have no superannuation payments; nothing. I feel sad, depressed and scared for my ability to pay my way when all the cuts start.' Is she a leaner? I would like the Treasurer to tell me. 


Is a leaner someone like the single parent who contacted me, who has worked hard to support herself and her two boys and is to be made redundant this year? She is one of 16,500 public servants who are facing redundancy as a result of this government's broken promise on public service job cuts. Is that sole parent raising two kids a leaner? I would like to hear the Treasurer say so to her face.


When the Treasurer talks about leaners is he speaking about carers who are up three, four or five times in the night because the person for whom they care is calling out and they need to be by their side? Is that the kind of person the Treasurer thinks of as a leaner? The fundamental problem with this government is that the members leading the government are unable to put themselves in the shoes of the most vulnerable. They cannot put themselves in the shoes of someone who lacks financial literacy—a low-income earner like those who invested their life savings in Storm Financial, Trio Capital or Timbercorp and lost them as a result of inadequate financial protections. They cannot put themselves in the shoes of an age pensioner who is expecting the pension on which they depend to go up with wages, and who hears the Prime Minister's mealy-mouthed words in question time: 'Pensions will continue to increase.' Well, Prime Minister, they are not increasing at the rate these pensioners expect them to, due to your broken promise.



This is a budget which breaks promises like so much kindling. It is not just a budget which increases the deficit. Let us not worry about comparisons with the Treasurer's budget update last year; let us make the comparison with the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook. Compared to that, it is a budget that increases the deficit. The great flaw in this budget is that it breaches the fair go test, and that is why this government wants to talk about anything other than the budget. That is why members and backbenchers want to go out and speak to their constituents about anything other than the broken promises and the breach of the social contract. It is a social contract Australians have held dear and which, as previous members have so articulately highlighted, has been buttressed by a means tested social security net. (Time expired)

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-06-24,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (21:38):  I wish to ask the minister a question at the end of this because, with my experience of the Minister for Social Services, I realise he is a man of great empathy and compassion. Why do I say that? Because I know the Minister for Social Services does not see victims in our society and our community, as members on the other side would lead us to believe; he sees that every person in our community has potential and he wants every person in our community to have a great chance of having the best life they can. He does not want them to believe they are a victim and that they need saving. He wants them to see themselves as people with unlimited potential, and that is what so many of the elements of this bill are about.


I would like to share with you and the chamber a story that just happened to me in the last few months. I had a group of people come to me in February and March, asking me to be the ambassador for a program which was going to find 75 jobs in a month. We were going to find 75 jobs in 30 days for people with a disability. We sat down and talked with some of the key stakeholders in my community, and we said: 'We do not want it to be a failure. If we get 10 people with a disability a job in the month of March that would be a success, so why don't we say the aim of the program is to get 50 jobs?'


Do know how many jobs we found in the month of March? It was not 50—it was not what we put the figure at. It was not 75, which was the initial target we thought we would set. It was 115. It was 115 because, again, we did not see anybody as a victim. We did not see the shortcomings in anyone. We saw everyone with the potential to have a job and a lifestyle that was going to be more suitable to their enjoyment. 


The changes that come into effect for the disability support pension on 1 July will help support young people with a disability to enter the workforce if they are able to do so. One of the people I came into contact with while I was ambassador for this program was two-time Paralympics gold medallist Tracy Barell, who launched what we called the Page disability jobs search. Tracy was born without legs and with only one arm. She is independent; she gets around on a skateboard. She has two children and has won two gold medals but she told the jobs drive launch the hardest thing she has ever had to do was get a job. She said:


People sometimes talk to me like I'm deaf. I say, ""I'm missing my legs, not my ears.""


She went on to say:


We've got dreams and hopes and aspirations that we want to have our own homes and holidays and be able to buy cars. And we want to be able to work to achieve this.


Like Tracy, this bill recognises that people with a disability who are able to participant in the workforce will have better long-term outcomes if they can engage in the workforce. Tracy is confident, but many people on the disability support pension are not, because we have told them in the past they do not have the ability to work—that they have nothing to contribute to society.


That is plain wrong. Instead of rejecting the many skills and abilities people with a disability have, we should embrace and encourage them. Whether it is compulsory work focused activities such as work experience, education or training, the social, economic and health benefits of active participation for disability support pension recipients under 35 years cannot be overstated. So my question to the minister is: what measures are contained in this bill that will encourage greater workforce participation among people living with a disability?

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (21:43):  These bills, collectively, really expose the cruelty this government is subjecting the Australian people to tonight. These bills put on full display a long list of broken promises that were pitched at the Australian people before the election. This is not the budget the Australian people were expecting and it is certainly not the budget the people of Newcastle were expecting to see.


I really want to spend this very limited time for debate highlighting the impacts, for young people in particular, of these measures that are before us. These measures are cutting young job seekers off from Newstart for a period of six months. It is an incredible attack on a generation of young people who are looking for work and who are being pushed into hardship and, indeed, poverty.


These measures are amongst the harshest that are contained within these bills. They will see young people left without income support for a period of six months, possibly longer, at a time when they are incredibly vulnerable and in fact need assistance in order to be actively job seeking. What this government is effectively saying is, 'When you have found yourself unemployed we are cutting you off for six months and you are out there on your own.' I would like to share with the House some lived reality for a constituent of mine, Julie, who contacted me on this very issue. She wrote:


Hi Sharon 


I am a 20-year-old who is currently completing a certificate III in cultural and information services at Hunter TAFE. My course finishes late next month and instead of being excited about the future I am utterly terrified thanks to the Abbott government's budget, and for the first time it has made me question if I have a future in Australia. 


The Treasurer keeps going on about the best kind of welfare being a job for an unemployed person on Newstart. He would be right if there were actually any jobs being created, and I was not hearing 'We aren't employing anyone at the moment' ringing in my ears every time I go to hand a business my resume, or being told that I do not have enough experience to do the job despite all the work I have put in to ensure that I have the skills they are asking for even when I got to the interview stage. 


Please inform Mr Hockey I do not use my Newstart allowance the cigarettes and alcohol, I use it to get myself to job interviews, to help my retired dad to keep a roof over my head, buying interview clothes in the hope that I might actually get an interview and paying for internet access so I can search for jobs online so I can be rejected on the web and have whatever confidence I have left crushed, not just when I meet an employer face-to-face. 


Maybe Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey should spend a week actually trying to live on Newstart allowance and looking for work in the current climate because they have no idea what it is like and at the moment I have no belief that I have a bright future ahead of me despite all the courses I have done. Their budget is cruel, inhumane, heartbreaking and scary. Thanks for reading this.


That is the lived reality of one job seeker in Newcastle. The notion that this government provides no hope for a younger generation of Australians is truly horrifying. These young men and women feel that they have been left abandoned. They have seen cuts into the education system, they are seeing attacks on their employment prospects and now they are seeing that this is a government that has no capacity to lend them the support and assistance they are going to require in order to be active participants and productive members of society, helping them when they need some support to go job seeking. 


Those attacks on young people at this time when people feel their jobs are insecure and they are finding it especially difficult to find work is perhaps amongst the most vicious aspects of these particular bills before us. It is estimated that there will be some 500,000 new claims for emergency assistance as a result of this particular measure. My question to the minister is how does he intend to provide for those half a million— (Time expired)

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (21:48):  I indicated at the outset of my remarks that the government will oppose the amendments which have been moved by the Labor Party. It is almost as if the Labor Party live in a parallel universe. In fact, they do. The member for Hotham talked about the big increases under Labor. She did not mention the biggest deficits and the biggest debts that any government had left a successive government in Australia. She said that the budget was left in shipshape. If this was a budget left in shipshape, I would hate to see one that was sinking—$123 billion of accumulated deficits and a $667 billion trajectory of Commonwealth debt is hardly shipshape. If the budget was shipshape then we would not be in this regrettable situation that we are at the present time. 


The member for Hotham also talked about youth homelessness. Which was the government that did not continue the funding for youth homelessness and homelessness programs except for another 12 months? It was the Labor Party when they were in government. So the contributions from the Labor Party in relation to these matters are totally delusional. The Labor Party managed the trifecta. I know the Leader of the Opposition likes a punt now and again, but what was the Labor Party's trifecta? First it was deception in terms of saying year after year that they were going to deliver a surplus and never did. The second leg of the trifecta was debt, $667 billion the trajectory for the Commonwealth debt.



Mr Snowdon interjecting—




Mr Hutchinson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that the member for Lingiari is not in his seat and he is interjecting.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lingiari is out of order. The minister has the call.




Mr ANDREWS:
  The final leg of the trifecta is the one we have seen played out in this place day after day. After deception and debt we have now got denial from the Labor Party—denial that anything was ever wrong, denial that we have got these huge deficits, denial that we have got the largest Commonwealth debt ever in the history of this country. So we have got deception, debt and denial as the trifecta of the Labor Party. 


Can I say briefly in the last few seconds available to me to the member for Page that I want to congratulate him and commend him on that initiative of getting disabled people into employment in his electorate. Disabled people in my experience actually want to be in the workforce. Disabled people want to contribute to the country. That program that the member for Page has put in place is highly commendable. It is why we are doing things like ensuring that the budget is sustainable, so that we can afford things like the NDIS in the future. I commend these measures to the House. (Time expired)

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (21:11):  These bills introduce a range of 2014 budget measures in the Social Services portfolio. Under these budget welfare reforms, the government will continue to provide assistance for families, seniors, people with disability, carers and those most in need. Importantly, we are targeting assistance towards supporting the most vulnerable Australians while encouraging those who are able to work or study to do so. Our welfare system must be fair, but it also must be sustainable. The budget measures introduced by these bills will help make our welfare system strong for the future. I commend the bills to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Pursuant to the resolution agreed to earlier, I will now put the question on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No.1) Bill 2014 and the related bill. The question is that these bills be now read a second time.
