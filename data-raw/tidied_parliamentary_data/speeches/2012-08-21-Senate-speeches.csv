Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:31):  Last night I put on notice by way of questions to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and/or the department a fairly large amount of material. I am wondering, at the outset, whether the minister can provide us with any answers that might have been submitted overnight or this morning.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:32):  The answer is no—we do not yet have it.




Senator Ludlam:
  Nothing?




Senator FEENEY:
  I think no is the easiest answer. There is some publicly available material that I have looked at but, in terms of a formal response to questions on notice, we do not have an answer for you this morning.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:33):  That makes it difficult to proceed. One of the things I was after—probably the most important—concerned the references I provided last night. I do not understand why this would not have been forthcoming during the morning, unless it was not given priority, but I sought the minister's advice on whether the government agrees with the statements made in three reference documents that I provided last night about the number of cluster weapons and submunitions that were fired into Iraq in 2003, and which Australian SAS, Regular Army and RAAF forces supported that action. Let us pick up those ones in particular. Has the minister been given the opportunity, or has anyone else bothered, to look at those documents and assess whether they are accurate or not?

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:34):  I have looked at advice given by the Congressional Research Service to the US Congress on 27 June 2012, and that may very well be a document Senator Ludlam is familiar with. In any event, it uses statistics that are the same as those he has cited. So I think for the purposes of this morning, subject to me getting formal advice from the department the only information I have before me is that the statistics Senator Ludlam is using are right. This document talks about 13,000 munitions by US and United Kingdom forces in the first three weeks of the conflict in 2003. For the purposes of today I am happy to take those statistics as agreed between us.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:35):  I thank the minister—he has left himself some wriggle room in case figures come back that are different. The other question of great consequence that I put to him last night was whether I am correct in assuming that the Royal Australian Air Force flew close support for the US units that were using those weapons on the way into Baghdad. I listed a number of cities and towns along the way. I believe that is of central importance in this debate. 


For senators who were not present and for those in the gallery who might be listening, this debate went quite late last night. If we asked 100 Australians randomly in the street whether we should support the Convention on Cluster Munitions, 100 people would come back and say of course we should. We heard unanimous support from government and coalition senators last night, saying it is timely that we sign onto this instrument.


Unless the minister can persuade me otherwise, I believe that under the convention as it is sought to be embedded in domestic law and as currently drafted Australian military units could directly support, for the sake of argument as it appears to have happened before, US military units firing cluster weapons into areas indiscriminately, leaving these things littering the landscape. It would not be prevented by the drafting of the bill before us. We had a lot of debate about this last night, and I sought to have some matters taken on notice to see if they could be clarified. 


The central fact of the matter is that there is nothing in the drafting of this bill that would prevent exactly that situation from occurring again—not in Iraq, obviously, but in any other battlefield that we find ourselves co-deployed with US military units. We could be directly planning and supporting missions in which cluster weapons are used, which would violate not just the spirit but also the letter of the convention. If it turns out I am wrong, I will sit down and we can close out this debate and get on with it—but the drafting of the bill as it is presently formulated would allow precisely those things to occur.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:37):  I do not really have much to add to where we got to in the debate last night, Senator Ludlam. I will repeat the position we reached. The events in 2003 occurred well before the convention, so obviously Australia, at that time, did not have any obligations under the convention. We have not made any assessment about how current convention obligations might have affected military operations in 2003. 


I repeat the point I made at the conclusion of last night—that in the view of the government this convention, and our support for it, is an important step forward. We believe the interoperability provisions found in this legislation are critically important both to the workings of the treaty itself and to Australia's alliance relationship with the United States. As I also said last night, if interoperability provisions like this were not found in the bill and were not countenanced by the convention, that would, in our judgement, greatly weaken the convention and support for it. You would be creating a situation in which any nation which had an alliance relationship with any one of the United States, Russia, China, Iran, India, Pakistan, Brazil or a plethora of other nations might feel unable to support the convention. We think that would reduce the value of the convention—we would be dealing with a convention with far fewer signatories and which therefore exerted far less influence towards the creation of an international norm where these weapons are not used. There is nothing new in all that, Senator Ludlam—I am simply repeating the case I put to you last night.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:39):  I indicate to senators that we are still asking general questions about the bill, as was Senator Xenophon last night. I want to move us through and get to our amendments. We will return to this issue briefly when I move the amendments which will fix this gap in the bill—a gap the parliamentary secretary did not quite concede exists but which I strongly contend does. 


I will to move on to the second of the three primary areas of concern I identified last night: the transiting and stockpiling of cluster weapons in Australia. We are not concerned about that being done by Australians—because, as we have established, Australia want nothing to do with these things, and that is a sound principle—but by an ally. This conversation is not academic, it is not abstract and it is not hypothetical. We have invited, we discovered last November, the United States Marine Corps to establish a presence in the north. I have also had it confirmed—I think, at the last estimates hearings—that the United States Air Force has been invited to establish a presence at Tindal. There are obviously ongoing discussions occurring which we are not party to—no-one in the Australian public is—concerning the US naval presence in Cockburn Sound in the south-west of WA and Queensland residents will also be aware that there are discussions occurring about US military presence at Australian facilities.


I do not want to get caught up in a debate about what is and what is not a base. It is quite clear that the US presence in Australia, as it is ramped up, will be flying under an Australian flag. That is something the Australian government has decided is important for the optics of the arrangements, I suspect. Nonetheless, the US military will be stationed here in various forms. They will be parking materiel and equipment here. So it is not good enough that the bill, as it is drafted, exempts the military personnel of states which are not party to the convention from its prohibitions while they are on Australian territory. 


We can go, if the parliamentary secretary chooses, to the operative part of the bill. It allows states which are not party to the convention, but which are engaged in military cooperation with the ADF, to stockpile cluster munitions in bases, aircraft and ships in Australia. Let us start there. Parliamentary Secretary, you can either treat Darwin as a case study or you can keep your answer in the abstract if you prefer, but I want to know how this bill is going to operate. Will it be unlawful for the US to stockpile cluster weapons in transit from place to place on Australian soil?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:42):  Firstly, I repeat that there are no US bases in Australia. There are joint facilities.




Senator Ludlam:
  I asked you not to do that.




Senator FEENEY:
  I am resisting the temptation to head down that road, too, Senator Ludlam. I also make clear that Australia has never had stockpiles of these weapons. I know you understand that, Senator Ludlam, but it is important to put it on the record. 


I repeat that the bill uses the language found in the convention. For our part, we say that the bill, in its intent and in its operation, effects everything the convention is intended to effect. The convention itself permits military cooperation and operations between states parties and countries not party to the convention. That is a point worth highlighting, I think. Such military cooperation or operations may entail the use by foreign countries of their own assets on Australian territory or the entry of foreign ships or aircraft into Australian territory. 


The defence which is found in proposed section 72.42 protects foreign military personnel of countries which are not party to the convention while such personnel are in Australia. This section obviously takes into account that Australia engages in military cooperation and operations with some countries which are not party to the convention—obviously the United States is one of those. But those kinds of military cooperation and joint operations are expressly permitted by article 21 of the convention. The defence in the bill recognises that foreign military personnel are not required to comply with an international legal obligation to which their own country has not consented. I think that is reasonably straightforward. It is essential that Australia be able to continue to cooperate with countries which have not signed the convention. 


The government has made clear that it has not and will not permit other countries to stockpile cluster munitions in Australia. I trust that is an important undertaking for you to have on the record, Senator Ludlam. 


There are currently no foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions in Australia and, as a matter of policy, the government confirmed on 23 November 2011 that it has not and will not authorise such stockpiling. The government will confirm this commitment in a public statement at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention and in Australia's annual statements under the convention.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:44):  I suspect this is slightly unorthodox, but as we have representatives of the coalition here this afternoon—you might want to seek some advice from your shadow spokesperson—I invite the coalition to establish what their policy is. The problem with not embedding this in law, which is the reason we turn up here, is that policy decisions can change. Policies can change according to political whim and they can change with a change of government. So I invite the coalition to put on the record whether it is their policy, should they win government, to also prohibit, not in law but in policy, the stockpiling of cluster weapons in the possession of other states.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  Thank you for that. Yes—who would want to miss it! How could you possibly not be watching! Minister, why has it been decided to embed this commitment as a policy undertaking rather than simply write it into the law, as many other state parties have done?

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:46):  Because the bill is designed to give effect to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and so the bill keeps faith with the convention. What we are now talking about is a question of policy that goes above and beyond the convention. The government obviously has a firm view, a view that should give you comfort, that I think is aligned with your own view, but that is a matter of policy. It is not something that is required or sought in the convention itself.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:46):  Minister Feeney, Austria has stated:


… foreign stockpiling of cluster munitions on the national territory of States Parties is prohibited by the Convention. … Should a State Party to the Convention allow a foreign state to stockpile cluster munitions on its territory, this action would be in violation with the provision entailed in Article 1 paragraph c that prohibits assistance …


Does the minister or his advisers agree with that view?

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:47):  Austria has taken that position. Obviously, it is utterly entitled to take that position. I can only repeat the Australian government's view, which is that we have introduced legislation into this parliament that keeps faith with the convention and the requirements of the convention, and we have not seen the need to go above and beyond the convention in that particular regard.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:47):  That is extremely concerning. Colombia noted:


The government 'absolutely rejects … any manner of …  storage of foreign cluster bombs in Colombian territory' …


Guatemala wrote that it considered:


… the stockpiling of cluster munitions of other countries in the territory of a State Party to the Convention, as well as the investment in its production is prohibited according to Article 1 of the Convention.


Slovenia stated:


'[In] our view the Convention … contains the prohibition of … stockpiling of cluster munitions by third countries on the territory of each State Party. Therefore, such activities are illegal and not allowed on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia.'


The Australian government have said: 'No, trust us. We won't let that happen, not on our watch.' We do not yet have a position from the coalition. But I take no comfort whatsoever from that. The Minister for Defence could stand up the day after tomorrow and say, 'We changed our minds,' and this legislature would be able to do nothing about it. Why has Australia taken a position that is so contrary to that of these other signatories? Why are we maintaining this wriggle room? I do not understand. I trust the minister when he tells me that that is not something the Australian government would do, but I do not understand why we are leaving this loophole wide open in the law. This is our opportunity to fix it.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:48):  It is not a loophole, Senator Ludlam. This is a piece of legislation that keeps faith with the convention and encompasses the interoperability provisions that we need as a matter of practical application to our alliance with the United States. And I do not accept that the government are out of step with other countries in the way you have asserted. Obviously, you have plucked out some examples, but there are of course many other examples we could talk about. We could talk about China, Russia and the Republic of Korea. We could talk about Israel. We could talk about Egypt, India and Pakistan. Clearly, this is a complicated question and there are different and complicated circumstances in different parts of the world. The government are ensuring that the convention is faithfully implemented by Australian law, and as a matter of policy we are telling you how we intend to realise that. Australia's interpretation of the convention is similar to that of other governments, including those of the United Kingdom, Canada and France, and each country implements its obligations in accordance with its domestic processes and requirements. I do not pretend to be an expert on how Guatemala or Austria makes its decisions and reaches its conclusions about this matter, but I can certainly talk about how Australia has done so. The government are very proud of the fact that we have supported this convention, brought legislation to this parliament that would give life to our support for ratifying the convention.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:50):  Minister, the operative part of the bill that I am referring to, section 72.42, states, as you are no doubt aware:


Section 72.38—


which is the fairly comprehensive list of things that are prohibited—


does not apply to the stockpiling, retention or transfer of a cluster munition that:


(a) is done by:


(i)  a member of the armed forces of a foreign country that is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions—


for example, the US would be caught by that—


or


(ii)  a person who is connected with such forces as described in subsection (2) and is neither an Australian citizen nor a resident of Australia …


So serving personnel with the US Marine Corps, for example, or their contractors, are explicitly allowed to stockpile these weapons in Australia under that section of the act. Why?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:51):  The government do not support deleting section 72.42. We say that the effect of deleting section 72.42 would be that visiting military personnel of countries who are not party to the convention would be prohibited from any conduct relating to cluster munitions while in Australia, and this would significantly limit Australia's ability to undertake military cooperation and operations with such countries, as permitted by the convention. The amendment you propose would also have the effect of requiring those personnel to comply with an international legal obligation to which their sending country has not consented. 


Proposed section 72.42 of the bill gives practical effect to the range of conduct permitted by article 21 of the convention. Deleting section 72.42 would limit Australia's ability to cooperate with countries not party to the convention, as permitted by article 21 of the convention. Australia engages in military cooperation and operations with countries not party to the convention, both overseas and in Australia, with the United States obviously being the outstanding example. Maintaining interoperability with the United States and other coalition forces is central to the protection of Australia's national security and international security.


 I cannot help but again assert the point that you are asking something of this Senate which is not asked of us by the convention itself and which would not apply elsewhere or in military alliance relationships, whether they be with China, Russia, Pakistan, India or whoever. There are currently no foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions in Australia and, as a matter of policy, we have confirmed that we will not authorise such stockpiling. We say that deleting section 72.42 would render the interoperability provision in the convention meaningless. That, of course, would have the effect of seriously damaging our alliance relationship with the United States. We have all talked about why that would be undesirable. So notwithstanding the defence found in proposed section 72.42, we say visiting forces would not be excused from prosecution if they use, develop, produce or acquire cluster munitions in Australia.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:53):  I am happy to cede the call to Senator Birmingham because I know he wanted to be here for the debate last night and I have put a question through your duty senator inquiring into coalition policy, which I know is a bit unorthodox, because the Australian government is refusing to enshrine a fairly important point into law. Parliamentary Secretary, what flexibility is created by giving us the policy undertaking that we have now, which you have indicated will go into writing when we formally ratify? What do we gain by doing that? What flexibility do we gain? What would be possible, given that undertaking in policy, that would not be possible if we simply removed these offending clauses? I do not understand how making a policy commitment to not stockpile these weapons here is any different from a strategic or operational point of view from enshrining it in law. If there is no difference, let us just put it into the bill.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:54):  This is not about flexibility; it is about this bill achieving its purpose, its intent—that is, supporting the convention and meeting the requirements of the convention. We think it is entirely appropriate and that, indeed, the most effective way to deal with matters outside that single purpose is to deal with them as matters of policy. While we might differ about the means, we do not differ about the ends. Our policy is clear and it will be repeated in the regular transparency requirements that the bill engenders. We say that the bill is meeting its core purpose—that is, to meet the requirements of the convention.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:55):  I had hoped to make a contribution on this bill during the second reading debate but unfortunately was unable to do so due to conflicting commitments. I do not propose to give a speech here on the second reading and abuse the committee process. I have not had a chance, unfortunately, to review all of last night's Hansard or Senator Ludlam's questions to necessarily pursue lines of questioning with the minister that would not potentially overlap what Senator Ludlam has done, but I do want to put a couple of things on the record. There is very strong interest across the chamber in ensuring that not just the detail of the Convention on Cluster Munitions but also the intent of the Convention on Cluster Munitions is adhered to by this and future governments.


This was an agreement negotiated by governments across party lines, a negotiation which commenced under the Howard government and was continued and ultimately finalised under the Rudd government. Australia's desire to be part of this follows in a very proud tradition, which I think we need to uphold in this country, of leading the world in looking at weapons that have particular negative humanitarian consequences from their use. An outstanding example is the leadership role Australia played historically in relation to the debate on the use of landmines. There are many parallels which can and should be drawn and I hope there will be further parallels in future to which we can look to see that Australia's success in leading the world, in condemning, reducing and eliminating wherever possible the use of landmines, is replicated by Australia ultimately leading the world in condemning, reducing and ultimately eliminating, hopefully, the use of cluster munitions.


This bill, as you can tell by its date, has been around for some time. It was introduced into the parliament back in 2010. That is evidence of the fact that there have been not just formal parliamentary inquiries around this legislation but concerns expressed across parties and from outside the parliament through different organisations as to whether this bill does entirely meet the detail of the treaty and the agreement on cluster munitions and, of course, the intent of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. 


I highlight just one of the submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry, held way back in January 2010, a submission from the Australian Red Cross. The Red Cross highlighted a number of concerns which have been the subject of at least some of questioning I managed to pick up on in the debate today and I am sure were subject to speeches and questioning last night, concerns about whether the bill in particular addresses issues of interoperability and stockpiling in a manner which puts appropriate boundaries around Australia's engagement.


The Red Cross submission says:


Paragraphs 3 & 4 of Article 21 outline the manner in which States Party may engage in military cooperation with States not Party to the Convention and paragraphs 1 & 2 of Article 21 impose positive obligations on States Party to amongst other things “make its best efforts to discourage States not party to this Convention from using cluster munitions.” It is important then to read the two parts of the Article together and ensure that the implementation of paragraphs 3 & 4 do not conflict with paragraphs 1 & 2.


The Red Cross argues that this bill does not achieve a balance in the application of the different paragraphs and articles of the convention. If the parliamentary secretary feels that he has anything to add on how the bill does in fact successfully balance or attempt to balance the two requirements in the convention to accept issues around cooperation while Australia makes its best efforts to discourage the use of cluster munitions, I would welcome any further assurances that he can provide. The Red Cross did recommend and urge that the relevant sections of the legislation, in particular section 72.41, be construed more narrowly and use words that are used elsewhere in the world. As the submission says, this could be done:


… for example by having it apply only to ""mere participation"" and acts that are unintended or inadvertent or that only have a remote or indirect relationship with the prohibited conduct.


The Red Cross also highlighted—and this has been addressed in the debate—some concerns around stockpiling, maintenance and transit of cluster munitions in Australian territory, and I note the assurances that the parliamentary secretary has given there. I had a chance to have a quick look at the parliamentary secretary's closing speech in the second reading debate, and I understand that Senator Ludlam was just questioning whether the government has committed as a matter of policy to not authorising and not allowing such stockpiling of cluster munitions. I understand also that the parliamentary secretary said that the government will confirm its commitment in a public statement both at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention and in Australia's annual transparency report under the convention.


I am not sure—and perhaps he can explain—how the public statement that the parliamentary secretary has committed to make at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention will differ from the statement he made in the second reading debate. Perhaps he can also explain why, if there is to be any difference, that statement is not being made now as part of this legislative process to provide the comfort which many seek that Australia upholds a strong position on not allowing stockpiling.


Senator Ludlam posed a question on that front to the opposition and, as he knows, it is not my role within the opposition to commit the opposition to such a policy. However, he can have this individual senator's assurance that I expect that the opposition would continue with such a clear policy if the government were to honour its word—and Senator Feeney's word—in this legislative process. I hope that, the government having at least set a standard at a minimum level with this legislation—which some will say is not adequate—and then having gone further in government policy as the parliamentary secretary is committing to do, a progression occurs and that there is never a backward step and that changes to policy only further strengthen Australia's commitment to the elimination of the use of cluster munitions.


I emphasise that, whilst I still have some concerns about whether the bill meets all of the assurances that the government gives, I think it is important that we recognise that Australia's involvement in the convention through this bill is a very significant step forward in eliminating cluster munitions from the world, and I hope that all senators who approach the matter with good intent ensure that in the years to come we hold the government of the day to account for ensuring that Australia's good intentions are reflected and honoured through our actions and not just our words. I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to any of the issues I have raised.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:04):  I take up the invitation, Senator Birmingham. I repeat that the government thanks the opposition for supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010. I guess that the opposition has reached the judgement, as have we, that this bill gets the balance right. Obviously both we and the opposition come to the table with the understanding that we want to keep faith with the convention and that this bill does represent a step forward but that we are at the same time practically minded in that we wish to make sure that the convention does not have the effect of severing our alliance arrangements with the United States.


I repeat that we will be making a statement on cluster munitions, which you, Senator Birmingham, have talked about. The detail in the statement will be absolutely aligned with the undertakings I have given, and government policy will be expressed in the terms I have put them in this debate. I think that a lot of the detail that your question asked for I dealt with last night, and I commend the transcript to you for some of the detail about the balance in proposed sections 72.41 and 72.38 in particular.


I think that we have got the balance right and have said very plainly that this bill realises the convention, that matters above and beyond will be dealt with as a question of policy and that our policy is clear and well understood.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:07):  When this instrument has been ratified and lodged, the Australian government will make a public statement and that public statement will be in line with the undertakings I have given this chamber. Thereafter the bill itself requires that there be an annual transparency report, and that annual transparency report would repeat the undertakings given in the public statement at the time of ratification.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:08):  The minister has used the term 'authorisation' of weapons being stockpiled or transited through Australia. I also thank Senator Birmingham; I guess we can only hope that in the unlikely event that there is a change of government next year he ends up as the defence minister and then we can hold him to his word—which I absolutely believe; I know he cares a great deal about these issues. However, we have even less from the coalition than we have from the government. From the government we have a hypothetical policy statement that may be announced at some future stage down the track; from the coalition we have Senator Birmingham assuring us that he loathes these weapons as much as anybody else and would not want to see them stored here. 


I am interested to know how we would actually prevent it. How is this going to work in practice? When US warships that may or may not be nuclear armed transit through Australian ports, the US Navy has a policy of neither confirming nor denying that the ships are carrying nuclear weapons. To what degree would we even know about the weapons on these vessels or aircraft moving through Australian waters or airspace, stabled temporarily at Tindal air base or wherever else, in order to issue an authorisation in the first place?

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:09):  Firstly, there is nothing hypothetical about our policy. Our policy is our policy and it is plain. The government strictly monitors the presence of cluster munitions and other explosives on Australian territory. Ships and aircraft owned by foreign armed forces that transit through Australian territory are required to advise the quantity of explosives that they have on board to enable appropriate explosives safety requirements to be met—that is, to ensure that the ship or aircraft is berthed or parked in an appropriate location—and it is standard practice to require such vessels to advise of the total net explosives quantity of munitions that they have on-board rather than the actual type and quantity of specific munitions. 


All munitions owned by foreign armed forces that are stored on Australian soil are required to be managed as Commonwealth explosives, in accordance with the Explosives Act 1961 and its subordinate regulations and codes. This requires specific approval for the storage and transportation of these munitions and their inclusion in Defence information holdings. Additionally, munitions are stored in Defence facilities licensed to store explosive ordnance and are managed on the computer system for armaments. As a consequence of that Defence both approves and has full visibility of all foreign armed forces munitions that are stored on Australian soil.

There is a relevant treaty—the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty—and that bears on the issue of nuclear weapons as well.

Maybe I misunderstood your comment: do we actually know, broken out by weapon type, what is stored on Australian soil? Let us start with that before we deal with naval or air assets.

The convention does not contradict that approach—it does not go to transiting vessels or planes. As I have described, that is consistent with the convention.

Chair, I think it might assist the chamber if I formally move the first amendment and we actually start moving through these.




The ACTING TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  We are in your hands, Senator Ludlam, as to how we handle the amendments. The only thing is that the last of your amendments, No. 6,needs to be moved separately.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:15):  I will speak to each of them in turn. I now move amendment (1) on sheet 7084, which relates to intention:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 28), omit paragraph 72.38(2)(c), substitute:


(c)   the first person knew or should have known that the act would be done.


It is not a matter that I have discussed at length so I will briefly describe for the benefit of senators why I am doing this. This amendment is to the section of the bill that relates to promoting acts with cluster munitions, so it goes to our positive obligations under the terms of the convention. A person commits an offence if a person knew or should have known that the act would be done. That is common language for recklessness. This bill sets a very high threshold for liability requiring that a person intended that an act be done in order to be liable for one of the offences. This refers specifically to proposed section 72.38. Under this standard, individuals would not be liable for conduct if, for example, they were aware that their conduct would result in cluster munitions use—so there is knowledge—or in a substantial unjustifiable risk of use, so recklessness. Using an intention standard in 72.38, this makes it very difficult to hold individuals liable for use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions or assistance with these prohibited acts. This is even if they knew or should have known that their conduct could lead to one of these activities. This result is in direct opposition to JSCOT's recommendation to prevent inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions by Australia. So I hope the minister can see the distinction that I am drawing here even though it may seem to be a fine one. It is between inadvertent participation and reckless participation. I will remind the chamber, because I am still open to referring this bill back to JSCOT as we discussed last night, that JSCOT, in its report No. 103 of 2009, said: 


… The Committee also acknowledges concerns regarding the potential for Australia to inadvertently participate in the use or assist in the use of cluster munitions, despite the provisions of the Convention. The Committee is concerned that some of the terms contained in the Convention are not clearly defined and may provide an avenue by which Australia could participate in actions which may contravene the humanitarian aims of the Convention. The Committee therefore considers that the Australian Government and the ADF should address these issues when drafting the domestic legislation required to implement the Convention, and when developing policies by which the personnel of the Australian Defence Force operate …


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have regard to the following issues when drafting the legislation required to implement the Convention … , and when developing policies under which the personnel of the ADF operate:


 the definition of the terms 'use', 'retain', 'assist', 'encourage' and 'induce' as they apply in Articles 1, 2 and 21 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions;


 preventing inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions by Australia; …


To cut to the chase, this amendment implements that latter recommendation by JSCOT. This amendment would effectively implement that in full. I know—and I spoke at length on this last night and earlier this afternoon about the facts—how horrified I was to discover that what I thought was lazy drafting or inadvertent loopholes that have crept into the bill were actually deliberately placed there at the behest of the United States government, as was demonstrated by the release of the state department cables by WikiLeaks. In this instance I think perhaps it is simply poor drafting. I do not sense any underlying conspiracy here and I am merely attempting to improve the drafting to tighten up what I believe leaves us very open to a very wide interpretation or a very high bar being put in place. So I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:19):  The government's position is that we agree with your understanding that the proposed amendment is intended to alter the standard of fault which applies to an element of the offence of assisting, encouraging or inducing the commission of a prohibited act from 'intention' to 'knowledge'. As indicated, the government does not support your proposed amendment, being the amendment of the Greens Party. As currently drafted, the bill will ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. The offences in the bill have been drafted on the basis of a reasonable interpretation of the convention. We consider that a reasonable interpretation of the convention is that a person who assists, encourages or induces another person to undertake prohibited conduct must also intend that the prohibited conduct be done. This interpretation is consistent with the object and purpose of the convention, which is to prohibit the use of cluster munitions. I repeat, Senator, that, as we discussed last night in the committee stage, I think it is entirely unremarkable that Australia consulted with its alliance partner, the United States, and developed a common position insofar as we could maintain our commitment to support the convention while sustaining that alliance. I think, as I said to you last night, there are no revelations in WikiLeaks worthy of that name, rather the mundane conduct of diplomacy between friends.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:21):  The minister may find it mundane that a party to the convention would be doing the bidding of a party not to the convention that actively deploys and uses in military conflicts these weapons. So as for developing a common position—and maybe I did not quite make myself clear last night—how does the Australian government come to a common position when our objectives are diametrically opposed? The Australian government is telling the public that it wants to see these weapons eradicated from the face of the earth. The United States military has still deployed and used these weapons on civilian populations in recent conflicts. So how exactly do we reconcile and come to a common position in that instance?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:21):  It is actually very straightforward. Again, I think we are retracing ground that I covered last night. Clearly the government has supported this convention, as indeed has the opposition and the Greens, because we are all committed to the eradication of cluster munitions. Of course, if it were possible, we would also sign a convention that outlawed war. But, tragically, we live in an international environment where things are not quite so simple. While we are resolved to not use, not stockpile, not consider the use of cluster munitions, that is not a view that is shared by a range of countries. You obviously speak of the United States, but there are many others. If you were to insist, as you seem to be, that every country that signs this convention must walk away from its alliance relationships and any view that its military should be interoperable with its major alliance partners, then I would submit that you would not simply see the allies of the United States disadvantaged but of course you would be creating a set of circumstances whereby none of the powers or the allies would sign this treaty and it would be, if you will forgive the phraseology, dead on arrival. It would be a dead letter treaty.


We are committed to changing international norms. We are committed to eradicating these weapons. But it is a nuanced business. Of course, one must also comprehend that for some countries the banning of cluster munitions may simply mean a bigger investment in artillery and rocket barrages. These things are not simple. And while they are a little easier for us because our view is clear and we do not face a territorial threat and these are not weapons we have ever used or ever stockpiled and we have no intention of ever doing so, we understand that the equation in other parts of the world is not so simple. So again I would put it to you that if we were to follow your formula we would find a convention with fewer signatories and we would find a convention that in fact has less of an impact rather than the greater impact you seek.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Ludlam to schedule 1, item 1, paragraph 72.38(2)(c) be agreed to. 


Question negatived.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:21):  I think the chamber should have reconsidered that one. However, I will move to Greens amendment (2) on sheet 7084:


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 29), after subsection 72.38(2), insert:


(2A)   An entity regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority commits an offence if it directly or indirectly:


   (a)   provides funds to a person or an entity; or


   (b)   invests funds in an entity;


involved in the development or production of cluster munitions or explosive submunitions.


This is not an issue we have canvassed at length, so I will just briefly speak to it. This amendment relates to the ban on investment. I presume Senator Feeney will shortly jump up in response and assure me that I am misreading the bill, but in fact we have taken advice from the people who actually manage and run the funds and they have said that this is a flaw. This is not, I think, something we are doing at the behest of the United States government, unlike the other, clear faults we have introduced in the bill. Again, I would be inclined to place this in terms of a drafting error, but maybe I am just naive.


The bill should explicitly ban investment because it assists with a prohibited act. I struggle to see how that could be a controversial statement. Many other countries specifically ban direct and indirect investment in cluster munitions in their legislation. By 'indirect' we mean an investment in a parent company that may, through a company that it has a holding in, in fact be manufacturing components or manufacturing cluster weapons themselves. There are not a large number of companies in the world who manufacture these weapons. Most of them, indeed, are subsidiaries of the big arms manufacturers. Perhaps those are the entities in whom this amendment should be dedicated to.


The Treaties Committee recommended at recommendation (2) that the legislation should prevent investment. It is fairly clear. It is supported by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors who proposed this in its submission to the Senate inquiry. I would encourage all senators to go back and have a look at what the financial community thinks of this bill. Their evidence was compelling. They said that in order to comply with the spirit of the CCM and the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that the bill must restrict the ability of cluster bomb producers to secure any capital from Australian investors by 'making it illegal for Australian investors to provide financing to such companies'.


We propose that the restriction applies to all Australian institutions regulated by ASIC or APRA. Under our proposal these institutions will be prohibited from lending to companies that produce cluster bombs. In addition, the institutions will be prohibited in trading in securities or investing moneys—their own or on behalf of clients—in companies that produce cluster bombs. Finally, under our proposal the bill will contain a schedule with a list of such companies that will be updated by the Commonwealth as required.


A number of countries have legislation which directly prohibits the manufacture and financing of cluster munitions. I will go through a list of those briefly, but let me just test first of all whether there have been any second thoughts, either on behalf of the government or the coalition, that in fact this is the easiest of the loopholes to close. Senators would be aware through the length of the debate thus far that perhaps the other issues are complex; this one is pretty simple: we do not want to be enabling the financing, direct or indirect, to companies producing cluster weapons. I hope that is an uncontroversial statement. Could I get an indication, please, from the minister if the government intends to support this Greens amendment that would simply tighten up the investment criteria, as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors have advised. If Senator Humphries wants to indicate a position on behalf of the coalition, I would be grateful as well.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:28):  No, I am afraid, Senator, the government does not support the proposed amendment. The government repeats its view that this bill gives full effect to the convention—the convention that represents the agreement of the international community on prohibiting cluster munitions. We understand that the proposed amendment would make it an offence for a company to invest in any company that develops or produces cluster munitions, regardless of the investor's knowledge or intent in making that investment, and regardless of whether the invested funds actually assist in the development or production of cluster munitions.


It is the government's view that such an amendment is inconsistent with the convention and inconsistent with the primary purpose of this bill, which of course is to give effect to the convention. The bill uses the same language as the convention to ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. The convention does not prohibit all forms of investment in companies that develop or produce cluster munitions. Rather, the convention prohibits the provision of assistance, encouragement or inducement in the development or production of cluster munitions. Some acts of investment would fall within the scope of the convention's prohibition on assistance where the investment in fact assess the development or production of cluster munitions, but any acts of investment that are prohibited by the convention will fall within the scope of the offences in the bill.


The proposed amendment may have potentially wide-ranging effects. Human Rights Watch has estimated that more than 85 companies produce cluster munitions or their key components, and many of these companies of course produce other non-prohibited products. Financial institutions that provide credit for loan facilities to these companies would be in breach of the proposed amendment, and we say that is unworkable and that it goes beyond the scope of the convention itself.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:30):  So when I finally move this motion the Senate will be voting to keep a loophole open that the financial community wants closed—just so that we are well aware that. A number of countries have legislation which directly prohibits the financing and manufacturing of cluster weapons. Australia is going to stay outside that framework and that is profoundly shameful. Luxembourg in 2009 passed its Convention on Cluster Munitions ratification law, and article 3 of that law contains a ban on investments and states:


All persons, businesses and corporate entities are prohibited from knowingly financing cluster munitions or explosive submunitions


In 2008, Ireland's Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill explicitly prohibited investment of public money in producers of cluster munitions. In 2009 the New Zealanders, whose enabling legislation I have referenced previously, included a prohibition on investment in companies that manufacture cluster munitions and they are clear about what sort of financing is prohibited—namely: 


… assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable, however acquired; and includes legal documents) or instruments (for example bank credits, travellers’ cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares—


and so on.


The Netherlands in 2011 passed a motion that called for the prohibition of direct and demonstrable investments in companies that produce, sell or distribute cluster munitions. The UK government issued a ministerial statement in 2009 confirming that 'under the current provisions of the bill, which have been modelled upon the definitions and requirements of the convention, the financing of cluster munitions would be prohibited. The provision of funds directly contributing to the manufacture of these weapons would be prohibited.' Lastly, Belgium produced a schedule in its legislation, and article 2 of that legislation reads:


Also prohibited is the financing of a company under Belgian law or under the law of another country, which is involved in the manufacture, use, repair, marketing, sale, distribution, import, export, stockpiling or transportation of anti-personnel mines and or sub-munitions within the sense of this act, and with a view to distribution thereof.


To this end The King shall, no later than the first day of the thirteenth month following the publication of this act, prepare a public list


(i) of companies that have been shown to carry out an activity as under the previous paragraph;


(ii) of companies holding more than half the shares of a company as under i) and;


(iii) of collective investment institutions holding financial instruments of companies as designated in i) and ii).


So here is a fairly explicit example of the sort of behaviour that Senator Feeney just said we could not possibly bring to bear in an Australian legislative context because companies that manufacture these hideous weapons might also manufacture consumer white goods. Who knows? And we would not want to impact upon them! Actually, I believe we would. That is precisely why we would bring an instrument like this into law: to stigmatise and try to strangle financial oxygen to exactly that kind of behaviour. Either we oppose the manufacture and distribution of these weapons or we do not. Minister, would you briefly provide us with the government's view on why it is good enough for the state parties that I have just listed to do this but, somehow, not possible here in Australia.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:34):  I am happy to respond, Senator. Each signatory to the convention is implementing its obligations under the convention in accordance with its domestic processes and requirements. Some countries—for example, Guatemala, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malawi, Malta, Rwanda and Zambia—consider that article 1 of the convention by implication prohibits all forms of investment in companies that develop or produce cluster munitions. Other countries consider that the convention does not prohibit investment but have nonetheless enacted legislation prohibiting all forms of investment in companies that develop and produce cluster munitions—for example, Belgium and, as I think you cited, Luxembourg.


In the case of Belgium and Luxembourg this legislation was not enacted on the basis of any legal obligation arising under the convention. Countries are not precluded from deciding as a matter of policy to adopt measures regarding investment that go beyond those in the convention. Other countries, such as Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom, have not included a prohibition on investment as part of their legislation to implement the convention. I will conclude by saying that, when one looks at the cases around the world, we see some variation, and I repeat the government's view that what we have before us is a bill that keeps faith with the convention and enacts the requirements of that convention as its primary purpose.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:35): In closing, Madam Temporary Chair—and then I will ask you to put the question if there are no other contributions—the Greens agree with Human Rights Watch, who state:


The Bill should explicitly ban investment because it assists with a prohibited act, that is, the production of cluster munitions. Production cannot be curtailed and cluster munitions eliminated if a state party allows direct or indirect financial support to manufacturers of the weapons. Because private investors often provide important financial support to such companies, the ban should extend to private funds.


As I have mentioned a couple of times, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors provided evidence to the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee that was compelling. In their submission they pointed out that there is no known direct investment in cluster munitions occurring anywhere in the world. On the other hand, direct investment is the only type of investment that would be captured under the current legislative wording. In other words, we are prohibiting a practice that does not exist, but on the kind of practice that does exist—that is, indirect investment in parent companies that have subsidiaries producing these devices—this bill is silent.


I could have seek an undertaking that the minister believes that, and maybe I have misunderstood his comments. ACSI observed that for the avoidance of doubt 'the current drafting will have no practical effect on the financing of cluster bomb production'. Minister, before we put this question to the vote, is it the government's understanding that the current wording of the bill does preclude indirect investment in cluster weapons? Perhaps that could have some bearing on the way in which the courts interpret future actions which are brought to bear.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:37):  The bill gives effect to the convention in Australian law and is guided and limited by the convention. The bill provides that a person or entity commits an offence if they intentionally assist, encourage or induce a person or entity to develop or produce cluster munitions. This offence would, for example, apply to a person who intentionally provides financial assistance to an entity so that the entity can develop or produce a cluster munition. However, accidental or innocent acts of assistance, encouragement or inducement will not fall within the offences in the bill.


For example, the person who contributes to a superannuation fund which includes investments in companies that may develop or produce cluster munitions would not fulfil the elements of the offence in the bill. The offences in the bill utilise the criminal code standard fault element of intention. The standard fault element should be applied unless there is a reason to depart from it.

What I can do here, and what I have done, is to articulate our policy and the fact that what we have before this Senate is legislation that keeps faith with the convention. Our view is that you are trying to accomplish certain policy ends that are not found in the convention, and which we say are outside the gamut of this legislation as a consequence.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:38):  So I can invest in a shell company that does not manufacture cluster weapons but owns entities that do, and the minister somehow wants us to believe that that is in keeping with the spirit of the convention? It is not—it is just not. I am not sure that there is any value either in asking anybody who might still be listening to this debate to pursue this any further, because I think that on the key question the minister has been unable to comfort us—that I can invest in a company that has nothing to do with cluster munitions apart from the fact that it owns a subsidiary entity that does manufacture them, but that will not be in breach of this bill. Why even bother having investment criteria in here? As ACSI pointed out—and these are the people in the industry who know exactly how this game works—the bill as drafted has no practical effect because we do not invest in companies that directly manufacture these weapons, we are investing in the entities that own them as subsidiaries. On that, this bill is silent.


Unless the minister has anything to add, my take away from this debate is that the provisions as drafted will have no practical effect at all. That is certainly what the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors believe. The minister has given us no evidence this afternoon that they are incorrect. If the minister has had nothing further to say, that is fine—I will let the chair put the question to the chamber.




The ACTING TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  The question is that Greens amendment (2), to insert subsection (2A) into 72.38(2) in schedule 1, item 1 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:47):  I suspect that this will be among the least controversial of the amendments that the Greens have proposed to this bill and it is also one with which I have the least issue. This is simply a technical amendment. The Greens amendment here is section 2239 of the bill which is about the acquisition and retention was raised by the minister in terms of what stockpiles the ADF can hold. What we are seeking to do is ensure that the minimum number of munitions are held by Australia that is absolutely necessary for training purposes. 


The text of the bill currently reads that the minister may authorise in writing specified members of the ADF or other specified Commonwealth public officials to acquire or retain cluster munitions for one or more of the following purposes. The Greens amendment simply adds the words 'minimum number' and 'absolutely necessary'. So I will make very clear at this point that this part of the bill proposes that we could acquire cluster munitions that have the Greens support. I have seen at our Minhad air base in the UAE, with ADF personnel showing a visiting party of rather naive MPs from the other side of the world exactly what this could do to people, how it sounds when they go off, how they are incorporated into improvised explosive devices and how we can protect the local population and of course our own troops in the field from these horrific weapons, so I can understand the requirement for training purposes. We are not proposing to modify the list of reasons we might retain the things. We recognise that they are not for deployment and that that is not the intention of this part of the bill.


Nonetheless I think these amendments still have merit. The words 'minimum number' and 'absolutely necessary' provide very clear and explicit guidelines. We are not going to propose buying crate loads of these materials. We are holding onto, as I think the minister expressed in the debate last night, a handful of legacy weapons, many left over from the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and a handful of newer weapons simply to familiarise our forces going into Afghanistan or elsewhere with what these weapons can do and what they look like.


I commend this amendment to the Senate on the understanding that we are not seeking here to modify the basic premise of this part of the bill but simply to provide a hard and fast cap to reduce any residual ambiguity that this is for anything other than training purposes.


I move amendment (3):


(3)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 18 and 19), omit ""to acquire or retain specified cluster munitions"", substitute ""to acquire or retain the minimum number of cluster munitions absolutely necessary"".

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:50):  The government does not support the proposed amendment as we believe it is not necessary to include this requirement in the legislation. Article 9 of the convention allows state parties to take legal, administrative or other measures to implement the convention including the creation of regulations. The government intends to reflect the minimum number requirements in regulations that we believe are an appropriate way to implement the convention. The regulations will reflect the requirement of the convention that the amount of explosive submunitions retained or required by a state party shall not exceed the number absolutely necessary for the purposes permitted in the convention and, Senator, you have spoken to those. 


Factors that must be taken into account in decision making, such as the minimum number requirement, can be included in regulations rather than legislation. Proposed subsection 72393 states that regulations may prescribe the requirements relating to authorisation by the minister under subsection 72392. The regulations will reflect the requirement in paragraph 6 of article 3 of the convention that the amounts of explosive munitions retained or acquired by a state party shall not exceed the minimum number absolutely necessary for the purposes permitted in the convention. As you have said, Senator, those purposes are the development of and training in cluster munitions detection, clearance or destruction techniques and the development of cluster munitions countermeasures. These permitted purposes are the same purposes for which an authorisation can be granted under section 7239 of the bill.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:52):  I commend this amendment to the chamber. 



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (3) on sheet 7084 moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to. 


Question negatived. 



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Ludlam, do you wish to proceed with amendment (4)? 




Senator LUDLAM:
  Chair, I certainly do. I can think of nothing that I would rather do. I move amendment (4): 


(4)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 7), at the end of section 72.39, add:


(6)   The Minister must submit an annual report to the Secretary General of the United Nations for each calendar year during which cluster munitions are retained or acquired under subsection (2) or transferred under subsection 72.40(1).


(7)   A report under subsection (6) must include, but is not limited to, information on:


   (a)   in the case of cluster munitions retained or acquired under subsection (2):


   (i)   the proposed purpose or purposes for which the cluster munitions have been acquired or retained;


   (ii)   the type, quantity and lots numbers of cluster munitions that have been acquired or retained;


   (iii)   if the cluster munitions have been used for a purpose—the purpose for which the cluster munitions have been used; and


   (b)   in the case of cluster munitions transferred under subsection 72.40(1):


   (i)   the name of the party to which the cluster munitions have been transferred;


   (ii)   the type, quantity and lots numbers of cluster munitions that have been transferred.


(8)   A report under subsection (6) must be submitted by 30 April of the following year.


This amendment is also effectively a technical amendment and will go to amendments (5) and (6), I suspect, after question time, which go to the deeper substantive issues of why we would allow the ADF to continue to plan and conduct missions in which these weapons were used and then again in amendment (6), which relates to transit and stockpiling of these weapons on Australian soil. 


Amendment (4), however, simply goes to our belief that the minister should submit an annual report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that details the matters which we were referring to just before. So the minister or his or her delegate under this amendment would be required to submit a report annually to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for each year in which cluster munitions are retained, acquired or transferred by no later than 30 April of the following year. This report, we believe, should include information on the planned and actual use, type, quantity and lot numbers of cluster munitions acquired or retained under the subsection. 


Minister, this is nothing more nor less, in my view, than simply modelling best practice. This is modelling good behaviour. Each state party and those non-state parties that are eventually brought within the ambit of the convention should be encouraged to have precisely this practice. I suspect that long after all state parties have joined this convention and long after these weapons have been banned from the arsenals of the world—and we all, I think, look forward to that day—there will still be in places like Afghanistan, Laos, Vietnam and across former battlefields in Africa and elsewhere tens and hundreds of thousands of these weapons scattered about and there will still be a requirement for defence forces and mine-clearing personnel to retain stockpiles of these weapons. This is something that is going to have to remain in perpetuity. So I understand why we will need to retain very small numbers of these weapons for training purposes, but I believe we should get into the practice now of modelling best practice behaviour, which means accurate reporting to the S-G of the United Nations about exactly what stockpiles we are holding and why. If that practice is reflected in those of other states party to the convention, I think we will all be better off. I commend this amendment to the chamber.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:54):  Senator Ludlam, the government does not support this proposed amendment, and again we say that it is not necessary to include this requirement in legislation. Article 9 of the convention allows state parties to implement the convention through legal, administrative or other means as appropriate. And, as with its reporting obligations under other international legal instruments, Australia will comply with its reporting obligations under the Convention on Cluster Munitions—and we talked a bit about those last night and again today—without the need for those obligations to be set out in legislation.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:55):  I move amendment (5):


(5)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 6 (lines 7 to 31), omit section 72.41, substitute:


72.41  Defence—participation by Australians in military cooperation with countries not party to Convention on Cluster Munitions


      A person who is an Australian citizen, is a member of the Australian Defence Force or is performing services under a Commonwealth contract does not commit an offence against section 72.38 by merely participating in military cooperation or operations with a foreign country that is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.


Note 1:   A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this section: see subsection 13.3(3).


Note 2:   The expression offence against section72.38 is given an extended meaning by subsections 11.2(1) and 11.2A(1), section 11.3 and subsection 11.6(2).


Note 3:   This section relates to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 21 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.


This amendment quite clearly goes to what is probably the most flawed part of the bill. Amendment (5) fixes—I do not even know if 'loophole' is an accurate term—a structural sabotaging of the very intent of the convention that we are designing this legislation to enact. So I think calling it a loophole is simply too generous. Calling it a loophole would allow you to imagine that perhaps it was inadvertent and that it had got in there by mistake, and we now know that that is clearly not the case. 


The section this amendment seeks to fix allows Australian troops to actively assist countries that have not signed up to the convention to deploy and use these munitions. This occurred in Iraq when the convention did not exist in 2003, and we have discussed that extensively. I would be interested to know whether anybody in the department has bothered to chase up any of the questions I put on notice last night about the weapons platforms that the United States government uses to put these weapons into the field, because that will be helpful information when we come to debating the amendments around stockpiling and transit. But, in particular, I put some specific questions through you, Minister, last night about whether F18 pilots flew close support missions for US ground forces that were using cluster weapons against civilian populations. I would invite the minister now, as the clock runs down towards question time, to address whether he knows that is the case or not.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:57):  As I said, Senator, as we commenced today, those are issues on which I have undertaken to get back to you. We have taken those questions on notice. Of course, I guess a nuanced but important one is that we would not say, and I suspect you would not say, that they were used against civilian populations. But as to how and when they were used in the course of 2003, we are awaiting advice. 


With respect to your amendment more broadly, the proposed amendment is intended to replace the interoperability defence currently found in the bill and, as a consequence, the government does not support the proposed amendment. We talked a lot last night and today about that interoperability defence. The government does not consider that the defence that applies to mere participation accurately gives effect to the convention. Such an amendment would therefore be inconsistent with the purpose of the bill, which is of course to give effect to that convention. The convention does not prohibit mere participation or unintended or inadvertent participation in acts by a non-state party that would be prohibited to a state party. The bill uses the same language as the convention—a point I keep making because it should engender your confidence in the bill—to ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. Further, the term 'mere participation' is not defined and would be subject to interpretation. Creating a defence for mere participation ignores the limitations placed by the convention on the kinds of activities that can be undertaken in the course of military cooperation in operations with countries not party to the convention. 


Creating a defence or mere participation also risks removing criminal liability for a broader range of conduct than is permitted by the convention. Again, I say the bill uses the same language as the convention to ensure that the bill accurately reflects the provisions found in the convention and reflects international agreement on the prohibition of cluster munitions.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:33):  That makes it difficult to proceed. One of the things I was after—probably the most important—concerned the references I provided last night. I do not understand why this would not have been forthcoming during the morning, unless it was not given priority, but I sought the minister's advice on whether the government agrees with the statements made in three reference documents that I provided last night about the number of cluster weapons and submunitions that were fired into Iraq in 2003, and which Australian SAS, Regular Army and RAAF forces supported that action. Let us pick up those ones in particular. Has the minister been given the opportunity, or has anyone else bothered, to look at those documents and assess whether they are accurate or not?

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:34):  I have looked at advice given by the Congressional Research Service to the US Congress on 27 June 2012, and that may very well be a document Senator Ludlam is familiar with. In any event, it uses statistics that are the same as those he has cited. So I think for the purposes of this morning, subject to me getting formal advice from the department the only information I have before me is that the statistics Senator Ludlam is using are right. This document talks about 13,000 munitions by US and United Kingdom forces in the first three weeks of the conflict in 2003. For the purposes of today I am happy to take those statistics as agreed between us.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:35):  I thank the minister—he has left himself some wriggle room in case figures come back that are different. The other question of great consequence that I put to him last night was whether I am correct in assuming that the Royal Australian Air Force flew close support for the US units that were using those weapons on the way into Baghdad. I listed a number of cities and towns along the way. I believe that is of central importance in this debate. 


For senators who were not present and for those in the gallery who might be listening, this debate went quite late last night. If we asked 100 Australians randomly in the street whether we should support the Convention on Cluster Munitions, 100 people would come back and say of course we should. We heard unanimous support from government and coalition senators last night, saying it is timely that we sign onto this instrument.


Unless the minister can persuade me otherwise, I believe that under the convention as it is sought to be embedded in domestic law and as currently drafted Australian military units could directly support, for the sake of argument as it appears to have happened before, US military units firing cluster weapons into areas indiscriminately, leaving these things littering the landscape. It would not be prevented by the drafting of the bill before us. We had a lot of debate about this last night, and I sought to have some matters taken on notice to see if they could be clarified. 


The central fact of the matter is that there is nothing in the drafting of this bill that would prevent exactly that situation from occurring again—not in Iraq, obviously, but in any other battlefield that we find ourselves co-deployed with US military units. We could be directly planning and supporting missions in which cluster weapons are used, which would violate not just the spirit but also the letter of the convention. If it turns out I am wrong, I will sit down and we can close out this debate and get on with it—but the drafting of the bill as it is presently formulated would allow precisely those things to occur.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:37):  I do not really have much to add to where we got to in the debate last night, Senator Ludlam. I will repeat the position we reached. The events in 2003 occurred well before the convention, so obviously Australia, at that time, did not have any obligations under the convention. We have not made any assessment about how current convention obligations might have affected military operations in 2003. 


I repeat the point I made at the conclusion of last night—that in the view of the government this convention, and our support for it, is an important step forward. We believe the interoperability provisions found in this legislation are critically important both to the workings of the treaty itself and to Australia's alliance relationship with the United States. As I also said last night, if interoperability provisions like this were not found in the bill and were not countenanced by the convention, that would, in our judgement, greatly weaken the convention and support for it. You would be creating a situation in which any nation which had an alliance relationship with any one of the United States, Russia, China, Iran, India, Pakistan, Brazil or a plethora of other nations might feel unable to support the convention. We think that would reduce the value of the convention—we would be dealing with a convention with far fewer signatories and which therefore exerted far less influence towards the creation of an international norm where these weapons are not used. There is nothing new in all that, Senator Ludlam—I am simply repeating the case I put to you last night.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:39):  I indicate to senators that we are still asking general questions about the bill, as was Senator Xenophon last night. I want to move us through and get to our amendments. We will return to this issue briefly when I move the amendments which will fix this gap in the bill—a gap the parliamentary secretary did not quite concede exists but which I strongly contend does. 


I will to move on to the second of the three primary areas of concern I identified last night: the transiting and stockpiling of cluster weapons in Australia. We are not concerned about that being done by Australians—because, as we have established, Australia want nothing to do with these things, and that is a sound principle—but by an ally. This conversation is not academic, it is not abstract and it is not hypothetical. We have invited, we discovered last November, the United States Marine Corps to establish a presence in the north. I have also had it confirmed—I think, at the last estimates hearings—that the United States Air Force has been invited to establish a presence at Tindal. There are obviously ongoing discussions occurring which we are not party to—no-one in the Australian public is—concerning the US naval presence in Cockburn Sound in the south-west of WA and Queensland residents will also be aware that there are discussions occurring about US military presence at Australian facilities.


I do not want to get caught up in a debate about what is and what is not a base. It is quite clear that the US presence in Australia, as it is ramped up, will be flying under an Australian flag. That is something the Australian government has decided is important for the optics of the arrangements, I suspect. Nonetheless, the US military will be stationed here in various forms. They will be parking materiel and equipment here. So it is not good enough that the bill, as it is drafted, exempts the military personnel of states which are not party to the convention from its prohibitions while they are on Australian territory. 


We can go, if the parliamentary secretary chooses, to the operative part of the bill. It allows states which are not party to the convention, but which are engaged in military cooperation with the ADF, to stockpile cluster munitions in bases, aircraft and ships in Australia. Let us start there. Parliamentary Secretary, you can either treat Darwin as a case study or you can keep your answer in the abstract if you prefer, but I want to know how this bill is going to operate. Will it be unlawful for the US to stockpile cluster weapons in transit from place to place on Australian soil?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:42):  Firstly, I repeat that there are no US bases in Australia. There are joint facilities.




Senator Ludlam:
  I asked you not to do that.




Senator FEENEY:
  I am resisting the temptation to head down that road, too, Senator Ludlam. I also make clear that Australia has never had stockpiles of these weapons. I know you understand that, Senator Ludlam, but it is important to put it on the record. 


I repeat that the bill uses the language found in the convention. For our part, we say that the bill, in its intent and in its operation, effects everything the convention is intended to effect. The convention itself permits military cooperation and operations between states parties and countries not party to the convention. That is a point worth highlighting, I think. Such military cooperation or operations may entail the use by foreign countries of their own assets on Australian territory or the entry of foreign ships or aircraft into Australian territory. 


The defence which is found in proposed section 72.42 protects foreign military personnel of countries which are not party to the convention while such personnel are in Australia. This section obviously takes into account that Australia engages in military cooperation and operations with some countries which are not party to the convention—obviously the United States is one of those. But those kinds of military cooperation and joint operations are expressly permitted by article 21 of the convention. The defence in the bill recognises that foreign military personnel are not required to comply with an international legal obligation to which their own country has not consented. I think that is reasonably straightforward. It is essential that Australia be able to continue to cooperate with countries which have not signed the convention. 


The government has made clear that it has not and will not permit other countries to stockpile cluster munitions in Australia. I trust that is an important undertaking for you to have on the record, Senator Ludlam. 


There are currently no foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions in Australia and, as a matter of policy, the government confirmed on 23 November 2011 that it has not and will not authorise such stockpiling. The government will confirm this commitment in a public statement at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention and in Australia's annual statements under the convention.

Policies can change according to political whim and they can change with a change of government.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:47):  That is extremely concerning. Colombia noted:


The government 'absolutely rejects … any manner of …  storage of foreign cluster bombs in Colombian territory' …


Guatemala wrote that it considered:


… the stockpiling of cluster munitions of other countries in the territory of a State Party to the Convention, as well as the investment in its production is prohibited according to Article 1 of the Convention.


Slovenia stated:


'[In] our view the Convention … contains the prohibition of … stockpiling of cluster munitions by third countries on the territory of each State Party. Therefore, such activities are illegal and not allowed on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia.'


The Australian government have said: 'No, trust us. We won't let that happen, not on our watch.' We do not yet have a position from the coalition. But I take no comfort whatsoever from that. The Minister for Defence could stand up the day after tomorrow and say, 'We changed our minds,' and this legislature would be able to do nothing about it. Why has Australia taken a position that is so contrary to that of these other signatories? Why are we maintaining this wriggle room? I do not understand. I trust the minister when he tells me that that is not something the Australian government would do, but I do not understand why we are leaving this loophole wide open in the law. This is our opportunity to fix it.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:48):  It is not a loophole, Senator Ludlam. This is a piece of legislation that keeps faith with the convention and encompasses the interoperability provisions that we need as a matter of practical application to our alliance with the United States. And I do not accept that the government are out of step with other countries in the way you have asserted. Obviously, you have plucked out some examples, but there are of course many other examples we could talk about. We could talk about China, Russia and the Republic of Korea. We could talk about Israel. We could talk about Egypt, India and Pakistan. Clearly, this is a complicated question and there are different and complicated circumstances in different parts of the world. The government are ensuring that the convention is faithfully implemented by Australian law, and as a matter of policy we are telling you how we intend to realise that. Australia's interpretation of the convention is similar to that of other governments, including those of the United Kingdom, Canada and France, and each country implements its obligations in accordance with its domestic processes and requirements. I do not pretend to be an expert on how Guatemala or Austria makes its decisions and reaches its conclusions about this matter, but I can certainly talk about how Australia has done so. The government are very proud of the fact that we have supported this convention, brought legislation to this parliament that would give life to our support for ratifying the convention.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:50):  Minister, the operative part of the bill that I am referring to, section 72.42, states, as you are no doubt aware:


Section 72.38—


which is the fairly comprehensive list of things that are prohibited—


does not apply to the stockpiling, retention or transfer of a cluster munition that:


(a) is done by:


(i)  a member of the armed forces of a foreign country that is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions—


for example, the US would be caught by that—


or


(ii)  a person who is connected with such forces as described in subsection (2) and is neither an Australian citizen nor a resident of Australia …


So serving personnel with the US Marine Corps, for example, or their contractors, are explicitly allowed to stockpile these weapons in Australia under that section of the act. Why?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:51):  The government do not support deleting section 72.42. We say that the effect of deleting section 72.42 would be that visiting military personnel of countries who are not party to the convention would be prohibited from any conduct relating to cluster munitions while in Australia, and this would significantly limit Australia's ability to undertake military cooperation and operations with such countries, as permitted by the convention. The amendment you propose would also have the effect of requiring those personnel to comply with an international legal obligation to which their sending country has not consented. 


Proposed section 72.42 of the bill gives practical effect to the range of conduct permitted by article 21 of the convention. Deleting section 72.42 would limit Australia's ability to cooperate with countries not party to the convention, as permitted by article 21 of the convention. Australia engages in military cooperation and operations with countries not party to the convention, both overseas and in Australia, with the United States obviously being the outstanding example. Maintaining interoperability with the United States and other coalition forces is central to the protection of Australia's national security and international security.


 I cannot help but again assert the point that you are asking something of this Senate which is not asked of us by the convention itself and which would not apply elsewhere or in military alliance relationships, whether they be with China, Russia, Pakistan, India or whoever. There are currently no foreign stockpiles of cluster munitions in Australia and, as a matter of policy, we have confirmed that we will not authorise such stockpiling. We say that deleting section 72.42 would render the interoperability provision in the convention meaningless. That, of course, would have the effect of seriously damaging our alliance relationship with the United States. We have all talked about why that would be undesirable. So notwithstanding the defence found in proposed section 72.42, we say visiting forces would not be excused from prosecution if they use, develop, produce or acquire cluster munitions in Australia.

 (Western Australia) (12:53):  I am happy to cede the call to Senator Birmingham because I know he wanted to be here for the debate last night and I have put a question through your duty senator inquiring into coalition policy, which I know is a bit unorthodox, because the Australian government is refusing to enshrine a fairly important point into law. Parliamentary Secretary, what flexibility is created by giving us the policy undertaking that we have now, which you have indicated will go into writing when we formally ratify? What do we gain by doing that? What flexibility do we gain? What would be possible, given that undertaking in policy, that would not be possible if we simply removed these offending clauses? I do not understand how making a policy commitment to not stockpile these weapons here is any different from a strategic or operational point of view from enshrining it in law. If there is no difference, let us just put it into the bill.

We think it is entirely appropriate and that, indeed, the most effective way to deal with matters outside that single purpose is to deal with them as matters of policy. While we might differ about the means, we do not differ about the ends. Our policy is clear and it will be repeated in the regular transparency requirements that the bill engenders. We say that the bill is meeting its core purpose—that is, to meet the requirements of the convention.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:55):  I had hoped to make a contribution on this bill during the second reading debate but unfortunately was unable to do so due to conflicting commitments. I do not propose to give a speech here on the second reading and abuse the committee process. I have not had a chance, unfortunately, to review all of last night's Hansard or Senator Ludlam's questions to necessarily pursue lines of questioning with the minister that would not potentially overlap what Senator Ludlam has done, but I do want to put a couple of things on the record. There is very strong interest across the chamber in ensuring that not just the detail of the Convention on Cluster Munitions but also the intent of the Convention on Cluster Munitions is adhered to by this and future governments.


This was an agreement negotiated by governments across party lines, a negotiation which commenced under the Howard government and was continued and ultimately finalised under the Rudd government. Australia's desire to be part of this follows in a very proud tradition, which I think we need to uphold in this country, of leading the world in looking at weapons that have particular negative humanitarian consequences from their use. An outstanding example is the leadership role Australia played historically in relation to the debate on the use of landmines. There are many parallels which can and should be drawn and I hope there will be further parallels in future to which we can look to see that Australia's success in leading the world, in condemning, reducing and eliminating wherever possible the use of landmines, is replicated by Australia ultimately leading the world in condemning, reducing and ultimately eliminating, hopefully, the use of cluster munitions.


This bill, as you can tell by its date, has been around for some time. It was introduced into the parliament back in 2010. That is evidence of the fact that there have been not just formal parliamentary inquiries around this legislation but concerns expressed across parties and from outside the parliament through different organisations as to whether this bill does entirely meet the detail of the treaty and the agreement on cluster munitions and, of course, the intent of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. 


I highlight just one of the submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry, held way back in January 2010, a submission from the Australian Red Cross. The Red Cross highlighted a number of concerns which have been the subject of at least some of questioning I managed to pick up on in the debate today and I am sure were subject to speeches and questioning last night, concerns about whether the bill in particular addresses issues of interoperability and stockpiling in a manner which puts appropriate boundaries around Australia's engagement.


The Red Cross submission says:


Paragraphs 3 & 4 of Article 21 outline the manner in which States Party may engage in military cooperation with States not Party to the Convention and paragraphs 1 & 2 of Article 21 impose positive obligations on States Party to amongst other things “make its best efforts to discourage States not party to this Convention from using cluster munitions.” It is important then to read the two parts of the Article together and ensure that the implementation of paragraphs 3 & 4 do not conflict with paragraphs 1 & 2.


The Red Cross argues that this bill does not achieve a balance in the application of the different paragraphs and articles of the convention. If the parliamentary secretary feels that he has anything to add on how the bill does in fact successfully balance or attempt to balance the two requirements in the convention to accept issues around cooperation while Australia makes its best efforts to discourage the use of cluster munitions, I would welcome any further assurances that he can provide. The Red Cross did recommend and urge that the relevant sections of the legislation, in particular section 72.41, be construed more narrowly and use words that are used elsewhere in the world. As the submission says, this could be done:


… for example by having it apply only to ""mere participation"" and acts that are unintended or inadvertent or that only have a remote or indirect relationship with the prohibited conduct.


The Red Cross also highlighted—and this has been addressed in the debate—some concerns around stockpiling, maintenance and transit of cluster munitions in Australian territory, and I note the assurances that the parliamentary secretary has given there. I had a chance to have a quick look at the parliamentary secretary's closing speech in the second reading debate, and I understand that Senator Ludlam was just questioning whether the government has committed as a matter of policy to not authorising and not allowing such stockpiling of cluster munitions. I understand also that the parliamentary secretary said that the government will confirm its commitment in a public statement both at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention and in Australia's annual transparency report under the convention.


I am not sure—and perhaps he can explain—how the public statement that the parliamentary secretary has committed to make at the time of Australia's ratification of the convention will differ from the statement he made in the second reading debate. Perhaps he can also explain why, if there is to be any difference, that statement is not being made now as part of this legislative process to provide the comfort which many seek that Australia upholds a strong position on not allowing stockpiling.


Senator Ludlam posed a question on that front to the opposition and, as he knows, it is not my role within the opposition to commit the opposition to such a policy. However, he can have this individual senator's assurance that I expect that the opposition would continue with such a clear policy if the government were to honour its word—and Senator Feeney's word—in this legislative process. I hope that, the government having at least set a standard at a minimum level with this legislation—which some will say is not adequate—and then having gone further in government policy as the parliamentary secretary is committing to do, a progression occurs and that there is never a backward step and that changes to policy only further strengthen Australia's commitment to the elimination of the use of cluster munitions.


I emphasise that, whilst I still have some concerns about whether the bill meets all of the assurances that the government gives, I think it is important that we recognise that Australia's involvement in the convention through this bill is a very significant step forward in eliminating cluster munitions from the world, and I hope that all senators who approach the matter with good intent ensure that in the years to come we hold the government of the day to account for ensuring that Australia's good intentions are reflected and honoured through our actions and not just our words. I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to any of the issues I have raised.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:04):  I take up the invitation, Senator Birmingham. I repeat that the government thanks the opposition for supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010. I guess that the opposition has reached the judgement, as have we, that this bill gets the balance right. Obviously both we and the opposition come to the table with the understanding that we want to keep faith with the convention and that this bill does represent a step forward but that we are at the same time practically minded in that we wish to make sure that the convention does not have the effect of severing our alliance arrangements with the United States.


I repeat that we will be making a statement on cluster munitions, which you, Senator Birmingham, have talked about. The detail in the statement will be absolutely aligned with the undertakings I have given, and government policy will be expressed in the terms I have put them in this debate. I think that a lot of the detail that your question asked for I dealt with last night, and I commend the transcript to you for some of the detail about the balance in proposed sections 72.41 and 72.38 in particular.


I think that we have got the balance right and have said very plainly that this bill realises the convention, that matters above and beyond will be dealt with as a question of policy and that our policy is clear and well understood.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:08):  The minister has used the term 'authorisation' of weapons being stockpiled or transited through Australia. I also thank Senator Birmingham; I guess we can only hope that in the unlikely event that there is a change of government next year he ends up as the defence minister and then we can hold him to his word—which I absolutely believe; I know he cares a great deal about these issues. However, we have even less from the coalition than we have from the government. From the government we have a hypothetical policy statement that may be announced at some future stage down the track; from the coalition we have Senator Birmingham assuring us that he loathes these weapons as much as anybody else and would not want to see them stored here. 


I am interested to know how we would actually prevent it. How is this going to work in practice? When US warships that may or may not be nuclear armed transit through Australian ports, the US Navy has a policy of neither confirming nor denying that the ships are carrying nuclear weapons. To what degree would we even know about the weapons on these vessels or aircraft moving through Australian waters or airspace, stabled temporarily at Tindal air base or wherever else, in order to issue an authorisation in the first place?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:09):  Firstly, there is nothing hypothetical about our policy. Our policy is our policy and it is plain. The government strictly monitors the presence of cluster munitions and other explosives on Australian territory. Ships and aircraft owned by foreign armed forces that transit through Australian territory are required to advise the quantity of explosives that they have on board to enable appropriate explosives safety requirements to be met—that is, to ensure that the ship or aircraft is berthed or parked in an appropriate location—and it is standard practice to require such vessels to advise of the total net explosives quantity of munitions that they have on-board rather than the actual type and quantity of specific munitions. 


All munitions owned by foreign armed forces that are stored on Australian soil are required to be managed as Commonwealth explosives, in accordance with the Explosives Act 1961 and its subordinate regulations and codes. This requires specific approval for the storage and transportation of these munitions and their inclusion in Defence information holdings. Additionally, munitions are stored in Defence facilities licensed to store explosive ordnance and are managed on the computer system for armaments. As a consequence of that Defence both approves and has full visibility of all foreign armed forces munitions that are stored on Australian soil.

Maybe I misunderstood your comment: do we actually know, broken out by weapon type, what is stored on Australian soil? Let us start with that before we deal with naval or air assets.

Chair, I think it might assist the chamber if I formally move the first amendment and we actually start moving through these.




The ACTING TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  We are in your hands, Senator Ludlam, as to how we handle the amendments. The only thing is that the last of your amendments, No. 6,needs to be moved separately.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:15):  I will speak to each of them in turn. I now move amendment (1) on sheet 7084, which relates to intention:


(1)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 28), omit paragraph 72.38(2)(c), substitute:


(c)   the first person knew or should have known that the act would be done.


It is not a matter that I have discussed at length so I will briefly describe for the benefit of senators why I am doing this. This amendment is to the section of the bill that relates to promoting acts with cluster munitions, so it goes to our positive obligations under the terms of the convention. A person commits an offence if a person knew or should have known that the act would be done. That is common language for recklessness. This bill sets a very high threshold for liability requiring that a person intended that an act be done in order to be liable for one of the offences. This refers specifically to proposed section 72.38. Under this standard, individuals would not be liable for conduct if, for example, they were aware that their conduct would result in cluster munitions use—so there is knowledge—or in a substantial unjustifiable risk of use, so recklessness. Using an intention standard in 72.38, this makes it very difficult to hold individuals liable for use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions or assistance with these prohibited acts. This is even if they knew or should have known that their conduct could lead to one of these activities. This result is in direct opposition to JSCOT's recommendation to prevent inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions by Australia. So I hope the minister can see the distinction that I am drawing here even though it may seem to be a fine one. It is between inadvertent participation and reckless participation. I will remind the chamber, because I am still open to referring this bill back to JSCOT as we discussed last night, that JSCOT, in its report No. 103 of 2009, said: 


… The Committee also acknowledges concerns regarding the potential for Australia to inadvertently participate in the use or assist in the use of cluster munitions, despite the provisions of the Convention. The Committee is concerned that some of the terms contained in the Convention are not clearly defined and may provide an avenue by which Australia could participate in actions which may contravene the humanitarian aims of the Convention. The Committee therefore considers that the Australian Government and the ADF should address these issues when drafting the domestic legislation required to implement the Convention, and when developing policies by which the personnel of the Australian Defence Force operate …


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have regard to the following issues when drafting the legislation required to implement the Convention … , and when developing policies under which the personnel of the ADF operate:


 the definition of the terms 'use', 'retain', 'assist', 'encourage' and 'induce' as they apply in Articles 1, 2 and 21 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions;


 preventing inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions by Australia; …


To cut to the chase, this amendment implements that latter recommendation by JSCOT. This amendment would effectively implement that in full. I know—and I spoke at length on this last night and earlier this afternoon about the facts—how horrified I was to discover that what I thought was lazy drafting or inadvertent loopholes that have crept into the bill were actually deliberately placed there at the behest of the United States government, as was demonstrated by the release of the state department cables by WikiLeaks. In this instance I think perhaps it is simply poor drafting. I do not sense any underlying conspiracy here and I am merely attempting to improve the drafting to tighten up what I believe leaves us very open to a very wide interpretation or a very high bar being put in place. So I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:19):  The government's position is that we agree with your understanding that the proposed amendment is intended to alter the standard of fault which applies to an element of the offence of assisting, encouraging or inducing the commission of a prohibited act from 'intention' to 'knowledge'. As indicated, the government does not support your proposed amendment, being the amendment of the Greens Party. As currently drafted, the bill will ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. The offences in the bill have been drafted on the basis of a reasonable interpretation of the convention. We consider that a reasonable interpretation of the convention is that a person who assists, encourages or induces another person to undertake prohibited conduct must also intend that the prohibited conduct be done. This interpretation is consistent with the object and purpose of the convention, which is to prohibit the use of cluster munitions. I repeat, Senator, that, as we discussed last night in the committee stage, I think it is entirely unremarkable that Australia consulted with its alliance partner, the United States, and developed a common position insofar as we could maintain our commitment to support the convention while sustaining that alliance. I think, as I said to you last night, there are no revelations in WikiLeaks worthy of that name, rather the mundane conduct of diplomacy between friends.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:21):  The minister may find it mundane that a party to the convention would be doing the bidding of a party not to the convention that actively deploys and uses in military conflicts these weapons. So as for developing a common position—and maybe I did not quite make myself clear last night—how does the Australian government come to a common position when our objectives are diametrically opposed? The Australian government is telling the public that it wants to see these weapons eradicated from the face of the earth. The United States military has still deployed and used these weapons on civilian populations in recent conflicts. So how exactly do we reconcile and come to a common position in that instance?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:21):  It is actually very straightforward. Again, I think we are retracing ground that I covered last night. Clearly the government has supported this convention, as indeed has the opposition and the Greens, because we are all committed to the eradication of cluster munitions. Of course, if it were possible, we would also sign a convention that outlawed war. But, tragically, we live in an international environment where things are not quite so simple. While we are resolved to not use, not stockpile, not consider the use of cluster munitions, that is not a view that is shared by a range of countries. You obviously speak of the United States, but there are many others. If you were to insist, as you seem to be, that every country that signs this convention must walk away from its alliance relationships and any view that its military should be interoperable with its major alliance partners, then I would submit that you would not simply see the allies of the United States disadvantaged but of course you would be creating a set of circumstances whereby none of the powers or the allies would sign this treaty and it would be, if you will forgive the phraseology, dead on arrival. It would be a dead letter treaty.


We are committed to changing international norms. We are committed to eradicating these weapons. But it is a nuanced business. Of course, one must also comprehend that for some countries the banning of cluster munitions may simply mean a bigger investment in artillery and rocket barrages. These things are not simple. And while they are a little easier for us because our view is clear and we do not face a territorial threat and these are not weapons we have ever used or ever stockpiled and we have no intention of ever doing so, we understand that the equation in other parts of the world is not so simple. So again I would put it to you that if we were to follow your formula we would find a convention with fewer signatories and we would find a convention that in fact has less of an impact rather than the greater impact you seek.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:21):  I think the chamber should have reconsidered that one. However, I will move to Greens amendment (2) on sheet 7084:


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 29), after subsection 72.38(2), insert:


(2A)   An entity regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority commits an offence if it directly or indirectly:


   (a)   provides funds to a person or an entity; or


   (b)   invests funds in an entity;


involved in the development or production of cluster munitions or explosive submunitions.


This is not an issue we have canvassed at length, so I will just briefly speak to it. This amendment relates to the ban on investment. I presume Senator Feeney will shortly jump up in response and assure me that I am misreading the bill, but in fact we have taken advice from the people who actually manage and run the funds and they have said that this is a flaw. This is not, I think, something we are doing at the behest of the United States government, unlike the other, clear faults we have introduced in the bill. Again, I would be inclined to place this in terms of a drafting error, but maybe I am just naive.


The bill should explicitly ban investment because it assists with a prohibited act. I struggle to see how that could be a controversial statement. Many other countries specifically ban direct and indirect investment in cluster munitions in their legislation. By 'indirect' we mean an investment in a parent company that may, through a company that it has a holding in, in fact be manufacturing components or manufacturing cluster weapons themselves. There are not a large number of companies in the world who manufacture these weapons. Most of them, indeed, are subsidiaries of the big arms manufacturers. Perhaps those are the entities in whom this amendment should be dedicated to.


The Treaties Committee recommended at recommendation (2) that the legislation should prevent investment. It is fairly clear. It is supported by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors who proposed this in its submission to the Senate inquiry. I would encourage all senators to go back and have a look at what the financial community thinks of this bill. Their evidence was compelling. They said that in order to comply with the spirit of the CCM and the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that the bill must restrict the ability of cluster bomb producers to secure any capital from Australian investors by 'making it illegal for Australian investors to provide financing to such companies'.


We propose that the restriction applies to all Australian institutions regulated by ASIC or APRA. Under our proposal these institutions will be prohibited from lending to companies that produce cluster bombs. In addition, the institutions will be prohibited in trading in securities or investing moneys—their own or on behalf of clients—in companies that produce cluster bombs. Finally, under our proposal the bill will contain a schedule with a list of such companies that will be updated by the Commonwealth as required.


A number of countries have legislation which directly prohibits the manufacture and financing of cluster munitions. I will go through a list of those briefly, but let me just test first of all whether there have been any second thoughts, either on behalf of the government or the coalition, that in fact this is the easiest of the loopholes to close. Senators would be aware through the length of the debate thus far that perhaps the other issues are complex; this one is pretty simple: we do not want to be enabling the financing, direct or indirect, to companies producing cluster weapons. I hope that is an uncontroversial statement. Could I get an indication, please, from the minister if the government intends to support this Greens amendment that would simply tighten up the investment criteria, as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors have advised. If Senator Humphries wants to indicate a position on behalf of the coalition, I would be grateful as well.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:28):  No, I am afraid, Senator, the government does not support the proposed amendment. The government repeats its view that this bill gives full effect to the convention—the convention that represents the agreement of the international community on prohibiting cluster munitions. We understand that the proposed amendment would make it an offence for a company to invest in any company that develops or produces cluster munitions, regardless of the investor's knowledge or intent in making that investment, and regardless of whether the invested funds actually assist in the development or production of cluster munitions.


It is the government's view that such an amendment is inconsistent with the convention and inconsistent with the primary purpose of this bill, which of course is to give effect to the convention. The bill uses the same language as the convention to ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. The convention does not prohibit all forms of investment in companies that develop or produce cluster munitions. Rather, the convention prohibits the provision of assistance, encouragement or inducement in the development or production of cluster munitions. Some acts of investment would fall within the scope of the convention's prohibition on assistance where the investment in fact assess the development or production of cluster munitions, but any acts of investment that are prohibited by the convention will fall within the scope of the offences in the bill.


The proposed amendment may have potentially wide-ranging effects. Human Rights Watch has estimated that more than 85 companies produce cluster munitions or their key components, and many of these companies of course produce other non-prohibited products. Financial institutions that provide credit for loan facilities to these companies would be in breach of the proposed amendment, and we say that is unworkable and that it goes beyond the scope of the convention itself.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:30):  So when I finally move this motion the Senate will be voting to keep a loophole open that the financial community wants closed—just so that we are well aware that. A number of countries have legislation which directly prohibits the financing and manufacturing of cluster weapons. Australia is going to stay outside that framework and that is profoundly shameful. Luxembourg in 2009 passed its Convention on Cluster Munitions ratification law, and article 3 of that law contains a ban on investments and states:


All persons, businesses and corporate entities are prohibited from knowingly financing cluster munitions or explosive submunitions


In 2008, Ireland's Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill explicitly prohibited investment of public money in producers of cluster munitions. In 2009 the New Zealanders, whose enabling legislation I have referenced previously, included a prohibition on investment in companies that manufacture cluster munitions and they are clear about what sort of financing is prohibited—namely: 


… assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable, however acquired; and includes legal documents) or instruments (for example bank credits, travellers’ cheques, bank cheques, money orders, shares—


and so on.


The Netherlands in 2011 passed a motion that called for the prohibition of direct and demonstrable investments in companies that produce, sell or distribute cluster munitions. The UK government issued a ministerial statement in 2009 confirming that 'under the current provisions of the bill, which have been modelled upon the definitions and requirements of the convention, the financing of cluster munitions would be prohibited. The provision of funds directly contributing to the manufacture of these weapons would be prohibited.' Lastly, Belgium produced a schedule in its legislation, and article 2 of that legislation reads:


Also prohibited is the financing of a company under Belgian law or under the law of another country, which is involved in the manufacture, use, repair, marketing, sale, distribution, import, export, stockpiling or transportation of anti-personnel mines and or sub-munitions within the sense of this act, and with a view to distribution thereof.


To this end The King shall, no later than the first day of the thirteenth month following the publication of this act, prepare a public list


(i) of companies that have been shown to carry out an activity as under the previous paragraph;


(ii) of companies holding more than half the shares of a company as under i) and;


(iii) of collective investment institutions holding financial instruments of companies as designated in i) and ii).


So here is a fairly explicit example of the sort of behaviour that Senator Feeney just said we could not possibly bring to bear in an Australian legislative context because companies that manufacture these hideous weapons might also manufacture consumer white goods. Who knows? And we would not want to impact upon them! Actually, I believe we would. That is precisely why we would bring an instrument like this into law: to stigmatise and try to strangle financial oxygen to exactly that kind of behaviour. Either we oppose the manufacture and distribution of these weapons or we do not. Minister, would you briefly provide us with the government's view on why it is good enough for the state parties that I have just listed to do this but, somehow, not possible here in Australia.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:34):  I am happy to respond, Senator. Each signatory to the convention is implementing its obligations under the convention in accordance with its domestic processes and requirements. Some countries—for example, Guatemala, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malawi, Malta, Rwanda and Zambia—consider that article 1 of the convention by implication prohibits all forms of investment in companies that develop or produce cluster munitions. Other countries consider that the convention does not prohibit investment but have nonetheless enacted legislation prohibiting all forms of investment in companies that develop and produce cluster munitions—for example, Belgium and, as I think you cited, Luxembourg.


In the case of Belgium and Luxembourg this legislation was not enacted on the basis of any legal obligation arising under the convention. Countries are not precluded from deciding as a matter of policy to adopt measures regarding investment that go beyond those in the convention. Other countries, such as Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom, have not included a prohibition on investment as part of their legislation to implement the convention. I will conclude by saying that, when one looks at the cases around the world, we see some variation, and I repeat the government's view that what we have before us is a bill that keeps faith with the convention and enacts the requirements of that convention as its primary purpose.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:35): In closing, Madam Temporary Chair—and then I will ask you to put the question if there are no other contributions—the Greens agree with Human Rights Watch, who state:


The Bill should explicitly ban investment because it assists with a prohibited act, that is, the production of cluster munitions. Production cannot be curtailed and cluster munitions eliminated if a state party allows direct or indirect financial support to manufacturers of the weapons. Because private investors often provide important financial support to such companies, the ban should extend to private funds.


As I have mentioned a couple of times, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors provided evidence to the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee that was compelling. In their submission they pointed out that there is no known direct investment in cluster munitions occurring anywhere in the world. On the other hand, direct investment is the only type of investment that would be captured under the current legislative wording. In other words, we are prohibiting a practice that does not exist, but on the kind of practice that does exist—that is, indirect investment in parent companies that have subsidiaries producing these devices—this bill is silent.


I could have seek an undertaking that the minister believes that, and maybe I have misunderstood his comments. ACSI observed that for the avoidance of doubt 'the current drafting will have no practical effect on the financing of cluster bomb production'. Minister, before we put this question to the vote, is it the government's understanding that the current wording of the bill does preclude indirect investment in cluster weapons? Perhaps that could have some bearing on the way in which the courts interpret future actions which are brought to bear.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:37):  The bill gives effect to the convention in Australian law and is guided and limited by the convention. The bill provides that a person or entity commits an offence if they intentionally assist, encourage or induce a person or entity to develop or produce cluster munitions. This offence would, for example, apply to a person who intentionally provides financial assistance to an entity so that the entity can develop or produce a cluster munition. However, accidental or innocent acts of assistance, encouragement or inducement will not fall within the offences in the bill.


For example, the person who contributes to a superannuation fund which includes investments in companies that may develop or produce cluster munitions would not fulfil the elements of the offence in the bill. The offences in the bill utilise the criminal code standard fault element of intention. The standard fault element should be applied unless there is a reason to depart from it.

There are battalions of folk who are better equipped to manage those sorts of questions in due course. What I can do here, and what I have done, is to articulate our policy and the fact that what we have before this Senate is legislation that keeps faith with the convention. Our view is that you are trying to accomplish certain policy ends that are not found in the convention, and which we say are outside the gamut of this legislation as a consequence.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:38):  So I can invest in a shell company that does not manufacture cluster weapons but owns entities that do, and the minister somehow wants us to believe that that is in keeping with the spirit of the convention? It is not—it is just not. I am not sure that there is any value either in asking anybody who might still be listening to this debate to pursue this any further, because I think that on the key question the minister has been unable to comfort us—that I can invest in a company that has nothing to do with cluster munitions apart from the fact that it owns a subsidiary entity that does manufacture them, but that will not be in breach of this bill. Why even bother having investment criteria in here? As ACSI pointed out—and these are the people in the industry who know exactly how this game works—the bill as drafted has no practical effect because we do not invest in companies that directly manufacture these weapons, we are investing in the entities that own them as subsidiaries. On that, this bill is silent.


Unless the minister has anything to add, my take away from this debate is that the provisions as drafted will have no practical effect at all. That is certainly what the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors believe. The minister has given us no evidence this afternoon that they are incorrect. If the minister has had nothing further to say, that is fine—I will let the chair put the question to the chamber.




The ACTING TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  The question is that Greens amendment (2), to insert subsection (2A) into 72.38(2) in schedule 1, item 1 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:47):  I suspect that this will be among the least controversial of the amendments that the Greens have proposed to this bill and it is also one with which I have the least issue. This is simply a technical amendment. The Greens amendment here is section 2239 of the bill which is about the acquisition and retention was raised by the minister in terms of what stockpiles the ADF can hold. What we are seeking to do is ensure that the minimum number of munitions are held by Australia that is absolutely necessary for training purposes. 


The text of the bill currently reads that the minister may authorise in writing specified members of the ADF or other specified Commonwealth public officials to acquire or retain cluster munitions for one or more of the following purposes. The Greens amendment simply adds the words 'minimum number' and 'absolutely necessary'. So I will make very clear at this point that this part of the bill proposes that we could acquire cluster munitions that have the Greens support. I have seen at our Minhad air base in the UAE, with ADF personnel showing a visiting party of rather naive MPs from the other side of the world exactly what this could do to people, how it sounds when they go off, how they are incorporated into improvised explosive devices and how we can protect the local population and of course our own troops in the field from these horrific weapons, so I can understand the requirement for training purposes. We are not proposing to modify the list of reasons we might retain the things. We recognise that they are not for deployment and that that is not the intention of this part of the bill.


Nonetheless I think these amendments still have merit. The words 'minimum number' and 'absolutely necessary' provide very clear and explicit guidelines. We are not going to propose buying crate loads of these materials. We are holding onto, as I think the minister expressed in the debate last night, a handful of legacy weapons, many left over from the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and a handful of newer weapons simply to familiarise our forces going into Afghanistan or elsewhere with what these weapons can do and what they look like.


I commend this amendment to the Senate on the understanding that we are not seeking here to modify the basic premise of this part of the bill but simply to provide a hard and fast cap to reduce any residual ambiguity that this is for anything other than training purposes.


I move amendment (3):


(3)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 18 and 19), omit ""to acquire or retain specified cluster munitions"", substitute ""to acquire or retain the minimum number of cluster munitions absolutely necessary"".

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:50):  The government does not support the proposed amendment as we believe it is not necessary to include this requirement in the legislation. Article 9 of the convention allows state parties to take legal, administrative or other measures to implement the convention including the creation of regulations. The government intends to reflect the minimum number requirements in regulations that we believe are an appropriate way to implement the convention. The regulations will reflect the requirement of the convention that the amount of explosive submunitions retained or required by a state party shall not exceed the number absolutely necessary for the purposes permitted in the convention and, Senator, you have spoken to those. 


Factors that must be taken into account in decision making, such as the minimum number requirement, can be included in regulations rather than legislation. Proposed subsection 72393 states that regulations may prescribe the requirements relating to authorisation by the minister under subsection 72392. The regulations will reflect the requirement in paragraph 6 of article 3 of the convention that the amounts of explosive munitions retained or acquired by a state party shall not exceed the minimum number absolutely necessary for the purposes permitted in the convention. As you have said, Senator, those purposes are the development of and training in cluster munitions detection, clearance or destruction techniques and the development of cluster munitions countermeasures. These permitted purposes are the same purposes for which an authorisation can be granted under section 7239 of the bill.

 (Western Australia) (13:52):  I commend this amendment to the chamber. 



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (3) on sheet 7084 moved by Senator Ludlam be agreed to. 


Question negatived. 



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Ludlam, do you wish to proceed with amendment (4)? 




Senator LUDLAM:
  Chair, I certainly do. I can think of nothing that I would rather do. I move amendment (4): 


(4)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 7), at the end of section 72.39, add:


(6)   The Minister must submit an annual report to the Secretary General of the United Nations for each calendar year during which cluster munitions are retained or acquired under subsection (2) or transferred under subsection 72.40(1).


(7)   A report under subsection (6) must include, but is not limited to, information on:


   (a)   in the case of cluster munitions retained or acquired under subsection (2):


   (i)   the proposed purpose or purposes for which the cluster munitions have been acquired or retained;


   (ii)   the type, quantity and lots numbers of cluster munitions that have been acquired or retained;


   (iii)   if the cluster munitions have been used for a purpose—the purpose for which the cluster munitions have been used; and


   (b)   in the case of cluster munitions transferred under subsection 72.40(1):


   (i)   the name of the party to which the cluster munitions have been transferred;


   (ii)   the type, quantity and lots numbers of cluster munitions that have been transferred.


(8)   A report under subsection (6) must be submitted by 30 April of the following year.


This amendment is also effectively a technical amendment and will go to amendments (5) and (6), I suspect, after question time, which go to the deeper substantive issues of why we would allow the ADF to continue to plan and conduct missions in which these weapons were used and then again in amendment (6), which relates to transit and stockpiling of these weapons on Australian soil. 


Amendment (4), however, simply goes to our belief that the minister should submit an annual report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that details the matters which we were referring to just before. So the minister or his or her delegate under this amendment would be required to submit a report annually to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for each year in which cluster munitions are retained, acquired or transferred by no later than 30 April of the following year. This report, we believe, should include information on the planned and actual use, type, quantity and lot numbers of cluster munitions acquired or retained under the subsection. 


Minister, this is nothing more nor less, in my view, than simply modelling best practice. This is modelling good behaviour. Each state party and those non-state parties that are eventually brought within the ambit of the convention should be encouraged to have precisely this practice. I suspect that long after all state parties have joined this convention and long after these weapons have been banned from the arsenals of the world—and we all, I think, look forward to that day—there will still be in places like Afghanistan, Laos, Vietnam and across former battlefields in Africa and elsewhere tens and hundreds of thousands of these weapons scattered about and there will still be a requirement for defence forces and mine-clearing personnel to retain stockpiles of these weapons. This is something that is going to have to remain in perpetuity. So I understand why we will need to retain very small numbers of these weapons for training purposes, but I believe we should get into the practice now of modelling best practice behaviour, which means accurate reporting to the S-G of the United Nations about exactly what stockpiles we are holding and why. If that practice is reflected in those of other states party to the convention, I think we will all be better off. I commend this amendment to the chamber.

(5)   Schedule 1, item 1, page 6 (lines 7 to 31), omit section 72.41, substitute:


72.41  Defence—participation by Australians in military cooperation with countries not party to Convention on Cluster Munitions


      A person who is an Australian citizen, is a member of the Australian Defence Force or is performing services under a Commonwealth contract does not commit an offence against section 72.38 by merely participating in military cooperation or operations with a foreign country that is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.


Note 1:   A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this section: see subsection 13.3(3).


Note 2:   The expression offence against section72.38 is given an extended meaning by subsections 11.2(1) and 11.2A(1), section 11.3 and subsection 11.6(2).


Note 3:   This section relates to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 21 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.


This amendment quite clearly goes to what is probably the most flawed part of the bill. Amendment (5) fixes—I do not even know if 'loophole' is an accurate term—a structural sabotaging of the very intent of the convention that we are designing this legislation to enact. So I think calling it a loophole is simply too generous. Calling it a loophole would allow you to imagine that perhaps it was inadvertent and that it had got in there by mistake, and we now know that that is clearly not the case. 


The section this amendment seeks to fix allows Australian troops to actively assist countries that have not signed up to the convention to deploy and use these munitions. This occurred in Iraq when the convention did not exist in 2003, and we have discussed that extensively. I would be interested to know whether anybody in the department has bothered to chase up any of the questions I put on notice last night about the weapons platforms that the United States government uses to put these weapons into the field, because that will be helpful information when we come to debating the amendments around stockpiling and transit. But, in particular, I put some specific questions through you, Minister, last night about whether F18 pilots flew close support missions for US ground forces that were using cluster weapons against civilian populations. I would invite the minister now, as the clock runs down towards question time, to address whether he knows that is the case or not.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:57):  As I said, Senator, as we commenced today, those are issues on which I have undertaken to get back to you. We have taken those questions on notice. Of course, I guess a nuanced but important one is that we would not say, and I suspect you would not say, that they were used against civilian populations. But as to how and when they were used in the course of 2003, we are awaiting advice. 


With respect to your amendment more broadly, the proposed amendment is intended to replace the interoperability defence currently found in the bill and, as a consequence, the government does not support the proposed amendment. We talked a lot last night and today about that interoperability defence. The government does not consider that the defence that applies to mere participation accurately gives effect to the convention. Such an amendment would therefore be inconsistent with the purpose of the bill, which is of course to give effect to that convention. The convention does not prohibit mere participation or unintended or inadvertent participation in acts by a non-state party that would be prohibited to a state party. The bill uses the same language as the convention—a point I keep making because it should engender your confidence in the bill—to ensure that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law. Further, the term 'mere participation' is not defined and would be subject to interpretation. Creating a defence for mere participation ignores the limitations placed by the convention on the kinds of activities that can be undertaken in the course of military cooperation in operations with countries not party to the convention. 


Creating a defence or mere participation also risks removing criminal liability for a broader range of conduct than is permitted by the convention. Again, I say the bill uses the same language as the convention to ensure that the bill accurately reflects the provisions found in the convention and reflects international agreement on the prohibition of cluster munitions.

 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to her answer to a question from Senator Cormann yesterday in which she compared carbon pricing in Europe with that in Australia. Is the minister aware that under the European Union's ETS the EU expects to impose a 1,974 million tonnes of carbon cap on emissions in 2013? At current market prices of A$9.10 per tonne, the value of these permits would be $18 billion. Given that there are 512 million people in countries covered by the EU's ETS, this means that Europeans will pay just $35 per person in carbon taxes in 2013. In contrast, Labor expects to raise $7.7 billion in revenue from the sale of permits this financial year, equating to $340 per Australian. Does the minister accept that, in per person terms, Australia's carbon tax is at least nine times bigger than Europe's ETS?

For instance, yesterday she compared us to Norway, which gets 98 per cent of its electricity from hydro, and with Sweden and Switzerland, which get 40 per cent of their electricity from nuclear? How does the minister defend her comparison to countries that are so unlike Australia, or is she proposing that we make new dams or build nuclear power plants?

 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:05):  I have a further supplementary question, Mr President. I refer to the fact that the regional greenhouse gas initiative in the United States has just raised $6 per person for the year. The New Zealand government has forecast carbon revenues of less than $35 per person in 2012. China expects any carbon price to start below $2 a tonne. Can the minister name any country in the world which raises anywhere near $340 per person that Australia does, or are we just going to be stuck with the biggest carbon tax in the world?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  I certainly accept that the most expensive climate policy on offer is that which Senator Joyce supports, which is $1,300 per household every year—$1,300 every year in more tax as a result of the cost of your policy. So if the senator really cares about per capita or per household costs, perhaps he should explain to the electors—it is not New England, is it; whichever one he is going to get eventually in his mind—why it is that he supports a policy that will cost them more.




Senator Joyce:
  Mr President, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question is: does the minister accept in per person terms that Australia's carbon tax is at least nine times bigger than Europe's ETS? That is the question for the minister for sending people to Manus Island and Nauru.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I do draw the minister's attention to the question. The minister has one minute 20 seconds remaining.




Senator WONG:
  I know there is a lot of sookiness with the blokes on that side who do not like any scrutiny of their policy failure. Every time we mention the fact that their policy will cost more, they want to jump up and say, 'That is not relevant to the debate.' Well, the debate is about how you get to five per cent; that is the debate. We on this side have an economically responsible policy with tax cuts and additional benefits through the pension and family tax benefits system, all of which you oppose. You want to impose a higher cost on the economy, a higher cost on pensioners, a higher cost on families through your policy. In terms of the international situation, I would invite Senator Joyce to read the recent report from the Climate Commission which has been released, which concludes that 90 countries representing 90 per cent of the global economy have committed to reduce their carbon pollution and have policies in place to achieve their reduction. Many of these countries rely on a market-based mechanism and by next year around 850 million people will be living in a country, state or city with an emissions trading scheme, including countries like the UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland. Those are the relevant international facts. I know that Senator Joyce does not want to acknowledge that. (Time expired)

That is the reality. That is the highest cost scheme on the planet.




Senator Joyce:
  Mr President, on a point of order on relevance. I have directly asked the question: can the minister name any country in the world that is going to pay more than $340 per person per year? I can understand why she would be upset with the National Party having its say. After all, from the Left of the doormats of the Labor Party, I can understand why she would be upset.

  Order! That is now debating it. There is no point of order. The minister has 27 seconds remaining.

  I do not accept the senator's figures. If he wants to go down the per capita route then he would know that we are also the highest per capita emitter of any advanced economy in the world.

He studied under an AusAID scholarship at the Australian National University. The Prime Minister's visit comes directly after my visit to the Solomon Islands last weekend.


I was pleased to see the progress that Solomon Islands has made. With the help of RAMSI—the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands—since 2003 we have seen domestic revenue collected by the Solomon Islands government grow at an annual approximate average of 20 per cent between 2006 and 2011, allowing essential services to continue. There has been improved debt sustainability, measured by debt to GDP ratio, from 23 per cent to 18 per cent, seeing it well below the accepted benchmark of 30 per cent. Over 2,500 public servants have trained in the last three years in better administration and financial management. The country is stable, the economy is growing, people's lives are getting better—this could be a description of Australia under the present government. I know that is the view the opposition is forming as I rehearse these encouraging figures—and many challenges remain, but the Solomon Islands and its people have more opportunities and brighter prospects for its future.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:05):  


I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by Senators Birmingham, Edwards and Back today relating to the carbon tax and to the live export of cattle to Indonesia.


In listening to Senator Wong, the Prime Minister and everybody in the government at present I have to say that I am starting to wonder a few things about the carbon tax package. I am starting to wonder why there is any so-called compensation attached to the carbon tax package at all. I am starting to wonder, when I look at the budget papers and see that they claim that the carbon tax will generate billions of dollars annually in revenue, how that is the case and whether there is in fact a gigantic mistake in the budget papers. When I listen to the Prime Minister, when I listen to Minister Wong and when I listen to ministers or members across this government, I am left with the impression that the carbon tax has no impact at all. I am left with the impression that it is not having any cost impact anywhere on anything. It seems that every time a question is asked all we hear from the government—all we hear from the Prime Minister, from Minister Combet, from Minister Wong or from anyone else—is that the price rises are the fault of the states. These price rises are all the fault of the networks. It is all the fault of anything else except, of course, the government's own carbon tax.


We know that this is just a falsehood. We know that the government is misleading the Australian people through this claim, through this pretence that all cost rises are somehow the result of anything other than the carbon tax. How do we know this? We know it because we have the facts to demonstrate it. We have the facts, and those facts stem originally from the government's own Treasury modelling, modelling that demonstrated the carbon tax would cause a nine per cent rise on electricity prices and that would then be felt with further increases over subsequent years. Has that modelling proven to be true? By and large it has. How do we know that? Because we have the facts of what has happened state-by-state to electricity prices since the carbon tax.


We know that in New South Wales, yes, prices have gone up 18.1 per cent. It is correct to say that is not all attributable to the carbon tax, but 8.9 per cent of that increase is attributable to the carbon tax. So because of Labor's carbon tax, power prices in New South Wales are now 8.9 per cent higher and they of course will keep going up and up and up with the carbon tax. We know that in Queensland the estimate is that of the 13.1 per cent increase in electricity prices, 11 per cent of that is attributable to the carbon tax. So Queenslanders are paying 11 per cent more on their electricity bills as a result of the carbon tax. We know that Western Australians are paying 9.1 per cent more. People here in the ACT, they are paying 14.2 per cent extra on their electricity bills as a result of the latest carbon tax. The state with the smallest increase in electricity prices as a result of the carbon tax is my home state. In South Australia, the carbon tax has only just pushed prices up, apparently, by about 4.6 per cent. Why? Because we already had the highest electricity prices in the country. We already were more dependent on wind and higher cost sources of energy to start with, and that means that we still have the highest prices in the country.


So for all that we hear from those opposite—and from Minister Wong, as we did today in question time, where she tries to pretend carbon tax or electricity price rises are somebody else's fault—the evidence is speaking for itself. The government's modelling has been correct. People are facing a 10 per cent price rise across the board as a result of the carbon tax. Whether it is sporting clubs, as I asked the minister about today, whether it is pubs or clubs generally, whether it is small businesses—none of them get any compensation. The minister could not identify a single club or a small business today that was receiving any compensation as a result of these price rises, but all of them are facing real price rises.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  I too would like to contribute to this debate today, this motion to take note of answers in question time, and put to rest some of the outrageous claims made in particular by Senator Birmingham and Senator Edwards. It is disappointing to see those two South Australian senators continue on the scare campaign which has been perfected by their leader, Mr Abbott. I see they have joined the parade around the country where Mr Abbott talks down the economy, where he talks down the jobs that are being created in Australia by this government and where he frightens people into believing that pretty soon we are going to have Armageddon. Last time I looked, Whyalla was still there and doing pretty well.


The opposition neglect to tell the people of Australia the whole story of the policy of tackling climate change. They certainly forget to tell the people of Australia that they too actually believe in reducing harmful carbon emissions and that they have a policy to do that and to achieve exactly the same targets in reducing carbon emissions that the federal government has. They went to the last election with that policy as well. It is just that they have a different way of going about it. Their way of going about it is to slug every household in Australia with a bill of $1,300 for their ridiculous and inefficient direct action plan. It is very disappointing that Senator Birmingham, who used to be a moderate in this place, has turned to the dark side when it comes to tackling climate change. He has to spout the position of his leader, which we know he probably does not really believe.


The opposition is also pretty good at neglecting to tell Australians that in fact we are in good shape here, compared to other countries. Senator Wong said in one of her answers today that under this government 800,000 new jobs have been created in Australia under this government. There are record investments in the pipeline in Australia, particularly in mining and especially in our home state of South Australia. We have low unemployment and we are on track to return the budget to a surplus. These are things that we should be proud of; we should not be talking them down.


The opposition also do not tell Australians the real story of why electricity prices are increasing. We know that average electricity bills went up by 50 per cent in the last four years—before the carbon price. The most important driver of power prices going up is investment in network infrastructure. And now every consumer, for every $100 you pay on your power bill, $51 of that is to go towards the cost of infrastructure. And, yes, that is because state governments have neglected to build infrastructure. And we could probably go back through the history of South Australia and pinpoint the time when the Liberals privatised electricity as when infrastructure was not built because of the privatised system. And now our state governments are having to play catch up in that space.


Treasury modelling shows that under a carbon price there will of course be a moderate increase to the cost of living for average households and small businesses. We have never hidden that fact. We have put in compensatory mechanisms to deal with that fact, including an average increase in household payments of $10.10 per week, which is to outstrip the $3.30 average increase in a household bill. We also put in place lots of mechanisms to assist small businesses to deal with the increased cost from the price on carbon, and that includes the $6½ thousand instant asset write-off, which I can tell you is very popular in small businesses that I talk to around the place. I remind Australia's small businesses that they can make a claim for that asset write-off for every asset purchase that they make.


We also know that power cuts are quite a small component of the average small business costs. But in this whole debate we should not forget the reason for the carbon price is so that the big polluters—less than 500 or so companies in—pay for polluting. Yes, they will pass on some of those costs and the government has acknowledged that and put in place numerous mechanisms to offset the small costs that are passed on down the line. It would be nice if the federal opposition told the truth instead of continuing the scaremongering campaign that they have waged ad nauseam. Australians are beginning to understand that they are dealing with people who fail to tell the truth. (Time expired)

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:15):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong. In one of her answers she made reference to the inaugural appearance of my colleague Senator Birmingham on Q&A last night. I must say that, when she awarded Senator Birmingham's performance a second to that of Senator Cameron, I was astounded because if you had not been a participant in the Australian political race or an observer of it you would not have known whether Senator Birmingham had two of his other parliamentary colleagues sitting alongside of him in Senator Cameron and former minister in a Labor government Graham Richardson. I thought they all put in a very good performance in a great critique of this current Labor government. On that basis I thank Senator Birmingham for his leadership in that debate on the ABC.


I do also concur with Senator Birmingham's remarks asking where this mysterious $7.8 billion is going to come from. We ask questions of the Labor Party or the Minister representing the Minister for Energy and Climate Change about where it is going to come from. Apparently it is not going to come from anybody, but we are going to have this compensation package which is going to fix anything anyway. Every time we ask a question about Pete's Fish Farm or the Blair Hotel or the clubs in South Australia or Western Australia or Queensland, we hear it is just going to be fixed with assistance. I notice that there was reference to 300,000 pensioners getting compensation but no reference at all the clubs of those community organisations which rely so heavily on the energy costs. There is the fact that the impact of rising energy costs—which we all acknowledge by your very own modelling, as Senator Birmingham quite rightly pointed out—varies from state to state but is a massive impost on small business.


The jig is up. I reckon Robert Gottliebsen belled the cat this morning in his 10:49 AM article, 'Why the carbon tax does not work'. He refers to:


A group of Nobel laureates and other top experts who combined to form the Copenhagen Consensus believe that the world's emphasis on emissions reductions by carbon pricing and similar mechanisms is simply not going to work. They propose a cheaper but more radical global solution.


The Labor Party and their policymakers should listen to that. The article goes on:


The Copenhagen consensus was formed in Denmark to bring together top global knowledge to determine the best way to allocate funds to solve particular problems.


Gottliebsen says of the group:


When it comes to carbon, they concluded that because electricity had become essential to the current living standards of a vast number of people on the globe, simply pricing electricity at higher levels would not make an enormous difference to usage. 


They said this in reference to people trying to climb out of their poverty:


They concluded that the most economic way to reduce global poverty was to make sure that pre-school children have sufficient nutrition. Without pre-school nutrition, adult capabilities are greatly reduced and they are much less productive members of the community.


This is a big issue for those on the other side and I do not hear it acknowledged at all. We need energy. This is sort of the carrot and stick approach except the government has the stick. I commend the report to everybody. They conclude by summarising that standards of living will be increased with the use of energy. However, we need to do development and research for better ways of renewable energy rather than to tax out of existence what we have. 


Just in reference to Senator Wong's other answers, she talked about the tax cuts and the asset write-offs and the carryback of losses. I can guarantee you in my business experience a one per cent tax cut on a business that is not making any money. Pete's Fish Farm at Kalangadoo is not making any money. (Time expired)

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:20):  I was not going to mention it, but I did not see Q&A last night and I am sure the senators in this place did their parties proud. I had something far more important to do than watch Q&A. I had to sort out my sock drawer.


I rise to take note of a question from Senator Back to Minister Ludwig. I heard the comment, 'What would he know, he is a vet?' I do have admiration for Senator Back. I work closely with him when he is dishing it up to me as I am walking out of the chamber as he did the other day quite fairly. You got one in for free, Senator Back--through you Mr Deputy President—but we will have the chance to square the ledger somewhere along the line.


In terms of the live export trade, I do stand in this building as a very proud senator for Western Australia. Those who do know my whereabouts—and hopefully not as many as I think might—know that I proudly haunt the Kimberley. At every opportunity I am in the Kimberley. Whether it be in the west or the east, the live export trade is very topical. Live cattle and beef are the main industry in the Kimberley. It is not the only part of Western Australia for those who might not know. There is also the Pilbara. 


I also know that when the live export ban was on and the Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee conducted a number of inquiries around the Top End of Australia and also one here, in Canberra, I made sure that I was in Broome to hear from the pastoralists—not only the Kimberley pastoralists and the Pilbara pastoralists but also the 22 Kimberley Aboriginal pastoralists—who were affected. They have their own little association, headed by Billy Lawford from Bohemia Downs. I know the drama that the ban on the live export trade created. 


I honestly say, with my hand on my heart, that I know the pain that it would have given the minister to have to put that ban on. But let us just talk about that ban—the ban that lasted a month. Yes, it did get everyone jumping who had an interest in live export, and they are not only the pastoralists but also others who rely on cattle for a living. They are the numerous truckies, trucking companies, truck drivers, auto electricians, tyre suppliers, fencing suppliers and local shops in those regional and rural towns, as well as a host of other businesses. Let me talk about this from the west Kimberley perspective—the towns of Broome and Derby. People think that Broome is bubbling. It is the dry season, which is normally the height of the tourist season. Tourism is really suffering. Trust me: they are suffering. The high Australian dollar is making it very hard for them. But I also have to tell you, Mr Deputy President—and I know that Senator Back will back me on this—the pearling industry is all but defunct there. They are struggling. So the live export of cattle is very important. 


I think the way that everyone has jumped on the government has been unfair. Let us take a couple of steps back to what I call the 'shocking behaviour' on behalf of Animals Australia and the RSPCA—and I will tell you why. It was right of them to bring to the attention of the government the mistreatment of animals, but they sat on that information for months. For months and months, they sat on it. If they had been fair dinkum, they would have been in here that quick that they would have burnt the carpet trying to get to the minister's office. 


I stand in support of the live cattle industry, but I would much rather see a more active boxed-meat industry. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to go back to my old trucking days when there was an abattoir in Kununurra, an abattoir in Wyndham, an abattoir in Broome and an abattoir in Derby. There was also one, but not for cattle, in Carnarvon. And I also think Port Hedland might have had some activity around there. I remember all those meatworkers and businesses that relied on the live export cattle trade. 


I fully stand shoulder to shoulder with the government on its decision to put the ban on because we had to lift our standards. There are no ifs or buts about it. When I was at the PGA conference in Broome in June, I said that it would have been lovely if we could have done it without having to put a ban on. The sad reality is that we had to put the ban on. We had to lift the treatment of animals in Indonesia to world-class standards. I understand that the Indonesians have put some pressure on Australian growers. But I can tell you from the PGA in Broome that they are confident that their export figures will return to pre-ban days. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  I thank Senator Sterle for the support he gave the industry last year. Had he not given it such support, the industry might not have been returned quite so quickly. But I do remind Senator Sterle again that I did write to the minister in the days before he made the decision to suspend the trade, and I invited the opportunity to speak with him at length so that he could avert doing that. 


But the matter of greatest concern to me today is that, when I put my questions to Senator Ludwig, whose answers I wish to take note of today, I was raising with him matters of enormous concern to biosecurity in this country. Only yesterday did he answer a dorothy dixer from Senator Moore in which he very proudly spoke of his role in protecting biosecurity in this country. When I raised with him the very real threats of a return of foot-and-mouth disease to Indonesia and, subsequently, to this country and the possibility of a return to this country of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, a disease that took us some 130 years to eradicate, all he could come back and say to me was 'a scare campaign'. This is the minister who has responsibility to the Australian community for one of our most important industries. 


The third highest revenue export income earning industry for this country is agriculture. For Minister Ludwig to stand up here and claim this side of the house, and particularly me, a veterinarian of some 40 years' experience, has no interest in biosecurity or in animal welfare matters is a deep insult to me. It is an absolutely deep insult to me. I raised with him the question of whether or not he is aware and can he confirm that beef is being illegally repackaged as 'product of Australia' and being brought into Indonesia from India—a country which is rife with foot-and-mouth disease and, indeed, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. The only retort he could give back to me was that he regarded that as a scare campaign. 


Let me debunk, if I can, a theory which was put around this time last year about the live export trade, which is that, if the live export trade were discontinued in any country of any type, it would be replaced with chilled or frozen—in other words, boxed meat. We know from our experience with Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, when we lost the live export trade of sheep to Saudi Arabia for political purposes, there was a concurrent drop-off and cessation of boxed beef and sheepmeat sales to Saudi Arabia. I will have more to say about Saudi Arabia in coming days. 


What we see evidence of at this very time is that the Indonesians are punishing Australia because of the act by Senator Ludwig in suspending the supply of protein to low socioeconomic Indonesian families last year. The reprisals are many. We see the reprisals, do we not, in the attitude of the Indonesians towards our attempts to solve the asylum seeker problem. We see it in the efforts of the Indonesian government now to accept the notion of accepting beef from the United States. This is a market that is on our doorstep. Would the Americans be keen to get into the Indonesia trade? Of course they would. Do we have a freight advantage? Yes, we do. But what is going to happen now as a direct result of the insult visited upon Indonesia following the actions of Senator Ludwig? These were actions that he did not need to take, I emphasise. We have a circumstance now in which the number of live cattle has been reduced this year to 283,000 animals—this is down from 770,000 in 2009. At the same time, we are also see a halving of the amount of boxed chilled beef going into Indonesia. This is exactly in line with what we saw Saudi Arabia do years ago.


As I have raised the point, another country that Indonesian government ministers have said they will seek to import beef from is Brazil. Not all of Brazil has foot-and-mouth disease. There are so-called foot-and-mouth-disease-free zones. But we know that the leakage of movement of live cattle from foot-and-mouth-disease zones into zones which are free of foot-and-mouth-disease are very wide and loose. I repeat the fear which has been expressed by the veterinary profession and throughout the community that if we end up accepting beef from those countries into Indonesia, those diseases will return to Indonesia, and with our porous borders we will end up with them in Australia.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:49):  What is it about the Australian Labor Party and this government? The implementation of the Gonski review says more about the Labor Party and indeed the Labor government than I ever wanted to know. Listening this afternoon to my old friend Senator Kim Carr in question time answered any unresolved questions I had about Labor and education. They have still learned nothing from the past, sadly. They are still fighting—as Senator Carr is—the class warfare of post World War II Australia, still believing that behind every little Catholic primary school lurks a King's School or a Geelong Grammar and still believing that only wealthy Australians send their children to non-government schools. The Australian Labor Party still believe that, and of course they are wrong.


The Labor Party are wrong, Mr Deputy President, but you know about my generosity with the Australian Labor Party. I am prepared to forgive the fact that their history is very poor. They do not understand history; they have never understood it. But what I cannot bear about the government is their total failure to implement their own policies effectively. As an amateur historian I forgive them, but as a legislator I am afraid I cannot forgive them. They have failed.


This government has handled the Gonski review appallingly. Its approach has been incompetent and chaotic. The soft spot for this government over the last five years has been the implementation of its own policies—the failure to effectively implement. We have witnessed everything, of course, from the NBN to pink batts. It has been a shambles. In fact, sometimes it has been an expensive and a very deadly shambles. But let us not go there this afternoon, because I am not in the mood for it. I could recite all those horrors, but I shall spare the chamber this afternoon.


However, I will not spare the chamber a couple of the horrors from my area of education. Senator Carr spoke about education, I concede, with passion this afternoon and a certain amount of belligerent eloquence. In fact, the implementation of Labor's education policies has been a shambles. It started off with computers in schools with Mr Rudd saying before the 2007 election that laptops will be the toolboxes of the 21st century. Actually it was not a bad idea, but the implementation was a shambles. What happened? The government discovered that in fact they did not have the money. They had not assessed the actual cost of the computers and the necessary infrastructure. The scheme was totally underfunded. In the end, of course, Labor state governments and parents and teachers of non-government schools had to come to the party. 


That was the first one, the beginning of the education shambles. So much for the revolution. In the end, the Commonwealth had to spend twice as much money as it thought it would. Five years later, this year I asked at budget estimates about it, and I was told that only eight out of 2,650 high schools have been connected by the Commonwealth to high-speed fibre broadband, which was at the heart of the government's promise. So much for the Rudd government's education revolution. 


Then we had the national curriculum, and that was a shambles. Why? First of all, it was heavily politicised. Sadly, too many of those on the cultural left politicised the national curriculum. Not a good idea, not very clever. But even forgetting that, because I am in a good mood, what happened? The implementation became a shambles. There have been numerous delays. What was supposed to happen? On the face of it, a national curriculum was not a bad idea, but a few years on it was put back again because the state governments thought, 'This might actually be bad for our kids. This curriculum is not a positive.' In fact, the former New South Wales state Labor government thought the national curriculum was a step back for the schoolchildren of New South Wales. Again, another shambles. 


What is the granddaddy education shambles of them all? The Building the Education Revolution—who could ever forget what a total shambles that was? Let's just face it: the school halls that were built by state governments cost somewhere between 30 and 50 per cent more than equivalent buildings constructed by independent or Catholic schools. That is an indictment. Those school halls cost from 30 to 50 per cent more than they would have if they had been built by independent schools or by Catholic schools. That is a disgrace. 


What is even worse is that, finally, the Auditor-General said that the bureaucracy, the Commonwealth Public Service, did not have the oversight mechanisms, the wherewithal and the expertise to assess whether the value for money was good. The Public Service did not know whether the Commonwealth was getting good value for money. That, in a sense, was the heart of the entire problem. But, today, my friend Senator Carr said, 'There has been an education revolution.' 


We have spent something like $1½ billion of taxpayers' money more than we should have on school halls. We spent billions more on computers and on the national curriculum—somewhere around $20 billion. What has been the outcome of the education revolution? Our test results internationally have gone backwards—$20 billion on the education revolution and our scores internationally have gone backwards. I call that an education devolution. All that money and the test results have gone backwards. But apparently I am a doomsayer. 'It will all be okay because Mr Gonski and the Gonski review will fix it all.' That is what I am now told. 


You would think that the government would have done some modelling, wouldn't you, Deputy President, about the effect that the Gonski model would have on schools? At budget estimates, I asked the government for their modelling. 'Have they done any modelling?' They had not done it for the BER, but I thought they may have done it for Gonski. Guess what? I was told that they had not done any modelling about the effect of Gonski on the 10,000 schools in this country—no modelling at all. Now, we know why no modelling was done. The government are very cunning, but we know why. It is because there is a new hit list—3,254 schools will be worse off, one-third of Australia's total number of schools. Of those 3,254 schools, more than two-thirds are government schools.




Senator Thorp:
  Rubbish.




Senator MASON:
  Yes, they are. Over 2,330 of those 3,254 schools are government schools. Two-thirds of those schools are government schools and they will be worse off. So much for the rhetoric and the pandering today from Senator Carr, my old friend. Most of those schools are government schools. How much worse off on average will they be? Mr Deputy President, I will tell you, just between you and me, each of those schools will on average be half a million dollars worse off. That is what this government will do to government schools.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Mason is misleading the Senate. I ask you to call him to order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point, Senator Collins. Senator Mason.




Senator MASON:
  Mr Deputy President, you might ask why the government went down the road of the Gonski review. I will tell you why. Ever since the Menzies government believed that the Commonwealth should aid Catholic and independent schools, the Labor Party have been driven by a pathetic class envy and an ideological vengeance. They do not like the idea of government supporting non-government schools, even though without it the taxpayer will be far worse off. Most of the schools the Commonwealth government supports are systemic, poorer Catholic schools, and it is time the Australian Labor Party learnt that.


They have never got over the fact. Most are not Kings, Geelong Grammar or anything like it. In the past we have had to put up with Mr Latham's hit list—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Where did you go to school, Brett?




Senator MASON:
  and now we have a new, far more sophisticated hit list made up of 3,200 schools, two thirds of which are government schools, and everyone should be afraid.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:00):  Senator Mason is completely shameless this afternoon. To think that we could be in here having this debate and he could be talking to us about Catholic systemic schools! Let me remind the Senate that this is the 50th anniversary of the school aid debate, which happened down the road in Goulburn, and we have been celebrating the victory of it ever since. It was all about funding schools.


This matter of public importance that we are debating today indicates quite a lot about the sense of confusion and disarray that the opposition is in about the Gonski report. Of the messages that have come out this week, on the one hand we had the shadow spokesperson saying that the opposition will not support but repeal the Gonski recommendations and any legislation that is put in place and, on the other hand, we had the Leader of the Opposition yesterday telling the independent schools not only that public schools were funded enough but also that if there was any injustice it was against private and systemic schools. Let us see if we can get some kind of sense coming from the opposition on what has been an extraordinary debate.


When we think about Australia as a knowledge nation, let us give credit to those eminent people who contributed to the Gonski review. That was a serious attempt, 40 years after the Karmel report, to transform our education sector and to ensure that we have an education system that will work for children into the future. As for the notion that this is only about funding, if we go to the model of funding what does the Gonski review say? It says that the Howard government's SES model for funding private schools based on their SES as determined by the census data was flawed, and it was widely criticised because around half of the non-government schools received more than they would otherwise have been entitled to, leaving ordinary Australian taxpayers about $800 a year out of pocket. The Gonski review and the critique of the report say that the Gonski model is far more attentive to the needs of government schools and in the spirit of public education generally than was the coalition's SES model.


Senator Mason came in here today and I honestly believe I could see his nose growing—Pinocchio, here we come! It was an outrageous abuse of the parliament to pretend—the question Senator Mason did not answer was: where did he go to school? Let us be very clear, this motion is a fear-mongering motion suggesting that there are going to be schools closed and funding to one in three Australian schools slashed. It is absolutely wrong. It is absolute rubbish. The Gonski review recognised the challenges we have in inequality of funding in our school system and made some serious responses and recommendations. We as a government have not articulated our position finally. We have said that we are looking to implement the recommendations in the interests of schools, communities, parents and learning—isn't that what schools are all about?


The whole notion that the Gonski report was a series of isolated recommendations is a nonsense. The recommendations show a significant strategy to address the challenges that we have in our schools. In the forward estimates those challenges are estimated to be about $5 billion a year. That is a serious challenge for all of us but it is a serious challenge that is about the Australian nation. It is about school reform. It is about the integration of funding between Commonwealth and state. It is about identifying what targets need to be supported where there is significant disadvantage. I would have expected Senator Mason, who is in here as a champion of schools and school education, to be supporting the Gonski reforms and recommendations knowing that teachers are out there trying to do their best. They are doing a great job but they need to be supported, and class size is probably a good place to start.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-08-21,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:05):  I am pleased to be able to stand up here and talk on this matter of public importance about one of the most important issues confronting Australia, and that is the quality of our education system. I am quite despondent about the way the debate has deteriorated so rapidly, especially over the last few weeks.


If we think about the antecedents to the Gonski review into the funding of schools in Australia, we wonder why it was tasked with the important job of having a serious overhaul of the system. That was because we knew, and have known for a significant period, that we have, essentially, an inequitable system of school funding in Australia. It is a system that has been cobbled together over time, with opportunistic, political, ad hoc decision making about how we fund our school systems. We also know—and this is probably one of the main reasons that there was an impetus to having this review take place—that performance in Australian education systems has been slipping seriously, especially in the last decade.


So it is really disingenuous, first of all, for Senator Mason to suggest that that was something the current government is responsible for. By my calculations, that was happening on Prime Minister Howard's patch. We know that since 2000 there has been a serious decline in the way Australian students are performing by international standards. Our scores on the PISA tests—the Program for International Student Assessment—have shown that where we were pretty proudly performing in literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy, over the last nine years we have seriously declined in those.


Clearly that really poses a dilemma for a nation that it is facing serious challenges in the 21st century for which we need the best educated population that we can have.


But let's go back to the Gonski review. As Senator Stephens pointed out, that is an eminent panel of people. There has been no scuttlebutt or impugning of their credentials. When the review was released publicly in February, it was generally met with great respect because there was clearly a great amount of research and erudition behind the findings of that review. In absolute good faith those people, who are all highly experienced in education and highly motivated to reform Australia's discredited education funding system, came up with what is essentially a blueprint for generational change that is based on principles of consistency and fairness. Almost unanimously the initial report was greeted with respect and great consideration. Many commentators on public education and education generally in Australia have welcomed not only the findings in that report which confirmed what many people were already concerned about but also the really clear-eyed, fair, logical proposal as to how to reform the system.


We know, as I said, that the precursors to the review were that there was concern there is an inequitable system and that our performance standards are slipping. What did the review find? The review found that there is clearly an inequitable system: that the system is broken, it is illogical, it is not transparent, it is underfunded and essentially it is unfair. The review found too that performance is indeed slipping, both internationally and within Australia. Worst of all, the review found something that is to our eternal shame, and that is why I cannot be flippant about this, even if that is the tone of the debate today. This finding is that in Australia children's opportunity to reach their full potential is nothing to do with their inherent ability; it is about the opportunity that they have, the schools they attend, and the ability of those schools to do the job that we need them to do if we are going to educate our population for this century. 


Clearly we know that there are performance gaps across Australia that are causally linked to advantage. These gaps are not linked to inherent ability. I do not buy the idea that children in particular areas that we can map are somehow less able than children who live in more advantaged areas. We actually know it is about the resources available to the schools and the schools that are available for those kids to attend. We know that children who are experiencing disadvantage are going to need additional supports at school to help them to reach their full potential. I cannot understand how anyone could argue with the basic proposition that comes out of the Gonski review, which is that we absolutely need to provide a fair, level playing field so that every single kid in Australia has the opportunity to reach their full potential. It is not only fair and right for each and every kid, it is obviously what a clever, smart and fair society would do.


I would like to go to an email that I received yesterday from a parent in Victoria that really touched me, because she was watching the debate that has been going on and spoke from the heart. In a sense, this email sums up some of the important aspects of this debate, which is knowing that the public education system still educates the vast majority of our kids and educates the vast majority of those children who are going to experience some disadvantage and some difficulty in achieving their full potential, whether it be because they are from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, they are Indigenous kids, they are being educated in remote schools, or they are children with a disability—80 per cent of children with a disability are educated in our public schools. Whatever the reason, it is clear that if we are going to fund schools on the basis of need then a significant amount of additional funding—it has been estimated we will need $5 billion or more to bring us up to less than the OECD average—is needed to go to schools on the basis of need and to those schools that are going to be looking particularly at educating kids from disadvantaged backgrounds.


The person who wrote to me said that her children attend or have attended a country college in Victoria, and her eldest daughter and son both achieved strong results in year 12 which saw them accepted into their first preferences for uni. She said: 'We have a daughter in year 9 and a son in year 6.' She has been on the school council for 12 of the last 13 years, including three years as the chairperson. In that little country school, the number of pupils in the secondary section hovers around 100 to 110. There are currently 13 students, she thinks, who have been taken out of that school to go to private boarding schools—so they have been required to board away from home. She said: 'That is over 10 per cent of our potential funding gone from both the community and the school, making it increasingly difficult for our local school to provide the breadth and depth of curriculum to the students that remain.' But she went on to say: 'Our school is exemplary. It is led by an inspiring principal who is driven by her desire for all students to have every opportunity to receive their best. They offer a wider curriculum than they should be able to, and they do this for the good of the students. We often have students achieving ATARs in the 90s, and have a high percentage of students that go on to either further study or full-time employment.'


She goes on to make the point that she understands that people have a choice and choose to send their children away because of tradition or sporting reasons, but she also raises the issue that some parents now, because of the divisive, discrediting and unseemly argument that is going on, believe that they cannot exercise a real choice by sending their kids to public schools. That is partly because public schools have been underfunded and partly because there is an attempt to divide the community, I think, and to sell an idea that to get an education now it is necessary for those who have the means to send their children away from the public education system and to private schools. She goes on to say: 'My husband and I are proud products of the public education system and we choose for our children to also be a part of this system,' because she also thinks that it is good for all the students at the school and for the community as a whole. She said that her children by going to this school learn how to learn and to value all members of society, rather than being removed from those who may be seen to be a part of the fragmentation where you end up having different classes of society being educated in different ways.


She says, 'I know my children can reach their goals with hard work and the continued support from us and the school.' I think she is a good example of someone who understands the importance of having a universal, quality public education system so that all children have the opportunity to be educated together and have the opportunity to reach their best potential. We need to get on with Gonski, so no more delay and no more division from the coalition! Let us just get on and do what Gonski has told us we know we need to do for the sake of our kids.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:14):  So yet another policy mess and policy shambles from the Labor government! It is a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks as the hits just keep on coming. Every time we turn around there is another policy disaster from this government. We all want better outcomes for students, we all support better state schools and we all support better independent schools. In a better world we would all like to see funding increased for schools right across the board. But the world under this Labor government is not in that perfect place. Gonski is a mess. It is an absolute mess. When you start looking at why it becomes absolutely crystal clear that this government has absolutely no idea. There is absolutely no detail about how this is going to work, how this is going to be implemented and where the modelling is. We are completely in the dark.


My very good colleague Senator Mason was far too modest to actually quote himself when he was discussing the questioning that he had been doing in the previous Senate estimates. I am not so modest, because it is very important that we have this on the record. Senator Mason was asking the committee what the financial impact would be of the new modelling on Australian schools—a very sensible question. We then get an interchange between him and Ms Paul, the secretary:



Ms Paul: We do not really have any results to offer at this point—


and this is at the end of May, so this is a few weeks ago—


But if you want me to take it on notice and keep you posted on it, I am happy to do so. 



Senator MASON: The department is not able to tell the committee what the financial impact of the proposed— 



Ms Paul: That is right—not at this point. That is because of the work that is still underway, which was recognised by Gonski as being unfinished work, as it were. 



Senator MASON: We should not labour the point, as it were, but that is where the rubber will hit the road, I think it is fair to say. 



Ms Paul: Absolutely. I agree with you there. 



Senator MASON: I was going to ask you to provide a breakdown of the financial impact under the proposed new modelling for all Australian schools,—


a very intelligent question—


but you have not done that. Are you going to do that? 


It gets better:



Ms Paul: In due course, I suppose.


This is just a part of an excerpt of the answers to the very good questions that Senator Mason was asking. Just a few weeks ago that is all the detail that the coalition was able to get, and it goes on in much the same vein and it is certainly in Hansard for anyone to see. That is all we could get in terms of the detail of the modelling and how this is going to work. A $6.5 billion—well, who knows?—a year program and not a single scrap of detail from the government on how it is going to work! And how is the government going to pay for it? This is $6.5 billion a year we are expecting. How much are the feds going to pay? How much are they going to expect the states to pay? I expect that the government or the Prime Minister will say: 'This is wonderful. We're going to implement it now, states. Would you mind coughing up most of the money?' They will say, 'I haven't got it.' Look at New South Wales: they are floundering after 16 years of Labor in New South Wales and they are struggling with that legacy of debt that the Labor government left them. Where are they going to come up with the money from?




Senator Mason:
  Queensland's bankrupt.




Senator NASH:
  Thank you, Senator Mason. We have got a federal government with a debt of $241 billion and a record in waste that is second to none. Perhaps if they had not wasted so much money, Senator Mason, they might be able to free up a little bit of money to put to something like education reforms. We have seen the Home Insulation Program with the pink batts with $2.5 billion mismanaged. We have seen greens loans and Green Start, with the $175 million Green Loans Program mismanaged and eventually dumped. There was the Solar Homes Program with a $850 million blow-out. The list goes on and on and on. So it is no wonder there is no money being talked about. It is no wonder  the government is not saying, 'By the way here we have got the money to do this. It's no problem at all with.' We have no idea who is going to pay for it. What is it going to do to the Treasurer's $1.5 billion wafer-thin surplus? How is it going to impact on the surplus? Schools have absolutely no certainty—none—and it is about time this government got its act together and started giving this country some decent policy. We saw the Prime Minister say this yesterday, telling the Independent Schools National Forum:


Every independent school in Australia will see their funding increase under our plan.


Thank you very much but I am not going to believe anything this Prime Minister has to say anymore. I would be far more likely to believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden and I would probably have more respect for fairies at the bottom of the garden. Senator Mason, you would well know that the PM's track record on promises is not actually that crash hot, so why should we believe the Prime Minister when she says:


Every independent school in Australia will see their funding increase under our plan.


This is a Prime Minister who said she had no plans to challenge Kevin Rudd, none at all. In May 2010 the Prime Minister was quipping to the media:



There's more chance of me becoming the full-forward for the Dog
s
 than there is of any change in the Labor Party … 


Well, that is history for you, isn't it? Then of course there was the one that everybody knows and understands very well:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


What do we have now? We have a carbon tax. So tell me, Senator Mason, what do you think? Do you think there is any chance of there being truth in this statement:


Every independent school in Australia will see their funding increase under our plan.




Senator Mason:
  No, I don't.




Senator NASH:
  I don't think anybody in this nation believes what the Prime Minister says.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Nash, could I suggest that you do direct your comments to the chair and not directly to Senator Mason.




Senator NASH:
  He is such an excellent recipient of my comments though, Mr Deputy President. Who would believe anything that the Prime Minister has to say anymore—the Australian people do not. They do not believe what the Prime Minister says. I hope she is right, I hope she is correct and I hope all the schools have a funding increase but we have absolutely no idea—




Senator Thorp:
  You're right about that!




Senator NASH:
  and we have no expectation that the government could deliver any of this. Thank you, Senator, I will take that interjection. We have no idea what the government has in store for us. We have no idea expectation that the government can even deliver this even if they turn it into some coherent policy, which it clearly is not at the moment. We only have to look at the track record of policy disasters: computers in school, the NBN, border protection, Fuelwatch, GROCERYchoice, the live export mess and the list goes on and on and on. So why would anybody have any faith or any trust that they could deliver Gonski even if they could turn it into some coherent policy—which sadly I expect they will not be able to do.


The leaked modelling on the weekend—isn't it interesting? We are told, Senator Mason, that there is no modelling, there is nothing in any form we can give you, there is nothing we can see. But, funnily enough, things just turn up, don't they?



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  What Senator Mason said earlier is absolutely right: these schools are going to be worse off. What really aggravates me and disappoints me is it is schools like this: Dubbo School, Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, Bonalbo Central, Nimbin Central, Broken Hill North, Lismore Public School, Cootamundra Public School, Canowindra High School, Tullamore Central School—regional public schools. We on this side of the chamber are not going to sit here and let this government do anything in any way, shape or form that is going to undermine regional schools, undermine any of these schools, because we on this side of the chamber, we in the coalition, believe in a better future for Australian students and we are the ones that will be able to provide that for them.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (16:21):  I am a little perplexed as to the tone of some of the contributions we have had over the last few minutes. In fact, I felt like I was back in the classroom a bit and was about to ban you from any more red cordial, Senator Mason! Forgive me as a new member of this place, but I wondered whether even relevance was something that should be taken into account. The proposition that we are talking to today says:


The Gillard Government’s Gonski school funding model which threatens to slash funding to one in three Australian schools and its continuing failure to provide education certainty for students and parents.


That was the so-called topic, talking about slashing funding to schools in Australia. To do that is based on a completely base motive. All that is trying to do is instil fear—not that those on this side of the House are unused to the fact that it is the main tactic of those opposite to try to instil fear, whether or not it is a gainful, meaningful addition to any decent debate. The Prime Minister has said on many occasions and in many forums that no school will be worse off under the funding model of the Gonski review. How much clearer can you be than that? As opposed to what was said by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday at the Independent Schools National Education Forum:


Overall, the 66 per cent of Australian school students who attend public schools get 79 per cent of government funding. The 34 per cent of Australians who attend independent schools get just 21 per cent of government funding. So there is no question of injustice to public schools here. If anything, the injustice is the other way. If anything, the injustice is the other way.


That was not my repetition; that was the Leader of the Opposition's, as you would recognise. So we need to say to ourselves: who is creating the fear campaign here? Who is frightening school parents and school communities? It is not the Gillard government threatening to slash funding; it is Mr Abbott. Rather than trying to embrace the wonderful principles that go behind the Gonski review that were so well articulated by Senator Wright, Mr Abbott is trying to frighten school communities, which I find completely reprehensible.


Why do we need a review into school funding? All of us are representatives of our own communities. All of us know that there are schools in our area that by a sheer fluke of where they happen to be physically placed, the socioeconomic status of the parents who send their children to that school, through the concentration of the number of children who do not have English as their first language or it is not the first language spoken at home, because of the concentration of children in a particular area who may or may not have disabilities, because of the concentration of children who have an Indigenous background—the list goes on. There is a lot of inequity in the system, and the Gonski review recognised that. In fact, the Gonski review found that the way we fund our schools is illogical, lacks transparency and is not focused on achieving the best results for our students, and it recommended a new way of funding for all schools that would include a set amount of funding per student with extra money for students and schools that need it most, including kids from poorer backgrounds, students with disability, remote and small schools, Indigenous students and those with limited English proficiency.


So what is it about? It is about equity. It is about recognising that every one of the children in this country, regardless of where they live or what family background they come from, has the right to a high-class education. I really seriously doubt that senators opposite would refute that. How are we going to do that? If we have a funding model that recognises those inequities across our school system, we need to have a system whereby there is a core amount of funding for each individual student and then a degree of loading on top of that that would also recognise the special needs of those students and the extra resources that have to be put into making sure they reach their potential. Not all of our students come to school from the same starting point. Some students live in homes that are able to provide rich life experiences, they are well nourished, there are no questions about good health, nutrition, sleeping, warm clothing, shelter—all those issues. Some of our students come to school ready and eager to learn. They also often have reading and writing skills and they are proficient sometimes in a second language. They have been introduced to sport, art, dance, drama and they are ready and willing to get into education and thrive. Not all kids have that opportunity.


If that opportunity is not provided by the education setting then it is our responsibility as a country to make sure that we address those inequities through the way we fund, resource and staff our schools. That is all Gonski is talking about. I think it is a principle that anyone who cares about the wellbeing of all Australian children should applaud and recognise.


To question the commitment of this government to education is quite disingenuous because, when you compare and contrast the actions and commitments of the Rudd and then Gillard Labor governments in recent times with the statements we have had coming from those opposite, they are in stark contrast. In my community we are seeing a whole new cohort of people entering trade training in order to get better jobs in the future. The trade training centres are providing a fantastic service to the people in those communities. There is $1.2 billion for 374 projects, which will benefit over a thousand school communities, yet those opposite have said they are going to abolish them.


We are investing over $15½ billion in skills and training over the next four years. We had 90,200 apprentices starting a trade in 2011 alone; yet, over the three years 2005 to 2008, the coalition spent just $6.8 billion, created only 85,000 new apprentices and pledged to cut a billion dollars from vocational training. That is the kind of compare and contrast of a value system about education that we see mirrored in the contributions from people in this place.


But I have an even bigger concern about education. My state of Tasmania relies very heavily on GST revenue. I stand to be corrected but I think figure is as high as $1.5 or $1.6 back from income tax receipts that come from Tasmania. We are looking at a review—coming from those opposite, from statements that have been made in my state and also in the state of Western Australia—that could see that formula changed. If the formula were to be changed to a dollar-for-dollar value in my state of Tasmania, that would see over $600 million per year ripped out of our community, ripped out of our state's profits. What is that money spent on? It is spent on education. My state of Tasmania is going through a period of very tight fiscal restraint at the moment and we do not need to have the spectre of more GST cuts hanging over our head.


I wish the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate were here today because I would like him to commit as a Tasmanian that he will not stand by and see $600 billion—




Senator Mason:
  Million.




Senator THORP:
  Million, sorry—$600 million ripped out of our state coffers per year, affecting every single one of our schools around the state and every single one of our students. Gonski is a fantastic model but we have to have the money to pay for it. I would like to hear Senator Abetz, a fellow Tasmanian, say very loudly and clearly to the Leader of the Opposition, 'I will not stand by and see the GST revenue ripped out of Tasmania, ripped out of our schools and out of the potential of every one of our Tasmanian children.'

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:33):  I am really pleased that we have had a number of school groups listening from the public galleries today, and one group has just moved on, because they heard and witnessed firsthand the absolute hypocrisy of those on the other side. I will first of all turn to the comments that Senator Wright made earlier on. It was like watching the trailer for a new Alice in Wonderlandproduction because what she actually said, and the kids upstairs in the public gallery actually heard, was that 'a child's education outcome is a 100 per cent product of advantage'. Her words were that any child's education outcome was purely down to advantage and not, to quote her words again, 'inherited ability'.


I do not know about you, Senator Mason, and I have not read as many books as you have—I have not studied and taught from as many learned books as you have—but I have certainly read enough to know that there are many in history who have had and have demonstrated an inherited ability. Let us start with Albert Einstein, whom we all know about. To suggest that people like him did not develop their ability through anything other than advantage is just extraordinary. Let us think of an even more immediate person, the Australian pianist David Helfgott—as if you could suggest that it was because of advantage that he developed the skills he did rather than because of inherited ability. It really was extraordinary Alice in Wonderland stuff.


The concern we have with the Gonski review is not the fact that we need to look at ways in which we can strengthen the education system in Australia—no-one on this side of the chamber has ever suggested that. I have to pay tribute to Senator Thorp because it is about the quality and choice in education. We must do everything we can to strengthen choice in education so that parents have an opportunity to ensure that they can give their children the best chance in life, the best shot at life, and the way to do that is through education, by giving them a hand up rather than a handout through life.


The big issue with the Gonski review is that, as we saw in the over 3,000 schools that get funding under the proposal he has put, there are insufficient funds unless funds are taken out from somewhere else and put into those schools that need greater investment. We know that this is just not going to happen, because we have billions of dollars here that, according to the Gonski review, need to be invested in education. We have billions of dollars that have to be invested NDIS and we have billions of dollars that need to go into border protection and propping up the policies of the government in that regard. So we know that this is an absolute furphy. It just is not going to materialise. This is something that the Gillard Labor government will never, ever have to implement.


Why is that? Because there is no way that they will be able to deliver on this before a federal election.


I am also reminded of the words that Senator Carr used in question time in response to a question today. It was Senator Kim Carr—I will qualify it—the fighter from the left, who used the term 'class warfare' not once, not twice but three times in a response to a question today. Why is that? Because we know that the old guard from the left in the Labor government that sit on that side of the chamber are still driving this. They have not got over the fact that Australia and the world have moved on since the fifties. They have not; they are still trying to perpetuate class warfare. We have seen this in recent months with Treasurer Wayne Swan trying to demonise those who are wealth creators in this country, who provide tens of thousands of jobs for hard-working Australians. They are trying to demonise the wealth creators as the evil bogeymen of this world.


This is what we are concerned about here. Whenever a Labor government start discussing funding for schools, their innate socialist approach to education rises to the fore and we know that it is all about stripping funding from independent or Catholic schools and propping up other government schools. We are not about stripping money from government schools; we want to make sure that all schools are properly funded to provide choice for parents.


In closing, there is a school in Croydon. It is a school for disabled kids. It provides education for more than 100 kids—it is something like 110 kids. Under the Gonski review proposal that school would lose its funding—it is a government school—to the tune of $2,884,667. So this school that is absolutely critical in Croydon, in the electorate of Deakin, would lose more than $2.8 million. They would be $2.8 million worse off. It is a secondary school that caters for students who have experienced difficulty for various reasons, who cannot find an education other than— (Time expired)

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-08-21,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:40):  One of the greatest pleasures of being a senator is having the opportunity to visit many schools throughout New South Wales and to witness firsthand the fine work of teachers, the talents of our students, the staff who work at schools and of course the parents involved in education. Throughout the last 12 months, my time as a senator, I have had the great privilege of opening throughout New South Wales many Building the Education Revolution facilities—a $16 billion program implemented by this government to build new school halls, to build libraries, to build science and computer laboratories and to build cultural and sporting facilities and make our schools better places to learn.


The BER program is summed up by this story. A few months ago I was at Dunedoo public school in central New South Wales. I was doing a BER ceremony, and at the conclusion of the ceremony an afternoon tea took place. The deputy principal left during the ceremony and came back during the afternoon tea and said: 'Sorry I had to leave. I just had to take a physics class with two of our students.' I said, 'Only two students in your physics class?' She said that, because they had a new BER classroom with a wonderful new Smart Board, these students, the two students of Dunedoo public high school, were now able to take a physics class via the internet, via video link-up with other public schools in that area. This is the first time that this school has been able to offer physics to students because the facilities simply were not available and the teachers were not available. One of those students could be the next Qantas pilot or the next scientist that our country develops because they have had the opportunity to undertake this education at that school. Education is all about opportunity and it is the Labor government that is delivering and expanding opportunities for students in Australia.


Those opposite often whinge and complain in this place about the Building the Education Revolution program. But in all of my travels to schools throughout New South Wales I am yet to hear one teacher, one parent or one student complain about the new facilities that they have at their school for their children and for their children's education. In fact, all we get is praise.


The other phenomena that I have noticed at BER ceremonies in recent times is the increasing appearance of the local coalition member of parliament. So despite the fact that they will come in here and criticise the program, who turns up for the BER ceremony? None other than the local coalition MP. And you can bet your life, Senator Williams, that when the photo is taken and the plaque unveiled who manages to weasel their little head into that photo? None other than the local coalition MP! They are always out there at those BER ceremonies. On occasion I have even seen some of those coalition MPs speak at some of these BER ceremonies and offer praise in front of parents and students about the BER program because they know how popular it is and how well it has served our schools.


I am happy to come into this place and debate Senator Fifield's motion about education because the one thing that the Gillard government have done more of is invest in a better education for students. And we will continue to improve our schools. That is what the Gonski review and program is all about. It is about ensuring that funding will increase over time, but the increase will be allocated in a fair manner that ensures that we are bringing up those who are disadvantaged. So the claim on the motion that funding will be cut is simply false.


But there is no need to dwell on this because the Australian public well understand that; they well understand because they know our commitment to increasing funding for education. They see it in their community. They see it at their child's school. They see it in the increasing educational infrastructure that we have been building in schools.


They see it in the new computers that their children have access to. They see it in the vast new array of subjects that their children are able to undertake because of this government's investment in education. If they had read the Gonski review—and they should have because one of their own, Kathryn Greiner, was a member of the panel—they would know that the Gonski review is all about increasing funding to schools throughout Australia and reducing disadvantage. 


When it comes to education, this Labor government's record speaks for itself. The Building the Education Revolution had $16 billion invested in new school infrastructure for every school throughout the country. We have increased university funding. We have introduced a national curriculum. We have introduced a NAPLAN testing regime to ensure that our children have a regular check on their literacy and numeracy. We have introduced trade training centres—a record investment in the vocational education and training sector—and we have introduced greater accountability and information for parents through the My School website. Couple that with increasing investment in laptops for schools and students throughout Australia. We have doubled the amount of funding for school education since we came to government. It is almost double the amount that the Howard government invested in education. That is our record and we are happy to stand on it. We are happy to debate education in this place on any occasion with those opposite because we believe in education and in investment in education and we have a better record than the coalition.


In fact, the Australian public may well ask, 'What do we know about the coalition's education policy?' We do not know anything about it because they do not have a policy at the moment. They have not announced it publicly but there have been leaks from their cabinet about $70 billion worth of cuts to the federal budget. You can bet your life that education will be one of those government departments that will be in for a massive cut when it comes to them preparing their election costings. Why do we know this? It is simple. 


We only need to look at what has occurred in each of the states where the Liberal Party has come to government over recent times. In my home state of New South Wales the cuts to education funding began almost immediately. They started off by leaving disabled students stranded on the first day of the school year in 2012 because the education minister and the department had not bothered to renegotiate the contract for transport to school for disabled kids. They followed that up with cuts to education in the recent state budget. Some cut right to the bone, in particular funding for special needs and disabilities.


Braddock Public School lost $95,000 in funding for students with disabilities and special needs under the state government's new Every Student, Every School policy—wonderful use of Orwellian language there by the New South Wales Liberal Party. It is one of 272 New South Wales public schools that will have fewer teacher aides and less access to special needs teachers for students with disabilities including autism and mental health issues. That is the record of the Liberal Party in government when it comes to education in New South Wales. They followed it up with more cuts not only in the schools sector but also to vocational education and training. New South Wales funding for school infrastructure has been cut by $14.3 million in the last New South Wales budget. TAFE infrastructure was slashed by $13 million in one year alone, bringing a total of $40.9 million cut from the New South Wales technical and further education budget.


Then we have a look at what is going on in other states, in particular Queensland. If you ever want a better advertisement to vote Labor, have a look at what is going on in Queensland. 'Can Do' Campbell Newman certainly can do. What he can do is take an axe to a state government budget, take an axe to education funding.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-08-21,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:51):  I rise this evening to make a contribution to remembering the sacrifice in 1942, some 70 years ago, that members of 2/40 Battalion made in the defence of Australia. In 2006, the 2/40th's historian, Peter Henning, said:


Although the 2/40 Battalion made up a significant proportion of Tasmanian prisoners-of-war and about a third of Tasmanian AIF casualties in the Second World War, there are few memorials to them and scant public awareness of their history.


I acknowledge that two members of the House of Representatives, Messrs Hubert Anthony in 1946 and Dick Adams in July 2004, have both made special mentions of the 2/40th in speeches to parliament. I also thank Peter Henning for his authorship of Doomed and Mrs Sue Beard of Moonah in Tasmania—a relative of a battalion soldier—for their assistance in putting together this speech.


The 2/40 Battalion was almost entirely comprised of Tasmanians and was formed in response to lobbying by veterans of Tasmania's 40th Battalion who had served in the World War I. The nominal roll, which was prepared by those who survived service in the 2/40th, provides details of those young Tasmanians who volunteered: their age, employment, religion, where in Asia these soldiers served and their fate. Amongst those who joined the 2/40th was the then headmaster of Launceston Church Grammar School, Norman H Roff, who was killed in action in Timor, leaving a wife and two young children.


The bulk of the enlistees 'took the King's shilling' in mid-1940 and their typical age was between 19 and 21, meaning that any of the currently living survivors of the 2/40th should be aged 92 or older. But if anecdotes are correct, perhaps the one or two 14 year olds who enlisted might still be living at age 86 or 87. In fact, recently the Advocate newspaper carried a story that one of the younger members of the 2/40th, Fred Brett, was less than fulsome in disclosing his age on enlistment, and that he had celebrated his 16th birthday whilst in Changi prison.


Having assembled in mid-1940 in Brighton, Tasmania, the battalion trained for the next six months in their home state, prior to their transfer to Bonegilla, near Wodonga, where they joined other battalions in the 23rd Brigade of the 8th Division. There followed a train and truck journey that took them to Adelaide, Alice Springs and then up to Darwin. With the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941, the 2/40th was rushed to Timor from Darwin on 10 December, arriving at Koepang to form the bulk of Sparrow Force, charged with defending the airfield at Penfui, the base for the Hudson bombers of RAAF's 2 Squadron. 


MP Hubert Anthony in his speech to the House in 1946 spoke about the conditions which the 2/40 Battalion had to endure in Timor. He purported that the battalions in Sparrow Force were not adequately armed or prepared for this battle and backed up these assertions with a report made by then Brigadier Lind, who was in charge of Gull Force, which can be accessed digitally on the Australian War Memorial website. Lind suggested that an inquiry into these circumstances should be made in order for someone to be held accountable and that all information held by the government and the armed forces should be made public to all Australians. No such inquiry was ever held.


A period of eight months was available but not utilised for the battalion to receive adequate resources in the way of armament and personnel, as well as for lines of communication to be opened with the Netherlands East Indies naval and air support. There was no form of air support, as the RAAF squadron left when invasion was imminent, and artillery support was very limited, as was back up arms and munitions. Japanese forces numbered 23,000 against about 4,000 Allied troops.


As a consequence of all these weaknesses in preparations, support and manpower, the 2/40th was ill-prepared to meet a more numerous, professional, and well-equipped Japanese force, which included tanks, and which landed by sea and air on 20 February 1942. In three days of fighting the 2/40th suffered 84 dead and 132 badly wounded. Japanese casualties were even more serious. Despite their valiant efforts, when the Japanese delivered the 2/40th commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Legatt an ultimatum to either surrender or be bombed, there was little choice. Consequently, the bulk of 2/40th became prisoners of war. Some members escaped inland, others were later captured, and some joined Australian commandos in the hills and were subsequently evacuated in December 1942. However, the great majority of the 2/40th joined the 22,000 Australian POWs in South-East Asia.


According to Australian War Memorial records:


… the 2/40th prisoners spent the first seven months of their captivity interned in a camp at Usapa Besar. A small party of senior officers was shipped to Java on 26 July and the rest of the prisoners on Timor followed in September.


From Java, the 2/40th prisoners were dispersed throughout Japan's conquered territory. Over 500 of the men from Sparrow Force were sent to Singapore and then off to work on the infamous Burma-Thailand railway. Some of the 2/40 men embarked on two ships in January 1943 bound for Moulmein in Burma. American bombers tragically sunk the ship transporting the Dutch POWs and damaged the Moji Maru, which was carrying the Australians, killing seven. Major LJ Robertson, OC of the 2/6 Field Company, commended a handful of prisoners for the assistance that they gave to the organisation and rescue of the Dutch survivors. One of those mentioned was Corporal Wallace Imlach, concrete worker, of the 2/40th who before the war lived in Myrtle Bank near Launceston. Most of the 2/40th Battalion who worked on the railway joined it from the Thai end and hence they no doubt were involved in Hellfire Pass and Hintok viaduct construction, which are now well known to many Australians. Other members of the 2/40th made the long sea journey to Japan to work in labour camps.


The impact of this chapter of World War II on Tasmania was indeed widespread, with losses felt within friendship groups, sporting clubs and families and these losses are still being remembered. The Tasmania Cricket Association news journal of 24 April 2012 exemplifies this. I will read extracts of the 2/40th references:


One member of the 2/40th Battalion was a powerful left hand batsman from Myalla named Les Allen. Allen, the Uncle of the not then born former Sheffield Shield wicket-keeper Les Allen, held one of the highest scores for Myalla Cricket Club, 222 not out against Boat Harbour at Boat Harbour, one of only four known double centuries for the old club.


As the Japanese attacks on Timor increased and the 2 Squadron withdrew, the airfield was razed and the 2/40th retreated inland having had its main supply line by road cut. Amid mounting pressure, the 2/40th surrendered in what became a choice of ""surrender or be bombed"" leaving Pte. Allen a prisoner of war along with most of the group.


After seven months as a POW, Allen and 266 other Australians were being transferred to Japan along with America and British troops, one of 772 on board the cargo ship SS Tomahoko Maru.


Not displaying flags to show that there were Australians on board and only 40 miles from Nagasaki, the Tomahoko and her convoy was attacked by the US. Allen was one of the 560 on board who did not survive the attack.


Allen's cousin, Jack Moles, was also part of the 2/40th. The pair parted company before getting on the convoy thinking that if separated they had a 50/50 chance that one would get home. Moles served the remainder of the war as a POW and returned home after the war.


When Myalla resumed after the war, Doug, who had only watched one match his elder brother had played, was old enough to play and went on to better his lost brother by scoring 224 not out also against Boat Harbour. Incidentally, the only match Doug watched featuring his brother was the game where Les made his 222 not out.


By the time the war had ended the battalion had lost 264 of its original 920 men. Despite their valiant efforts, members of the 2/40th do not appear to be recognised as they should in Tasmania. The Launceston branch of the RSL has an honour board which lists the names of the 264 of the 2/40th who paid the supreme sacrifice. More recently, on Anzac Day 2012 a plaque was unveiled in North Motton, near Ulverstone. The message on this memorial is a simple one: at the top of the plaque is an Australian flag and the ovular colour patch of white over red, which was proudly displayed by every 2/40th digger.


Then there is written:


In Honour of the men of the 2/40th Battalion 'Sparrow Force'—Tasmania's own—Lest we Forget.


It is important that I record that this plaque is the result of the perseverance of a committee of Ulverstone residents who raised money via cake and raffle sales. There is also a memorial at Green's Beach which is a life-size wood carving of a 2/40 digger standing under a palm tree. All sides of politics would no doubt agree with me that war memorials are vital in honouring the service of men and women for Australia.


I was pleased to read an article in the Mercury last month which detailed plans for a memorial to the 2/40 Battalion in Hobart and I made contact with one of the driving forces behind the push—a Mrs Susan Beard, whose uncle Dennis Scanlon was a member of the battalion but passed away in 2006. The article quoted 91-year-old Doug Jack, a member of the battalion, who was a prisoner of war for 3½ years. Mr Jack's simple request is to see a memorial in Hobart before he and his fellow surviving veterans pass away. Lloyd Harding and Jack Bone join Doug Jack as the three surviving southern Tasmanian members of the battalion. For the benefit of those three in particular, I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Hobart City Council has approved the group's request for a memorial in the vicinity of other war memorials near Anzac Parade.


The group behind the push for the Hobart memorial hopes to have this memorial established by December, pending the outcome of an application to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is thought that Tasmania has around 15 surviving members of the battalion. Mrs Beard has provided an insight into the special connection they have and they still meet every year on the Sunday nearest to 23 February, on Anzac Day and at Christmas. She says they meet as the 2/40 Battalion. I urge my fellow Tasmanians in parliament as well as their state counterparts to help spread the story of the 2/40 Battalion.
