The PRESIDENT
 (09:32):  Yesterday in question time, there was a great deal of disruption during Senator Bilyk's questions and the answers given by Senator Abetz. The disruption and the need for me to constantly call the Senate to order made it very difficult to catch what individual senators were interjecting at the time. Because of the noise, especially from those close to the chair, I could only hear portions—at best—of senators interjecting, of which there were many. Some senators apparently took exception to remarks made by Senator Heffernan and Senator Brandis, and I undertook to review the Hansard and the audiovisual footage.


I have reviewed the Hansard and the footage, neither of which detected Senator Heffernan making any inappropriate remarks. Having warned Senator Heffernan not to repeat anything that he may have said that could be construed as inappropriate, and requesting that he withdraw any such statement if it was inappropriate and if it was made, Senator Heffernan indicated that he did not say anything inappropriate. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I can only take Senator Heffernan at his word that he did not.


In relation to Senator Brandis, the Hansard and the footage did not pick up the words he used. I heard, albeit still with difficulty, the words used by Senator Brandis at the time but do not consider that they carried the meaning alleged by Senator Conroy. As I recall the words, they took the form of a warning to Senator Bilyk to take care what she said lest she commit a crime. I took the language used by Senator Brandis to be merely rhetorical. As all senators would understand, anything Senator Bilyk said in question time is protected by absolute privilege. It forms part of the proceedings in parliament which, in accordance with the law of parliamentary privilege, cannot be impeached or questioned in any place outside parliament, let alone form the basis for any action against her, including any action for contempt under the Royal Commissions Act 1902.


As I indicated last week, I have been very disappointed with the conduct of senators, particularly during question time. I have had difficulty hearing answers because of the level of interjection from both sides of the chamber but especially on my near left. As communications to my office indicate, disruptive behaviour reflects poorly on individual senators and upon the Senate as a whole.


Also, the level of backchat to, and argumentation with, the chair is currently unacceptable. Arguing with the chair, whether it be me, the Deputy President or any of the temporary chairs, is not in order at any time and there has certainly been far too much of it of late. 


As we all know, the standing orders do not give the President any authority to suspend senators for brief periods. Senators may only be suspended by a decision of the Senate as a whole. While the President is responsible for maintaining order, responsibility for discipline lies with all senators. I would be reluctant to see the standing orders amended to provide for the removal of a senator, by the chair, for breaches of the rules as I believe the integrity and conduct of each senator should rest with each and every senator. I can only appeal to the good will and desire of each senator to represent their state to a standard accepted by the people of Australia, which, I am confident, would include the proper observance of all rules, being respectful to one's colleagues and to observe the authority of the chair. Senators, the alternative is to change our standing orders. As I have indicated, I do not think that this Senate would want this to be the next option for restoring respect and order to this august chamber.


I know, through substantial representation from members of the public, that the people of Australia expect better behaviour and a more mature approach to senators' conduct in this place. I do note that the eight crossbenchers and pockets of other senators constantly observe the standing orders and respect the conventions and decency of the more senior parliamentary chamber in the Commonwealth of Australia. 


The standing orders are rules of debate, designed to provide a rational framework for the contest of ideas, which is the essence of a parliament. As I intimated last week, intelligent, witty and respectful interjection, whilst technically disorderly, can be tolerated and at times it can be welcomed, provided it is not constant, loud, and aggressive and does not continue despite calls from the chair to cease.


So, Senators, please consider the seat that you occupy, consider the people that you represent, consider the many observers that watch proceedings live, or those that listen or view on national broadcast and allow them to, at least, feel justified and assured that this place contains individuals, whom they elected, that will uphold the good values, standards and discipline that befits holding the office of a senator in the parliament of Australia.

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.



The speech read as follows—



I am pleased to introduce the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2015 into the Parliament.


The bill makes amendments to various Commonwealth acts which are consequential to the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act 2015. That act received royal assent on 5 March 2015 and will commence on 5 March 2016 or earlier by Proclamation. 


When the act commences, it will align the requirements for registration and publication of acts and instruments into a single legislative scheme. This is achieved by significant reforms to the Legislative Instruments Act and the repeal of the Acts Publication Act 1905. The consolidated scheme will be provided by the Legislation Act 2003, as the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 will be renamed. 


Further, the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act also amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, including clarifying and expanding provisions dealing with machinery of government changes, and other amendments to support those made to the Legislative Instruments Act. 


The reforms made by the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act will improve the operation and clarity of the legislative framework for Commonwealth instruments and Acts. 


This bill supports the implementation of these reforms by making consequential amendments such as updating references to the Legislative Instruments Act, and provisions which deal with the application of that act, to reflect the amendments made.


The bill also removes references to certain exemptions from sunsetting and disallowance for legislative instruments from various enabling acts. The exemptions will be added to an updated Legislative Instruments Regulation 2004 prior to commencement of the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act, where this is necessary to preserve their legal effect. These amendments will enhance the accessibility and clarity of Commonwealth laws, by ensuring that consolidated lists of exemptions are easily accessible in the updated Regulation. 


This bill also:


makes minor amendments to the Legislation Act and the Acts Interpretation Act, as amended by the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act, to clarify the application of their requirements to administrative forms; 


makes minor amendments to the definition of a legislative instrument in the relevant act to clarify the status of court rules of states and territories; 


makes minor amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to clarify that provisions of the Family Law Act which set out the application of the Legislative Instruments Act to rules of the Family Court apply to those rules whether they are made under the Family Law Act or another Act; and


makes other minor consequential amendments to Commonwealth acts, repeals several spent provisions, and makes minor technical corrections to the Legislation Act.


The Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Bill supports reforms made by the acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act to create administrative efficiencies, reduce 'beige tape' and promote access to justice.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-08-19,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:38):  This bill, the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2015, follows the Acts and Instruments Framework Reform Bill 2014, the principal bill. That bill was amended to accept one recommendation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and passed the parliament, with Labor support, on 5 March this year.


The principal bill implemented the recommendations of a statutory review of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 under the former Labor government in 2008. That review was led by a committee, comprising Mr Anthony Blunn, Mr Ian Govey and Professor John McMillan. That bill made a number of reforms to the arrangements for delegated legislation under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. That act, now named the Legislation Act, sets out a comprehensive regime for the registration, tabling, scrutiny and repeal of legislative instruments.


This bill makes a number of consequential technical machinery and drafting changes to the bill. The bill updates references across the statute book to the Legislative Instruments Act to reflect its change of name to the Legislation Act; compiles the list of instruments exempt from sunsetting and disallowance, presently found in various locations into one central list in regulation to be made under the Legislation Act; clarifies the status of rules of court under the Legislation Act; and repeals spent provisions and makes various technical and drafting corrections to the Legislation Act.


These are minor and technical changes. As Labor indicated when the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Bill came to this place, we support any measures which make Commonwealth instruments easier to locate and understand. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-08-19,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise today to talk about a recent trip I had to Samoa. In Christmas of 2011 my wife, Nancy, and I spent the Christmas break in Samoa. Samoa is a small country of 2,800 square kilometres with a population of around 190,000 people. Being a fifth-generation farmer, I take a keen interest in what is happening in the agricultural sector and, to be honest, in Samoa the answer is not much all. I started thinking about a coffee industry because the climate is right and there is plenty of labour. Samoan people are lovely people, and I thought, 'How can we help these people develop industry and exports especially?'


When I returned I was put in touch with the Executive Chairman of Gloria Jean's Coffees, Mr Nabi Saleh, who in turn paid for coffee and cocoa expert Christophe Montagnon to go back to Samoa with us in June of 2012. From that visit Christophe, with input front Andrew Falconer, whose expertise is in sustainable service management, produced a report on coffee and cocoa cultivation in Samoa. We had a busy week with many meetings, including the Prime Minister and his deputy, the Minister for Agriculture, research people, the association of exporters and manufacturers and other groups.


We discovered at that time that only 12 per cent of the Samoan population is engaged in formal paid employment. The official unemployment figure is 8.7 per cent, but I am sure it is significantly higher because so many are working in family enterprises. In fact, two-thirds of the labour force is absorbed by subsistence village agriculture and fishery. The country has a large trade deficit, and agriculture accounts for just 10 per cent of the GDP while up to 20,000 households practice small-scale, labour-intensive subsistence agriculture of generally less than four hectares.


Samoa previously had a coffee industry, which had been established by the Germans and later managed by the Western Samoa Trust Estates Corporation. The Germans had been growing the brand liberica coffee, but this disappeared in the 1950s because of the popularity of robusta and arabica coffees. Today coffee production barely exists and cocoa production is very low because botanical and agronomical basic knowledge of coffee is badly lacking.


Christophe's report following our trip in 2012 found that Samoa's climate and soil are suitable for coffee and cocoa cultivation. The lowlands are suitable for robusta coffee and cocoa and the high country above 600 to 800 metres above sea level might be suitable for some arabica varieties. The Samoan government decided to revitalise the robusta variety through a stimulus package in 2012. The stimulus consisted of providing some coffee plants—enough to plant two hectares—but it was not a success. That is because there is not a well-identified value chain, there is no clear technical assistance strategy and the vegetal material is of poor genetic quality. Christophe pointed to the industry being hit at various times by cyclones, pests and diseases but said the two main reasons for the stagnation in the coffee and cocoa industries were lack of knowledge and no established value chain.


In July this year, I returned to Samoa after being approached by Mrs Lita Gaugau who is Samoan and works in New Zealand. She indicated her family was keen to establish a large, modern coffee plantation in Samoa. In company with Mrs Gaugau I met again with the Prime Minister, the opposition leader, the Minister for Agriculture and the Australian High Commissioner to Samoa, Ms Sue Langford.


The coffee beans from the stimulus package were being picked. About three years after the trees were planted, they started to produce coffee beans. When coffee beans are picked, they must be processed to remove the shell and the skin leaving the coffee bean ready for roasting. The stumbling block is the fact that Samoa does not have a coffee processing machine. So here is a stimulus package now producing some—I underline some—coffee beans that cannot be processed. I do not think that is a very successful stimulus package.


The main coffee player is the roasting company CCK, run by Australian Ken Newton. The so-called Samoan coffee he is commercialising and of which Samoan people are proud as a national product is roasted 100 per cent from coffee beans imported from Papua New Guinea. Mr Newton said his Samoan coffee volume was very low and of such a low physical quality that it could not be used to produce an acceptable roasted coffee.


What is the problem with Samoa? In my opinion, they have never grown modern varieties. Growing the old German varieties means that the trees grow to a rather high tree. This means that many of the trees are blown over in cyclones, resulting in crop failure. The new varieties are topped, meaning that the top of the young tree is cut off so the tree grows out, not up, and is much more resistant to high winds and cyclones. The industry just does not have the backup of research and agronomic management.


The country is trying to develop its sheep industry and imports the breed Fiji Fantastic. Last year, the country imported 110 of these sheep to form the basis for a new national breeding program, and they hope to build the flock up to around 3,000 over the next decade. The problem is again the lack of industry support and the lack of capital for farmers to build infrastructure. I did notice the amount of dogs roaming and I thought at the time they will not have a sheep industry for long unless they start culling a few or controlling these dogs that are everywhere in the streets. I have been assured by Ms Sue Langford that the program has commenced and that there are signs of it working.


Total Australian official development assistance to Samoa in 2015-16 will be an estimated $37.2 million. I have been informed that a significant amount is directed towards building and upgrading roads to enable better access for agricultural produce. My question is: What agricultural produce? Perhaps Australia should finance the experts and establish a modern, up-to-date coffee plantation to train and guide the local people on how the coffee industry could be viable. The next stage would be establishing a modern processing plant for the coffee grown. I believe there needs to be more focus on sustainable agriculture.


Samoa has a huge trade deficit. The ships are going there taking all sorts of produce in, but very little is going out. There are thousands of acres of land producing nothing. The previous government gave them a stimulus package—to do what? To plant trees in their national parks to prevent climate change. Why didn't we put it into modern-day varieties of coffee, to let them establish the industry? And do not just sell the coffee beans roasted; process them right through, if they are Robusta coffee, to the stage of instant coffee jars—vertical integration; send a finished product.


I was informed that Samoa has a $2 billion GDP but owes around $1.4 billion, 70 per cent of GDP. That is not a good financial look. I have tried to help these people, and I think we can do a lot for them, but I am being frustrated, especially given that Nabi Saleh, a very decent and generous man, paid for the expert from France to go out to Samoa to do the whole survey and the report. We should be employing these people full time for four years to establish the industry properly, and then Samoa could actually have an industry, vertically integrated, that would allow exports and jobs and would benefit their country.


With the sheep industry, I am informed that soon they will be trying the dorpers, which are a very popular sheep here in Australia. I noticed dorpers are now being run over near Tweed Heads, in a very wet climate. But the Samoans are going to have to fence their country and keep the dogs out, and they need guidance and training in this field as well. There is certainly plenty of opportunity there.


But, if Samoa do not build industries and they keep relying on imports and their debt keeps growing, they will head down the road of Greece to financial ruin, and I would hate to see that. I have helped as much as I can, and I thank those people who have helped me. I thank the Hon. Julie Bishop for her time and her staff for the work they have done in assisting us. But we do not seem to be making any progress. I find it amazing that, in the stimulus package put in in 2012, the government paid people to plant the old 1910 German varieties of coffee trees, which are very old and out of date, and people are now picking those coffee beans, but there is no processing machine. That is like setting up a wool-producing farm, grazing and, when the sheep are ready to shear, you do not have a shearing machine or a shearer and you do not harvest the wool. They are picking the coffee beans but are not processing the beans, so they are being wasted. 


They have got to be helped and guided to do it properly so they can secure industries, jobs and vertical integration for coffee and cocoa. They do export some cocoa to New Zealand, which is good. There is much more potential for that. But my concern is, with that $37 million, we are helping them with health and various very important issues, but we need to help them more with industry—work with the Samoan government to see that they get established, grow their economy and save themselves from going down the road of national debt. Their tourism is going okay, but there is plenty of room there. Let us hope that in the future we can help them to establish those industries and they grow, for their own betterment.

But, when we ask ourselves about the cost of the royal commission, what we have to do is look at it in the overall context. How much is this royal commission going to save the Australian economy by throwing a spotlight on corruption and rorts and racketeering by the trade unions that you seek to protect by destroying the royal commission?

Senator Conroy is now using the opportunity to wage his own vendettas in the fratricidal ugly world of Labor Party politics. In relation to the first part of the question, I would have to check but I would do recall communicating with Mr Heydon on the occasion when the government approached him to request that he extend the life of the royal commission. Obviously as a matter of courtesy it was necessary to make that request of him. I cannot immediately call to mind at any other occasions when I have spoken to Mr Heydon during the currency of the royal commission, but I will check.


In relation to the second part of Senator Conroy's question, if I understood it correctly and I am sure I did, I am being chastised for failing to interfere with the operation of the royal commission, being chastised for not suggesting to or insisting that the commissioner pursue a certain line of inquiry in a certain way. Well, of course I would not. Anybody who sought to interfere with a royal commission would be committing a crime.

Anybody who inquired into corruption in the trade union movement was bound to have mire and dirt and sleaze thrown at them by the protectors of the organised criminals in the trade union movement on the opposition benches.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (14:15):  Mr Julian Burnside, whom I know slightly, hardly approaches this as an impartial observer. Yet even Mr Burnside has made the same point that I make about the Hon. Dyson Heydon: that he is a person of utterly unimpeachable integrity, a man with no politics, appointed to the New South Wales Court of Appeal by the Labor government of Mr Bob Carr, appointed to the High Court of Australia by the coalition government of John Howard. But, rather than one individual lawyer, let us remember what the Law Council of Australia had to say yesterday:


The public attacks on the commissioner being played out through the media are unacceptable and damage the basis on which tribunals and courts operate.


That is the voice of the Law Council of Australia representing every constituent body of the legal profession in Australia. That is the voice of the legal profession in this country— (Time expired).

  Yesterday, in the course of asking me a question concerning the Honourable Dyson Heydon, and in the course of making an attack on Mr Heydon, Senator Collins uttered some words which I described as 'sleazy' and 'dishonest'. Although no objection was taken to my use of those words at the time, the President has since intimated to me that he would wish me to withdraw them. So I do.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (15:07):  I rise to provide additional information to Senator Lazarus in relation to his question regarding the Mount Emerald wind farm. I can confirm for Senator Lazarus that the Mount Emerald wind farm project was referred to the Department of the Environment for assessment under the EPBC Act in December 2011. The project was determined to be a controlled action, with the relevant controlling provisions being listed threatened species and ecological communities, listed migratory species, World Heritage properties and Natural Heritage places. An environmental impact statement was only concluded and provided for the project and exhibited for public comment, though, in May 2014. The Department of the Environment, having analysed both the EIS and the comments provided to the EIS, has sought further information from the proponent regarding potential impacts of the Mount Emerald wind farm on the northern quoll. Once this information is received, the assessment will progress and a decision regarding approval of the project will be made in accordance with the requirements of the EPBC Act. I assure Senator Lazarus that neither any more nor any less consideration of the impact on the northern quoll of the Mount Emerald wind farm will be accorded than was accorded to the impact on the ornamental snake and the yakka skink in relation to the Carmichael coalmine or to any other listed species that is considered in relation to any other controlled action.

 (Victoria) (15:09):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Conroy today relating to the Commissioner of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.


Given that Senator Abetz denied me leave, I will address some of the matters I would have raised earlier in taking note of answers to questions from me and Senator Conroy.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why don't you make it Senator Wong too?




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Mr Deputy President, I hope that my time will not incorporate lengthy interjections such as those from Senator Ian MacDonald.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It probably will not.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you very much. I have reflected in both yesterday's question time and today's that when the government is in serious difficulty we see it coming forward with the insults. Yesterday it was reported that in the discussions related to questions about Commissioner Heydon—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You're not insulting Dyson Heydon? What double standards!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  My question to Senator Brandis yesterday did not insult Commissioner Heydon. It sought some straightforward information that the government has been seeking to conceal for quite some time. Instead, in his conditional withdrawal Senator Brandis claimed that I uttered words attacking Commissioner Heydon. This is simply untrue. I invite all senators to review the Hansard of yesterday's question time. I did not hear what Senator Brandis said in question time yesterday because of all of the noise in the chamber. I thank the President for his comments this morning to that effect. On reviewing the Hansard I saw that I had been described as 'dishonest and sleazy', which is disgraceful. I will not repeat today the words that Senator Payne described as inaudible, because they were obviously heard. The point is the insults that this government is coming forward with to try to conceal its fragile political status. Why is it fragile? It is fragile because the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has put his trust in the judgement of people such as Senator Brandis to make balanced decisions on who should conduct a royal commission. We see now from answers to questions today that Senator Brandis did not have an appropriate process for determining someone. He had no short list. The cabinet had no short list. He picked Commissioner Heydon. He claims it was on the basis that he wanted 'the best black-letter lawyer'. I do not know that being a black-letter lawyer is necessarily the best criterion for someone to look into complex workplace relations matters and the behaviour of registered organisations. However, I can understand that Senator Brandis would be happy to have a capital-C conservative lawyer, which is what I understand a black-letter lawyer to be. Let us look at the other point that I raised in questions today, which is about the secrecy—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  This is the guy that Bob Carr appointed.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator MacDonald!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I cannot follow her argument.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a matter for me. What is a matter for me is interjections which are disorderly. I am calling you to order.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The other issue I raised today was not an attack but a question about the costs involved in the royal commission. What were we told by Senator Brandis today in answer to that? 'It's a matter of form. We don't provide information such as this on costs.' Yesterday he could not tell us whether it was a special circumstance that he personally had approved. We are still waiting for that answer. Today he cannot tell us why we can get information about the costs involved for counsel assisting, Mr Stoljar, but we cannot get the information—other than through cabinet leaks—that might be relevant to the costs of Commissioner Heydon.


We need to understand the full costs of this exercise. This royal commission is turning into a farce. The secrecy, the lack of transparency and the decision-making processes demonstrated by this government are the issue. I have not attacked Commissioner Heydon, but I am attacking the way this government has dealt with this matter.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-08-19,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:15):  In responding to the claims and the allegations made by the honourable senator opposite, I echo her sentiments and reflect that I, too, am disappointed in some of the conduct in this chamber during question time. But, rather than lay blame on the government benches, I draw to the attention of Senator Collins the behaviour and conduct of the Labor Party. It is truly outrageous that they belittle, they yell, they scream and they get hysterical whilst ministers are trying genuinely to answer questions.


Yet I understand it in the respect that they are seeking a distraction from their own failings. These distractions take on many forms, because the government is absolutely interested in responding to the priorities of the Australian people—and that is about jobs, about growing the economy and about providing opportunity for people going forward. Those opposite are not interested in those good-news stories. They are not interested in those productive stories. What they are interested in doing is laying a smokescreen down to hide the malfeasance that is inculcated in the union movement and has been exposed so deeply by the royal commission. So, because they cannot control, for want of a better word, the royal commission or influence the events there, they target the commissioner himself. They have targeted the commissioner in the most derogatory of manners with these pejorative slurs and these allegations that they cannot back up with any substance, and they do it because the royal commission has exposed the depth of union corruption.


It goes to the very, very top, where we are seeing favours traded by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, in his time as the boss of a union in order to enrich or ingratiate the union at the expense of employees. Some may be able to justify that; I think it smells, and it has been exposed. We have also seen Mr Shorten receive pecuniary benefits in the form of employees and campaign workers, paid for by others and not disclosed. These are not mere oversights; they are not just the price of a Mars Bar or a meal at a local Chinese restaurant. We are talking about tens of thousands of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of dollars when it comes to the unions.


So, rather than the opposition trying to play a constructive and positive role in the affairs of the country, they are seeking to denigrate one of our best and most learned former justices in Dyson Heydon. It does them no good, I have to say, because the Australian people are actually interested in outcomes rather than the fire and brimstone produced by those opposite. None, or few, can conjure up the fire and brimstone like Senator Wong or Senator Conroy or even Senator Collins, with her confected outrage about how she has been harshly dealt with and poorly treated.


Yesterday's question time was very disappointing, I have to say. In one sense, it is very fortunate that it was not broadcast to the Australian people—in that they would be very disappointed in the conduct of the members opposite—but I am disappointed in the sense that the Australian people did not get to see firsthand just how shameless and how shallow the modern Labor Party has become. It is no longer about policy; it is no longer about doing the best thing by Australians; it is only about power for power's sake. We are seeing that through the royal commission exposing the union movement, where it was all about getting votes to control more of the Labor Party so you could get more of your people into government, get the largesse of government, become ministers and hold positions of authority.


That is not what this place is meant to be about. Politics is not meant to be about that; it is meant to be about coming in here with a vision of how you would like to shape the country—a vision of how you would like to help Australians do better. We are going to have differences in that vision, but it is not meant to be about self. That is one of the things the modern labour movement need to align themselves with. It should not be about them as individuals; it should not be about enriching the union movement; it should not be about progressing up the greasy pole. It should be about lifting Australians and helping Australia to become better and better.


If I sound disappointed, I am—because you need a good opposition to make governments even better, and I want to see governments of all stripes made much better.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2015-08-19,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:20):  I too wish to take note of answers to questions asked by members on this side of the chamber. I will try a different tack today, which I do not normally do: I will go through some notes and lay it all out so that those listening can get a handle on what has been going on. I want to talk about the situation with the perceived bias of the royal commissioner. In 2010, the inaugural Sir Garfield Barwick Address was organised by the Liberal Party and, of course, the current Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, spoke to it. This year's event was advertised on the New South Wales Bar Association website with a Liberal Party logo. It said that money was payable—it is undeniable—to the Liberal Party of Australia, New South Wales division and included the disclaimer that political donation laws apply to fundraising events. It is pretty simple: it was a Liberal fundraiser.


Mr Heydon received an email from a Mr Gregory Burton, who was the organiser of the Sir Garfield Barwick Address, on 10 April 2014. In Mr Burton's email, he disclosed that he is the chair of professional engagement for the New South Wales Liberal Party's lawyer branch. He stated:


… we trust we show the party in a favourable light!


The party being the Liberal Party. He declared that the Garfield Barwick address is the, in his words, 'flagship event' of his branch. Mr Burton wrote to ask if Mr Heydon would be amenable to delivering the address, if the commission was completed, suggesting that Mr Burton perceived a conflict of interest back in April 2014. Mr Heydon replied that he would be happy to give the address.


The royal commission into trade unions was extended in October last year, and we know that. Justice Heydon was reminded of the address in March 2015 and he confirmed his interest to address them. Through a series of conversations and questions being put to Commissioner Heydon he later declared—not originally, but later after it was raised with him through the media—that he 'overlooked', which was the word he used, the fact that the event was organised by the Liberal Party, and that he had been asked to give the address only if the royal commission had finished. Commissioner Heydon said:


I overlooked the connection between the person or persons organising the event and the Liberal Party which had been stated in the email of 10 April, 2014.


He went on to say that he also overlooked the fact his agreement to speak at that time had been:


… conditional on the work of the commission being completed before that time.


Commissioner Heydon was sent an email with attachments by a Liberal Party member on 12 June of this year declaring the event a fundraiser, including a political donation declaration on Liberal Party letterhead. Commissioner Heydon said that the email and attachments were printed by a personal assistant and that he did not read the attachments. Commissioner Heydon's personal assistant was emailed on 12 August 2015 by a Liberal Party member confirming details of the event. They said that the party would not be mentioned on advertisements in public Bar Association publications. The email noted:


… of course people will disclose if they go over the state donation limit.


On 13 August journalists obtained New South Wales Liberal Party flyers, one of which was sent to Commissioner Heydon in June, announcing that the event was a Liberal Party fundraiser and advising those attending to make cheques payable to the Liberal Party New South Wales Division. It said, very clearly, that all proceeds would be applied to state election campaigns with a disclaimer that donations over $12,000 would need to be disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission.


It does not matter how much that side of the chamber try to cover up and not tell us what the cost is. It was clearly a very poor choice by Commissioner Heydon. What makes it looks even murkier to the public is that that side of the chamber are doing everything they can to try to defend that it was not Liberal Party, that he did not see it, that the assistant missed it, that the dog ate his homework. It reeks. (Time expired)

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Training) (15:25):  I did my best to listen to the contributions, word for word, of Senator Sterle and Senator Collins to this motion as they spoke earlier this afternoon. I thought I captured all of Senator Sterle's assertions of the relevant facts, but it is important in this case to actually outline that those facts do not support the conclusion that those opposite have arrived at. The single, most important fact here is that, upon realising and upon being made aware of it—a fact to which he has admitted—Justice Heydon made it clear he would not address that particular function. He did not actually undertake any activity that is party political.


Let us put this in context as I try not to assign a motive to those with whom I have a different view. If there were some consistency in approach from those opposite, one would not have to do this. I cannot help but refer to some other instances where I have not heard any expression of outrage from those opposite. In these instances the lectures were delivered, the functions were held, the person in question turned up and gave the address. It is the exact opposite of what Justice Heydon has done in this case, when he, rightly, said it would be inappropriate for him to deliver the address. He made that clear and released all the facts immediately upon him becoming aware of them.


On 11 November last year, and fortuitously for the Labor Party I realise that some were discussing the Sir Garfield Barwick Address, His Honour Judge Greg Woods delivered the Frank Walker Memorial Lecture to the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Ryan, just resume your seat. Senator Ryan.




Senator RYAN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Before anyone rises to correct me, it is Labor Lawyers spelt simply with an O as in L-A-B-O-R. It is not any suggestion that it is a small L or people simply working in labour law. I might also say, as was highlighted in the other place within the last hour, that Justices Gaudron, McHugh and Kirby all addressed Labor Lawyers functions, but there was no cry from those opposite. Again, it is immediately apparent to anyone that examines the facts in this case that Justice Heydon, upon realising this function was associated with the Liberal Party, immediately made clear that it was not appropriate for him to do it and withdrew from the function.


This is where we get to the truth of the matter. I have rarely seen such—



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ryan, resume your seat. I ask the Senate to come to order, and Senator Ryan should be heard in silence.




Senator RYAN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I have, in my seven-and-a-bit years in this place, rarely seem such contrived and confected outrage. One can only go to the motive of those opposite. As the news of endemic corruption in certain parts of Australia's labour movement bleeds out across the country, in an attempt to refer the pain or hide it, the Labor Party opposite sort of stubs its toe and tries to contrive some outrage of an event that did not occur.


The most important fact here is that Justice Heydon immediately withdrew. Those opposite are trying to pull together issues of the cost of a royal commission and issues of the timing of emails. They will not accept at face value the word of the commissioner and they try to imply that, somehow, there is a party political activity happening here, and it simply did not happen. There is no debate over that fact; it did not occur.


I note that Senator Collins, in her contribution during question time, referred to the cost of the royal commission. Quite rightly, given the scale of racketeering and illegal conduct in certain parts of the labour movement, particularly in my home state of Victoria, particularly here in the ACT as has already been brought to public attention by this commission, the costs to the community in terms of public infrastructure—every hospital we build, every private building of any significant size and all our infrastructure—are much, much greater.


This is an attempt at diversion. It is an attempt at diversion from the news that the Labor Party opposite is desperate that the Australian people not know. They do not want the Australian people to know that their masters, their mistresses, those who they work for, those who control their preselections, those who control and provide their slush funds, are involved in serious activity that is being uncovered by this royal admission and has already led to activity in the justice space which I will not go into in any more detail. Before anyone mentions any other events, that is the simple point that the Labor Party is trying to hide.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-08-19,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:30):  I also rise to speak on the motion to take note of answers to questions asked by Senators Collins and Conroy. What did we learn from the answers to these questions? As I am coming to understand, not a great deal. But we did learn from the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, that Dyson Heydon was selected by the government on his recommendation. It is a reminder, if we needed one, that this royal commission is absolutely a creature of the government. It is a creature of the executive. 


It is worth reflecting on the consequences for our nation's institutions of their decision to pursue this royal commission. In this circumstance it is curious to consider that one of the hallmarks of political conservatism is supposed to be respect for our political institutions. Royal commissions are one of the legal institutions of this nation. They have played a respected role in dealing with issues that normal legal and political processes are incapable of dealing with. The Prime Minister showed no respect for the institution of the royal commission when he decided to establish one to inquire into trade unions. This is a blatantly political inquiry for blatantly political purposes. I know it, the people in this chamber know it and the public at large knows it. In establishing the inquiry, the Prime Minister has compromised the respect that royal commissions have previously enjoyed. 


On this, it is perhaps worth quoting former Prime Minister John Howard, who said quite recently:


I’m uneasy about the idea of having royal commissions or inquiries into essentially a political decision on which the public has already delivered a verdict. I don’t think you should ever begin to go down the American path of using the law for narrow targeted political purposes.


Well, that advice was not heeded. Instead, what we have had is an $80 million exercise that is simply designed to smear political opponents. Despite the pious statements today, the government has used the royal commission relentlessly to smear and pursue political opponents.


Of course, this commission now faces a new and more serious challenge. As Senator Sterle outlined in his remarks, a series of events has led the commissioner to reveal circumstances that, quite reasonably, create an apprehension of bias. This comment is not just being made by people on this side of the chamber, but it is being made broadly in the commentary within the community. It is worth reflecting on this. It is a serious and significant matter in relation to a political institution that in the past has served our country well.


The government has relied at times on Julian Burnside, who of course has clarified his position in recent days. In so doing, he made reference to a previous circumstance where a person chairing an inquiry found themselves in a similar position. Just yesterday, Julian Burnside said that in the Australian Broadcasting Authority inquiry into cash for comment a very similar situation arose. The person chairing the inquiry, David Flint, was careless enough to go on air with John Laws when the cross-examination of John Laws had not been completed. He eventually saw the difficulty and stepped aside. That is the explanation that Julian Burnside provided about how people behave in this circumstance. It is quite reasonable for people in this place and people outside this place to raise their concerns about this process.


The royal commission into trade unions is quickly degenerating into a farce. Everybody understands the bias that is present. Everybody understands the way that the government has been using this process simply to smear people it does not like, political organisations it does not like, people who do not agree with the conservative views that they themselves hold. It is time for Mr Abbott, who is the owner, the person who initiated this commission, to recognise what everybody else in the country has realised, not to wait three weeks, as he did with Bronwyn Bishop, but to act now to make his concerns plain and to bring this to an end.

  The government appreciates the intent of this motion but we cannot support it. We recognise that the sponsors of this motion are very concerned about country-of-origin labelling. As the government we recognise that consumers want to know the origin of their food and the government has made considerable progress on country-of-origin labelling. We also note that the senators concerned work on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into seafood labelling and acknowledge the hard work of that committee in the inquiry process. 


The government is currently considering its response to the recommendations from the inquiry into the current requirements of the labelling of seafood and seafood products. We are continuing to consult with the industry on this issue. The government is precluded from acting unilaterally to introduce a compulsory regime. As stated previously in the chamber, the Commonwealth has limited legislative power in the area of food regulation and although standards may be developed by FSANZ, their development enforcement is undertaken in collaboration between and are reliant upon state and territory legislation in Australia and New Zealand.

  I am disappointed with the coalition's response, notwithstanding that there were many coalition senators—including from the National Party—who had made a terrific contribution to the Senate committee inquiry on changing the law. We can make a difference, in terms of seafood labelling. That will make a huge difference to Australian jobs in this country. Thousands of jobs could be created.


I acknowledge Senator Nigel Scullion's work in the Northern Territory. He was the pioneer who got this through in the Northern Territory, where it has been a terrific success. So to say that the Commonwealth cannot act unilaterally, to say that it is all too hard—with respect to the government, if there is a political will on the part of the Commonwealth to show leadership from government, they can do it. I have contrary advice that says that it can be done. But I do want to genuinely acknowledge the coalition senators who have supported this privately and publicly, and I hope that sooner rather than later we will have these seafood labelling laws so that Australian consumers know what they are buying in their restaurant or takeaway shop.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Marriage Equality Plebiscite Bill 2015 will require a national plebiscite on the issue of same-sex marriage, to be conducted at the next general election.


The Bill will determine the timing and question of a plebiscite that will enable electors to indicate their views regarding the issue of marriage equality.


This Bill proposes the question ""Do you support Australia allowing marriage between 2 people regardless of their gender?"".


The sponsors of this Bill share the view that the Parliament should enact specific legislation to direct the question and other machinations of a plebiscite on the issue of marriage equality in Australia, rather than allow these important matters to be determined solely by the Government.


The Bill outlines that there will be compulsory voting in this plebiscite and that it should be held at the same time as the next general election. This choice of timing would significantly reduce the cost of holding the plebiscite.


The issue of funding for both the 'yes' and 'no' cases is dealt with in this Bill, such that Commonwealth funding will be provided as set out in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, specifically subsection 11(4). This means only the basic materials containing arguments in favour of and opposed to the proposed question would be distributed to electors.


If the result of the plebiscite affirms support for marriage between two people regardless of their gender, the Bill affirms it is the intention of the Parliament that this change be legislated within six months of this result being determined.


The sponsors of the Bill share the view that it is essential for the Parliament to legislate to determine the question and other important parameters of a plebiscite on marriage in Australia. For this reason, I/we call on the Senate to support this Bill.

 (Tasmania) (15:54):  I move:


That the Senate notes:


(a) the seven recommendations of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee's inquiry into industry structures and systems governing levies on grass-fed cattle;


(b) that the Minister for Agriculture (Mr Joyce):


(i) has only supported, in principle, two of the seven recommendations, and


(ii) has rejected the primary recommendation, being the establishment of a legislated producer‑owned body;


(c) that the Australian Beef Association, the Cattle Council of Australia, and the Australian Meat Producers Group and Concerned Beef Producers have presented a united voice to the Minister for Agriculture in support of the primary recommendation to establish a legislated producer‑owned body; and


(d) that claims by the Liberal and National parties that they are supporters of the Australian beef industry are undermined by the failure of the Minister for Agriculture to support the united voice of beef producers.




I seek leave to make a short statement.





The PRESIDENT:
Leave is granted for one minute.





Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Last year the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee put down a Senate report that recommended a total overhaul of the beef levy system in this country. Ten years prior to that the same committee made the same recommendation. There was a considerable amount of hope and optimism among beef producers around this country that we would actually see an overhaul of the beef levy system. Twelve months and seven recommendations later, only two of them have been given in-principle support by the government but there has been absolutely no action. This motion is very clear here today. This is a rocket from the Senate to go underneath the Minister for Agriculture. I admit, it may not lift him off the ground but it will make him uncomfortable. He needs to act on the Senate recommendations and he needs to act now. If he really does support beef producers—

Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  This is both a false and a misleading motion in the way it has been drafted. What producers wanted was transparency, accountability and better resourcing for peak bodies and that is happening. They wanted reform and we are seeing the most progressive reform we have seen in decades in the body that governs this, Meat and Livestock Australia. Let me tell all Australians who might be listening one thing. When you want to find out what needs to happen in agriculture, you should not listen to the anti-jobs and the anti-agriculture body of the Greens. They are against live exports. They do not just want to change the way things happen in agriculture; they want it to stop. I recommend that the Senate consider this motion carefully and reject it.

The speeches read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SUPERANNUATION BILL 2015


The Australian Government is resolutely committed to supporting Australian Defence Force (ADF) members throughout their service and in their retirement. 


The Australian Defence Force Superannuation Bill 2015 (the Bill) gives effect to the Government's intent to introduce new, modern and flexible superannuation arrangements for people joining the ADF on and after 1 July 2016. The Bill establishes a new superannuation scheme to be known as ADF Super. 


The Bill fixes some of the longest running grievances of the veteran and ex-service community, namely a lack of flexibility in the current military superannuation scheme and the lack of portability of a member's superannuation benefit when they leave the ADF.


At the outset I thank the Defence Force Welfare Association, the RSL and the Australian Defence Association for their feedback and for supporting this legislation. I also acknowledge the opposition for their support for this important set of changes.


ADF Super forms a significant part of the Government's plan to provide flexible service arrangements for all ADF members. Importantly, as part of this plan current serving personnel who are members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) may opt to join ADF Super, but they will not be compelled to do so.


ADF Super will be a modern, fully funded accumulation superannuation scheme. 


ADF Super will, for the first time, allowADF members to choose the superannuation fund they belong to. It will provide superannuation choice and enable ADF members to select any complying superannuation fund to invest their superannuation benefit.



A default military superannuation fund

will be established and managed by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, which is the trustee for the major Commonwealth superannuation schemes, including the current and past military superannuation schemes.


In recognising the unique nature of military service the Government has agreed to a single employer contribution rate of 16.4 per cent, which is a generous rate well above community standards. 



ADF Super

will apply to:


those joining the ADF for the first time on and after 1 July 2016; 


contributing MSBS members who choose to join ADF Super;


preserved MSBS members who re-join the ADF and choose to become a member of ADF Super; and


MSBS and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme members who receive retirement pay and re-join the ADF on a full time basis or as a Reservist on Continuous Full Time Service on or after 1 July 2016.


Contributing DFRDB members do not have the option to transfer to ADF Super.


The current MSBS will be closed to new members from 1 July 2016.



Unlike previous military schemes, such as the MSBS which requires a minimum employee contribution of 5 per cent of salary, there will be no requirement for ADF Super members to make employee contributions to their superannuation.




As a result, contributing MSBS members who choose to become ADF Super members will immediately receive a 5 per cent increase to their take home pay as they are no longer required to make compulsory employee contributions. 



Accompanying ADF Super will be a new statutory death and invalidity scheme, known as ADF Cover. ADF Cover will be consistent with the death and invalidity arrangements ADF personnel currently receive as MSBS members. It will ensure that ADF members are properly looked after, for the rest of their life if required, in the event they are injured during their ADF service.


ADF Super recognises the unique nature of military service, and importantly, provides greater flexibility for individuals in how they manage their finances at various stages of their working life.


I commend the Bill 


 


AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE COVER BILL 2015


The Australian Defence Force Cover Bill 2015 (the Bill) gives effect to the Government's commitment to introduce new, modern superannuation arrangements for people joining the Australian Defence Force (ADF) on and after 1 July 2016. The Bill establishes a new statutory death and invalidity scheme to be known as ADF Cover.


Due to the unique nature of military service it is often difficult for ADF members to obtain death and invalidity cover at a reasonable cost under group insurance arrangements. ADF Cover addresses this issue by ensuring all ADF personnel who are members of the ADF Super scheme have full death and invalidity cover.


ADF Cover provides all members who join on and after 1 July 2016 with death and invalidity cover consistent with that provided to members of the current Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). It will apply regardless of the superannuation fund chosen by the ADF member. 


As is the case for current MSBS members, ADF members will not be required to make any contributions to ADF Cover and all benefits paid under ADF Cover will be met from consolidated revenue.




Benefits for Incapacity





ADF Cover will provide benefits for ADF members who are medically discharged and whose capacity to undertake civilian employment is limited as a result of a medical condition that occurs while serving in the ADF.





If that capacity is reduced by 60 per cent or more, they will be classified as Class A and receive an appropriate pension. 





If that capacity is reduced by 30 per cent or more, but less than 60 per cent, then they will be classified as Class B and receive an appropriate pension.





If a member
'
s capacity is reduced by less than 30 per cent they will be classified as Class C and their superannuation will be preserved in the fund of their choice. The preserved benefit is subject to the normal age preservation rules for release.





Under ADF Cover the death and invalidity benefits provided will be consistent with the death and invalidity benefits provided under the current MSBS.





Benefits for Death





If an ADF member dies in service, or if an invalid dies while receiving an invalidity pension, benefits will be paid to the dependants of that member or invalid, or to their estate.





In the case of an invalid or ADF member who dies, their spouse (if any) will receive a reversionary pension or lump sum. The pension will be increased if there are eligible children. If that spouse later dies and was themselves receiving a pension, any eligible children will also receive a reversionary pension. 





If an invalid dies with no spouse but with eligible children, the eligible children will receive a reversionary pension. If an ADF member dies in service with no spouse but with eligible children, then the eligible children will receive a lump sum. In the case of an ADF member who has no spouse or 
eligible children, a lump sum will go to the estate or the legal personal representative of the ADF member. 





ADF Cover recognises the unique nature of military service and offers important protection for ADF members and their family consistent with that provided under the current MSBS.



I commend the Bill


 


DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION AND ADF COVER) BILL 2015




Measures to implement ADF Super and ADF Cover



The Australian Defence Legislation Amendment (Superannuation and ADF Cover) Bill 2015 (the Bill) contains the consequential amendments necessary to establish the ADF Super and ADF Cover arrangements. In line with the Government's drive to cut red tape, the Bill also contains a number of measures to reduce the administrative complexity of the current and previously closed military superannuation schemes.




Measures for Children



The current Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) and closed Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme provide pensions for children of deceased Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and former ADF members. To qualify for a benefit, children over 16 must demonstrate they are in full-time education. 


In contemporary Australia the majority of high school students do not leave school until they reach 18. This Bill modernises the arrangements of the current and closed schemes so that children only have to demonstrate they are in full-time education once they reach the age of 18. 


This will reduce the administrative burden on families receiving a benefit under the current and closed military schemes, as well as the burden on the administrator of those schemes.




Re-entered Members



At present all DFRDB retirement pay recipients who re-enter the ADF full time or as a Reservist on Continuous Full Time Service must make an election to either become a MSBS member, not become a MSBS member or to again become a DFRDB contributing member before commencing their further service. 


If no election is made or the election is not made before commencing re-entered service, the re-entered member becomes a MSBS member by operation of the law. 


If the person elects to become a member of the MSBS their retirement pay is suspended until such time they complete their period of service. 


If the person elects to again become a DFRDB contributing member their retirement pay is cancelled and recalculated after the further period of service is completed, noting that the additional service must be for more than 12 months for this to apply. 


After 1 July 2016, all DFRDB scheme retirement pay recipients who re-enter for further service will be able to choose which superannuation fund they belong to, noting they cannot re-join the closed DFRDB scheme.


Importantly, they will continue to receive their retirement pay while accumulating further superannuation benefits in the fund of their choice. Put another way, they will no longer have their retirement pay suspended or cancelled as is currently the case.


Likewise, those members currently receiving a MSBS pension who re-enter for a further period of service will also be able to join a superannuation fund of their choice, again noting they cannot re-join the closed MSBS. They will also continue to receive their pension during that period of service while accumulating further superannuation benefits.




Flexible Service



The Bill also facilitates the introduction of significant reforms to the ADF's future workforce model. This Bill enables a new category of flexible service for members of the Permanent ADF.



Defence is a modern, flexible and responsive employer. The introduction of Flexible Service Arrangements will better secure the ADF's capability by:


encouraging skilled and experienced people to stay in the ADF longer; and


promoting greater consistency in the application of formal flexible service arrangements.


The Bill will enable permanent ADF members to seek flexible service arrangements that can be structured on the number of days worked per week, weeks per month, or even months per year.


Importantly, the application of the flexible service arrangements will remain cognisant of the need to balance the ADF member's needs with Defence's capability requirements. 


ADF personnel should be encouraged to pursue longer-term and worthwhile careers within a modern and innovative Defence Force. This Bill facilitates the introduction of a new workforce model and will help to ensure Defence get the most out of its people and those people get the most out of their Defence career.


I commend the Bill

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (17:48):  I want to address some of the issues that were raised by those opposite. Senator Collins made some comments in relation to the government supporting the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014. We agreed to this legislation without the mandatory minimum sentences to ensure that other important measures contained in the bill were passed without further delay. These important measures included introducing offences for the trafficking of firearms and firearm parts into and out of Australia and expanding the offences for trafficking firearms within Australia to include parts. We took to the election a commitment to implement tougher penalties for gun-related crime, and that is why we are now reintroducing the minimum sentences into this legislation.


Can I also address some of the comments that were raised in relation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, in relation to a number of issues. Firstly, in relation to arbitrary detention we believe that there are appropriate limitations and safeguards in place to ensure that detention is reasonable, necessary and proportionate to each individual case. We consider that the mandatory minimum penalties for firearm trafficking are reasonable and necessary to deter people from diverting firearms into the illicit market, where they can be accessed by criminals and used in the commission of serious and violent crimes. Given that the provisions do not impose a mandatory nonparole period, the actual time a person will be incarcerated will remain at the discretion of the sentencing judge. And, consistent with these concerns raised by that committee, the government has amended the explanatory memorandum for the bill to note that the mandatory minimum sentence is not intended as a guide to the nonparole period, which in some cases may differ significantly from the head sentence. This level of judicial discretion provides protection against arbitrary detention and demonstrates the government's commitment to limiting any infringement against this right. The provisions include a number of other limitations and safeguards against arbitrary detention, including that they do not apply to children—those under the age of 18—and do not prevent appeal of a conviction or of any sentence above the mandatory minimum.


Issues were also raised in relation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in relation to the right to a fair trial. We do not believe that the mandatory minimum for firearms trafficking offences contravenes a person's right to a fair trial. The minimum term of imprisonment will only apply if a person is convicted of an offence as a result of a fair trial, in accordance with such procedures as are established by law. Furthermore, the penalty does not prevent the appeal of a conviction or of any sentence above the mandatory minimum. And I note that the validity of mandatory minimum penalties for aggravated people-smuggling offences in the Migration Act was upheld as constitutionally valid by the High Court in the matter of Magaming v The Queen.


Can I also address the issue of advice from the Law Council of Australia suggesting that mandatory minimums reduce the likelihood of offenders pleading guilty. The government notes the concerns of the Law Council of Australia in relation to mandatory minimum sentencing; however, the government is of the firm view that the introduction of these penalties will send a strong deterrent message to those who would otherwise engage in firearms trafficking.


We note that the Law Council of Australia has suggested that the presence of mandatory minimum sentences reduces the likelihood of offenders pleading guilty as offenders are aware that a guilty plea will still result in the prescribed minimum sentence. However, the government has not attached a non-parole period to the mandatory minimum sentence to ensure there is still an incentive to enter a guilty plea as the particular circumstances of each case will be considered by the court and the sentencing judge will be able to exercise their discretion in determining the amount of time that an offender actually spends in jail.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (19:19):  Tonight I wish—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator McGRATH:
  It is another record from Senator Conroy, the parliamentary embodiment of jazz hands.


Tonight I wish to pay homage to the passing of a car. Indeed, the car I mourn passes further into folklore when it ceases production in December this year. To confuse matters even further, it is not a car, and other descriptors like 'utility vehicle' or 'automobile' fail to do this most beautiful of creatures justice. Of course I am mourning, in that most platonic of relationships—between man and woman and the Land Rover Defender—the sad end of the Land Rover Defender's production.


I am the proud owner of a 2012 model Land Rover 110. I will own it until the day I die. It is called Boris, after I ran a poll on Facebook during the 2013 election campaign. It is white, with LNP stickers on the back and a Fulham Football Club sticker on the side. I do not think I have cleaned it since we began our relationship back in 2012, but to me that adds to the patina of its greatness. There is golden retriever hair from one end of the Land Rover to the other. There are remnants of stale Macca's chips down the seats, and a few stains of doubtful parentage decorate the interior.


Ever since I was a small boy I have dreamt of owning a Land Rover Defender. Others may dream of walking on the moon or playing cricket for Australia, but I wanted a clunky, 'brick on wheels', 'tough as nanna's teeth' beast of a vehicle. Perhaps it is from my childhood in regional Queensland, but there is something about a tractor or a cane harvester that makes me quite excited. But the one vehicle that stands out from them all, the one vehicle that makes me very, very excited, is the Land Rover Defender. Her Majesty the Queen is known to be quite fond of the Land Rover, which has become a symbol of British sturdiness.


Land Rover owners are a special bunch, and anyone who owns or drives or falls in love with a Land Rover is a pretty solid citizen. While driving along we always give ourselves a wave to the other drivers, because good manners cost nothing, while owning a Land Rover is priceless. But sadly, after 67 years of continuous production, the nanny-staters and crypto-communists in the European Union have killed off this great vehicle, with production to cease at the end of this year.


So, let us reflect on the Land Rover Defender and on the Land Rover. The genesis of the Land Rover occurred on a Welsh beach in 1947, when Maurice Wilks, chairman of the Rover company, sketched out the silhouette of the vehicle in the sand. And to be brutally honest, the shape of the Land Rover has not changed much since the late 1940s and that adds to the special magic of the Defender. The first Defenders rolled out in early 1948 when Ben Chifley was Prime Minister and George VI was on the throne. It was brought out because it was thought British farmers and indeed Commonwealth farmers would need a cheap, sturdy off-road vehicle.


The Land Rover was made from cheap aluminium and painted in military green because that was the only paint that was left after the end of the Second World War. Though lacking in comfort—and any Land Rover driver will tell you that even the modern versions are particularly uncomfortable—the Land Rover fulfilled the need for a sturdy and powerful vehicle to deal with whatever nature could throw up. Land Rovers became used by the British military, which bought thousands of vehicles for everyone from the medical corps to the SAS. Civilian versions were modelled for tanks, trains, conveyor belts, snowploughs, fire engines and hover vans.


Over the decades since, the Land Rover has become as synonymous with farming, adventure, life-saving, exploring and enterprise as it has with warfare and it has also become synonymous with the LNP Queensland in 2012-13, when Senator Canavan joined me on some particularly bumpy rides up and down the Bruce Highway. The modern specifications of the Land Rover Defender are something to behold. I would encourage you to go to the Land Rover website using the internet machine to find out how fantastic these vehicles are. I am not acting on a commission here but, Mr Acting Deputy President Dastyari, I think you will agree with me that they are so good that you will want to go and buy one. 


Every single Land Rover has been made in the same factory in Solihull since 1948. There is even a test track of rugged terrain, water and mud, trees and hills—something I experienced while on a regional tour with my then boss, the chairman of the Conservative Party, Francis Maude, now Lord Maude, who happened to get bogged on one occasion.


Interestingly, another random fun fact is that Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond was born in Solihull. So it was quite fitting that Top Gear dedicated a special to the Land Rover earlier this year. Hammond took a 64-year-old Land Rover Defender to the Claerwen dam in Wales and climbed up the dam face using a strong winch powered by a secondary engine, replicating an ad which showed off the Land Rover back in the 1960s. If ever you needed a demonstration that this machine could do anything, it was that.


But now, it is all coming to an end. Tata, the current owners of Jaguar Land Rover, say that the decision to stop production is 'mainly legislation based', which is code for green-tape. Indeed, new European emission standards are making the Land Rover Defender illegal in Europe. It has become too much effort to comply with the environmental activists in Brussels. And so the Land Rover is going to be produced in Eastern Europe. The twentieth of December 2015 will be a very sad day, when the last Land Rover rolls off the production line at Solihull. We must be vigilant here in Australia that we do not allow Australian resource industries to suffer a similar fate at the hands of eco-terrorists and socialists, especially when they are trying to use the law to cut jobs and cut Australian industries. The only thing wrong with the Land Rover Defender is its parentage—it should be Australian rather than British.
