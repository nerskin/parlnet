"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Extradition: A review of Australia's law and policy—Report 40, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I have just tabled contains the results of an inquiry by the treaties committee into Australia's extradition law and policy. Over the past 20 years some high profile extradition cases, including those involving Robert Trimbole, the late Christopher Skase and certain alleged World War II criminals such as Konrad Kalejs, have attracted considerable public attention and debate in Australia. It is clearly in the interests of Australia, and other nations, to have in place an effective network that prevents criminals from escaping justice, especially those involved in transborder crimes such as money laundering, drug trafficking and people-smuggling. We believe it is in our interest to ensure that Australia does not become a haven for those who have committed serious offences elsewhere.
At the same time, however, it is important to ensure that people are protected against false allegations, unlawful prosecution and possible punishment in countries outside Australia. It is balancing these competing concerns that is at the very heart of extradition policy. Australia's current approach to extradition derives from the Extradition Act 1988. This act introduced major changes to our extradition arrangements, the most significant of which was to introduce a `no evidence' model as the default option for new treaties that Australia entered into. Under this model, a country requesting extradition of an Australian citizen to face trial abroad need not produce any evidence to support the allegations of criminal conduct; instead, the requesting country need only supply a statement of the alleged conduct.
This model represents a radical departure from the requirements that had previously applied, and that still apply, under Australia's extradition arrangements with other Commonwealth countries—that is, a prima facie standard of evidence must be shown before a person can be surrendered. During our examination last year of Australia's proposed extradition treaty with Latvia, we on the committee became concerned that the no evidence model may not provide sufficient protection for Australians who are accused of crimes in other countries. Accordingly, we decided to conduct this review.
Having received and considered evidence on the issue, we do not favour the continuation of the no evidence approach to extradition. Other countries such as the United States, which is our main extradition partner, and Canada require a higher standard of proof before their courts will agree that one of their citizens should be surrendered. We consider that similar standards should be applied in relation to requests for extradition of our own citizens from Australia. We are not suggesting that a minitrial should be held in Australia before a person is surrendered to another country to face charges, but we are strongly of the view that justice demands that our courts should be able to scrutinise at least some evidence more closely than is currently the case before one of our own citizens is surrendered to face prosecution abroad.
Because our inquiry has revealed a wide range of views on precisely what higher standard should apply before surrender takes place, we believe there should be further consultation with the legal profession and other interested parties before a final model is determined. We think the most appropriate vehicle for this further consultation and consideration is the Australian Law Reform Commission. The commission has the experience, resources, expertise and, more importantly, the independence necessary to conduct a comprehensive examination of the merits and consequences of raising the evidentiary standard. It must be said in this context that some officials within the executive in this country do not favour raising the evidentiary standard: they see anything in the way of a successful extradition as somehow being against public policy. We disagree with that. We consider that the terms of reference for the commission's review should be sufficiently broad to allow examination not just of the evidentiary standard but also of certain other matters that I do not have the time to go into now. I urge those listening to the debate today to pay attention to what other members of the committee have to say about this report. We considered it in great detail, and it was a matter of conscience for some members. I commend the report to the House.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The purpose of the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was to deal with the problems of extradition, about which—with some high profile people attracting public attention—there has been considerable debate in Australia. It seems somewhat ironic that this report, entitled Extradition: A review of Australia's law and policy, has been tabled on the day Christopher Skase has purportedly died. According to his lawyers and others in Majorca, it seems that he has finally escaped the extradition proceedings altogether.
Other important issues were raised in submissions and during our hearings. They were: the appropriate division of responsibility between the executive and the courts in determining extradition matters; the inability of the person whose extradition has been sought to present evidence, such as alibi evidence; the presumption against bail; and, the type of offence for which extradition is available. As noted previously, the Attorney-General—or the Minister for Justice and Customs, acting on the Attorney-General's behalf—has final responsibility for determining whether to surrender a person on request by a foreign country. Traditionally extradition has been an executive function. As the Attorney-General's Department explained:
Extradition involves issues of international relations as well as justice. For reasons of diplomacy a government may wish to describe its grounds for refusing an extradition in less confrontational terms than a strict legal consideration of the position might suggest. Moreover, a government may have access to confidential sources of information on the internal affairs of a requesting country; significant problems could result from any need to substantiate such information in court.
There may be occasions when consideration needs to be given to the possibility of refusing extradition of an otherwise eligible person because of concerns about whether an extradition partner is fulfilling its obligations under the relevant arrangement or treaty, or indeed whether there are conditions or developments in the country which make it an unsuitable treaty partner. These are all matters which a minister is better positioned to handle than are the courts ...
There were strong arguments throughout the hearings to suggest that courts should have an expanded role in scrutinising the evidence presented by a requesting country. This should include consideration of objections to extradition and other evidence, such as strong exculpatory evidence led by persons who are subject to extradition, to help determine whether a person is an extraditable person. There were also arguments to suggest that the presumption against bail may be overly strict in some cases, with the current threshold being too low, and that a person who has been surrendered to another country to face trail should not have to pay for the cost of his or her return to Australia.
Overall the committee recommended that, because the law relating to extradition is so complex and changes could have significant consequences, a further consultation and an ongoing review should give consideration to these matters in more detail. It is important that we work on the premise of Western democracy and law that a person is innocent until proven guilty. We must be sure that the rights of a person being sought for extradition are not in any way expunged by administrative expediency. I commend the report to the House. A good deal of work has gone into the report. This is a very complex issue, which the committee has given good consideration to in the report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—I am also pleased to lend my support to the 40th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled Extradition: A review of Australia's law and policy. The member for Lyons remarked on the irony of the apparent passing of Christopher Skase on the same day that this report has been tabled. Perhaps it will be of far more relevance and interest to the fourth estate, which may find some interest in reading through this report. 
This report is not framed in a hugely holistic tome sort of way, although there are some learned legal types on the committee. Without wishing to be offensive, the committee is made up of far more practical people—ordinary members of parliament from various walks of life. I am sure that the QCs and others who are deliberately interested in this area will pull it apart and seek some views from other bodies such as the Law Reform Commission, which is one of the recommendations of the inquiry.
The report proves that Australia has some very tough immigration laws. When you review the whole matter of extradition in Australia, there are not too many cases of people wanting to take those who come to this country out of this country to face some trial somewhere else. The recent case of Konrad Kalejs perhaps stands out against that broad statement. Our immigration laws put some very hard pressure on those aspiring to come and live here—or, indeed, to visit here—to prove the quality of their character. Australia has not become a safe haven for criminals around the world. I remember Ronald Biggs was here at one stage in the 1960s, but moved on to somewhere else. This perhaps proves the efficacy of inquiring into the character of those who try to come here. By the same token, there are many in our community who would like to see us apply lower standards to some who come here as refugees and to deal with them in a far more timely fashion.
This country has standards that value individuals. As this report highlights, the proof of evidence—the demand for a case to be put for someone to be taken from our shores to somewhere else—is very demanding. We are not advocating a series of minitrials for any who may come this way, but we do not want to see countries lever out someone who was perhaps a political activist in their old country. Many in my electorate have come from the Horn of Africa with a political belief different from that of the ruling party. We do not want to see these people being levered out of a safe haven here in Australia just because someone wanted to put them on some sort of trial for some kind of political reason. The committee do not see extradition as simply an administrative process where a request is filled over a period of time; we believe it is quite fair and reasonable to demand some sort of proof of evidence—some sort of understanding—that the charge made is not spurious, and that it is something that will stick.
We also express some concern about the penalty that may face someone should they face trial. There are arrangements in place to ensure that people taken out of this country are not going to face the death penalty and other penalties such as torture, because we in this country do not believe in those sorts of penalties. But, as I said, there are those who would like to see illegal migrants or aspiring refugees who land on this shore dealt with in a far more curt way—in other words, sent straight back. But we, as a generous nation, offer them the opportunity to put their case, to produce their evidence and to stake their claim for refugee status. If they do establish that—as some five per cent of the people who come to this country seem to manage to do—they are afforded the opportunity to stay. We even go so far as to extend the generosity of the right of appeal in these matters. 
Of course, those opposite are very sluggish in their support of us trying to streamline these matters and are, in fact, facing a deal of condemnation from the broad community. There are a lot of people who are more than a little dissatisfied with the way our generous systems are being abused by those who seek to make a lot of money out of the process of appeal and the process of representing people who may face forced extradition from this country. 
With CHOGM coming, and some of the notable hoons and hooligans who come from countries whose standards are not as good as ours who want to bring violent and heated protests into my city of Brisbane, I hope that we will look at a big stick approach to threaten those people with far faster extradition than is currently the case. But those matters are not directly associated with this report. I commend the report to the House.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—In the course of this inquiry, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties heard conflicting evidence from various witnesses about the suitability of a no evidence provision in the extradition process. On the one hand, there were those who supported the no evidence provision because it represents a practical means of facilitating the extradition process—a position that reflects the original reason that the no evidence rule was introduced in around 1985 by the government of the day. It is a practical approach because of the differences between countries in their legal systems and the rules of evidence which apply. It is still a requirement under the no evidence provision that a statement of the alleged conduct be supplied. 
We received evidence from the Attorney-General's Department, who stated that the adoption of the no evidence procedure had facilitated entry into extradition treaties with civil law countries and that, since the option had become available, 30 bilateral treaties had been negotiated or renegotiated, compared with only five in the previous 19 years. Australia has entered into extradition treaties only with countries where it believes that an individual would receive a fair trial if they were extradited. So some very good arguments and evidence have been presented as to why a no evidence provision should apply. On the other hand, the accused must be afforded fair treatment by the legal system, and there are those who are of the belief that `no evidence' does not allow for this. 
We received evidence regarding the prima facie case. Several witnesses to the inquiry criticised the abandonment of that test in favour of the no evidence model. They were particularly concerned that this move had effectively taken from the courts the responsibility of safeguarding the rights of individuals and left it in the hands of the executive. It is, therefore, appropriate that the Australian Law Reform Commission undertake a more detailed investigation into this matter and make recommendations to parliament. These recommendations could then be used to develop a framework for Australia on the level of evidence that would need to be presented before extradition could take place. Until that investigation has taken place, I believe that parliament could not be adequately informed to allow it to make recommendations on this aspect of extradition policy. It is logical to recommend, for example, that the no evidence model be discontinued while at the same time recommending that the Australian Law Reform Commission undertake an investigation into this matter. It is good to see that we are actually going to be investigating those issues.
The treaties committee identified several different models in addition to the no evidence model that is available at the moment that the Australian Law Reform Commission could consider and provide recommendations on. It is far more appropriate to pursue this course of action, so that the parliament can ultimately make informed decisions on extradition policy. It is also appropriate that the Australian Law Reform Commission investigate some of the broader aspects of extradition policy. Again, the treaties committee should base its recommendations on extradition policy on the advice it receives from the Australian Law Reform Commission. These two recommendations are appropriate, and should be supported. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—Mr Speaker, in presenting the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000, we note that the Australian public have a right to be cynical about politicians spending their money on advertising campaigns. Since the government came to power in 1996, every Australian family has paid at least $108 in tax towards this government's advertising. That is $108 per family. In five years this government has spent at least $550 million in advertising expenditure. Compared to the last five years when Labor was in office, government advertising under this government has trebled.  
But it gets worse. In the lead-up to the next election, the government will spend around $20 million a month—all in an attempt to save its political hide. To anyone who has seen those ads, it is abundantly clear that this is not advertising simply to inform the community about government programs, but advertising to promote the political agenda of this government. That is why the Labor Party will do its best to try to stop this misuse of taxpayers' funds with this bill I present today. 
Last year this government was Australia's biggest spender on advertising—beating Coca-Cola, Telstra, Coles Myer, McDonald's, Toyota and other major corporations. Think of the number of times you have seen a McDonald's commercial or a Coca-Cola commercial in recent times; then ponder on the fact that the Howard government has actually spent more on advertising. This is money that should have been spent on better hospitals and better schools, not on a desperate bid to be re-elected. This government will not address the need for better hospitals and schools, but it will spend millions of dollars on advertising to help it win the next election. No wonder people are cynical about politics, when they see the huge amount this government is wasting on advertisements. Australians will not be tricked into believing this propaganda.
In the last two months, we have been bombarded with political advertisements on issues ranging from social matters to tax issues. But this is just the beginning. In recent months you would have seen several campaigns, including the private health insurance gap ads, which will cost the Australian taxpayer $15 million over the next three months. As my colleague Jenny Macklin, Labor's health spokesperson, has said, this amount could fund 1,250 hip replacements or 1,000 operations. Should we be elected to office, we have already identified, in the area that Jenny Macklin will represent as minister for health, $90 million for a cancer program—something which affects the lives of just about every Australian family. How much better that we spend it on that, rather than looting the public purse for the purposes of this ignoble government and the wretched political party underpinning it. If the government wants to inform private health insurance subscribers of their rights, it should get the information to those people alone, not the entire electorate. Why does the government have to spend millions of dollars advertising something that should be paid not by the Australian taxpayer but by the private health insurance companies? They are not short of a quid, with absolutely bulging coffers at this moment.
We have also seen a $4.1 million ad campaign to publicise budget measures for pensioners and retiree benefits. This figure could rise as high as $6 million once production and research costs are taken into account. But this information could have been sent through a mail-out to those affected. This would have been a much cheaper and more effective method. There is no reason why the government needed to spend millions to inform pensioners anyway; the $300 that they are getting from the budget would be automatically deposited into their accounts. It is an absolute scandal that the money is spent on this advertising rather than on the many other needs of the elderly.
Then there was the $5 million campaign on the abolition of the financial institutions duty. This is a state tax—and the whole kit and caboodle of any benefit of that financial institutions duty change has been seized by the banks in massively increased bank charges. This government does not even have the guts to go to the banks and say, `You will pass this on to consumers. You will put in place a social contract to ensure that the elderly and families are given decent services.' It has not got the courage to do that. It put out that $5 million campaign on that state tax—the financial institutions duty—and the banks got it all; the public got nothing. But I did not notice that featuring in any of the ads.  
Let us not forget the $6 million for an advertising campaign to encourage farmers to apply for a grant on the Agriculture—Advancing Australia scheme. With this money, every Australian farmer could have received 60 letters encouraging him or her to apply for the grant. But wait, there's more! The Howard government will soon launch three, possibly four, more advertising campaigns. The government has already started producing its $6.7 million Telstra Networking the Nation advertising program, in an attempt to try to highlight the service delivery to the bush. But rural and regional Australia is not going to be fooled by the propaganda. Instead of actually spending the $6.7 million on programs that will help the bush, it has spent that amount on advertising, in the vain hope that it will convince the electorate to vote for the third round of Telstra privatisation. `Not on your nelly,' say the people in regional Australia—as I have occasion to know, having spent a couple of weeks with them in the course of the last six weeks, talking to them about Telstra. I know exactly what they think about the proposition on privatisation, and they are our views, not the views of this government. 
We also know that the government has started filming a $4.2 million advertising campaign to promote its Work for the Dole program. This program has failed to help the unemployed, and it has no real training component, particularly for the long-term unemployed. We are just starting to see the corrupt scandals emerging with the government's Job Network program—and I bet they will not be advertising any of the corruption on that front!
There is also in the pipeline a $5 million campaign to highlight John Howard's innovation strategy—a totally inadequate strategy unveiled last January. Why have they waited this long to highlight it with an expensive advertising campaign? We all know that this government decimated research and development programs, industry research and university funding over the last five years. Now it is trying to play catch-up with Labor's Knowledge Nation. We are flattered, but it will spend $5 million on advertising, which could have been spent on those very programs, its catch-up with Labor's Knowledge Nation.
We also hear that there is going to be another major advertising campaign, would you believe: $4.5 million going into advertisements for a Jobs Network campaign in the first half of the financial year, to maintain the momentum of information. It will be maintaining the momentum of corruption—and there will be no information associated with that. There will be $4.5 million of public funds going to that effort.
These are not genuine information campaigns. Paul Gardner, chairman of one of the top advertising agencies in Australia, Grey Worldwide, recently told the Australian, when asked his opinion on the `no gap' ads and the new pension payment advertisements: 
And I think in some cases, the Government is selling rather than telling ... they certainly deliver information in a way that paints the Government in a better light.
He is absolutely right. This government is in the business of selling rather than telling, and always has been. 
Who could forget the `Unchain my heart' campaign last year in the lead-up the GST? This campaign was not informative, it was certainly not objective, and it was definitely political. If the government had followed the Auditor-General's recommended rules, the `Unchain my heart' campaign would never have been aired. And yet this government spent $46 million on the `Unchain my heart' ads—the most expensive ad campaign ever undertaken in this country. The `Unchain my heart' ads claimed that Australia would move from a tax regime that was restrictive to a tax regime that was simpler. What a remarkable assertion that was. It never pointed out that there would be a surge in employment at the tax office, with excise inspectors and officials—at least 4,000 at the tax office and the ACCC and 500 in Customs—to monitor this simpler tax regime.
Nor did the campaign point out that the number of pages in legislation would skyrocket under their new simple system. Nor did it explain the number of people who would now find themselves unpaid tax collectors. Even the tax office is admitting to customers how complex this tax system is, and yet the advertisements claimed it would `unchain our hearts'. It has unchained our anger; there is no doubt about that. This is one of the scandals for which the Australian people are unanimous in their condemnation of the Howard government.  
It is important to be reminded of the central tenets on advertising adopted by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit which the Howard government has refused to adopt. The committee stated last year that information campaigns should be justified by a cost benefit analysis. The nature of the campaign should be justified in terms of society's needs, efficiency and effectiveness. It stated that care should be taken to ensure that media placement of government advertising is determined on a needs basis and targeted accordingly. But do you think that John Howard has paid any attention to these recommendations? Of course he has not. If he had, he would not be spending $20 million a month in the lead-up to the next federal election. Not only has he ignored the Auditor-General's recommendations; he has also ignored his Liberal led Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit which signed off on these guidelines. 
That is why I present this bill today. It will do what this government will not: stop the blatant waste of money for political gain. If Labor is elected, we will get rid of the `sell' in political advertisements and make sure that all political advertising is informative. It was the Prime Minister who in September 1995 said: 
We will ask the Auditor-General to establish a set of guidelines and we will run our advertisements past the Auditor-General and they will need to satisfy those guidelines.
That promise, like so many others, was a non-core promise.
Let me outline what this bill does and where it comes from. This bill will amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to require government advertising to meet minimum standards with respect to objectivity, fairness and accountability. It will prohibit expenditure of taxpayers' money on advertising which promotes party political interests. The bill makes it improper to use, or permit to be used, any public money for a government information program unless that program is in accordance with the principles and guidelines for use of government advertising. This is in addition to the other ways in which public money may be improperly used or disposed of. 
The bill has been redrafted from its earlier version to streamline and improve some of its language and provisions. Importantly, it allows an advertising campaign to be immediately stopped by a court order if it breaches the guidelines. A failure to stop such an advertisement would then be punishable as a contempt of court. This means that a government minister who allows, or continues to allow, improper advertising would face a hefty fine or a period of imprisonment. The bill sets out principles and guidelines for the use of government advertising which are substantially the same as the draft guidelines recommended in October 1998 by the Auditor-General. This followed a report on the government's $15 million tax reform advertising campaign in the lead-up to the 1998 general election. You will remember that campaign. Nowhere in the two weeks of campaigning and the huge expenditure were the words `goods and services tax' mentioned. The Auditor-General found that to be an absurdity, given that at the heart of the government's proposals was a $30 billion gorilla of a new tax.
The Labor Party understands that governments have to inform people. We are not saying that governments should be excluded from advertising, and this bill would not do that. We know that there are a number of campaigns such as health warnings, health problems and modest, well-targeted defence recruitment—governments are obliged to spend money in the community's interest. But there is the potential for abuse here, and therefore there need to be sensible safeguards. 
The principles and guidelines we propose, among other things, are: government advertising material should be relevant to government responsibilities; this material should be presented in an objective and fair manner; that the information in government advertising should be based on accurate, verifiable facts which are carefully and precisely expressed in conformity with those facts; no claim or statements should be made that cannot be substantiated; the recipient of the information should always be able to distinguish clearly and easily between facts on one hand and comment, opinion and analysis on the other; material should not be liable to misrepresentation as party political; information campaigns should not be intentionally promoting, or perceived to be promoting, party political interests; material should be presented in an unbiased and objective language and in a manner free from partisan promotion of government policy and political argument; material should not directly attack or scorn the views, policies or actions of others; no information campaigns should be undertaken without a justifiable cost benefit analysis; the cost of the chosen scale and methods of communicating information must be justifiable in terms of achieving the identified objectives at the least practicable expense. 
Nobody should be fooled by this government's campaign of advertising. Nobody is fooled. Everybody knows it to be the corruption that it is. And everybody knows and has their favourite program which would really serve the needs of the people of Australia if that program were to be funded out of this advertising money. In our case you can bet your bottom dollar it will be. (Time expired)

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	expresses its support for the development of the Kokoda Track as a National Memorial Park; and
(2)	calls on the Government to:
	(a)	support and fund the construction of an all weather road from Kokoda to Ower's Corner, and of educational memorials at each of the battle sites along the Track;
	(b)	commemorate the 60th anniversary of our brave armed forces campaign with an Anzac Day Dawn Service in 2002 at Ower's Corner; and
	(c)	establish a project team to oversee these matters, consisting of representatives of the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs, Defence, Veterans' Affairs and Environment and Heritage.
It gives me enormous pleasure to introduce into the House and to speak on this motion today, because I think what we are trying to achieve today is something that all Australians can identify with. In giving some background on what brought me to be so enthusiastic about this proposal to commemorate the diggers and the local fuzzy wuzzy angels and what they did in the Second World War on the Kokoda Track, it would be remiss of me not to mention the long and untiring efforts of the Hon. Charlie Lynn, a member of the New South Wales upper house, who first brought my attention to this proposal. I first heard about it earlier in the year when Charlie spoke at a function held in Meningie, in the electorate of Barker, which I was privileged to attend. Over 100 people were as spellbound as I was when Charlie spoke at length of his own personal experiences and the stories that he had learned over the years.
I also have a personal connection in that my middle name of Damien was selected by my parents because of the famous and heroic efforts of that great wartime photographer Damien Parer, the first Australian to win an Oscar for his work and who in fact died in action. As I was born on the anniversary of D-day in the Second World War, it was quite appropriate. If it were not for Charlie Lynn, I would not be here today trying to repeat some of his enthusiasm for this memorial. I know he had planned to be here today, but unfortunately circumstances beyond his control have not allowed this to happen.
I do not think it is too full of hyperbole to state that our diggers' efforts at Kokoda are the Second World War equivalent of Gallipoli, and it is a shame on this country that people know more about the story of the Alamo in Texas, United States, than they know about the Kokoda Track. The horrific odds faced by our diggers at Kokoda were far greater than those heroes at the Alamo, but we still have not seen a film about it, for instance, even though there has been a film script written. I have no doubt that if this were an American story there would have been several films made about our service men and women's efforts to stop the Japanese invasion in horrific conditions and against all odds. 
On 24 July 1942, a superior Japanese force launched an attack on a small band of Australian defenders, and the Papuan infantry dug in on the Kokoda plateau. Their objective was to cross the Owen Stanley range in Papua New Guinea and capture the strategic city of Port Moresby. The Australian diggers were young, outnumbered and outgunned. During the next three months the Australians forced the Japanese to contest every inch of the rugged and treacherous Kokoda Track as they advanced towards the Japanese objective of capturing Port Moresby. In fact, the first Victoria Cross won on Australian soil was posthumously awarded to Private Bruce Kingsbury of the 2/14th Battalion during the Battle of Isurava.
The Australians rallied at the last ridgeline at Imita Ridge, a mere 40 kilometres from Port Moresby. The hugely more powerful and numbered Japanese force had stretched their resources to the limit in attempting toannihilate the Australians and on 17 September 1942 were ordered to conduct a fighting withdrawal to the beachheads of Buna and Gona on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. Australian reinforcements and Japanese setbacks at Guadalcanal and the Battle of Milne Bay saved Port Moresby.
The Australians pursued the Japanese with great courage and vigour and reoccupied the village of Kokoda on 2 November 1942. The fighting from July to November cost 607 lives, with more than 1,000 serious injuries. One would only have to trek across the Kokoda Track now to realise what an almost impossible task it would have been against the overwhelming odds faced by our diggers. It was Sir William Slim who said, `Some of us may forget that of all the allies it was the Australian soldiers who first broke the spell of invincibility of the Japanese army.' Not only that, they succeeded and won the battles.
There is a proposal for a master plan to develop the Kokoda Track into a memorial park, and because of time constraints and my inability to speak at length on it, I seek leave to incorporate three tables from that plan into Hansard which relate to, firstly, the departments involved; secondly, some key dates for action; and, thirdly, a possible agenda for a joint project team operation.

—Thank you. I sent this proposal around to colleagues on both sides of the House not expecting too much response because of the time constraints that we all have, but I was ecstatic at the response I received. I am pleased that the member for Cowan, as the first member to respond, has honoured me with his support in seconding this motion. I also thank in anticipation the members for Lowe and Canning from the opposition, my good friend here, the member for Hume, and very appropriately the member for Robertson, who is chairman of the Papua New Guinea-Australia Friendship Group. I must have had responses from at least 20 members within a couple of days of this proposal, and I thank you all for your continued interest and support. I also pass on what I am sure would be Charlie Lynn's thanks to all those members who have enthusiastically supported his ideas that I will now briefly outline.  
Whilst I have previously compared Kokoda with Gallipoli, I think the pilgrimage to Kokoda could be quite different. Some will want to walk the track, while others will want to drive from Port Moresby to the beginning of Ower's Corner where the track starts. Ower's Corner provides a majestic view over the Owen Stanley Ranges and is ideally suited as the future location of an annual Anzac Day service, and wouldn't it be great if we could have our first on the 60th anniversary of this campaign next year in 2002? To realise this vision, we need to ensure that an all-weather road is constructed through to Ower's Corner. Education memorials need to be constructed at each of the battle sites along the track, and local Kiora guides need to be trained in the military and cultural history of the Kokoda. A memorial site with suitable facilities for large groups of visitors needs to be constructed at Ower's Corner. Urgent action is needed if we are to meet a deadline of having the inaugural dawn service at Ower's Corner on 25 April 2002.
Urgent liaison with the government of New Guinea is essential, and a project team from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of the Environment and Heritage must be formed. Not only that, this project team should trek across the Kokoda Track themselves, preferably next month or in October. Urgent action is needed and warranted. I am indebted to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, for providing me with some information concerning the federal government's plans for a major series of commemorations in 2002 to mark the 60th anniversary of the defence of Australia campaign, which will include Kokoda amongst such events as the fall of Singapore, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the bombing of Darwin and the Milne Bay action. The minister has reacted quickly to establish an interdepartmental committee on the future of the Kokoda Track, which will be incorporated in the 2002 defence of Australia commemorations.
I also thank the Prime Minister for his support in this matter; he has taken a personal interest in ensuring that this committee is formed and is operational as soon as possible. There has been a hold-up in negotiations with the Papua New Guinea government, but Charlie Lynn made a separate visit in late June and had considerable success in breaking the deadlock by reaching an agreement with the local governor of Oro Province to permit 300 fee paying people to walk the Kokoda Track during the rest of 2001. Charlie Lynn informs me that he met with PNG ministers, members, local government councillors and individual landholders along the Kokoda Track who have given their support to the proposal and welcome the opportunity to develop a master plan.
I will conclude by saying that my enthusiasm for this project is enormous and, whenever I have spoken of this to the constituents in the electorate of Barker, I have been gratified to feel the same sort of enthusiasm being returned—because this is part of our noble history that captures the imagination of people of all ages and all backgrounds. I commend the proposed resolution and seek the support of the House for what is truly a bipartisan goal to commemorate our armed services during the Second World War.
—Is the motion seconded? ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Kokoda Track</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I second the motion. I am very pleased, in a bipartisan spirit, to second this motion so ably moved by the member for Barker and to compliment him, indeed, for bringing this important issue before the House. This is an important issue. Like many in the chamber here, I am a baby-boomer whose father was a veteran of the Second World War; I and many others like me, I suppose, grew up learning the stories of Kokoda and learning about the heroes—the people like Damien Parer, of course—who were so well respected by the Australian service men and women of that time.
But, in doing a bit of research for this motion, I came across a speech that was made on Sunday, 26 April 1992, by the former Prime Minister Paul Keating. He was at Kokoda for the 50th anniversary of this battle. I will quote from his speech, because I think it is indeed a very moving speech. Paul Keating, on that date, said:
This is the place where the rock of friendship and the foundation stone of relations between our two countries rests and while we've had a long history together in places like Port Moresby and Lae and other places it is really here that the soul of the relationship sits, here in Kokoda. Because it was here that Australians decided to defend your liberty as well as their own and you decided to defend yourselves and help us defend ourselves. It was here young Australian men fought for the first time against the prospect of the invasion of their country, of Australia.
Never before, even though we fought in many conflicts, mostly imperial conflicts, in conflicts where we felt pangs of loyalty to what was then known as the “Mother Country” to Britain and to the empire to fight in Gallipoli with heroism and in Belgium in Flanders and in France and in other places, this was the first and only time that we've fought against an enemy to prevent the invasion of Australia, to secure the way of life we had built for ourselves. And those young Australian men fought here, 2,000 of them died, 600 Americans died later and we should never forget their sacrifice, that the families who live so distantly in the United States lost 600 sons here should never be forgotten and they cost the lives of 13,000 Japanese who fought for their country and what they believed were their country's strategic interests which were, of course, interests which we could not accept and could only abhor.
The lesson of this place is that these young men believed in Australia and we need to give Australians, all Australians, particularly young Australians, an Australia to believe in. We can't deny young Australians their birthright to a past with meaning for them and a future with meaning. It has to be a future with meaning and everything we see here—there can be no deeper spiritual basis to the meaning of the Australian nation than the blood that was spilled on this very knoll, this very plateau, in defence of the liberty of Australia.
So Prime Minister—
and that was, of course, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea—
can I thank you on behalf of your countrymen, some who I've met here today who actually fought in that campaign, for those who died in that campaign, to the relatives here today of loved ones who were lost in that campaign but who gave their lives selflessly in the defence of Papua New Guinea and the defence of Australia and the broader defence of liberty in the Pacific.
This was the place where I believe the depth and soul of the Australian nation was confirmed. If it was founded in Gallipoli it was certainly confirmed in the defence of our homeland here. So I thank you Sir for inviting me and my wife to this fiftieth anniversary of the Papua New Guinea campaign and particularly on behalf of the Australian people I thank the people of Papua New Guinea, the people of Kokoda, the people of the surrounding areas and the people of the Papua New Guinea defence force and its forebears for their support of Australians at war.
I will come back to that issue of support in a minute, but I think it is fitting that our past Prime Minister and our current Prime Minister have very strong thoughts and views about this place we are talking about today. Given their strong views and given the interest of this parliament, I have no doubt that if we are prepared to pursue this issue, then indeed we could have the Kokoda Track developed as a national memorial park, as is suggested in this motion.
Prime Minister Keating spoke about the support that the Australian diggers received on the Kokoda Track. When researching this issue, I also came across a poem that I would like to relate to the House. It was written by a sapper, H. Beros, who was in the 7th Division AIF with the Royal Australian Engineers. Bert Beros served, according to this note, in both World War I and World War II. He wrote this poem at 4 a.m. one morning on the Kokoda Track after having been on stand-to. It may never have been printed but for the fact that an officer sent a copy home to his mother, and she was so impressed that she had it published in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. The poem reads: 
The Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels
Many a mother in Australia,
When the busy day is done,
Sends a prayer to the Almighty
For the keeping of her son.
Asking that an Angel guide him
And bring him safely back
Now we see those prayer are answered
On the Owen Stanley Track,
For they haven't any halos,
Only holes slashed in their ears,
And with faces worked by tattoos,
With scratch pins in their hair,
Bringing back the wounded,
Just as steady as a hearse,
Using leaves to keep the rain off
And gentle as a nurse.
Slow and careful in bad places,
On the awful mountain track,
And the look upon their faces'
Makes us think that Christ was black.
Not a move to hurt the carried,
As they treat him like a Saint,
It's a picture worth recording,
That an Artist's yet to paint.
Many a lad will see his Mother,
And the Husbands, Weans and Wives,
Just because the Fuzzy Wuzzy
Carried them to save their lives.
From mortar or machine gun fire,
Or a chance surprise attack,
To safety and the care of Doctors,
At the bottom of the track.
May the Mothers in Australia,
When they offer up a prayer,
Mention those impromptu Angels,
With the Fuzzy Wuzzy hair.
That concludes the poem. I think the spirit of that poem, the spirit of what was said by the member for Barker here today and the spirit of what was said by Prime Minister Keating embrace the spirit of what most Australians feel about the Kokoda Track and those who lost their lives there. The Kokoda Track is to those who fought in New Guinea what Gallipoli is to those who fought in that campaign, what Kapyong is to those who fought in Korea and what Long Tan is to those who fought in Vietnam. Though these battles were in fields far flung from Australia, they had one thing in common: the courage of the Australian servicemen, their love of freedom and their uncompromising approach to mateship. If we feel anything about those issues and if we feel anything about mateship, we should feel strong enough in that mateship to want to do something to ensure that the sacrifices that those men made on the Kokoda Track and the spirit of support that they received from the fuzzy wuzzy angels is not forgotten. The way to remember those people and those sacrifices is contained in this motion before us. I am very pleased to, in a bipartisan way, give support to the member for Barker and to this motion. While there are limitations on the number of people who can speak on the motion, I am sure that most members of this House, and of this parliament, would speak in support of this motion were there time for them to do so. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Kokoda Track</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—It is an honour for me to stand here as an Australian member of parliament to support this motion by my friend the member for Barker, ably backed up by the member for Cowan. I am also mindful of the magnificent contribution of my old mate Charlie Lynn, the honourable MLC for the New South Wales parliament. He has been fighting this battle on behalf of the memory of those fellows who died on the Kokoda Trail. I commend him for the diligence and the compassion with which he has driven himself to ensure that this issue is raised in the parliament here today.
Let me go back to 1942. It was the year Australia lost its innocence. Pearl Harbour had been bombed. Hong Kong and Singapore had fallen. Darwin had been bombed and midget submarines had raided Sydney Harbour. Another nation was trying to steal our country, and we were not prepared. In August 1942 a small band of diggers was thrown against the might of the Japanese army in a last-ditch defence of Australia's northern doorstep. The diggers were out-gunned and outnumbered six to one. Many of them were recent conscripts, aged 18, who had never fired a shot in anger. These young men, together with units of the AIF rushed back from the Middle East, confronted the Japanese high in the Owen Stanley mountain range in Papua New Guinea. There they formed a ragged line of defence between the invaders and the Australian mainland. The Japanese 144th Regiment, crack troops of the Emperor's South Seas Force, had been invincible since they had been blooded in Manchuria in 1937. They had surged unchecked through Asia and the Pacific. Thirteen thousand of them landed in New Guinea, their last step before conquering Australia itself. 
At best, the Aussies could gather about 2,000 troops to oppose them. The battleground was a narrow, meandering and precipitous path through impenetrable jungle which led to Port Moresby and then Australia. On the Kokoda Track there was no escape: no helicopters or air support to medivac the wounded, no aerial bombardment, no artillery—although the Japanese lugged mountain guns through the jungle. This was the last major man-to-man battle in history. If you could not walk out, or the brave Papuan fuzzy wuzzy angels could not carry you out, you died. In this cauldron, many diggers joined the immortals. There were men like Bruce Kingsbury VC, who single-handedly charged into the heart of the enemy, killing 30 or 40 or them and saving his battalion headquarters, only to be struck down by a sniper at the moment of his glory. These are the words of Sergeant Allan Avery, 39th Battalion:
I reckon he almost gave his life because there was nothing scared about it. No, he just went straight into them as if bullets didn't mean anything, you know. And we all got a bit of the action, you see, when we saw him. When you see something like that, you sort of follow the leader, don't you? And that is what we did.
And there were men like Sergeant `Teddy' Bear, a hero of the battle for Isurava, who launched a ferocious solo charge at the invaders, so ferocious that some Japanese soldiers were seen to jump to their deaths over a precipice rather than face him, and men like Corporal John Metson, who with superhuman selflessness refused a stretcher and crawled for 10 days dragging his leg shattered by a machinegun, before being murdered by the Japanese. The battle for Kokoda, as my parliamentary colleague the member for Barker quite rightly said, is Australia's Alamo. If Gallipoli symbolised the Anzac spirit in World War I, then Kokoda is its Second World War equivalent. The Aussies fought with such vigour and valour that their Japanese opponents were convinced they were facing a massive force of defenders.
That is what the Australian fighting man is renowned for and it is because of the legend of those heroes who unselfishly gave their lives in very difficult circumstances on the Kokoda Track.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I begin by congratulating my good friend the member for Barker on his worthy motion before the House today. I endorse fully his speech and the speeches of the member for Cowan and the member for Hume. In making my contribution to the debate, I wish to let members know that within my electorate of Lowe, which is on the shores of the Parramatta River, we have our own Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway. This rainforest walkway is some 800 metres in length and it runs around Bray's Bay between Concord Hospital, the famous repatriation hospital, and Rhodes railway station.
The origin of this walkway is found in the Australia Remembers program, when the Keating government and the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, announced plans for the walkway in 1994. The objective of building the walkway was to provide a permanent memorial to all veterans who served in World War II, with particular emphasis on the south-west Pacific area. When the plans for the walkway were announced, Concord Council, Concord Rotary, the Returned Services League of Australia, the New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning and Concord Hospital all got behind this great project. I also acknowledge the Howard government's ongoing support for the walkway and the contribution by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott. One of the great constants in Australian politics is the bipartisanship in this House for the veteran community, and rightly so. 
I cannot let this occasion pass without giving special recognition to the New South Wales State President of the RSL and Chairman of the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway, Mr Rusty Priest AM, and the Director of the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway, Ms Alice Kang, and her assistant, Ms Hilary Nourse. They have all done a magnificent job in promoting the walkway and in organising numerous memorial services associated with the walkway and Concord Hospital.
There are 22 stations along the walkway that reflect particular battles and events of significance relating to the New Guinea campaign. Visitors can reflect on the service and sacrifice of our Australian soldiers at each of the 22 stations: Milne Bay; McDonald's Corner, the beginning of the Kokoda Track; Ower's Corner, the end of the jeep track; Uberi, the first staging camp on the Kokoda Track; Imita Ridge, the Australians' final defensive position; Ioribaiwa, the furthermost point of the Japanese advance; Menari; Efogi, the desperate battles of Mission Ridge and Brigade Hill; Myola, the forward supply depot and medical post; Myola Ridge; Templeton's Crossing, where a determined Japanese rearguard delayed the Australians; the Coast Watchers; Eora Creek, a bitter Japanese defensive battle in the mountains; Isurava, the vital delaying battle; Deniki; Kokoda; Oivi, the death of Captain `Uncle Sam' Templeton; Gorari; Wairopi; Buna; Gona; and Sanananda, a bloody stalemate and the climax of the Papuan campaign.
Rusty Priest reminded me last Friday, when I advised him that this motion was coming before the House today, that most Australians will never see the Kokoda Track in New Guinea. However, as Rusty pointed out, many Australians can come to Concord and Rhodes and journey along our Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway. I know that I speak on behalf of Rusty Priest, Alice Kang and Hilary Nourse in issuing all members of this House, particularly the member for Barker, an invitation to visit the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in my electorate of Lowe. I know that they will be very welcome. For the benefit of the House, I seek leave to table an information leaflet and some supplementary information describing the 22 stations and the Memorial Rose Garden, which comprise the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in my electorate of Lowe.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—It is indeed a pleasure and an honour to rise in this House today to support the motion by my good friend and colleague the member for Barker to develop a master plan for the Kokoda Track and to establish it as a national memorial park in memory of the many young Australians who lost their lives on the Kokoda Track. That would be a great symbol of the depth of feeling that Australians have for those who fought on the Kokoda Track and for the many who died on the Kokoda Track.
Australia and New Guinea are linked not only geographically but also historically. Almost every person that you speak to in Australia has some links with Papua New Guinea, whether it be through working there, particularly prior to independence, through having a father or grandfather who was a veteran of the Kokoda Track, or some other link with Papua New Guinea. It is important that we develop this master plan. There is a need for a master plan because geographically the Kokoda Track is in very difficult terrain. I have spoken to a number of people who have walked the track. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to do so, although my friend the MLC Charlie Lynn has tried on many occasions to encourage me to undertake the arduous track, but I have spoken to other colleagues, including the member for Gosford in New South Wales, who is a good friend of mine, Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, and Senator Julian McGauran. They have all walked the track at some stage. One of the messages that they bring back is the mud. As Chris Hartcher said, `I cannot get out of my mind the mud in walking that track.' The entire time that they struggled up and down the terrain, which is incredibly steep, there was constant mud—mud in the bed, mud in the boots, mud in the clothes and mud in the eyes. That was in peacetime, when they had support. You can imagine the sacrifice and struggle that our young veterans went through when they were suddenly thrown into that area without support. That is the message that came back from the people who had walked the track. They mentioned the terrain of the track, how steep it is, and the gullies that they had to cross. There were gushing streams—one slip off the plank and you knew that you would be dead. 
It is a difficult thing but it is an essential thing that has to be done to develop a master plan so that this track can be dedicated as a national memorial park. As part of that plan, it is very important to have an all-weather road to Ower's Corner. Many young Australians backpack their way to Gallipoli every Anzac Day, and many young Australians would be very keen to participate in dawn services at Ower's Corner. Many people would not be physically capable, or have the time, to go along the whole of the track. So if there was an all-weather road to Ower's Corner, we could have those dawn services and hundreds of Australians would be able to participate in them. That would be a further recognition of what Australia owes to the young Australians and to the fuzzy wuzzy angels who supported them during the Second World War. 
There are other ways in which we can assist. The Australian parliament works very closely with the parliament of Papua New Guinea. As president of the friendship group, I am encouraged by our exchanges and the education process for the parliamentarians of Papua New Guinea. Theirs is a young democracy and they are still struggling to come to terms with it. It is important that we help them through the process of our democracy and our system of parliament. I know that they have appreciated the number of exchanges that we have been able to provide to help and encourage them in a stable democracy and a stable parliament which will hopefully bring them peace and stability. If we are going to encourage young Australians to go to Papua New Guinea, they have to know that they can go there in safety and in friendship so that they can go and recognise the sacrifices made by the young Australians and the young Papua New Guinea people who fought and died in the sacrifices of the Second World War.

"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I am pleased today to add my support for the development of the Kokoda Track as a national memorial park. I congratulate the member for Barker on bringing this issue to the parliament, and I congratulate the previous speakers.
As a Western Australian, it is important for me to note the contribution of the 2nd/14th and the 2nd/16th Battalions, as they were among the first of the AIF units sent up the Kokoda Track. My dad was one of those soldiers and from early childhood I heard the tales of his time on the Kokoda Track and how it rained every day; how difficult it was to get supplies through; how often they went without food because there was none; how difficult it was to get the wounded out; how kind the fuzzy wuzzy angels were and how many had died. Also, of course, you have to remember that those who came back had made a huge sacrifice as well—they had lost their youth. If you had been one of those soldiers going up the Kokoda Track and had to decide which of the wounded were likely to make it, and which were sent back and which were not, that is not something you easily live down and it is in your memory always.
As it is nearly 60 years since the battle took place, I think it is time that the soldiers' courage was recognised and that there is a memorial on the Kokoda Track to those who lost their lives. While most Australians are familiar with the major battles of World War I, we need to do much more to increase the awareness of other conflicts which took place closer to our home. By supporting the building of an all-weather road from Kokoda to Ower's Corner with educational memorials at each battle site, another step is going to be taken to ensure that the bravery of our soldiers is never forgotten and that the generations that come after ours will have the opportunity to pay tribute to that courage shown by previous generations as they protected the Australian way of life. 
In the many battles that Australian soldiers have fought, Kokoda was the first that directly protected Australian shores. It was a battle where our soldiers were helped by the local people and, without their help, many more soldiers would have died. In the preparation of the memorial, it is important that the government and the people of PNG are involved and support the plans. The memorial should also pay tribute to the Papua New Guineans who lost their lives, and those who continue to live who did everything to ensure that our troops had as much safety and assistance as possible, for their contribution must never ever be forgotten.
Like many Australians, I have always thought that one day I would like to go up the Kokoda Track and see where my father spent many of the war years. I think I would be defeated by lack of fitness, so I was most encouraged to hear that it is possible to drive. Improving the track will give many more people an opportunity to visit an important part of our history and it will ensure that our young people go to New Guinea for Anzac Day in as large numbers as they go to Gallipoli. I also support the holding of the Anzac Day service next year. I spoke to my local RSLs and they were very enthusiastic about that and already a great number are saying that they would love to attend.
For the veterans of Kokoda, the 60th anniversary would be a special time to have the chance to return and attend a dawn service. It is important that the country give the honour that they deserve. In the building of this memorial, not only will we be paying tribute to those who lost their lives, we need also to remember the sacrifice of those who came home and continued to make a contribution for many years after the war. I do not think any of us knows any veteran who came back the same person as they went away, and that is something that must never be forgotten. Our country can never adequately thank the veterans and the people of PNG for their courage, but this building of a national memorial will make sure that their sacrifice is never forgotten.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—It is more in sorrow than in anger that I want to bring to the House's attention the announcements in the press over the weekend in relation to the indication from Government House that our new Governor-General is going to be spending quite a bit more of his time in Sydney than in Canberra. I have never had to make a speech that was having a go at a Governor-General before and I am finding it a little bit difficult—
—I remind the member for Canberra that speeches that have a go at the Governor-General are not in fact tolerated in the chamber.
—I understand that, Mr Speaker, and that is why I am saying that the announcement that has been made by the staff at Government House in Canberra is what has really got me upset. I do not know the reason for the announcement. It is true to say that Governors-General in the past have spent time in all places, including of course Admiralty House in Sydney. But I do not understand why there was the requirement in this particular instance for such an announcement to be made.
Canberra is in fact the national capital. I am not standing here trying to defend it as such so much as to remind everybody that that is the case. An announcement like this being made yet again brings into question Canberra and the ACT and their role as the national capital. That is the point that I think we need to make.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	condemns the Government for failing to ensure that residents in nursing homes receive an adequate standard of personal medical care;
(2)	notes the concerns of the families of nursing home residents and workers in the aged care industry about the impact of the Government's aged care policy on nursing home standards and care; and 
(3)	calls on the Government to review its aged care policy to ensure that the wellbeing of nursing homes is paramount and not secondary to government savings.
There is no greater challenge for government today than that of ensuring adequate care and accommodation for Australians as they grow older. It is about people and ensuring that older people in our community who are frail and who need special care and accommodation can receive the quality care they need. It is about treating them with dignity, in the way that you would want your mother, father, husband, wife or even yourself to be treated. Aged care is about caring for people who have made enormous contributions to our nation and who now depend on government to ensure that they receive the care they deserve. Unfortunately, the Howard government has failed to ensure that older people receive this care. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Aged Care have forgotten that they are talking about real people when they blame everyone else but themselves for the aged care crisis. The government stands condemned for its inaction, for placing nursing home residents at risk, for failing to provide sufficient nursing home and hospital beds for people who need them, for undermining the viability of many nursing homes because of its flawed funding formula and for failing to plan to meet the future needs of older Australians.
In this House we have heard about the poor medical attention that residents at Riverside and Yagoona nursing homes received. This government's response was appalling. The minister was more interested in justifying her performance and passing the buck than addressing the real issues. It is not good enough, and it certainly does not equate to a government taking seriously its responsibility to care—remember that word—for some of the most vulnerable people within our society. The government and the minister have argued that the accreditation process would ensure that all residents of nursing homes receive quality care, but this is not the case. Most nursing homes pass the scheduled inspections but problems still continue in nursing homes run by unscrupulous operators. The government's commitment to meaningful spot checks still has a question mark over it. 
Most areas throughout Australia are experiencing an enormous shortage of beds. The minister has detailed the number of beds that the government has allocated to address this shortage. But what the minister—or, for that matter, anyone in the Howard government—does not tell us is how many of these beds are actually available. In the Hunter, the area I come from, there are currently 89 phantom nursing home beds and 460 phantom hostel beds, and on the Central Coast of New South Wales there are 147 phantom nursing home beds and 528 phantom hostel beds. This represents one bed in 10 in the Hunter and one bed in five on the Central Coast that exist only on paper. And on the mid-North Coast the figure is one bed in six.
I have very little sympathy for the government's argument that it has delivered all these beds to the area I represent when every day I have families telling me about the problems they are having locating a bed for their mother, father, husband or wife. There are people like the lady from Swansea whom I saw last Thursday. Her mother is 89 years old and suffers from slight dementia, but she is not a danger to herself or others, so she is not a high priority. She is very frail and disabled. She has been assessed as needing hostel accommodation. She has been waiting for six months and is also on the waiting list for a community care package. Her daughter visits every day and pays for her to get care in her home. Wouldn't it be good if some of those 460 phantom hostel beds existed, because then this lady would have somewhere to live?
Recently in the Hunter, Catholic aged care announced that St Catherine's of Siena at Waratah and St Joseph's at Lochinvar will close. The member for Hunter has just expressed to me his great disappointment that beds are going from Lochinvar. These closures are a direct result of the government failing to adequately fund aged care facilities and, from what other aged care providers in my area are telling me, they will not be the last nursing homes to close their doors. Catholic aged care is a quality aged care provider. It places a high value on the care of its residents above all other aspects, so it is very sad when we see this organisation being forced to close a quality nursing home, one that has had $1.5 million invested in it in recent times. The minister, as always, blames the closures on something else: the closures were outside her control; St Joseph's is too small; St Catherine's is a heritage building and on three levels, which makes it expensive to operate. We hear excuse after excuse, but these excuses will not find nursing home beds for the 88 residents who live at St Catherine's, nor will they help all those people in the Hunter and on the Central Coast who are waiting for nursing home beds.
So what has caused this crisis? If we can believe the minister, we could be forgiven for thinking that there is no crisis. She has told the Australian people and the nursing home industry that the funding for aged care is generous and that nursing homes should be making a 12 per cent profit. But, when the funding is looked at in detail, the problem becomes obvious. I will use St Catherine's of Siena to illustrate the minister's deception. The minister has stated that St Catherine's has received a 54 per cent increase in funding over the last five years. True, but what the minister is not saying is that this funding increase has been absorbed totally by 16 new beds, which accounts for 31 per cent; increased insurance premiums of six per cent; increased superannuation contributions of three per cent; and award increases of 14 per cent. This leaves no funding for increases in the cost of food, electricity, maintenance, service contracts, medical supplies, linen services, cleaning products, telephones and the implementation of the GST. It is little wonder that St Catherine's of Siena has to close its doors.
The government relies heavily on the Gray report to justify its performance in the provision of aged care. Unfortunately, whilst this review was conducted by an eminent person independent of government, it relies on government data and unreleased government modelling to support its key finding. There is no independent research, so how credible and independent is this review of the government's reform program when it has used the government's data? 
A report released by Aged and Community Services Australia on Friday for the National Aged Care Industry Council concludes that the aged care industry is fast reaching crisis point and that its ongoing viability is under threat. That is a real problem for Australia. The report details the problems that that industry is having in gaining access to capital to make necessary building improvements or to finance new beds. It also demonstrates the government's failure to portray the real costs of nursing homes by its statement that it costs only $68,500 to provide a nursing home bed when, if all costs are taken into account, it costs somewhere between $85,000 and $120,000. No wonder there is a crisis within the nursing home industry, and no wonder a question hangs over its ongoing viability. This, in turn, has led to the closure of facilities like St Catherine's of Siena, those 549 phantom beds in the Hunter and 675 phantom beds on the Central Coast—beds that exist on paper only.
There are many other issues that threaten the viability of the nursing home industry—and which the government has failed to recognise—such as the enormous cost of the accreditation process and a number of staff related matters that also impact on the industry's ongoing viability. The government has failed to recognise that aged care is about care—care for vulnerable people who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Aged care is not about passing the buck, it is not about cutting costs and it is not about apportioning blame; it is about planning and ensuring that the needs of our communities are met.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—Health and wellbeing of all Australians, in particular the elderly, is a central concern of this government. In her closing remarks, the member for Shortland said that the future of aged care was about planning. Let me indicate to the House that it was the total and abject failure of planning by the previous Labor government that established the baseline for the situation that this government faced when it came to office in 1996. Indeed, the government has significantly increased the number of aged care places available for older Australians. After the government came to office in 1996, the Auditor-General—an independent officer— found that a 10,000 aged care place deficit had been left by the previous Labor government. In the last two approval rounds, and in the 2001 approval round, more than 31,000 new places have been released to in part make up for this deficit and to meet the need for growth.
A review was taken, again independently, by Professor Gregory. What he found about the building fabric of the nursing homes in Australia at the end of the Labor rule of this Commonwealth parliament was that 13 per cent of nursing homes did not meet the relevant fire authority standards, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet the relevant health authority standards, 70 per cent of nursing homes did not meet the relevant outcome standards and 51 per cent of nursing home residents were living in rooms with three or more beds. That was the legacy left to this government by the previous government—the opposition of which the honourable member is a member in this place. It is that legacy that this government has been attempting to address over the five years it has been in government.
Indeed, Professor Len Gray, in the two-year review of aged care reforms, found that there had been improvements in building standards since this government came to office. Specifically he stated:
Substantial increases in the quality and quantity of residential buildings was a specific objective of the reforms. The evidence indicates that considerable progress has been made towards achieving this objective.
Professor Gray also found that the new arrangements introduced by this government generated sufficient income to enable the industry to meet its capital requirements, and the system is now sustainable well into the future. Indeed, extensive rebuilding, upgrading and refurbishment work has been undertaken. In the past two years, $1.4 billion across Australia has been committed by the industry to capital building works, and 12 per cent of all aged care homes in Australia have been either newly built or completely rebuilt.  
There has been a steady decline in the number of residents per room since October 1996, when there were 1.6 residents per room. This has fallen in 3½ years to 1.5 residents per room. In 1994, Professor Gregory found that, under the Labor Party, some 51 per cent of residents were living in rooms with three or more people. Now, fewer than 22 per cent of residents are living in rooms with three or more beds, and this number is steadily declining.
In 1995-96, the former Labor government spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care. The outlay in the 2000-01 financial year is expected to be $3.9 billion. If you look at the projections into the future—and we are the first to admit that we have a lot further to go, that we came from a very poor base left to us by the Labor Party—you will see that there will be an increase from some $4.2 billion to $6 billion in 2001-02, an increase of some 41 per cent. So the moves and the measures taken by the government have been substantial.
Referring to the Hunter region, which the honourable member represents, the total number of new operational beds commenced or scheduled to commence by 31 December this year is 461; the total number of new aged care homes commenced or scheduled to commence by the end of this year in the Hunter region is five, which will account for an additional 163 residential aged care places; and seven extensions to existing aged care homes have commenced or are scheduled to commence by the end of this year, which involves an extra 298 residential aged care places. So in the Hunter region alone, which the honourable speaks about in part of her remarks, there is an expected increase in actual beds in aged care facilities on the ground of some 461 beds. In my own electorate there have been numerous new nursing homes and aged care facilities that have been built and there are many hundreds of new beds. I am sure that members, if they are frank about the matter, can speak about that right throughout this area. 
The other issue that the honourable member failed to mention when talking about the situation in the Hunter was the high and increasing workers compensation costs which, in effect, have been imposed by the Labor government in New South Wales. One would have thought that, if she were truly making a fair representation of the situation, she would have admitted to those high and increasing workers compensation costs in the state of New South Wales and would be calling upon the Labor government in New South Wales to do its part in relation to these matters.
Certification in this area has provided the first ever audit of the building quality of all aged care homes. We hear about problems that arise from time to time with certain aged care facilities in this country. But we have a better situation now—not that any of us want problems to arise—where there is certification, monitoring and checks and we can have some assurance of the quality in these nursing homes. The situation that prevailed prior to this government—when the party of the honourable member opposite was in government; when it was occupying this side of the House—was that we did not have those checks, we did not have that system of accreditation, we did not have that monitoring and we did not know what the standard was in relation to many of these homes. 
The accreditation agency and the department have the power to visit aged care homes and conduct spot checks. In fact, more than 643 spot checks have occurred so far this calendar year. As at 1 June 2001, a total of 1,320 spot checks had been conducted and some 3,000 accreditation sites audited. Professor Gray's overall conclusion was that reforms have resulted in substantial improvements to the aged care system. His assessment of this government's performance was clearly a distinction. He said:
It is my conclusion, on completion of the Review, that the reforms have delivered substantial improvements to the aged care system. The fine-tuning undertaken to smooth the implementation of the reforms and address unanticipated anomalies has been largely successful. 
That is all part of a situation in the context of the budgeting ability of this government. As was pointed out in question time today, when we came to office there was not only a deficit in the Commonwealth budget, in terms of the 1995-96 budget when we came to power, but also a $96 billion Commonwealth debt, $80 billion of which—or most of it—had been run up while the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, was the Minister for Finance in the Hawke and Keating governments.
We did not start from a level playing field, and we will have paid back by the end of this financial year something like $60 billion. That is important because that frees up interest which is now available to provide for health care, aged care homes, education, police forces and all the social services that the people in Australia want. But I do not hear anything from the honourable member in terms of the base of income in this place. She is part of a party that says, `We'll roll back the GST. We'll roll back the revenue and somehow, magically, we are going to find more money for aged care facilities, amongst other things.' 
We have a growing and ageing population. In 1998, 2.3 million Australians were over 65 years—12 per cent of the population. That is estimated to be five million by 2030—something like 19 per cent of the population. This government recognise that there is more to be done in this area. But I would say to the people of Australia that, having recognised the problem, having recognised the legacy, having recognised the inadequate system that the Labor Party left us in 1996, we have made substantial improvements which have enabled us to provide thousands of more places and to put billions of more dollars into aged care. We have more to do and we will go further. This motion does not recognise that at all. We will build upon those results.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Care Standards</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to support the motion moved by my friend and colleague the member for Shortland and join with her in calling for this House to condemn the government for its failure to provide a safe aged care framework for older Australians. I would like to speak about some of the comments made by the member for Menzies. He said that aged care was now sustainable. I suppose he probably does not realise the situation in Tasmania, where the coalescence or funding equalisation—or whatever the government chooses to call it on any given day—actually results in a lessening of the funding to aged care facilities. Many facilities are now trying to decide whether or not they can remain open. That is not a sustainable industry, from my perspective.
The member for Menzies also gave assurances with respect to aged care standards and told us how we can believe in them. But time and time again we hear horror stories emerging from our nation's aged care facilities. Many of these facilities are good providers, particularly the ones in my region for which I have the utmost respect. They are struggling to do the best that they can under immense pressure from this government, which refuses to acknowledge the true state of the aged care industry. 
The fact that we have a far greater demand for aged care than is currently available should not have come as a surprise to any government. Australia, in common with other developed nations, is ageing. This phenomenon is predicted to continue well into the next century. The member for Menzies referred to the ABS projections, which indicated that, while the percentage of the population over 65 in 1997 was 12 per cent—and he gave the figures for 2031—the figure will actually reach something like 25 per cent by the time we get to 2051.
Tasmania is second only to South Australia in having the highest proportion of citizens over the age of 65. In terms of future growth rates, Australia is expected to experience a higher than average increase in aged population over the 1995-2005 period compared with the rest of the Western world. This is information we have known about for some time, yet the government continues to stick its head in the sand when it comes to the needs of our ageing population. These are people who have fought wars, raised families, contributed immeasurably to our society and paid a lifetime of taxes, but still the government continues to insult them through the incompetent and, I believe, uncaring Minister for Aged Care.  
Families who are faced with the prospect of having an elderly relative in a nursing home must be able to feel confident that their loved one is receiving the highest possible level of care, that their wellbeing and dignity are respected, and that they have the same quality of life that the rest of us in the community expect. With the current inadequacy of care subsidies, families cannot be sure that their relatives will receive even those basic standards. I regularly speak with staff in the excellent aged care facilities in my electorate who are heartbroken because they simply do not have the time and the resources that they need to provide the level of care that they not only want to provide but know they need to provide.
I recently met with a group of aged care providers, and in one short meeting they raised over 13 issues which were of extreme concern. They included a long list of concerns about the accreditation system, heavy workloads, impossibility of paperwork, documentation driving funding, wage parity, and lack of recognition of nurses' skills. One issue that really concerned those at the meeting was the acuity of residents. Residents can come into a nursing home with an acuity comparable with that of patients in a medical ward of a hospital. What is of critical concern is that these facilities will sometimes have a ratio of one registered nurse to some 90 residents in his or her care. This is an outrageous situation and not what any of us would expect for someone we care about. 
Waiting lists are an issue that is often brought up in my electorate, and I share the concerns of the member for Shortland. It seems that practically everyone I speak with has a relative or knows of someone on a waiting list for an aged care bed. In 1997-98, 12 per cent of people waiting for high care beds in northern Tasmania waited over three months for that bed. This year, that figure has blown out to 25 per cent. One quarter of the people waiting for essential care services are waiting for over three months. Despite this, northern Tasmania was not granted a single extra high care bed in the 2000-01 allocation round. That means that frail, elderly Australians are waiting. They are waiting in hospital beds; they are waiting at home, unable to look after themselves; they are waiting in inappropriate services and not receiving the care they need to be safe and well. They are just waiting. While the Minister for Aged Care wastes time blaming the states for this terrible problem, frail Australians will continue to wait. And it is just not good enough. 
At June 2000, the northern Tasmanian aged care planning region had a shortage of 139 residential aged care beds, but in the 2000-01 allocation round northern Tasmania was granted only an additional 94 low care beds. These beds are not even going to come on line until 2003-04.
I want to mention that the honourable member for Dunkley will be speaking next in this debate. I know that he is particularly concerned about phantom beds in his electorate, with Lestlin Nominees, a Queensland company, having received an allocation of 140 beds in 1999, and yet not one of those beds is operational. I believe that the member for Dunkley has even undertaken a search for a location where an aged care facility could finally be constructed. It appears that the member for Dunkley appreciates the unacceptable impact of the current Liberal government's aged care policies, and I hope he supports this motion.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Care Standards</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—That was a wonderful, kind introduction from the member for Bass, and I thank her for drawing attention to my assiduous and tireless work in representing my constituency. The point that the member for Bass missed, and the point that my colleague highlighted, is that when the coalition government were elected, the Auditor-General identified a 10,000 bed shortfall and a half billion dollar shortfall in capital funding left to us by the former Labor government. The best the member for Bass can do is complain about the 30,000-plus beds that we have brought onstream since we were elected and the fact that these multimillion dollar facilities require considerable work to have them available and to a standard that provides for the dignity and the proper care of residents. They are not simply hospital beds, which is another point of confusion the member for Bass has identified. These are people's homes. If someone is assessed as needing this sort of accommodation, there is an obligation on all of us to play a constructive role and make sure that that level of care is there.  
I am glad the member for Bass highlighted the work I am undertaking at a local level. We have been able to convince the various state and federal planning authorities that there is an urgent need for additional beds on the Mornington Peninsula. Again, the member for Bass's criticism is that we have actually been successful in attracting more than 400 new residential aged care beds to the Mornington Peninsula region. These are substantial facilities and, again, I thank the member for Bass for her kind praise and for drawing people's attention to the work I have been doing to assist with the early availability of those beds. There is a considerable need for aged care beds, and that is why the government has made more than 30,000 additional aged care beds available since it was elected—to make up for the 10,000 shortfall left to it, plus the growing population that my colleague Mr Andrews was speaking of earlier.
The good news—and this is something that the member for Bass might not be aware of—is that, in the most recent allocation of beds, the region that I represent is getting additional beds, again recognising the need of a growing population and the fact that the Mornington Peninsula is highly regarded as a retirement destination. People choose to retire in our area, and in some cases that retirement takes the form of residential aged care. In addition, we have the RSL Park facility in Frankston—and I am surprised the member for Bass did not talk about it, but I will come back to that in a moment. 
We find in today's Newcastle Herald what this is really all about. The federal member for Shortland, Jill Hall, is just chasing headlines; nothing more than headlines. Where have the Labor Party been while we have had hard work to do to clean up the mess left behind in the aged care sector from 13 years of neglect from the former Labor government? They have been AWOL—absent without leadership. They had no idea how to fix the horrendous problem they left us with. The Gregory report, a report the former Labor government commissioned, identified a half billion dollar shortfall in capital funding, and what did the Labor government do in their final years? They cut capital funding by 75 per cent. That shows the sincerity with which the Labor Party addresses these issues, and that is probably why we have two recently elected members of the Labor Party talking about this subject: it is really helpful to stand up and seem sincere when you have got zero corporate knowledge about where we have come from. That is the only explanation that could be attributed to those earlier speakers. They must have no idea of the mess that was left to this government by the former Labor government in the area of aged care, and that is why they are here talking so sanctimoniously about aged care. 
The member for Bass talks about the acute nature of the care needs of people going into nursing homes. This highlights another confusion in the Labor Party. If they need hospital care, Member for Bass, put them in a hospital. But again that highlights a problem that the aged care community is facing as successive Labor state governments around this country churn people through hospitals: as soon as there is half a chance to get them out of there, they whip them out and dump them on the aged care industry. The member for Bass should go and talk to providers faced with having to accommodate people coming out of hospital at such a rapid rate and who might need care for only a few days, when that is not the appropriate care they need. You should jump to your feet and apologise for those disgraceful remarks you made before.
—I rise on a point of order on relevance, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is not in any way reflecting the aged care crisis and the people who need—
 (Mr Nehl)—There is no point of order. Resume your seat.
—The member for Bass tries to not learn more about the aged care industry by burning up the time that is available to me. Let me again highlight another point that the Labor Party have a problem with: they run around the country saying that they are concerned about the quality of aged care. But, when some action is taken to ensure that the quality of aged care services available to residents is enforced, what do they do? They run around saying, `Gee, this is all too hard. How can you be so cruel?' They did that: the Labor Party did that in Dunkley when the RSL war veterans park was identified as needing some additional assistance. In Riverside, when its problems were identified years ago, they did nothing. They are a hypocritical bunch. (Time expired)
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I have a grievance. I am going to speak today on the confusion caused by the introduction of the Howard government's goods and services tax on the backbone of our community sector. I speak on this topic with some authority: 25 years of working in the community sector for a number of community service organisations and non-profit organisations, and of being on committees of groups ranging from playgroups to school P&Cs to adult sporting clubs. These organisations play a vital role in the fabric of our society. I am talking about the organisations that our kids play at, that help people in trouble in our local area and that run our sporting clubs. What they are faced with under the new tax system is confusion, uncertainty and in some cases the real threat of closure.
Why has this tax system caused this type of chaos? It is causing chaos because it is complicated, ambiguous and in some cases downright destructive. Take, for example, the average sporting group in my electorate of Stirling—I have many such sporting groups. I have received many calls in my office from sporting groups grappling to come to terms with the GST. What has made it so hard? Firstly, the committees of these organisations are usually made up of volunteers. Volunteers, in this International Year of the Volunteer, are struggling and in some cases giving up due to the complexities of this tax system. The honorary treasurer in each of these groups is coming under increasing pressure in their voluntary role—pressure that is causing many of them to quit and to cease their contribution. They have spent the last 12 months coming to terms with issues such as GST registration and changes in the way their organisation is viewed by the Australian Taxation Office.
I recently hosted a BAS inquiry hearing in Scarborough, in my electorate. I heard first hand from both small business operators and community groups about the absolute confusion and frustration experienced over the everyday application of Mr Howard's and Mr Costello's tax system. One of the most damning statements came from a chartered accountant who spoke to the meeting about the increased pressure on sporting club committees. He had been the treasurer of his local tennis club and he spoke about how he had to resign, reluctantly, from his position due to the sheer time needed to perform his voluntary role. This is a man whose accountancy practice deals daily with small businesses coming to grips with BAS and other GST related issues. He said that there had been an enormous amount of misunderstanding over what the club's responsibilities were in relation to the GST. For example, there was an argument on the club committee about whether they should register for the GST or not. The accountant advised the club not to, due to the huge amount of paperwork associated with compliance. He told them it would be cheaper in terms of time and resources to simply absorb the extra costs of the GST on the club's maintenance and running than to have to go through the rigmarole of complying. Why bother when the end result is basically the same in terms of cost? Countless hours of work for no tangible benefit. 
This tennis club was not the only organisation faced with this dilemma. A group of volunteers from the eastern suburbs of my electorate run a voluntary organisation which puts on blue light discos and dances for all age groups in our local area and also throughout the state. Their work with at risk youth through the blue light disco program is commendable. They also put on concerts and dance parties, free of charge, for children suffering from cancer through the CanTeen program. This group fundraises through supplying local councils with concrete slabs for their footpaths.
The new tax system has hit this group in three ways. The first is GST registration. This group, like many others, applied for GST registration because they thought they had to. They thought they had to because the information given to them by the government and the Australian Taxation Office during the GST implementation was defective. It was extremely ambiguous; it was not clear. This group found as they approached tax time that they really should not have registered for the GST. They did not need to, and the amount of paperwork it created was prohibitive. They subsequently had to apply to deregister. The emotional toll on the committee caused by this was heavy. Finding advice through the current phone system was both time consuming and frustrating. They still have not had written notification from the tax office that their deregistration has actually occurred, they only have copies of the documents that they personally lodged with the ATO as proof of lodgment.
The next dilemma was the status of their treatment as a charity. They rang the tax office and received the charity pack. This was subsequently filled in, and endorsement sought. For those of you in the House who are not aware of the processes involved, I will briefly outline them so they can be better understood. The current government has brought in a system of endorsing charities. Previously, a non--profit organisation which had operated as a charity prior to the introduction of the GST had self-assessed. Under the new system, to receive treatment as a charity they need to submit an application to be endorsed. The information for this process is in a tax office publication called Charity Pack. Once the application has been completed, it is sent to the ATO for review. In the case of my local community group, they received a letter from the ATO advising them that their application had been rejected. I will read to the House some of the text of this letter:
Dear Directors
INCOME TAX:
Notification of refusal of endorsement as an Income Tax Exempt Charity
We refer to your application for endorsement as an Income Tax Exempt Charity.
You are advised that ... 
XXX—the name of the group—
is not considered to be an Income Tax Exempt Charity and your request for endorsement has been refused.
Your organisation does not fall to be considered to be an institution that is established and run to advance or promote a charitable purpose, as described in the Charity Pack. The following are not considered to be charities:
recreational and social bodies ....
Further Information
The following publications, which are available from our website at www.taxreform.ato. gov.au, provide further information:
• CLUBPACK—helps you work out if your organisation is exempt from income tax.
• CHARITYPACK—helps you work out if you are a charity.
Should you require any further information the ATO has a range of publications to assist you. You should contact the Tax Reform Infoline if you need further assistance.
The letter then goes on to outline the review rights under the legislation by giving the standard ATO response for appeals. The group then rang the infoline and spoke to the case officer from the ATO, but did not receive any coherent answer on their status. My office then rang the case officer and made inquiries on behalf of the organisation. The answers given were so obscure that my office asked to talk to a supervisor. The problem with the ATO letter is that it does not provide information on the reasons for the rejection. It then asks the group to get further information by recommending that they get a copy of the pack that they have just read and applied with. It is effectively sending the group back to the pack they have just used. No explanation is given.  
My office then spoke to the supervisor, who would not provide them with the number for a direct contact in Western Australia so we could contact them to find out information about the application. A promise was made to my office that someone from WA would ring the office and talk to my staff. A call was received from the ATO in Perth. After discussion it was agreed that information on a tax ruling for community groups, and a club pack, would be sent out. When asked about what training the ATO had provided to groups like this one, the answer was that money had been made available to peak bodies to train groups. Investigation revealed that this money was limited to peak bodies. In my electorate of Stirling there are over 400 community groups and the vast majority of these are independent from peak bodies. There are over 4,000 such groups in Western Australia alone, so the magnitude of this problem can be seen.
When the ATO was asked whether there were officers similar to the GST compliance officers used in the business sector for these community groups, officers that would be available to visit and advise them, my office was given the answer, `No.' My office was told that the Internet and the infoline was sufficient and that no personal support was available. This reveals that the government has failed its obligations in relation to the community sector. It has failed to properly resource an education campaign that is sorely needed in the community. It wasted countless of millions of dollars on the Unchain Your Heart campaign, a campaign that provided no real information to the community and was spectacular in its failure. Money was wasted on glossy propaganda rather than constructive assistance, advice and education seminars for volunteer management committees. 
What has this caused? It has caused confusion amongst these small groups run by community volunteers who do not understand the intricacies of this tax system. It has failed to properly provide support for a vital sector of our community, a sector that provides services that enhance the lives of millions of Australians.
The community group I have been discussing now has a third problem. It is trying to gain endorsement as a deductible gift recipient under item 4.1.1 as a public benevolent institution. This group enjoyed this status under the previous tax system but now its status is unclear. The endorsement criteria are complicated and rigid. What happens to this organisation if this endorsement is not achieved? It will struggle to fund raise for its activities that are playing a constructive role in our community. I will continue to assist local community organisations in my electorate on this issue. I will be writing to them all to offer assistance. What I want the Treasurer to do is to take action and provide field officers and education seminars to help avert a crisis in this sector. It needs to be done now. What does the government need to do? It needs to do more than hide behind glossy brochures—it needs to provide active support to our community organisations.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"— The Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is designed to improve the equity of the termination payments surcharge and superannuation contributions surcharge legislation. It makes permanent the transitional provisions that have applied since 20 August 1996. These are measures which were announced in the budget on 22 May this year. 
The bill will ensure that only the post 20 August 1996 amount of an employer eligible termination payment taken as cash will be taken into account for the surcharge. This reverses the current situation that makes all of the retained amount of an employer eligible termination payment—including amounts relating to pre-20 August 1996 service—accountable for the surcharge. This particular provision has been roundly criticised as being inequitable, including in the Australian Financial Review on 31 March this year.
The bill also provides that only a notional amount of an employer eligible termination payment is included in the calculation of the employee's adjusted taxable income for surcharge purposes. This will benefit employees or former employees who would not normally be subject to the surcharge but could become liable to pay the surcharge in a given year as a consequence of receiving an employer eligible termination payment.
The bill will also ensure that employees will not have to pay an effective tax rate higher than the top marginal tax rate plus the Medicare levy when taking their ETP as cash. Currently, some people may face a higher effective tax rate due to the interaction of the termination payment surcharge and the reasonable benefit limits provisions. In terms of impact on Commonwealth revenue, according to the explanatory memorandum, the estimated cost to revenue is $14 million in 2001-02, $21 million in 2002-03, $17 million in 2003-04 and $21 million in 2004-05.  
The opposition will be supporting this legislation. Indeed, it reflects measures which the opposition have been calling for and matters which we opposed at the time the surcharge legislation was introduced. The opposition drew these matters to the government's attention back then as anomalies and it has taken them until now to come around.
The termination payments surcharge came into effect on 20 August 1996. It is imposed on what might be described as golden handshakes paid on termination of employment of so-called high income earners. Termination payments are the retained amounts—that is, amounts not rolled over or transferred into a superannuation fund—of eligible termination payments made by employers on the termination of employment of an employee. The surcharge is payable only if the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for the financial year in question exceeds the surcharge threshold. For example, for this financial year, 2001-02, it is imposed at the rate of one per cent for each $1,219 of assessable income where a member's assessable income and superannuation contributions exceed $85,242. The maximum surcharge is 15 per cent, and that maximum is reached when assessable income and superannuation contributions reach $103,507. 
The government announced in the 1996-97 budget that a surcharge would apply to contributions that are subject to a tax deduction—including employer contributions and those made by the members where there is no employer contribution and the deduction has been claimed—where the assessable income and superannuation contributions exceeded $70,000. That has since been indexed to the amounts that I just outlined. Since 1999-2000, the so-called reportable fringe benefits of an employee are taken into account in working out superannuation surcharge liabilities.
The government introduced a transition period, which was scheduled to expire at the start of July. Following the expiry of the transition period, all of the termination payments accrued after 30 June 1983—even entitlements accrued prior to the introduction of the surcharge legislation—were to be subject to the surcharge. The surcharge itself has received a great deal of criticism, but some of these measures have attracted particular criticism. The termination payments surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge were examined in the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, Superannuation Surcharge Legislation, which sets out in very comprehensive detail many of the concerns that have been raised.
One of those concerns is a question of inequities in the transitional provisions for the termination payments surcharge. The definition of assessable income includes termination payments or golden handshakes. But inclusion of termination payments can result in lower income persons—not simply high income people—being liable for the surcharge. Somebody who loses their job and receives a redundancy payment can find themself in this category where the redundancy payment is included in their adjusted taxable income for the year in question as if it were income for one year only, and therefore it can put that person in the surcharge category. 
Despite the government having been made aware of these sorts of problems through the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into the original surcharge legislation, it has taken these past four years for some of these issues to be addressed. We were going to face the situation where the full 15 per cent super surcharge would apply to most substantial taxable separation payments, so that before the age of 55 normal unfunded super tax of 31.5 per cent for post-1983 benefits and the 15 per cent surcharge—a total of 46.5 per cent tax—would apply on taxable separation payments. That would have seen thousands of taxpayers being unfairly caught in the surcharge net after receiving large termination payments. Often those termination payments were received on retrenchment.
There is no doubt that the superannuation contributions and the termination payments surcharge have become important sources of revenue for this government since it introduced them. In 1999-2000 surcharge collections alone amounted to $577 million. Senator Sherry indicated to me that in the latest budget papers the surcharge collection amount has been hidden and it is no longer possible to identify what the surcharge collection yields for the government. It has simply been hidden in superannuation contributions and taxes more generally. I am indebted to the Department of the Parliamentary Library's Information and Research Services for their comment: 
... the history of the superannuation contributions and termination payments surcharge now appears to have gone full circle in a rather “Kafka-esque” manner. 
I think that they have put it more boldly than the Parliamentary Library usually put these things, but they have put it very accurately. I do not think that I can improve on that. They continue:
These surcharges were introduced as “equity measures” to make the level of superannuation taxation concessions available to high income earners more comparable to those available to middle and lower income earners. On the brink of the expiration of the transitional provisions, the surcharge legislation is being amended to remove “the most inequitable provisions of tax law” that could potentially and unfairly (but legally) catch taxpayers in the surcharge net after receiving large termination payments, ...
They go on:
... the surcharge legislation remains on the statute books. Many of the witnesses to the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation provisions will still be dealing with the complex administration, clumsy assessment procedures and on-going administration costs that are borne not just by the high income earners, but by all superannuation fund members. 
As I said, these were not my words, but I could not put it better myself. 
In relation to this express issue before the House, the sort of situation that arose is the example of the bus driver with the Brisbane City Council—I do not have the express details in front of me—who received a pretty modest amount of about $17 an hour in pay. Over the course of 22 years he had built up in his superannuation account some $70,000—and people who know a bit about superannuation will know that $70,000 over 22 years is not much and will not take you very far. On the closure of that defined benefit fund that he was a member of and the establishment of an accumulation fund in its place, he and other members rolled over their money into that new accumulation fund, and that $70,000 was included in his taxable income for the year in question. The tax office said, `Thank you very much. We will have $10,000 of that by way of superannuation surcharge.' That sort of anomaly has really been a most unfortunate issue with this surcharge, which was claimed to be an equitable measure and something which impacts on high income earners.
I want to indicate to the government that, while we will support it, Labor's view is that this measure certainly does not fix all the anomalies associated with the superannuation surcharge. One of the anomalies has been the subject of reports recently in the Financial Review in particular, and it is one which has been brought forward by the Australian and International Pilots Association who have done a submission to the Productivity Commission on the surcharge tax legislation. Their particular concern relates to the way in which members of certain defined benefit superannuation schemes are subjected to the surcharge tax. In their submission to the Productivity Commission they say:
Existing legislation unintentionally confers a benefit on business at the expense of the members of those funds. Currently, if a fund chooses to implement a surcharge debit offset account to administer the superannuation surcharge tax, an inequity can arise because of the difference between the interest rates applied to a member's benefit and the rates applied to the member's surcharge tax liability.
So you have a situation where your superannuation benefits are accruing—and in a defined benefit fund they accrue in a certain way—but you also have a liability accruing, this surcharge debit offset account, which can have a different rate of interest and can accrue at a higher rate than the rate at which your benefit is accruing. The submission continues:
This inequity results because the surcharge tax is in effect borrowed by the super fund, from the super fund, in order to pay the Federal Government tax. The capital and interest on the loan is charged to an account in the member's name and compounds whilst a member remains in the fund. The compounded amount is then subtracted from the final benefit upon the member's retirement from the fund. 
So, according to the pilots association, for a member having around 30 years membership in the fund, a three per cent gap between the credited earnings rate and salary inflation rate results in a reduction of around 13 per cent of the final benefit. They say:
Applying credited earnings rate to surcharge offset accounts is always detrimental. Despite the absence of express legislative authority, surcharge offset accounts are used by some corporate schemes as a result of discretion given to trustees by the trust deeds of their respective funds. In such cases, actuarial opinion varies widely as to the correct rate of interest to be applied. 
I have to say that this is a problem in the way that the surcharge is to be calculated for defined benefit funds, full stop, because there is a legitimate argument as to how you correctly calculate the employer contribution in the cases of these defined benefit funds.
The advice obtained by the pilots association consistently confirms that the use of the credited earnings rate of interest will be detrimental in the long run to fund members, irrespective of members' years of service, when compared to either the actuarially assumed salary inflation rate or the 10-year long-term bond rate that is used for public sector unfunded defined benefit schemes. Their submission says that they have received advice from Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, that there is no need for the trustees to adopt the practice of establishing debt accounts for affected members. Nevertheless, this is occurring and the pilots association believe that the legislation has inequitable consequences for fully funded defined benefit members.
It is clear that the federal government's legislation intends that the funds should recoup the tax from the members' accounts—there is no argument about that—but, because of the many different types of funds covered by the surcharge act, the decision by some trustees to use surcharge debit accounts for fully funded schemes when that method is only expressly authorised for unfunded schemes has resulted in significant issues for fully funded defined benefit members. That problem is even more exaggerated when inappropriate interest rates are used. 
So there are some serious questions that have been raised here, and I understand that the same sorts of issues arise in relation to other schemes as well, such as those of judges. It is possible that the amounts that they have their accounts reduced by can exceed even the 15 per cent of the surcharge, much less take into account the fact that they were entitled to benefits that had accrued during the years—and, in some cases, the many years—prior to the surcharge coming into effect.
The other anomaly that I want to mention to the House goes to the way in which the surcharge is calculated on shift workers. People who work in mines and various types of employment have their superannuation guarantee entitlements, the amount of superannuation money they are being paid, calculated on a base rate of pay but have there superannuation surcharge calculated on a total rate of pay. So people are receiving the superannuation guarantee on a lower rate of salary but are having to pay the surcharge that is calculated on a higher rate of salary.
A case of this kind was drawn to my attention recently by the member for Charlton, Kelly Hoare, which involves shift workers at the Eraring power station. They are entitled to the employee's base wage and have superannuation guarantee payments based on that. When they are assessing income, they have the base salary plus 20 per cent allowances, so their income is well below the superannuation surcharge levy lower limit. But the tax office applies the superannuation surcharge levy to the state government employee's base wage plus actual allowances of 37.7 per cent plus employer superannuation contributions, which puts the income above the superannuation surcharge levy upper limit. You can understand that a worker in a situation like that—where their entitlements are calculated on one salary but their taxation liabilities are calculated on a different salary—would be pretty unimpressed. I have come across a number of examples of that kind in the past few years, and I suggest to the government that these situations represent further surcharge anomalies which it ought to be prepared to examine. 
Having regard to these sorts of anomalies, Labor has indicated that we intend to have a review of superannuation. This government has no vision in relation to superannuation. By contrast, Labor in office built up superannuation from $40 billion back in 1983 to $500 billion now. We are prepared to look at some of these issues. We note the attempt by the government to mount a scare campaign based on misinformation in relation to superannuation. It is absolutely untrue that Labor intends to increase the superannuation guarantee contributions by employers; nevertheless, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business have been endeavouring to beat that up and continually misrepresent the opposition.
The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and I have all said, no, there will not be an increase in compulsory employer contributions to superannuation. It is necessary to have some honesty in political debate in this country, and I think the Prime Minister, the Minister for Small Business and others would do us all a favour if they ceased and desisted from misrepresenting what we have to say in the area of superannuation. We are concerned about superannuation anomalies. We do intend to have a review of superannuation with a view to building on the achievements of Labor in government in this area. As I indicated at the outset, Labor will be supporting this legislation which we believe is some time overdue.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS TAXES AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—The Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is one of those pieces of legislation where I believe the government has seen that change is needed and has moved with certainty to bring it about, and that change is a reduction in the surcharge on certain termination payments—that is, in regard to the termination payments surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge. We have listened to the Australian Labor Party tonight, and my colleague opposite has rightly said that they will not be opposing this legislation. However, neither did they oppose the introduction of the 15 per cent surcharge on superannuation termination payments when it was first introduced in 1997. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, I think you would be aware of that measure—the so-called measure to reduce the advantage that recipients of very high, late payments from super funds or golden handshakes had in the tax system—that was introduced by the government to rectify that problem. Labor did not oppose that measure; Gareth Evans, who was the shadow Treasurer at the time, I believe, did not seek to modify or change it. I notice that a number of members of the opposition, in the speeches made at that time, all skirted around the issue but said that they thought it was reasonable at the end of the day.
I picked up today a report in the Financial Review dated 10 May 2001, where the spokesman on these matters for the Australian Labor Party indicated:
Labor has been opposed to the additional 15 per cent surcharge for high-income earners, and Mr Thomson said this new tax had been “adverse” for funds and “problematic” for investors.
I would just say that, after listening carefully to his speech tonight, I think he ought to clarify exactly where his party stands. He cannot make statements to the press saying that the Labor Party is opposed to these measures and then come in here and say, `Well, we are not opposed. We're worried about some of the administration, but we are not opposed to the measures.' That report continues that the shadow assistant Treasurer:
... also argues that it was anomalous for eligible termination payments and rollovers for low-income people to be hit by the tax.
It is perfectly proper for him to have that view, and that is the measure that is being resolved here tonight. The changes that we are introducing here are well thought through changes, changes that are necessary and changes that will improve the application of the measures by bringing into effect, before the time necessary, before 19 August—which I believe is the eligibility date—the temporary measures introduced by the government now being made permanent. Those changes will be welcomed by everybody affected. 
That article in the Financial Review of 10 May, to which I have already referred, continues:
In criticising the Government's approach to superannuation, Thomson also spelt out the reform targets for any incoming Labor government.
“[The Howard] Government did a lot of damage to super through imposing the surcharge, through not proceeding with our co-contribution, by requiring over-55s to access their super before they can be eligible for unemployment benefits,” he says.
While these reforms would be aimed at boosting voluntary contribution, Labor is also sympathetic to increasing the compulsory contribution from the 9 per cent level that will take effect next year.
He says the evidence suggests that the proposed 9 per cent compulsory contribution in 2002 “is still not enough”, although the issue of adequacy would be examined in detail by the inquiry.
That is the inquiry he has mentioned here tonight.
So both the spokesman and the Leader of the Opposition are saying, `We know it is not enough money to meet the goals to have the compulsory level of super pegged at nine per cent,' but they trail their coat by saying, `Well, we are not sure whether we are going to do it; we are going to have an inquiry.' That is code for `we are going to do it, but we do not want to tell you we are going to do it.' That is exactly the system that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating adopted on a number of occasions when they were in office to break the news that they were going to change the tax system—like bringing in capital gains tax and other taxes. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition, in a doorstop on 2 August, said:
 We introduced the Superannuation Guarantee charge that is still not quite complete. It will be at 9 per cent of your income next year. It needs to be more than that.
In the same doorstop he goes on to say: 
If you can get it [superannuation contributions] say to 12 to 15 per cent instead of  9 per cent of people's earnings you have solved the problem ... we are almost there at 9 per cent. Next year, we will be almost there, we just need another three to five on top of that. 
That is as good as saying that there is going to be an increase in compulsory super contributions for employers. That is an added cost that the Labor Party are not saying they are going to apply, but they are going to apply it.
One can go back over a series of weeks to statements that have been made—including statements made by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Kelvin Thomson, who has been in here tonight—saying that the 15 per cent is a desirable goal. That 15 per cent is a different 15 per cent to the super surcharge that we are debating here tonight. As was indicated by Mr Thomson, he would not want to see the super surcharge—`and I have quoted from the appropriate sections of the Financial Review that the Labor Party was opposed to the super surcharge.' Not true; absolutely untrue. The Labor Party are supporting it. They are not going to vote against it here or in the Senate. They have always adopted that attitude, going right back to the day of its introduction. So I do not know what the Australian Labor Party are expecting to achieve by trying to play one side of the fence in a financial journal that I suppose they feel is read exclusively by magnates of some sort or another who would be affected by the super surcharge but not read by ordinary people. Completely untrue. It shows you how out of touch they are with the average Australian.
It is almost universally agreed that superannuation is too complex. But when you go to examine how you might change it it becomes a problem; and, despite the agreement by many authorities that it is too complex, there does not seem to be any perfect plan on the way in which you should tax superannuation. So the government has moved to modify the taxation put in place by our predecessors, and has instigated a superannuation surcharge and a termination payments surcharge simply to bring some more equity into the system, to bring a balance, and to still, however, give favoured treatment to the taxing provisions of superannuation. I think any financial adviser will quickly tell a member of the public that there is still significant advantage in investing in superannuation. The advantage is still there, the certainty is still there and the benefits are still there. So, despite surcharges, complexity and all the rest of it, this government has moved to clarify areas of superannuation. This legislation before the House tonight does these things. 
The government has announced three measures relating to employer contributions and to the surcharge. I think these measures have been widely welcomed. The date—19 August—is going to be in place so that the changes to the transitional provisions for surcharge on ETPs would be coming to an end and therefore the full amount of the ETPs taken as cash would be surchargeable from 19 August. From the calculations on amounts that I have seen, that means a reduction of something like 75 per cent in the payments. That is a very significant reduction; there is still the application of some surcharge, but there is a significant reduction. The first measure in this legislation tonight addresses this issue and ensures that only the post-August 1996 amount of an employer contribution will be surchargeable. It is not going back before that time, but only taking in the four or five years since that time, so the averaging process applies only to that four or five years.
The second measure in this legislation will ensure that low to middle income earners with modest employer payments will generally not be subject to surcharge. I have been given an example that a taxpayer who currently takes an employer ETP of $90,000 as cash will have the full amount included in their adjusted taxable income and could be subject to a surcharge of the full 15 per cent—the range, as I remember it, is one to 15 per cent. Under the new arrangements, if this taxpayer has 10 years service, only $9,000 will be included in their adjusted taxable income. Provided other components of adjusted taxable income are less than $72,000, this person will now pay no surcharge. That is a release and a relief for the lower to modest and medium income earner. The final measure in this legislation will ensure that taxpayers do not pay more than the top marginal rate plus Medicare levy on an employer ETP that is subject to a surcharge.
So we have here a sensible provision, announced by the Assistant Treasurer back on 22 May—it has been coming for that long. The legislation and amendments are in place. It will be a big improvement. It will simplify the process and it will alleviate payment by a number of people within the system. Making these changes will, of course, result in a loss of revenue for government which, if I remember rightly, will be in the range of $17 million to $21 million in a full year. It is a significant loss of revenue. It alleviates the situation of lower to medium income earners. A bit of additional information which I think is useful is that for approved early retirement schemes and bona fide redundancy payments, the tax-free amount for 1999-2000 is $4,858 plus $2,429 for each completed year of service. That is indexed for the next year—2000-01—to $5,062 plus $2,531 for each completed year of service.
I commend the bill to the House. It is a sensible modification made to legislation that many would prefer not to have, but which is a piece of equity legislation put in place by a government seeking to balance the opportunities for people, whether they be high earners receiving a golden handshake or a big superannuation payout or somebody who has a small DIY fund or a small fund contributed to by their employer as they work day to day.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS TAXES AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—in reply—Mr Deputy Speaker, in summing up the Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, I am well aware of the time and I will endeavour to truncate my comments. This bill introduces three measures which will improve the operation and fairness of the superannuation surcharge in relation to employer eligible termination payments. The government is responding to concerns that have been raised about the surcharge provisions, and these measures have been widely welcomed. The government announced on 22 May 2001 the measures contained in this bill as part of the 2001-02 federal budget.
The first measure continues existing arrangements that are to finish on 19 August this year. Without this measure, surcharge would be payable on the full amount of a termination payment from 20 August 2001. This measure ensures that only the portion of a termination payment received that relates to service after 20 August 1996 will be subject to the surcharge. The second measure ensures that taxpayers who receive modest termination payments and who otherwise do not have high incomes should have a reduced or no surcharge liability. This will be achieved by averaging certain termination payments over the individual's period of service with the employer, for the purposes of determining the appropriate surcharge rate. The third measure will ensure that taxpayers who receive a termination payment in cash will not pay more than the top marginal tax rate plus the Medicare levy. 
I do have a range of rebuttal points to the matters raised by the honourable member for Wills but, bearing in mind the time allocated for this section of the debate is just about finished, I will not proceed in a detailed response. That does not mean, of course, that we accept the points made by the member for Wills. The measures in the bill clearly improve the overall equity of the termination payments surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge legislation. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001 establishes a new comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices in Australia. The Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2001 is consequential and it provides for annual charges to be imposed in respect of medical devices included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. In 1998, Australia signed a mutual recognition agreement with the European Community that covers a number of industry sectors, including the medical device sector, and permits conformity assessment of medical devices traded between Australia and Europe to be undertaken in the exporting country. In addition, Australia has been a principal member of a broader project, the Global Harmonisation Task Force for medical devices, that has used the European regulatory system, which is considered to be world's best practice, as the basis for a global model for medical device regulation. The system proposed in this bill incorporates elements of the EC regulatory requirements and will apply to medical devices that are not covered by the EC's system, including tampons and hospital and commercial grade disinfectants.
The main provisions of this bill are: a new scheme that will be a separate chapter in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989; the introduction of a definition of `medical device' including a classification scheme based on the level of invasiveness of the body, duration of use and contact with the central nervous or circulatory system; the requirement for manufacturers to meet `essential principles' for safety and performance; the requirement for manufacturers to demonstrate that appropriate quality management procedures have been applied in the manufacture of a device; and flexible options for pre-market assessment of medical devices. It includes provisions for exemptions for medical devices to treat medically ill patients or importation under the Personal Import Scheme, for special treatment or experimental purposes—that is, clinical trials—and those covered by an authorised prescriber authority. The bill also includes a wide range of post-market mechanisms to enforce compliance with safety and quality control standards; the additional power to suspend medical devices from the register; the introduction of additional offences relating to non-compliance together with penalties; and a transitional period of five years within which manufacturers must comply with the requirements of the new scheme. 
Overall, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001 provides for a much more comprehensive and rigorous system for the regulation of medical devices than currently exists. In addition, unlike previous bills, such as the recently debated Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001, the proposed system has been developed in close consultation with both industry and consumer stakeholders and it has their support. However, it is disappointing to see that the Minister for Health and Aged Care has failed to take this opportunity to address a major concern raised not only by Labor but also by his own Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care that would see the establishment of a registry for permanently implantable devices. That is something that the Labor Party actively pursued publicly and in parliament last year as a means of providing additional public health safeguards for Australians who have had implanted devices such as heart pacemakers.
Labor's efforts in this area follow the recall in Australia in June last year of the St Jude brand of heart pacemakers following concerns about the premature failure of these devices, which illustrated deficiencies in the system for identifying and contacting recipients. As an interesting aside, St Jude is the patron saint of desperate cases, which is probably the way that many of those involved in the recall felt at the time. I understand that the recall has recently become the subject of litigation by a group of patients who were understandably distressed by the experience.
Deficiencies in the system relating to the tracking of implanted devices were also discussed as part of the inaugural meeting of the Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care in February 2000. One of the areas for immediate action identified during that meeting was the need to examine a system to track implanted medical devices. In support of this, I shall quote the media statement released by the council on 18 February 2000. It states:
Chaired by Dr Bruce Barraclough, President of the Australasian College of Surgeons, and supported by State and Federal Health Ministers, the Council will provide national leadership to improve the safety and quality of care in hospitals and other health settings.
`The Council has considered existing activities in safety and quality as they relate to consumers of health care, looking at the diversity and breadth of the issues as well as the available resources and the linkages that need to be made,' said Dr Barraclough.
`We have made a good start on a strategic plan for the Council, its vision and our objectives over the next five years, as well as identifying areas for immediate action ...
One of those areas identified in the media statement for immediate action is to `examine a system to track implanted medical devices'. The release goes on to state:
`This Council provides health ministers and indeed the whole health sector, including consumers, with a unique opportunity to build on existing knowledge and work in the area of safety and quality to make genuine gains and implement credible and realistic national standards ...
I understand that the council will be pursuing the medical devices issue as a priority next year.
At the time of the St Jude recall, Labor called on the Howard government to heed the advice of the council to institute such an examination and to set up a registry for implanted devices, including pacemakers. In response, the minister for health, care of a nice dorothy dixer, told parliament that the current system was the best in the world and that was that. Well, that is not what his own expert committee thinks, as evidenced by their initial recommendations and their continued pursuit of the matter.
Again, I draw members' attention to the council's statement, which calls for health ministers to take advantage of the opportunity to build on existing knowledge and work. We may indeed have the best system relative to others, but it is a system that can and should be better. That is why Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to provide a legislative and regulatory framework for the establishment of a registry for notifiable implantable devices that will enable efficient tracking and improve recall procedures. 
While the current bill provides that the Secretary of the Therapeutic Goods Administration may impose conditions on the inclusion of a device on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, including keeping records relating to the tracking and location of devices of that kind after their supply, Labor and the experts believe that such conditions must be mandatory. Labor amendments will place responsibility for the accurate listing of implanted devices with both the manufacturer and the medical practitioner responsible for the implant. There will also be provisions for advising the registry if an implant has been removed.
While the area of most urgency relates to those devices that are life supporting or life sustaining, such as cardiac pacemakers, it is the view of experts in the field that any registry should eventually cover all permanently implanted devices such as new hip joints, breasts and penile implants. Labor amendments, which allow for particulars in respect of the definition of a notifiable implantable device to be set out in regulation, provide sufficient flexibility to address these important issues. In order to ensure that the good system that Australians enjoy can be even better and even safer, I would strongly urge the government to accept these sensible and important amendments when they are moved during consideration in detail. 
In supporting the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2001, Labor, and I am sure many Australians, await with interest the government's response to our proposed amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (MEDICAL DEVICES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—We are debating tonight changes to, and the launch of, the therapeutic goods processes in Australia. This is an area in which I have been most critical of the Therapeutic Goods Authority for the unnecessary delays they impose on Australian producers and manufacturers, often with nothing more than a bureaucratic reason, the result of which is to deny Australian users and patients the latest techniques to be used to their benefit and to improve their health. I have also been critical of the costs and charges of this organisation, because there seems to be no limit to what they can charge for what comes into their head. I urge the government and the minister to keep an eye on those processes and not to relent in respect of the high standards that obtain to the Therapeutic Goods Authority.
The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001 and cognate bill that we are debating tonight seeks to introduce an improved code and process, and something which is more structured and understandable than what we have had in the past. It is said that we are moving towards a European consideration of therapeutic goods and products. That has some advantages and some disadvantages for Australia. However, there is a view among similar countries, such as Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia, to name four, that the process we are following is by far the best process to gain the best results for Australians.
I would like to draw the attention of the House to another area. If we settle for a code that has international credibility, then we must accept that, if a product or device is tested in the most rigorous way under the code or a code similar to the one we have adopted, that test should be adequate for Australian conditions. If there is a need for the manufacturers to verify at every stage that the testing processes have been properly supervised, and if they can verify all the testing steps, I do not see why we should spend months verifying those tests in Australia. That is often the case. I noticed recently that the TGA fast-tracked a simple product and that fast-tracking process took 10 months.
I notice also that only just recently the Therapeutic Goods Administration has given approval to the general use of modified silicon breast implants. That comes just two months after more than 3,000 Australian women received a $38 million payout in the case against the Dow Corning Corporation. There is need for care in this area and there is also a need to make sure that Australians are not disadvantaged and that they have access to the most recent techniques and the best technology in the world for their own health and their own benefit. 
Among the issues dealt with by the TGA has been the ordering of drugs on the Internet. I understand that within Australia, the Pharmacy Guild of Queensland has said that about seven per cent of Australians could be buying illegal and unregistered drugs over the Internet without prescription or quality assurance. That is a very dangerous process. Pharmaceutical and health industry representatives are absolutely right to make sure that authorities such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration are aware that that could be happening. The administration has said that it has taken several actions to stop the illegal sale of drugs on the Internet, but it could not provide details of every case. That is understandable because the management of the Internet is new and difficult and it may impose very large costs on Australian authorities as they try to track down the way in which the Internet is being used and the purposes for which it is being used.
I will run through the changes in the bill briefly. Five classes of classification are to be established. Some of the examples of the types of medical devices that will be covered by the regulations under the bill include class I which is defined as `low risk devices which are non-invasive, such as hospital beds'—we can imagine a long-term test on a hospital bed—`walking aids, wheelchairs, simple surgical and dental instruments'. Those are the sorts of areas that are quite irritating. It seems to take ages to redetermine whether something that has proved to be serviceable for many years, and which has a known reputation, is safe to use. Class IIa covers `intermediate risk medical devices ... such as hearing aids, dental filling materials, ECG machines, hospital grade disinfectants' and so on. Class IIb covers `intermediate risk medical devices, including some invasive or implantable devices, such as baby incubators, external pacemakers, surgical lasers, ventilators' and so on. Class III covers `high risk devices, including surgically invasive devices and animal-derived products, such as absorbable sutures, heart valves, vascular prostheses and stents' and other products. There is also a fifth class, AIMDs. This covers `implantable pulse generators, implantable electrodes and implantable drug infusion devices', all of which of course could be of high risk to the patient.
This legislation is needed and it is warranted. It creates a registrable and listable group, which I have just described. I think the classification scheme is a sensible one. I appeal to those who have responsibility to use the terms and powers of the TGA to make sure that the complex definitions of medical devices and therapeutic devices are made clear. One only has to look at the list of devices which fall within the definitions—if they are to stand as proposed—to see the wide range, which includes:
• diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,
• diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap,
• investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, or
• control of conception.
There are a wide range of products that spring to mind when one looks at those broad series of definitions.
The government has been dealing with this and consulting for a long time. I hope the whole process works because it will be to Australia's benefit, but it must serve two purposes: it must provide quick, accurate access to known cures that can produce certain results and it must also act as a policeman against any abuse or uncertainty that can arise in the use of medical and therapeutic devices.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (MEDICAL DEVICES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—Recipients of medical devices would not enjoy the same quality of life without them. In particular, when we think of things such as pacemakers or heart valves, it is clear that, without these, life expectancy for some people would be severely limited. Medical devices are health care products whose use requires the assistance of health care professionals. 
What these amendments do is benefit consumers through comprehensive risk management. Medical devices will be classified according to the risk involved in the use of the device, which is dependent on the level of invasiveness in the human body, the duration of use and things like contact with the nervous system or the circulatory system. The classification moves from what we currently have with the TGA—a prescriptive system with two classes—to a system with five classes. The new system will identify and manage risks involved with the new technology.
When we think of medical devices, it is important that we have a system of regulation and this is an improvement on the previous regulation, which came into place in 1989. The TGA is our equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. When we think of things like the Dalkon Shield or the Bjork-Shiley heart valve, this legislation attempts to ensure that, if there are any unintended consequences like there were from those items in future, there will be an improved ability, firstly, to assess the risk and also to recall those products.
The bill allows the introduction of an internationally harmonised framework for the regulation of medical devices that will protect consumers and allow for the rapid availability of medical technologies. The problem with the Therapeutic Goods Administration Act 1989 is that it does not balance risk classification of new technologies with safety and quality standards. That is what this new bill does. The current act only recognises unique Australian standards and does not recognise the fact that something like 90 per cent of medical devices are imported. It also limits the post-market monitoring and the adverse incident reporting that can occur within the Australian jurisdiction.
Since the mid-1990s, the Global Harmonisation Task Force—which includes the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia—has been working on the development of a global model to regulate medical devices. This model is based on the European approach and what this bill does is consistent with the global model and consistent with the European approach. The high risk devices are manufactured by a small number of multinationals. To avoid the costs of unique regulation we should have a consistent system around the world. I should also mention that, while about 90 per cent of medical devices are imported, within Australia this is a $1.8 billion industry and about 40 per cent of that is exported.
There are consumer benefits from this new bill. As I said before, we will have a risk based classification, where the level of regulation will match the risk. Also, manufacturers will be required to be audited and to have their systems certified. It also allows certain high risk devices to be assessed by the TGA—for example, products which may contain contaminated animal material and may be contaminated with BSE can still be assessed by the TGA.
There are also benefits for the industry in this new bill. It removes a system of unique Australian regulation. It also facilitates the agreement between Australia and the European Union on the mutual recognition agreement, and it provides flexibility for manufacturers and provides the option of electronic lodgment on the register. It also allows the TGA to suspend a device rather than just cancelling it on the register, allowing time to investigate adverse incidents.
The bill is the result of extensive consultations since 1998 with consumers, the medical devices industry, professional groups and states and territories. The Therapeutic Goods Administration regulates medicines and therapeutic devices at a national level. This bill legislates for a new system to classify, assess and approve medical devices. Medical devices include pacemakers, heart valves, medical gloves, bandages, syringes, condoms, contact lenses, X-ray equipment, heart rate monitors, surgical lasers, dialysis equipment and baby incubators. That is not an exclusive list, but it is the sort of thing that we are looking at. The Australian medical device industry was valued at $1½ billion in 1996. We have about one per cent of the global market and, as I mentioned, 40 per cent of this is exported. But, of what we have here in Australia, 90 per cent is imported. 
In June 1998 Australia signed the mutual recognition agreement with the then European Community. This treaty covers a number of industries, including the medical device industry. I will go into some detail on the treaty. It allows assessment to be carried out in the exporting country. This is intended as a flexibility measure to remove unnecessary regulation and duplication. It does not require harmonisation or the mutual recognition of standards. All the European assessment body has to do is check that products comply with the Australian standards. There is also, as I said before, a wider Global Harmonisation Task Force which includes G7 countries and the rest of the European Union. The Global Harmonisation Task Force is based on the European system.
The aims of this bill are to reduce unnecessary regulation and to give consumers faster access to new technologies while still maintaining safety standards. The bill defines medical devices. It also classifies medical devices based on the level of invasiveness of the body, the duration of use and the contact with the central nervous system or the circulatory system. For example, class I is low risk; class III includes things like heart valves, absorbable sutures and vascular prostheses. It also has a special class for active implantable medical devices, which includes things like pacemakers.
The bill provides for a new and comprehensive system to classify medical devices based on the level of risk they will pose to patients. It also introduces essential principles of safety and performance and conformity assessment procedures for demonstrating quality management which provide minimum standards for quality and safety. The TGA will have the power to audit applications and to require a conformity assessment. These will improve the pre-market assessment for high risk devices. Much of the new scheme replicates the existing provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 but, as I said before, it has not kept pace with actually reflecting the risk and classifying the risk of medical devices.
One issue that has been raised is implant tracking. One of the problems with this is that implant tracking places requirements on manufacturers and sponsors to obtain information relating to individual patients. Sponsors and manufacturers do not have the power to access hospital and private patient health records, and many of these devices may sit on a hospital shelf for months before they are implanted into a patient. It would be very difficult for sponsors or manufacturers to obtain this information. Also, it is currently outside the scope of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 for the TGA to regulate medical practitioners.
It should be noted that the government already does undertake some implant tracking. The bill already includes some provision for the keeping of records by sponsors relating to the tracking and location of devices under section 41FO(2)(c). Conditions will be placed on the supply of devices by sponsors to ensure that they are involved as far as possible in the keeping of records to facilitate implant tracking. Under Australia's existing regulatory system for medical devices, there are no provisions in law for the establishment of device registries for implantable medical devices which record the recipients of the device and conduct long-term patient tracking.
However, currently there are some voluntary implant registries within Australia which are maintained by private or community financed organisations. Some link patients to specific models of devices; others merely record procedures. For example, the Australia and New Zealand heart valve registry seeks to identify and locate patients implanted with the Bjork-Shiley convexo/concave heart valve which I mentioned earlier. There is also the cardiac surgery register and the coronary angioplasty register, which are maintained by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. In my electorate of Boothby, the Australian corneal graft register is linked to Flinders University. There is also a national joint replacement registry which is maintained by the Australian Orthopaedic Association. Device specific registries are available for orthopaedic surgery. The Australia and New Zealand heart valve registry has retrospectively located 96 per cent of one particular valve, the Bjork-Shiley convexo/concave valve. 
Last year, the TGA was involved in a number of hazard alert recall actions involving cardiac pacemakers. In the two cases where it was considered necessary to trace patients with the affected pacemaker, 98 per cent of patients with one type of pacemaker were traced and 100 per cent of patients with another type of pacemaker were traced. No country in the world has established a successful implant tracking system that provides 100 per cent traceability of patients. In 2000 the government formed the Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care, which I think the member for Bruce mentioned in his speech and which is supported by state and federal health ministers, to provide national leadership to improve the safety and quality of care in hospitals and other health settings. One of the key priorities of the council is to examine a system to track implanted medical devices, and there has also been a suggestion for a nationally operated implant tracking system that would use the Health Insurance Commission database to link patients with their implanted medical devices. So, on the issue of implant tracking, there is already a lot going on in terms of community organisations and there is some scope, as I said, for using organisations like the HIC.
In relation to unintended consequences with the use of a device, the bill carries an improvement in the free market assessment of products through the introduction of a comprehensive, risk based classification system that will allow an appropriate level of regulation to be applied to each class of device, and that should improve the safety of medical devices that are approved for supply in Australia. Despite all the precautions that you can have at the free market stage, there is still the potential for problems to occur with medical devices; therefore, this bill provides, which was not previously there with the TGA, an emphasis on post-market monitoring of devices, vigilance with mandatory reporting requirements for adverse incidents and provisions for the tracking of high risk implantable devices. All this should improve medical device safety. Australia has in place a sophisticated post-market monitoring and recall system, which will be enhanced by the new arrangements in this bill.
The bill has been around for a long time. As I said before, it resulted from the mutual recognition agreement between Australia and the European Union. There has been extensive consultation with consumers and industry groups. Australia will be aligning with international best practice by adopting a global regulatory model for medical devices. This will ensure that consumers have timely access to new technologies, while both consumers and industry will benefit from avoiding unnecessary costs through the removal of regulatory duplication. Medical device safety will be improved by moving from the current prescriptive regulatory system that recognises only unique Australian standards to a comprehensive, risk based classification system that will allow the appropriate level of regulation to be applied to each class of device. An increased emphasis on post-market vigilance, with mandatory reporting requirements for adverse incidents, and provisions for tracking of high risk implantable devices will also improve medical device safety.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (MEDICAL DEVICES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001 will allow the introduction of an internationally harmonised approach to the regulation of medical devices in Australia. It follows recommen-dations made in the 1997 Industry Commis-sion report into the medical and scientific equipment industries. In this day and age medicine is a very complex science, and with that complex science comes the medical hardware that goes with it.
In my electorate of Groom we have seen some enormous advances in the sorts of treatment that people can receive, both in the private and in the public systems. Part of those treatments includes the fitting of these sorts of medical equipment. It is important to not only the constituents that I represent but constituents right around Australia that they can have confidence in these devices and that they can be sure that the practices and the devices used in Australia comply with high Australian standards and high international standards. The electorate of Groom has an economy that has prospered as a result of supplying an exceptionally high level of services not only to the people of the Darling Downs but also to people in western Queensland and northern New South Wales. In return for that prosperity the level of service, in turn, improves. 
I am certainly proud of the hospitals that I have in my electorate. We have seen them continue to invest in the very latest that medical science has to offer—the sorts of things that give opportunity and quality of life to those people who receive their treatment. Hospitals like St Vincent's, St Andrew's and the Toowoomba Base Hospital are certainly involved in the day-to-day improvement to not only people's quality of life but also the fitting of some of the devices that will be covered by this proposed legislation. As well as those hospitals, of course, we have smaller hospitals that service small communities around Toowoomba, and both Clifton and Pittsworth are blessed with small community hospitals. Just outside my electorate, in the electorate of Maranoa, we have a hospital in the township of Allara and, to the north in the electorate of Blair, we have a fine hospital in the town of Crows Nest.
As I say, medicine is a very important facet of people's lives these days and some of these devices have gone a long way to enhancing not only their longevity but also their ability to participate in the community, to remain active and to contribute to the community that is around them. The new regulatory system will lead to improved medical device safety through the maintenance of the highest standard of safety performance and quality and timely availability of medical devices marketed in Australia. The legislation requires all medical devices to meet substantive requirements for quality, safety and performance for the protection of patients and users. As I say, it is important that we are able to offer people the highest possible level of confidence while at the same time providing them with the highest possible quality equipment.
The classification of medical devices will change from a prescriptive system to a system where the level of regulation applied to each class of device will be proportional to the level of risk posed by its use based on the level of invasiveness, duration of use and contact with the central nervous system or the circulatory system. All manufacturers will be required to meet quality system standards. Under the current system, only 50 per cent of manufacturers are required to meet quality system standards. You can see from that simple example the extra guarantees that users and patients who take advantage of the devices included in this legislation will receive from that one basic change.
There will be an increased emphasis on post-market monitoring for safety, including the requirement that manufacturers and sponsors report adverse events involving their medical devices to the TGA within specified time frames. Again, it is almost an after-market service system that has been incorporated into this to ensure that, when these devices are fitted, they continue to be monitored in such a way that, if there are any sorts of issues, let alone problems, with these devices, they will be reported in such a way that the issue can be addressed.
There will be provision to facilitate the tracking of high risk implantable devices. The bill will ensure that Australia will harmonise with international best practice for medical device regulation. As someone who sees internationalism and globalisation as one of the challenges facing small business, there are advantages in making sure that the medical fraternity keeps in step with international standards and that undue duplication of process and red tape will be decreased.
Removal of red tape is something that I am sure those people on the other side of the chamber, as well as those on this side of the chamber, would support wholeheartedly. It remains a challenge for governments at all levels—local, state and national—to ensure that any opportunity to reduce red tape is taken full advantage of. Due to these changes, the amount of red tape will decrease as much of the regulation duplication under the current system will be removed.
Under the present system, medical devices imported from overseas have to meet unique Australian standards. The new regulatory system will harmonise Australia's regulatory requirements with overseas best practice, based on the recommendation of the Global Harmonisation Task Force. It is not as though we are in any way compromising standards; we are simply aiming to facilitate the benefits of mutual recognition agreements with European Union countries. 
The industry will benefit from the amendments for removal of the unique Australian regulatory requirements for medical devices. This will decrease regulatory duplication and will facilitate trade for Australian exporters and importers. As the Minister for Small Business, I travel around Australia and visit various electorates. I have been impressed on a number of occasions by industries based here in Australia. In fact, some of them in regional Australia are not only competing with imported medical equipment but going out into that global marketplace and competing with the international companies in markets all over the world. I admire that sort of innovation and initiative, which we see so often from small business. The quality that these companies produce is very much world standard.
This bill will also facilitate the operation of an Australian European Union mutual recognition agreement, known as an MRA, and will particularly benefit Australia's access to European markets. Access to markets in the international sense is something that we should strive for at every opportunity. Applications for entry of low to medium risk devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods will be streamlined using a new electronic lodgment process. Processing times will be reduced markedly from 28 days to virtual time if the pre-market certificates meet requirements. Twenty per cent of the applications will be audited prior to entry. Manufacturers will have greater flexibility and choice in the way they demonstrate that their products meet the substantive requirements for safety performance and quality through choice of different procedures such as type of testing or evaluation of technical dossiers by the regulator. All manufacturers will be required to have a quality management system.
Given the sensitivity of certain high risk devices, section 41EA of this new legislation provides for these devices to be fully assessed by the TGA before they are marketed in Australia. This would exclude such devices from the scope of any mutual recognition agreement Australia may have with other countries. The government considers this to be a particularly important provision given the risks associated with these particular devices—for example, the possibility of products that may contain such things as contaminated animal material, including bovine sourced material from BSE identified countries. Australia does indeed enjoy a unique place in the world not only in terms of medical isolation, which protects us from some of these animal based diseases, but also in terms of our livestock industry. As a primary producer almost by birth, I think Australia has much to do and must be ever vigilant in maintaining that unique and safe position not only for our inhabitants of the human kind but also for our inhabitants of the animal kind. 
The scope of low risk, non-powered and non-sterile medical devices included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods will also be increased, allowing for a more effective post-marketing monitoring system that will ensure consumers continue to be protected from unsafe products. There will be a small number of products currently regulated as devices that will not fall under the new framework. They will continue to be regulated by the TGA, using existing Australian standards. It is proposed to also include in-vitro diagnostic products under the new regulatory framework within the next couple of years. These devices include all pathology tests. The global model for these devices is under development and the TGA is consulting widely with stakeholders on this matter.
There will also be an increased emphasis on post-market activities, with the requirement for manufacturers and sponsors to report adverse events involving their medical devices to the TGA within specified time frames. Australia's involvement in an international post-market vigilance system should reduce the likelihood of repeated adverse events and influence the development of new medical devices. 
Australian consumers need and benefit from access to a wide range of medical devices, including new technologies. By dollar value, approximately 90 per cent of medical devices used by Australians are imported. The Australian medical devices market is approximately one per cent of the global market. It is therefore imperative that Australia has a regulatory system aligned with world's best practice that ensures a high degree of medical device safety, performance and quality and also allows timely access to new devices. This will ensure that we maintain maximum safety for the users of these devices while at the same time ensuring that, when these devices are of a standard in which we can have confidence, their introduction into the Australian medical system is not delayed or held up in any way.
The international model of regulation adopts the global model developed by the Global Harmonisation Task Force, comprising the regulators of Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia. The European system is the basis for the new global model. The new regulatory requirements will facilitate the operation of the Australian-European Union mutual recognition agreement, MRA, by avoiding unnecessary or unique regulations which make Australian access to international markets less competitive.
As is usually the case with changes, there will be some cost implications for industry, such as the cost of implementing quality assurance systems. But these costs should be more than offset by increased export opportunity under the new system and savings through the removal of regulatory duplication. In other words, it will be a more efficient system which will give industries that produce these goods here in Australia some added confidence to invest in the development and marketing of products. However, the impact on individual companies will depend on the commercial decisions they make and the market pressures. While there will be some increase in costs for those companies whose products are reclassified to a higher risk category and because of the need for all manufacturers to have a quality management system, overall there should be savings to the industry through the harmonisation of technical requirements and standards. 
Some areas of industry that market medical device products that are exempt from or excluded under the current arrangements have expressed concern about the move to regulate their products and the potential cost involved in implementing quality assurance programs. These changes are in line with international best practice to ensure high quality and safe medical devices. These increased costs could also be offset by potential gains through easier access to European markets for Australian manufacturers and entry into Australia for products imported from Europe. The TGA is looking at a number of measures, including the grouping of families of low to medium risk devices under one ARTG entry to ensure that there is not a significant increase in regulatory costs for suppliers of these devices. 
The vast majority of products that are currently regulated as therapeutic devices will be regulated as medical devices under the new system. A small number of products will not fall under the new framework, as they do not fit the international definition of a medical device. These include household, commercial and hospital grade disinfectants and menstrual tampons. These will continue to be regulated by the TGA using existing Australian standards. Devices incorporating human tissue will also not be included in the new framework. There is a general agreement internationally that human tissue should be considered as a separate category to medicines and medical devices for Australia to maintain its existing ones. The TGA is currently consulting on a regulatory framework for these products. In-vitro diagnostic products will also be regulated under the existing system initially. However, it is proposed to include in-vitro diagnostic products under a new regulatory framework within the next couple of years. These devices include pathology tests. The global model for these devices is under development and the TGA is currently consulting widely with stake-holders on this matter.
The new system includes the power for the TGA to suspend a medical device from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods when appropriate, rather than cancelling the device from the register. This measure will allow manufacturers and sponsors to investigate and resolve potentially serious medical device problems without requiring the sponsor to reapply to the TGA, with the associated costs of application and re-evaluation. 
The changes facilitate Australia's participation in the international exchange of vigilance reports and the TGA's acceptance of a single internationally agreed dossier for marketing approval. The current system was at the cutting edge of international regulatory practice for medical devices when it was first introduced in 1991 and has served the Australian community well. However, the range of sophisticated medical devices is developing quickly. This growth is matched by consumer expectations for safe and timely access to new technology. Australia must update its regulatory system and harmonise with international best practice or be left behind the rest of the world.
To sum up, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2001 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2001 seek to allow the introduction of an internationally harmonised framework for the regulation of medical devices in Australia. This will allow better protection of public health while facilitating availability of medical technologies consistent with state-of-the-art and current knowledge. Australia will be aligning with international best practice by adopting a global regulatory model for medical devices. This will ensure consumers have timely access to new technologies while consumers and the industry will benefit from avoiding unnecessary costs for the removal of regulatory duplication. 
Medical device safety will be improved by moving from the current prescriptive regulatory system that recognises only unique Australian standards to a comprehensive, risk based classification system that will allow the appropriate level of regulation to be applied in each class of device. An increased emphasis on post-market vigilance with mandatory reporting requirements for adverse incidents and the provision of tracking of high risk implantable devices will also improve medical device safety. I commend the legislation to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The opposition supports the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001, which seeks to amend the Space Activities Act 1998, which the House adopted only some three years ago when we were at the threshold of a new phase of the space industry in Australia, and which provides for the making of regulations that will give effect to certain aspects of the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Russian Federation which relate to cooperation in the field of exploration and the use of outer space for peaceful purposes. This agreement was signed in Canberra only recently—in fact, on 23 May 2001—and I was able to be present after the signing at the embassy, where a number of the visiting delegates from the Russian Federation presented their credentials in this area and discussed with those who were able to be present at that time the mechanisms by which they proposed to implement this treaty. The degree of enthusiasm they had for working with Australia in this area was very encouraging indeed.
It is proposed that the bill will authorise the making of the regulations which in fact then proceed to implement in detail the treaty which we have signed with the Russian Federation. That is essential in order to protect a number of aspects of the arrangement which is proposed. They include the protection of not only the intellectual property and some of the physical property which is involved in the space industry and in particular with the Russian launch facilities but also the nature of the dual use technology which is involved in space activities. Obviously some of the rocket engines and constructions could have dual use facilities in a military context, as could many of the control technologies associated with this. Substantial protection is required for that.
There are also issues with duty and import costs, both into Australia and into Russia, which need to be eliminated if we are to have a cost-effective industry. Indeed, the Russian government requires that as a precondition to ensure that their goods that relate to the space industry are given appropriate treatment on entry into Australia. The space industry itself represents the ultimate in export industries. I suppose it would have been exempt under the GST provisions anyway, even though some of the material occasionally may return—all of it we hope in a controlled fashion, but of course there is always a possibility of an adverse and uncontrollable return. We would certainly require that the appropriate safety mechanisms be in place, which is what the principal act seeks to do.
This is the first time the Russian Federation have signed an agreement of this nature with another country. It is to Australia's credit that we have established the appropriate physical credentials in relation to the space industry, because obviously Australia has those in abundance in terms of the appropriate remote locations—whether that is Christmas Island or Woomera—and the appropriate areas where, if there is an adverse event associated with this, public safety is not put at risk. Also, we have a significant history in relation to the space industry, particularly Woomera in my own state of South Australia where a great deal of work has been done on this.
Indeed, some opportunities were lost when the combined Australian, British and European space initiatives of the sixties were eventually abandoned, when Britain pulled out of the Blue Streak activity and the other European rocket launches here. Subsequently we have seen this technology adopted, with the Ariane space industry out of French Guyana in Africa, with a very substantial launch facility there and significant investment going into that. But our concern is with Australia, and particularly in this case the two areas where the Russian technology is involved: Christmas Island—my colleague Warren Snowdon will address those issues shortly in some detail—and Woomera in South Australia.
The global space industry is a very significant industry. It employs something like one million people around the world these days and is probably worth in the order of $US100 billion. That is a very substantial investment in anyone's terms. Quite clearly, Australia needs to be part of this industry, not only because of the economic benefits that can arise from being part of the launch industry itself, which is what we are particularly discussing here, but also because that has numerous spin-off benefits in other technologies. That is probably the area where the government needs to pay the closest attention to ensure that our industry is able to benefit from the diverse opportunities which will arise from having a key component of the space industry here. 
We need to develop skills in that highly sensitive manufacturing area which is associated with space launches. Obviously, space technology is worked to very high tolerances and very exact manufacturing work, with very high quality control standards. That has very good spin-offs in other areas of manufacturing, because the skills you develop there can be broadened and applied across a wider variety of activities. Obviously, it flows on to communications equipment, communications expertise, telemetry and all of the associated data processing which goes with that. Other industries also flow from that, because space is very much a platform these days for the telecommunications and phone industries, for the Internet and data transfer industries, and for global positioning systems. The Europeans have launched their Galileo system, which goes with the Russian glasnost and the American GPS systems. All of those geographical determining electronic systems allow people to pinpoint their location in space and also in time, which is very accurate, I might say. That positioning system technology will be useful in many ways, including tracking aircraft, motor vehicles and trucks. It will be used in a wide variety of applications which we can also expect to be part of if we are participants in the space industry itself.
Those spin-offs are also used in the telecommunications industry and the satellite television industry, whether that is direct to home satellite technology or mobile phone type technology. We have recently seen some economic catastrophes in mobile phone technology in relation to the iridium system, with multibillion dollar investments no longer being all that active. But a new use has been found for the system, albeit at a somewhat lower price, and many other systems are now competing to cater for that area, with new technology arriving all the time. Remote sensing activities are also something which Australia needs to become much more expert in deploying for our agricultural and mining industries. A wide variety of applications from remote sensing will ensure that we are able to capitalise on the flow through benefits of the space industry itself.
So a wide variety of applications flow from the space industry, and the government has an important role in ensuring that our industrial sector can capture some of those benefits. To do that, an investment in research and development is required, something that this government has not excelled at in recent years, and there is a significant need for Australian industry to be alert to the opportunities. Those opportunities will only come once, and once they pass us by, as we have discovered in other industries, it will be very difficult to recover them.
Australia does have its own involvement in the space industry with the FedSat program. FedSat is due to be launched from Japan, as it happens, in early 2002. It is a 58-centimetre cube weighing approximately 50 kilograms. This is one of the new breed of microsatellites and will be an increasingly important part of our technological capacity in the future. It can play a very important role in delivering benefits from the satellite technology, but at a lower cost and with lower risk. The problem with the very large, very expensive satellites is if they fail in some way. Obviously, the investment is massive, the cost implications are enormous and the development time is very long. NASA, the American space agency, has announced the trend of faster, cheaper and better satellite technology, which is relevant to the whole space industry but particularly NASA. It appropriately applies to the satellite technology as well to ensure that we are able to put a number of important platforms into space but on a reasonably cheap and effective basis. 
For example, the FedSat satellite will include GPS technology—which will allow a number of important experiments to be undertaken and resolved in relation to the accuracy of GPS—a magnetometer, high performance computing, Ka-band transponders, a base band processor, UHF communications payload and a historic CD-ROM, including some important Australian music and Australian records to serve as a time capsule over the next hundred years or so.
The individual experiments by themselves are very important to those who are affiliated with them, although they are not as important from the parliament's point of view. The parliament is more interested in the fact that the platform is there to put them into space and the fact that Australians are working very actively in the Cooperative Research Centre for Satellite Systems. A number of young and enthusiastic engineers, scientists and technical people are involved who do great credit to themselves and to the Australian capacity in this area.
The parliament will certainly share in the joy next year when this satellite is effectively launched into orbit and the first signals come back and we are able to demonstrate our capability in this area. I also hope that we will be able to demonstrate our capability in the launch area as a result of the technology which this legislation allows us to capture for Australia and the cooperation which it envisages with the Russian federation. Our industry should benefit from the subsequent spin-off technologies, which are very diverse and broad. This generation of young engineers and scientists should benefit from an Australian space industry, just as a previous generation did. They will ensure that in the future we have the experience, enthusiasm and capability to develop those very valuable spin-off industries around the launch industry itself. So the opposition supports the legislation, commends the bill to the House and looks forward to the future development of our Australian space industry.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak on the government's Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001. Introducing the bill for its second reading in the House, my colleague the Minister for Community Services, Larry Anthony, outlined its details. This amendment bill is necessary to accommodate a very significant recent event in Australia's efforts to reinstate itself as a player in the global space industry. That event was the signing of the `Agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in the field of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes'. Members may not be aware that there are four companies looking at Australia as a base for commercial space launch facilities; two of those companies are planning to use Russian technology. The signing of the agreement in May this year by our own highly productive and dedicated Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, the Hon. Nick Minchin, and Mr Yuri Koptev, Director-General of the Russian Aviation and Space Agency, is the green light for our space industry to develop as a global player.
The agreement between Australia and Russia covers matters such as establishing a legal and organisational framework for the transfer of space technology, expertise and equipment; protection of intellectual and physical property; waiving of import duties for equipment into both countries; and allowing other parties access to these agreements. The agreement between Australia and the Russian Federation and this bill will facilitate progress by companies working with the Russian space agency. The most advanced proposal involves the Asia Pacific Space Centre plan, which will use Christmas Island as a space launch facility and utilise Russian technology.
The government's support for the development of Australia's space industry is unambiguous. In that regard, I was delighted by Minister Minchin's announcement that the government is willing to spend up to $100 million on Christmas Island to support the project. This incentive was provided to counter the financial advantages offered by existing infrastructure at a competing space launch facility in Alcantara, Brazil. This money will be invested in infrastructure on Christmas Island, such as airport upgrade and new port and road investment, as well as providing assistance with ground station facilities. It is part of a total $800 million investment planned by the Asia Pacific Space Centre that will see Australia re-enter and be a player in the space industry in a way that we have not been since the 1950s. 
Being from Western Australia, I also welcome the investment as an economic boost for the Christmas Island community. It is expected to generate up to 400 jobs during construction and up to 550 jobs once it is operational. This investment and the work done by the government, especially Minister Minchin, have been vital in attracting interest to Australia and demonstrating our commitment to seeing a space industry and satellite launch facilities established in Australia.
The APSC project will also open opportunities for the broader Australian space sector, especially in the design, manufacture, testing and flight preparation of satellites and in launch related technologies, such as space communications. Again, Western Australia is well placed in relation to this major project to benefit from these new opportunities. Examples of high-tech potential include the future development of new jobs in Australia for electrical and mechanical engineers, aerospace engineers, physicists and statistical specialists, working in such areas as payload integration, launch vehicle preparation and testing, and telemetry tracking. APSC also proposes to establish a space research centre, which will offer postgraduate teaching and research in collaboration with other Australian and international research institutions.
Construction work on the spaceport and supporting infrastructure is scheduled to begin later this year, and APSC intends to conduct two test launches in 2003. APSC is the only project targeting geostationary orbits. Geostationary satellites are approximately 23,000 miles above the earth's surface and they remain above a fixed point on the equator. Satellites in geostationary orbit are usually large, with a long operational life, such as communications satellites. Christmas Island is located relatively close to the equator, enabling launch vehicles to carry heavier payloads. The main proposed flight path for rockets launched from Christmas Island will be to the east—in keeping with geostationary payloads—out over the Timor Sea and travelling between Australia and Papua New Guinea. 
All launches will be subject to stringent safeguards, with no member of the public to be exposed to a risk exceeding one chance of casualty in 10 million launches. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, has expressed concerns with respect to the safety of their workers and facilities. But I also know that Warren Entsch, in association with the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, has been working very closely for many months with APPEA to ensure that our petroleum and gas assets are protected.
Labor's reaction to the coalition's commitment of $100 million to Christmas Island and APSC has been very strange. With Labor's talk about a Knowledge Nation, you would think the party would have been the first to congratulate the government for making such a substantial investment in this exciting high-technology industry—acknowledged earlier by the shadow minister. Instead, Labor came out the day after the government's announcement and started attacking the commitment as being economically irresponsible; the opposition finance spokesperson even referred to it as a `vote buying exercise'. This shows the hypocrisy of the ALP in relation to science and innovation: they are big on rhetoric but fail to deliver when it comes to the crunch.
The coalition has shown that it is prepared to put its money on the table with a fully costed and planned science and innovation program. The Prime Minister's innovation statement, Backing Australia's Ability, will provide $2.9 billion of additional funding over five years for science and innovation. This is the largest commitment ever made by an Australian government. On the other hand, you have Labor's Knowledge Nation, which is simply an uncosted and confused series of motherhood statements.
The APSC project is a very important step in terms of Australia's engaging in the high-technology commercial space industry. It will be good for Christmas Island, and it will be good for Western Australia. If Labor are serious about seeing Western Australia grow and develop in new and innovative ways, they should come out and state clearly that they support APSC and the Christmas Island project—and it appears that they will be doing so, and I congratulate them for that. I also congratulate the minister on his efforts thus far, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I am pleased to be able to speak on the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 this evening. I note in passing that I spoke on similar legislation in December 1998, on the then Space Activities Bill 1998, and I recall the euphoria at that time that was around this place and, indeed, in the public domain about the importance of the agreement which preceded that piece of legislation and in fact was the cause of it. That was as a result of arrangements between Kistler Aerospace and the Commonwealth government. Despite the public statements at the time, we have yet to see any space activity get off the ground—if I can use that term—in the sense of having any of the bases commence or of having any of the bases that were proposed then, and are currently being proposed, launch any rockets. I will come back to that, but I first want to refer to the nature of the legislation this evening.
The Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 is important because of what it will do. I will refer to the Bills Digest from the Library for the source of this first part of my contribution. It says the bill's purpose is:
To permit the operation of an inter-governmental agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth that would facilitate the import of Russian space technologies for possible launch from Australia.
In its background notes the Bills Digest points out that on 23 May 2001:
... representatives of the Commonwealth and the Russian State signed the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Field of the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes. The signing followed a saga of various proposals for the launch of foreign space rockets with satellite payloads from a number of proposed local facilities.
I will refer to those in some more detail later. The Bills Digest says that the agreement provides for the exemption of imported specialised space-related goods and equipment from an Australian duty of up to five per cent. It says that we should note that the Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 passed through parliament in early 1999 and that this involved an exemption for space objects such as satellites launched from Australia. Again, this was the result of the negotiations which took place primarily between Kistler Aerospace and the Commonwealth government. It goes on to say:
Australia had already maintained a space agreement with the former Soviet Union. That Agreement between the Government of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and the Government of Australia on Cooperation in the Field of Exploration and the Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes of 1 December 1987 is replaced by a new Agreement. It is not clear whether any significant programs emerged or succeeded under the previous agreement.
The Bills Digest says the effect of this legislation will involve an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, with the minister to authorise project concessions under guidelines to be developed. This would occur through the Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 (2001) during winter 2001.
The provisions of the bill amend the Space Activities Act 1998 to provide for new regulations to give effect to the provisions of the agreement. Regulations made under section 79A should enable the minister to nominate organisations to carry out specialised activities. Item 4 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new part 5A in the Space Activities Act 1998, the principal effect of which is to allow the making of regulations to give effect to the provisions of specified space cooperation agreements, in this case the new agreement. Item 6 of schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new schedule 6 in the Space Activities Act 1998 that contains an English text version of the inter-governmental agreement with Russia. An interesting feature in this Bills Digest, and something which I note is referred to in the informed or specialist media, is the nature of the current launch market. The Bills Digest says: 
A recent Euroconsult 2000 report estimates that the US$34.6 billion launch market for 657 satellites, over this decade, includes a 61 per cent allocation to commercial operators with 42 per cent open to tender.
It goes on to say:
However, according to a Canberra-based analyst, the projected supply of commercial space launches far exceeds estimates of demand over the decade. Asia-Pacific Aerospace Consultants believes that the oversupply approaches 200 per cent. As well, two major launch vehicle operators have made large bulk purchases of their own vehicles to lower costs.
So it raises a question about the new launch opportunities that will be exploited by this site on Christmas Island and the two proposals for Woomera, which I will refer to now. The first is that of Kistler, which aims to use reusable rockets from Woomera in South Australia, and Spacelift Australia, which plans to use SS25 Russian ballistic missiles rockets, also from Woomera. What we need to be wary of here are the conditions under which these companies are coming to Australia. The Asia Pacific Space Centre proposes to launch Russian vehicles from Christmas Island and plans to commence construction of the space centre in September 2001. I will refer to that in more detail shortly, but I want to go back for a moment to refer to an article in Aviation Week & Space Technology on 28 May 2001 which is headed `Rocket shakeout looms as overcapacity grows'. The reason I want to say this is because I am a little worried that the conditions being placed upon this new industry for Australia may be a little too onerous and that in fact, in a very tight market, the possible effect might be that these launch facilities may not happen.
I am not arguing that we should not be providing appropriate regulation, but we need to be very careful that we do not overregulate and that we strike an appropriate balance. We must understand that these companies are looking with interest at and have invested tens of millions of dollars in developing their proposals in terms of engineering, general planning and the consultation that takes place with these enterprises, and that we need to be very wary that we do not impose such regulations that will cause those companies not to be here.
An issue that has been of some concern is hazard analysis. A view has been expressed by some that, because of the nature of the United States experience in this industry, Australian regulations should replicate those that exist in the United States. I have a different view. I expect that we have regulations that are appropriate, fair and reasonable, and that we protect as far as we possibly can Australian citizens against any contingency that might arise as a result of a malfunction coming from one of those launches. But it is also true to say that we are an attractive destination as a host for these launch facilities because of the relative isolation of Australia and because we can get paths for the trajectory of rockets that are launched from Christmas Island or Woomera that go over areas where, in normal circumstances, there is very low risk of impacting upon any population or population centre. That is not the case in the United States. It is therefore fair to presume, I would have thought, that when we are drafting regulations and determining, on the basis of hazard analysis, what these regulations should require, we pay appropriate attention and due regard to the nature of the Australian geography and to our relative isolation and seek to maximise the benefit all round to the Australian community.
As I have said, I am not opposed to regulation. Indeed, I understand how important regulation is in what for us is a neophyte industry, but at the same time we want to be very concerned. If we combine the total investment that is proposed for launch sites on Christmas Island and at Woomera, we are looking at a sum approaching $2 billion or more. That is a significant investment. We need to be cognisant, as I have said, of the state of the market. It will not take too much, with the market as it has been described, for people to be turned off the possibilities here in Australia. We have heard already how the government came up with a package of $100 million for the Asia Pacific Space Centre because of the possibility that they might go to another country. That raises significant issues, quite frankly, and I will come to them in a moment, but the article from Aviation Week & Space Technology of 28 May in part states: 
Projections show a sustained market for the launch of at least 30 commercial geosynchronous satellite missions per year. But it also shows little growth to support multiplying launcher developments and dwindling insurance reserves.
Further on it says:
The projected commercial market can not sustain all of the launch systems that are here today, let alone all of the launch systems that are going to be in place by the end of the year ...
That is what Wilbur Trafton, President of Sea Launch, told executives at a forum. That raises significant questions for us as a host to these launch facilities. At the end of the day, commercial decisions will be made and the proponents of the space launch facility on Christmas Island, the Asia Pacific Space Centre, and those for Woomera, Kistler and Spacelift Australia, will make their commercial decision. But we want to be careful that they do not make a commercial decision that is affected by costs that need not be imposed as a result of regulatory requirements that are too onerous. I make the plea to the government that they should expedite the negotiations in such a way that, whilst the regulatory requirements are appropriate, they are not too onerous.
We have seen a lot of media reports over recent days about the launch facility on Christmas Island, in particular the undertaking by the federal government to make $100 million available for that proposal. The $100 million, I am advised, will pay for the upgrade of the island's runway, new port facilities and construction of the spaceport's mission control. I just pose the question to the government, and perhaps I will get a response, as to whether Spacelift Australia or Kistler will be afforded the same access to taxpayers' funds. Is there now a new proposal for industry development in terms of the aerospace industry that the government undertakes to support new developments such as those proposed for Woomera and for which moneys have already been invested? Does the government intend to approach the proponents of those facilities with an offer to assist in the way it is assisting the proponents for the base on Christmas Island? Will the government offer to pay for the construction costs of their mission control?
You will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am the member for the Northern Territory. Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands are part of my electorate. I am fully conversant with the conditions on Christmas Island and with the fact that infrastructure is extremely poor. I strongly welcome the $100 million in terms of the impact it will make on public infrastructure, infrastructure available for public purposes, that will be accessible to the community of Christmas Island on Christmas Island. There is no question about that. However, it is very important that the community is satisfied about the way in which these matters have been developed and about the desirability of having the Asia Pacific Space Centre project in the community. I say that because I was very surprised to learn recently that the announcement made by Senators Minchin and Macdonald on Christmas Island was not advised to the community. In fact, the Shire President, Andrew Smolders, who I spoke to earlier this evening told me that he was advised about the announcement by telephone after the ministerial party had arrived on Christmas Island.
The issue here is one which dogs this government. In relation to Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands—but particularly in relation to Christmas Island—the minister responsible, Minister Macdonald, has shown a great reluctance to consult, communicate or negotiate appropriately with the community of Christmas Island. He has effectively refused to acknowledge the importance of the shire council as a democratic forum which represents the interests of the community of Christmas Island. When questions have been raised by the community of Christmas Island about the Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal, they have been frustrated by the lack of response they have received from the Commonwealth.
There are mixed views on Christmas Island about the proposal from the Asia Pacific Space Centre project. Those views are mixed because people are concerned primarily because they have not been provided with appropriate information by the company or by the government. I find this very galling because, on the face of it at least, there are substantial benefits to be gained for the community of Christmas Island by the development of this facility. Indeed, it has been estimated that there will be 400-odd jobs, or thereabouts, during the construction phase, and in excess of 500 jobs when the launch facility is operating. That is not small beer, particularly when the largest employer on the island, Phosphate Resources Ltd, is currently employing around 180 people.  
A reasonable person should have a reasonable expectation that, in a remote community like Christmas Island, the government would go out of its way, because it is a small community which has been affected by the closure of a resort facility which, by the way, is owned by a sister company of the Asia Pacific Space Centre. Promises were made when Soft Star became the owner of the resort that they would have the resort up and running as a resort and a casino within 12 months. That has not happened and the community of Christmas Island is frustrated by that. When the resort was opened, it employed around 300 people. The community's expectations in relation to that issue were raised and they have not been met. Yet there has been no open, fair and reasonable communication, and no real attempt by the government to keep the community informed about the Asia Pacific Space Centre proposal, or to take them into their confidence about the negotiations with the Asia Pacific Space Centre people about what is proposed for their island community. 
It is no wonder that when I spoke to Andrew Smolders this evening he was meeting with his fellow shire councillors. They have expressed a very strong view about the failure of this government— particularly of Senator Macdonald—to inform and involve the community. As I say, this proposal for the launch facility on Christmas Island should bring undoubted benefits. But, if public confidence in the proposal has been undermined by a reluctance of the government to inform and involve the community, it is little wonder that the community is continually raising questions about the efficacy of the proposal, environmental issues, and other matters which arise.
We should understand that this means a great deal to the community. Only recently the community were advised that CGU, the insurer that has been operating in the community, would no longer accept policies for general insurance. That is an issue for a small and remote community in the Indian Ocean. They are not being well served by some people in the business sector and it is a cause of some frustration as a result.
While the government trumpets its role in these matters and offers $100 million out of a contingency fund—not through the budget, I might say—let me be very clear that the road infrastructure requirements and the need for an appropriate wharf facility to handle heavy cargo on Christmas Island have been matters the government has been aware of for some time—well before the budget was framed. There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for this $100 million not to appear in the budget papers. Presumably the negotiations with the Asia Pacific Space Centre had been going on for some time, yet we are led to believe that some extraordinary event has led to this money being provided off-budget. What extraordinary event was there?
Serious concerns have been raised about environmental matters relating to this proposal, and that is an issue that should be of concern to us. It is an issue of concern to the community on Christmas Island. Despite the obvious commercial benefits that would accrue to the community as a result of the development of this facility, there are significant questions yet unanswered by the government in relation to the environmental issues concerned with this proposal. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 June this year titled `Manna from the heavens as we join space race' refers to Mr Warren Nicholls, a freelance consultant used by the Asia Pacific Space Centre. He said that the environmental impact statement for the launch centre was `shoddy'. He is quoted as saying: 
The water supply on the island is a critical issue and if there was any spill either while transporting stuff there or during the launch it could go straight into the water supply—in which case the island's finished.
The article continues:
Noise from rocket launches was the main threat to fragile species and a noise demonstration by APSC was “hopeless ... just a joke”. “Where you have so many species that are endemic to the island, you have to be extra careful.”
I note on a matter of the environment that recommendations from the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in accordance with section 931 of the administrative procedures of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, state that there are 65 conditions attached to this proposal.
Another matter that I want to refer to just briefly is the role that has been played by the phosphate mining company. We need to comprehend here that this launch facility is to be built at South Point on Christmas Island. This is all under mining lease. The fact that the site has been established by the proponents has meant that the mining company has had to make arrangements with the Commonwealth over this land and has had to reschedule its mining operations so that it could mine out the areas to ensure that they were available to the space company. It should be applauded for this. As I say, it is currently the largest employer on Christmas Island, employing 180 people. It has a long history. it is a community based organisation. Those of you who have been in the parliament for any length of time will know that this company was built from, and by, the community after the mine was closed by a previous government and it has been acting very responsibly in the way in which it has dealt with this proposal, and it is to be applauded for it
We are supporting this legislation because it provides us with an opportunity. But it is very important that we do not blow this opportunity. We need to have proper regard to the regulatory framework which we are imposing. We need to ensure that there is a level playing field for all the proponents involved in this industry and we need to ensure that this government and the company involved come to their senses and ensure that the community of Christmas Island are properly informed about what is happening in relation to this space proposal, that their reasonable questions and concerns are properly answered and that the minister at least finally acknowledges that he has done nothing but treat with contempt the shire of the community of Christmas Island. He should offer to go over and take people through the issues and respond publicly to their concerns. And the space consortia people should have a public forum so that the people of Christmas Island can have their questions to the company and the government properly responded to.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—We in the opposition support the Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 because of the opportunities it provides for Australia. The bill authorises the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in the field of exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, which was signed on 23 May this year. While the key provisions of the agreement include the protection of intellectual property and information, it also provides a legal and organisational framework for the transfer of space technologies, equipment and expertise to the Australian commercial space launch industry.
The agreement also allows duty-free transport of space related goods and equipment which will be used in projects undertaken in either Australia or Russia. Launch vehicles, satellites, scientific equipment and telemetry and guidance equipment can currently enter Australia duty free, although some specialised equipment attracts an Australian duty of up to five per cent. This bill provides for the exemption of that duty. The implementation of duty exemption will be made through Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 of 2001, which will be introduced during these winter sittings.
There are at least four companies proposing to establish commercial space launch facilities in Australia. They are the Asia Pacific Space Station on Christmas Island, Kistler Aerospace Corporation at Woomera, Spacelift Australia at Woomera and the Falcon project at Woomera. Two of these would most likely be using Russian launch technology. The agreement between our two governments facilitates the release and ensures control of access of the sensitive and dual use nature of the technology involved. The most advanced project, as we have heard, seems to be the $800 million Asia Pacific Space Centre on Christmas Island. The Australian government has said that it would provide $100 million to help develop the centre. 
While this is a welcome commitment to the Australian space industry, there have been concerns raised in a couple of areas. I will reiterate some of those concerns. It has been claimed by the environmental consultant Warren Nicholls that the environmental impact statement for the planned satellite launch centre was shoddy. Warren Nicholls was invited by the Asia Pacific Space Centre last year to test the environmental credentials of the proposal. He said that the EIS needed to be redone and that it was the worst that you would ever come across. The main concerns that Mr Nicholls raised were noise and water issues, which could prove to be problems for the Christmas Islanders. He emphasised that the water supply on the island is a critical issue and described the decimation of the island that would occur if there were any spills, which would go straight into the water supply, either while transporting the equipment there or during the launch. On the issue of noise, he said that many species were endemic to the island and formed such a fragile community that a rocket launch within that community could be damaging to those populations. So it is clear that further environmental studies would need to be undertaken before this project went ahead.
There have also been suggestions that there is on oversupply in the satellite launch market. It has been claimed that, once fully developed, the launch centre on Christmas Island would conduct 11 launches per year, generating significant economic benefits, regional development, new research activity and employment. The industry, if it achieves in gaining 20 per cent of the international launch market, is expected to contribute $2½ billion to the balance of payments until 2010 and to generate several thousand new jobs over that same period.
However, an expert has said that the four space launch proposals will actually have a tough time making a profit. Mr Bruce Middleton, the Managing Director of Asia Pacific Aerospace Consultants, told the ninth Australian International Aerospace Congress that the projected supply of commercial space launches far exceeded estimates of demand over the coming decade. He said that the world's seven existing commercial launch providers would be able to provide a total of 685 launches into high geostationary orbits over the decade to 2012. Although figures support the supposition that economic benefits are going to be generated by the establishment of these four projects in Australia, experts say that it is going to be difficult for those economic benefits to be large and to be sustained.
The discussion in the parliament and more widely in our communities on these initiatives has focused on Australia's opportunities to enter an expanding high technology and high value industry. In seeking to further develop the space industry, Australia should also be looking at contributing to and participating in other international activities. I specifically refer to the construction of the international space station by NASA. The construction of the international space station is a step towards the science fiction dream of colonising space. The first project of course was the Mir space station. When it was launched in 1986 it was a technological revolution. It was the first modern space station and the predecessor of the current NASA-led international space station. The reason for Australia's involvement is to ensure that it becomes a truly international space station and not just an American space station. The global power of the American space industry and its pursuit of a NASA developed space industry contributed to the demise of Mir. This theory was published in a recent media article in the Sydney Morning Herald's Good Weekend magazine of 10 February this year. The article said: 
Mir, a decidedly Communist creation, was on the verge of a second lease of life as a capitalist enterprise, thus threatening NASA's ambitions for an orbital monopoly with its own space station. For Mir had a second career in the offing. It involved colossally wealthy tourists, Hollywood entertainment contracts, and even a foot in the world of Internet startups. Dennis Tito, a former NASA engineer turned financier, had signed up to become MirCorp's first tourist—at a round-trip cost of $US20 million. There was a $40 million deal to produce a micro-gravity version of the “reality-based” American TV show Survivor. And there was another high-profile, mega-rich tourist in the offing: James Cameron, the director of Titanic. The old Communist rattletrap was getting a serious capitalist makeover.
...				...				...
There is a strong resemblance between Mir and the ISS ... But it was Mir that became the world's first international space station, hosting visitors from more than 16 nations. Among them was South Australian Andy Thomas, who spent 141 days aboard the station 1998.
He said that he felt `a lot of fondness for Mir'. He said that it was his home, that he got to know it very well and that he got to feel very comfortable on board it. He said:
I am very lucky that I'm one of only seven NASA astronauts to have had that opportunity.
If Australia contributed to, and participated in, the development of wider space activities, we would benefit greatly. We would not be losing our knowledge and we would not have a brain drain; we would keep people like Andy Thomas in Australia and we would be able to use Australian technology to contribute to international space activities. I come from a region close to the city of Newcastle, and we have a very innovative, very smart and very high technological industry base in Newcastle. Newcastle would be one of the regions that would benefit in both an economic sense and an employment sense if we were to be more involved in some of these space exploration activities. The Good Weekend article continued:
... the ISS will be the most expensive government housing facility ever built; its cost to full operation is now set at a whopping $60 billion, more than seven times the budget specified when Reagan first announced the project in 1984.
An article in the Sun-Herald of 5 November 2000 stated:
By the time it is fully assembled the International Space Station will be as big as a football field and from Earth it will be as bright as the planet Venus. It will orbit the Earth every hour and a half and take 10 minutes to cross the sky.
It is the greatest international scientific endeavour in history, bringing together people who were once Cold War enemies and 16 other nations to work towards future manned voyages to Mars and beyond.
I am sure you would agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this prospect is very exciting and that Australia should be grasping the opportunity to become involved and be an active participant. But Australia already does play a critical role in space exploration. The article from the Sun-Herald also stated:
Scientists at Tidbinbilla, the deep space tracking station near Canberra, are a critical link in communicating with 15 unmanned outer space missions to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and the sun itself.
	...	...	...
NASA's representative in Australia, Dr Miriam Baltuck, said without Australia's dish scientists there would be no missions to outer space.
...				...				...
Australia's geographic position enables mission control in the US to keep 24-hour contact with its spacecraft as the world rotates. There are two other dishes, one in California and another in Spain.
While we are discussing these issues in the parliament, discussions are also happening widely in our communities. The member for the Northern Territory, who represents Christmas Island, where one of the proposed rocket launchers is being developed, talked about the discussions taking place in his community. Space exploration, space development and the possibility of space travel are capturing the imagination of all Australians. I for one believe that Australia has the capacity, the technology and the knowledge to contribute effectively and that we must be able to benefit, both in employment and economically, from these exciting developments, which will develop even further in the very near future. 
While the opposition supports this bill and the government's claims about the removal of impediments to the space launch industry by the particular agreement covered in this bill and that the creation of a competitive environment should generate significant benefits, regional development, new research activity and employment, I think we should all be aware of and continue to monitor some of those concerns and problems that may occur, such as environmental impacts and community and societal impacts, through the development of these rocket launchers. So we are ever-mindful of those and continue to keep a watchful regulatory eye on the projects, and we support the bill.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT (BILATERAL AGREEMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-08-06,"—I thank all the members who have participated in the debate tonight. Firstly, I would like to welcome the opposition's support for the Space Activities Bill 1998. I agree with the comments from the member for Bonython about the interest, support and general enthusiasm shown by our Russian counterparts for Australia as a potential space launch provider when they were here to sign the intergovernmental agreement in May this year. I too had the honour of being at the Russian embassy in May, with the member for Bonython, to help celebrate the signing of the IGA.
The signing of the agreement between the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Nick Minchin, and the Director-General, Mr Uri Koptev, here in Parliament House was the start of a very special relationship between our two countries, and I am sure that it is one that will continue to grow and develop. What is even more special about that relationship is the fact that Australia is the first country outside the Russian Federation to sign such an agreement, so it is quite significant.
As the member for Moore stated in his contribution to the debate tonight, the benefits of this agreement should not be underestimated. The Australian space industry will directly benefit from the transfer of technology. In the longer run, I believe we will see the growth and development of Australian expertise in many of the areas some of the speakers have mentioned—for example, space and aerospace engineering, software development, payload integration, launch vehicle preparation and testing and telemetry tracking. Western Australia, particularly communities like Perth, will indeed be very well placed to benefit in the long run as the Asia Pacific Space Centre grows and develops. In the short term, as the member for Northern Territory noted, places like Perth and Darwin will be very important centres of supply and support to Christmas Island as the APSC launch facilities are constructed and other public capital works infrastructure is developed.
However, there are a couple of issues that I would like to address in relation to comments made by the member for the Northern Territory. He referred to allegations by commentator Middleton with regard to market oversupply. The honourable member is correct in his comments that the market for low earth orbit launches is oversupplied, but the Christmas Island proposal—and I am surprised he was not aware of this—is for geostationary launches. This part of the market is quite stable. In any case, we should be taking a long-term view. Space projects take anything from five to 10 years to get into place. Even in the low earth orbital launches, the current slump in the market should not deter us from taking very much a long-term view.
Independent analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests Australia could aim to capture up to 20 per cent of the global launch market. That is not an insignificant value to the Australian economy. This share must be won through advantages offered in things such as price, market access and reliability of launch services. Quite frankly, I believe we will be able to deliver that through the Christmas Island site. The fact is that the APSC's Aurora rocket is one of the most proven in the market, with 100 per cent success rate on its commercial launches. Boeing, for example, is facing problems with its Delta workhorse at the moment. There are problems with Ariane-5, and Japan has yet to get its H II off the ground, so this arrangement with the Russian Federation to use their technology would certainly give us a competitive edge. That, together with the position of Christmas Island, puts us right at the forefront to grab that 20 per cent of the market share suggested by Pricewaterhouse. 
The other issue that was raised by the member for the Northern Territory related to issues with regard to the environment. The environmental impact assessment that has been carried out by APSC to date has cost some $2 million and has taken some three years to prepare. Everything has been considered, from rare and endangered fauna and flora through to the heritage sites through to some of the mining damage that has been done on Christmas Island. As the honourable member rightfully said, Senator Hill set some 65 conditions for APSC to meet with regard to environmental management, so I do not believe it is appropriate to suggest that this has in some way been overlooked. The phosphate mining company on South Point is having to expedite its process. One thing I think people can be assured of is that there is absolutely no chance—I repeat: no chance—that the development of the spaceport will in any way repeat the environmental devastation of phosphate mining. 
The member for the Northern Territory also quoted a Sydney Morning Herald article which referred to Warren Nicholls as a spokesman for APSC. That is incorrect. Warren Nicholls made some criticism of the environmental assessment with regard to ground water. That particular Warren Nicholls, I understand, is a former employee associated with the island. He was not associated with APSC. I think that needs to be clarified. 
In her contribution, the member for Charlton repeated the assertion that this Warren Nicholls was an employee of APSC. Again I say that this was not the case. Among other things, the member for Charlton made reference to Australia's most famous astronaut, Andy Thomas, and talked about brain drains— something the Labor Party has been raising in recent times. She may not be aware that Andy Thomas is in fact being taken on as an adviser to Paul Scully-Power, whom I recently appointed to head an advisory group to recommend strategies with regard to the space industry. So our two famous astronauts, Andy Thomas and Paul Scully-Power, have both come home to Australia and are very actively involved in and very supportive of the process that we are involved in with regard to getting a fledgling industry developed in this country—that is, our space industry.
The other comment I would like to make is with regard to the comments by the member for the Northern Territory, who suggested that there was no consultation with the Christmas Island community. I note that that comment was repeated recently by Senator Sue Mackay. I would suggest that Senator Ian Macdonald has consulted quite widely with the Christmas Island community. I have actually been over there meeting with council representatives and talking on a number of issues. We commissioned officers from the Department of Industry, Science and Resources to spend some days there last year in open public forums, discussing issues relating to the establishment of this particular industry. The APSC put out various information sheets for the community not only in English but also in Mandarin and Malay to ensure that there was not any misunderstanding. So I think it is a little unfair to suggest that there has been absolutely no consultation with the community. I would suggest quite the contrary. We have laid our cards on the table, and it is now up to the Australian Labor Party to make up their minds as to whether they are going to support the APSC project in Christmas Island. I will be very interested to see whether or not they are prepared to give that firm commitment. 
Of course, the APSC project is just as important for the Christmas Island community as it is in terms of seeing Australia as a nation enter the world stage as a provider of commercial satellite delivery systems. But there will be long-term benefits as well. At the moment, Christmas Island is wholly reliant on phosphate mining as the driver of its economy and employment. Phosphate mining has a limited lifespan, and whenever it does come to an end— whether it be in five years or 10 years time—if we do not have anything in place, Christmas Island, from an economic point of view, will effectively die. This is something that has weighed heavily on the government when looking at the APSC, and I know how hard people such as the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, have worked to ensure the long-term economic future of Christmas Island. 
The signing of the intergovernmental agreement will also be important for other commercial space launch proponents, such as Spacelift in Woomera, which other speakers here tonight have rightly referred to as well. I think that if Spacelift and Kistler succeed in getting their respective projects up and running, we will very quickly see the rebirth of Woomera as a major rocket launch facility. When I was last in Woomera and speaking to the range managers there, I was struck by how much intellectual talent Australia has lost in the field of space and aerospace since the heyday of Woomera. But there is a new generation of young people out there with an incredible desire to become engaged in a strong and vibrant home-grown space and aerospace industry. Young James Moody is one person who springs to mind. James Moody is heavily associated with the FedSat project and has an incredible amount of energy, enthusiasm and vision for the future of space and aerospace in Australia. It may take only one commercial launch proponent to get up and running for us to start to see new life breathed progressively back into interest in Australia in space and aerospace activities, and that can only be good for Australia.
The Space Activities Amendment (Bilateral Agreement) Bill 2001 gives effect to certain aspects of the agreement between the government of the Russian Federation and the government of Australia on cooperation in the field of exploration and the use of outer space for peaceful purposes. Passage of this bill is necessary before the agreement may enter into force. The bill amends the Space Activities Act 1998. The bill creates a new part, part 5A, to provide a framework for the implementation of specified space cooperation agreements and includes a part 5A power for the Governor-General to make regulations for the purpose of implementing certain aspects of the agreement.
The agreement was signed on Wednesday, 23 May 2001. The agreement provides a legal and organisational framework for the transfer to Australia of sophisticated launch vehicle technology, information and other space related technologies. It will also facilitate Australian access to Russian technical expertise and enhance collaboration between our countries in scientific research and technology development. This agreement, as I said earlier, is a milestone in Australian-Russian cooperation and is a symbol of Australia's increasing engagement in international space activities. The agreement is essential for those launch projects that will utilise Russian space technology, in particular the Asia Pacific Space Centre project proposed for Christmas Island and the Spacelift project proposed for Woomera.
Consistent with the government's policy of promoting the development of a commercial space industry in Australia, the agreement was framed with a view to encouraging Australian companies and other organisations to participate in the agreement and hence access its benefits. The new regulation-making power provides a mechanism to enable both private and public sector organisations to access its benefits. Participation by organisations will be on a completely voluntary basis. Where organisations choose to access its benefits, however, organisations must also accept certain responsibilities. 
In accordance with the regulations made under this new power, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources will be able to nominate organisations to participate in the agreement, subject to the agreement of the Russian government. This authorisation will be conditional on organisations satisfying certain conditions that will be set out in regulations made under this power. These conditions are necessary to ensure that authorised organisations act consistently with the obligations that the Commonwealth has undertaken. These conditions will include requiring suitable arrangements to be in place in respect of each project and may address such matters as intellectual property, protection of physical property, liability, transmission of scientific and technical data, and dispute settlement procedures. More detail is provided in the explanatory memorandum to this bill. 
In summary, passage of this bill will enable the Commonwealth to nominate private organisations to voluntarily access the benefits of the agreement, subject to certain preconditions being satisfied. Passage of this bill will also ensure that Australia fulfils its obligations under the agreement, and passage is necessary for the agreement to enter into force. The agreement, once it is in force, will facilitate the transfer to Australia of sophisticated space related technology and technical expertise, and it will enhance collaboration between Australia and the Russian Federation in scientific research and technology development.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-08-06,"—Last Sunday, my wife Adriana and I had the privilege of attending the celebration of the Eucharist to mark the 40th anniversary of the ordination of Monsignor Vince Redden, Parish Priest of St Mark's Catholic Church, Drummoyne. The celebration was a great tribute to a humble and very popular parish priest. The congregation was vast and included Monsignor Redden's parents and other family members, as well as members of the clergy, local parishioners and many friends of Monsignor Redden. During the Eucharist we all prayed for Monsignor Redden. Our prayer read:
Monsignor Vince, we thank you for selflessly leading and challenging us in our Christian mission here at St Mark's. We pray that God will always be with you, sustaining and challenging you in your ministry. May you be faithful to God through the people who touch your life. May you be energised by God's love and always be conscious of our love, support and prayers for you. We thank you for all that you have been to us and pray that your ministry continues in our midst.
During Monsignor Redden's homily, he mentioned the dwindling number of vocations to the priesthood in Australia and called for more vocations. He observed that he might be the last parish priest of St Mark's Church—an observation that struck the heart of all of us. The time has come when the devotion to the sacrament of holy orders is reaching rock-bottom. This is particularly prevalent in Australia, while in many other countries there is a spectacular resurgence in religious vocations of all kinds.
The significance for Australia is profound. Australia's legal, administrative and jurisprudential systems are based on solid Christian ethics. Indeed, the very notion of the rule of law, the doctrine of universalism—that is, one person, one law—and a host of other cornerstones of jurisprudence and justice are grounded in our Christian ethos. Therefore, the decline in the number of Christian vocations marks an adverse trend away from the very foundation of our democracy. With the decline of Christian vocations comes the erosion of universalism, the erosion of the rule of law, the erosion of the natural law, the erosion of natural justice, and the erosion of judicial review. In this House we know that cultural, legal and moral relativism are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the laws we make today.
Monsignor Redden's call for more vocations, whatever one's religion, needs all the support we can give. Let us strive for the restoration of those little republics of church that enshrine the critical link between morality and law. Let us deny the threat of agnosticism, with its lie in denying transcendental truth and, with it, the very foundation upon which our democracy so critically depends. Let us preserve our cultural, moral and political heritage that makes Australia one of the most desired places on earth to live. 
Relativism, consequentialism and liberalism are the very roots of morally inconsistent law-making. If we do not preserve our Christian cultural legacy, we will lose it in favour of another matrix, whether it is an alternative theistic belief or whether it is the worship of ego (liberalism), money (materialism), the state (nationalism) or some other morally erroneous ideology. Let us work for the preservation of our Christian legacy and encourage, ever more vigorously, teaching institutions to teach only truth. In so doing, we will play our part in ensuring that vocations thrive, thus preserving the moral rubric of our political and legal system which is so essential for the practical implementation of morality, and we will realise the ideals of Monsignor Vince Redden.
