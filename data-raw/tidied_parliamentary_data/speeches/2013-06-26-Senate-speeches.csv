The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  The Senate time clocks have just packed it in. Timing will be done by a stopwatch—which will not give you any more time; I am certain of that. Senators will be notified when they have one minute to go. We will get the clocks repaired as soon as possible. I have been advised that a technician will have to come onto the floor while the Senate is sitting to attend to the fault.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  Last week we had a five-minute false start on the debate on this aged care package of legislation. As shadow minister for ageing, I want to place on record the appalling process that this government has adopted. So much for these measures being, as the Prime Minister said, a second-term priority for Labor. These bills will join the 55 bills to be guillotined this week, which is almost double the 32 bills guillotined in the entire period that the coalition had control of the Senate. All up, some 216 bills have been guillotined under the Labor-Green alliance. It is disgraceful that this debate on five complex bills is being guillotined. As late as yesterday the government tabled yet more amendments. 


Whilst we may see passage of these bills today, through this very truncated and rushed process, the real detail of this legislation is in the 18 pieces of delegated legislation yet to be tabled, some of which commence operation next Monday. This is political blackmail by a minister showing contempt for the ageing and aged-care sector in general and a real lack of interest in older Australians. The 18 pieces of delegated legislation will no doubt be tabled out of session, thereby precluding proper scrutiny by this parliament. This delegated legislation will include the workforce supplement, which has created so much concern and alarm in the sector. 


No move for disallowance of any of these instruments is possible until the new parliament, given that 15 sitting days need to elapse before they come into effect. We would remind the sector that the future of these instruments rests with the new parliament. In the meantime, Minister Butler will no doubt continue to falsely promote that aged-care workers will get pay rises, knowing full well that their future is not certain. I am sure we will see more false advertisements like this one in The Retiree, wrongly asserting:


From July, $1.2 billion will flow into the pay packets of 350,000 aged care workers across Australia thanks to Federal Labor.


That was authorised by Minister Butler himself, with the address being his electorate office in Semaphore, South Australia. This is false. It is wrong. It is a lie. It is a fabrication. In media reports of 6 March, Minister Butler admitted it is unclear how many of the 350,000 aged-care workers will benefit from the $1.2 billion funding. So, Minister, stop peddling falsehoods and giving false hope for pay rises that will never materialise because providers cannot afford them and the on-costs associated with them.


That brings us to today. It is 727 days from the time the Productivity Commission delivered its Caring for older Australians report to the government on 28 June 2011—almost two years to the day. The government took two years and gives us 45 minutes. That is really showing us the value of Labor's 'second term priority' for ageing Australians.


These bills also pave the way for the creation of an Aged Care Pricing Commissioner to oversee and manage the new pricing arrangements that come into effect on 1 July 2014. The original draft bills allowed for the establishment of that position from 1 January 2014, allowing six months to set in place the appropriate new arrangements and to allow aged-care providers to submit applications for the relevant price variations. But, despite the operation of these provisions and those relating to quality issues not coming into force until 1 July next year, the government has advertised the positions.


The government's intention became clear last week when they tabled a list of amendments to their own bills dated 14 June—only eight days after the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing gave assurances about the filling of these positions. Now the commencement date for the pricing commissioner has been brought forward from 1 January 2014 to 1 August 2013. Let me be clear. The government are not changing the commencement of the revised pricing arrangements. They are just giving the new commissioner 11 months to get his or her house in order and have used dubious claims from industry to justify this outrageous slap to the looming caretaker period, which rears its head only twelve days later.


Not only will the coalition seek to amend the bills to restore the commencement date to 1 January 2014; we will also seek to remove any opportunity for the authority of the pricing commissioner to be delegated to an officer of the Department of Health and Ageing. The pricing commissioner should be independent of the department and be able to maintain integrity at all times.


Let me now move on to the very confusing issue of the accommodation pricing issues that are so complex and so convoluted that they will probably create a whole new industry in accommodation pricing consultants. The coalition supports the removal of the distinction between low care and high care and the consequent introduction of bonds across all residential care accommodation for those with the financial means. The coalition also recognises the importance of giving choice to consumers to select the most appropriate location and type of accommodation best suited to their needs. However, the coalition is not convinced that the new arrangements for accommodation pricing will achieve the improvements the minister and the government are spruiking.


The introduction of refundable accommodation deposits, RADs—accommodation bonds by another name—and daily accommodation payments, DAPs, instead of accommodation charges and income tested fees will be a further confusing part of the aged-care conundrum. Further complications add to the intrigue of making the right decision if there are means-testing and asset-testing components to add to the equation. Overlay that with considerations around the multiple choices on what to do with sizeable assets, such as the resident's house and superannuation funds, and you end up with a very confusing situation. This is likely to be well beyond easy understanding by many older Australians and their families or carers assisting them with such momentous decisions.


I now turn to some other concerns of the coalition regarding these bills covered in the dissenting report of the Senate committee, some of which are the subject of our amendments. There were many concerns raised in the Senate inquiry and, given the guillotine, we have been prevented from canvassing them properly and fully. Firstly, there are the ACFI appraisals. The bills change the point at which the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing can intervene when an aged-care provider has ACFI claim errors. The current wording of the section in the legislation requires that a substantial number of appraisals must be involved before invoking the secretary's powers to suspend providers from making ACFI appraisals. The proposed change is to remove the words 'substantial number', providing greater opportunity for the secretary to suspend an approved provider. The potential that this could occur after one simple mistake is overbearing bureaucracy.


Secondly, the issue of lifetime contribution caps saw many submitters raise concerns that the proposal to set annual and lifetime caps on contributions does not recognise the increasing trends in life spans of older Australians and the benefits to residents from the quality of care and services that are the foundations of these longer stays in residential care. There are also concerns associated with such things as the removal of the retention and the impact this will have on providers. The list goes on. Coalition senators are concerned that these changes have been ill-considered and not backed up with proper financial modelling to ensure confidence in, and certainty of, the economics of the proposals. Coalition senators recommend that the lifetime cap and its specified level be reconsidered, subject to further modelling and analysis of the impact of the lifetime cap on consumers and the industry.


Thirdly, the dementia supplement was intended to cover the 'additional costs involved in caring for people with dementia and other mental health issues'. The coalition believes that further clarification and expansion of the definition is required and that the name should reflect those targeted older Australians who may be eligible for the supplement. 


Now, to lost opportunities. Those of us who have wound our way around the maze of illness, disablement and increasing frailty of a parent through the process of ACAT to find a suitable vacant place in a nice home will know how challenging this can be for any family. Instead of taking an opportunity to simplify the process of moving from full independence to community care or to residential care, the government have gone completely in the other direction and created an even bigger, more confusing process. They have completely ignored the opportunity to reduce the confusion and have, instead, introduced RADs, DAPs and combinations of the two, as well as draw-down options, top-up arrangements, time limits and cooling-off periods. Experts will be challenged by these choices. We have to question the rationale of introducing such convolutions for the average Australian family.


I now turn to concerns of coalition senators regarding the impact of the proposed changes in regional, rural and remote areas. Many older Australians indicate a desire to age in place. This is the same for people residing in the non-metropolitan areas of Australia, but this is substantially more difficult for them to achieve, particularly as their care level needs increase. Ageing in a local community is important not only for the individual's wellbeing but also for the stability of community and the cohesiveness of family. Coalition senators recognise the significant role that aged-care facilities play in rural townships by enabling families to remain connected as people age closer to home, family and community. We remain very concerned that the impact of the changes will adversely affect the viability of many providers in regional, rural and remote areas.


I have talked a lot about the impact of these bills on care recipients and their families. I now want to move the focus to the other side of the equation—to the hundreds of approved aged-care providers. Over the last six years, we have seen a major decline in the business confidence levels across all spheres of care operations. It does not matter if I talk to large commercial operators, the bigger mission based providers, the smaller community based facilities or the few remaining 'mum and dad' family-owned homes: they all tell the same sad story that 60 per cent of all nursing homes are operating in negative financial territory. 


We know that community care operators across the country are all facing huge increases in demand for services. Those services are also coping with changes in the governance and funding processes that are being thrust upon them, with little care and understanding by the Gillard Labor government. The picture is not rosy with a financially stressed aged-care sector; the ongoing uncertainty created by a dysfunctional government which holds all the money cards; the ongoing conflicts and disconnects with the state and territory governments, particularly in relation to the recent Home and Community Care, HACC, changes; the increasing numbers of older Australians seeking care and accommodations services; and the ever-increasing frailty of those who do manage to get the type of care they need. All of this suggests that the five bills we have before us are just not good enough to assist the many providers that have taken on the challenging tasks of delivering care and accommodation services and facilities in this country.


The third 'corner' in this triangular playing field is the government. Any government in Australia today, or the one that will exist in another 80 days, will be challenged by the continuing high costs of our ageing population. There is simply very little 'new' money to perform miracles and tackle these problems. 


The government cherry-picked from the landmark Productivity Commission's report Caring for Older Australians, ignoring the majority of the report and committing little in the way of innovation to supplement and support those few recommendations it has been inclined to tackle.


While these five bills introduce some worthwhile improvements, older Australians deserve greater consideration. Their families and carers deserve support and assistance at a time of great stress. Decisions to relinquish independence, even if it is in decline, are difficult for all involved. While the government may assert that the arrangements in its package may give greater choice, these choices are now harder to fathom, harder to make and harder to live with over time. This is a very poor effort after such a long gestation period. The government itself has recognised the need for amendments and is joined by the coalition, the Greens and the Independent Senator Xenophon.


The coalition will oppose all government and Greens amendments that relate to the early commencement date for the Aged Care Pricing Commissioner. The government has other amendments on various issues, such as people with special needs and home care, as well as amendments of a technical nature. The coalition will not oppose those amendments. The Greens have proposed amendments relating to a homeless supplement, information requests from the Aged Care Commissioner and the formalising of the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority. The coalition will not oppose those amendments. Senator Xenophon has proposed changes to the review processes set down in the bills. The coalition agrees that earlier evaluation is appropriate and will not oppose the amendment from Senator Xenophon.


In conclusion, this has been an appalling process. After such long delays and holding patterns over the last two years, we now have a ridiculously rushed process with far less time for sufficient, appropriate and confident scrutiny by the parliament. In the last two weeks the Living Longer Living Better bills have been thrust into a race, competing with hundreds of other bills and legislative business. Today we will suffer the guillotine simply to get this legislation to the next step. The government and the minister have only themselves to blame. The government has wasted time. It has now run out of time; Australia has simply run out of patience. This is not real reform. It is just more regulation, more bureaucracy and more red tape. In the end, it will not achieve the end objective which is to give older Australians the care they need, when they need it and where they need it. So while our older Australians are living longer, under this regime they will not necessarily be living better.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:47):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and accompanying legislation. Before I commence my speech, I seek leave to table three pieces of correspondence from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler, which I have circulated to the whips.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The Australian Greens are strongly supportive of responsible and much needed reform within the aged-care sector. As our population continues to age, the already significant challenges faced by the sector will increase. They can only be addressed through comprehensive reform. We see this reform as being part of that process. This reform has been sought by consumers, aged-care providers and workers. Instead of whipping up hysteria around these changes, we actually listened to what people had to say. We know that people support these reforms and that, in particular, the majority of aged-care providers support these reforms, although they want some amendments, which I will address in my contribution to this debate. Aged care has not dominated the agenda in the way that other major reforms have this year, but it is vitally important reform that will touch most lives at some point, whether it is they are helping a loved one access the services and care they need or whether they are accessing that care themselves.


I know that many organisations have been working on this reform over a long period of time and have successfully put aged care onto the political agenda, firstly with the Productivity Commission process and then through the NACA blueprint. It is because of this tenacity that there will be more options for care, particularly in home care, which will help Australians be able to age in place for as long as possible with flexible care that can change as their needs change.


The Australian Greens believe that all people should be supported with high quality services, regardless of their capacity to pay, so it is particularly pleasing that funding is available to support vulnerable people who are unable to meet the costs on their own. For this reason we have particularly addressed the issue of homelessness, as indicated in our contribution through the committee process where we highlighted this issue, and my colleague Adam Bandt spoke of this issue in the lower house. There are services such as Wintringham Specialist Aged Care—and I acknowledge representatives of Wintringham in the gallery now—and these organisations do absolutely amazing work in providing care and support to some of the most marginalised and disadvantaged members of our community. Individuals who have experienced homelessness are highly likely to need specialised support to address complex behavioural and mental health needs. While facilities such as Wintringham have managed to cobble together some of the mainstream funding available, evidence presented to the inquiry clearly demonstrated that the service had lost about $20 a day per resident with the new ACFI arrangements. Given that these services are not likely to be collecting any fees from their residents, their long-time viability is in question.


Our preference would have been to move an amendment to the legislation, and I did circulate an amendment in the chamber. Unfortunately, due to some complications, that will not be possible, so I indicate that I will be withdrawing the amendment that specifically relates to the homelessness supplement. One of the pieces of correspondence I have tabled is a commitment by the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler, to implement a homelessness supplement through the principles process. That commitment will be operationalised over the next couple of days and will be implemented on 29 June. In other words, the government has committed funding to a homelessness supplement which will work in combination with the viability supplement. Minister Butler outlines in his correspondence—I understand he will also make a statement about this—that this will be a transitional supplement while the viability supplement is reviewed and that that transitional supplement will continue until a new proper homelessness supplement is put in place. The homelessness supplement will be $15 a day and will work in combination with the other services homeless people will be able to access. I think that is a very positive move, and I am very pleased that the government has agreed to implement that homelessness supplement.


Similarly, I am glad to see that LGBTI people will also be enshrined as a special needs category in the legislation. This group of people are another group of people that have been marginalised when it comes to accessing aged-care services, and recognising them in this legislation will ensure that there is a focus on addressing discrimination on the basis of sexuality in all training and planning aspects of aged care. I believe this is a group who also need legal protections from discrimination, which is why the Greens so strongly supported the amendment that passed through this place earlier this week.


The Greens also welcome the range of other special needs that have been acknowledged in this legislation, including culturally and linguistically diversity and care leavers. I am also particularly glad that the government has taken up the committee recommendation to make amendments to include those affected by forced adoptions, an issue that everybody in this place will know is very close to my heart. Similarly, the addition of specialised supplements for veterans in dementia care is welcome. I am very supportive of the renaming of the dementia supplement to acknowledge that the supplement also covers cognitive impairment and complex behaviours. 


However, broader mental health needs still seem to have missed out. Older Australians should have access to quality mental health services, just as other Australians do. This can be particularly difficult in residential care, just as we know accessing GP services in residential aged care is difficult. The government response notes that the review of the legislation should include the mental health needs of older Australians, and the Australian Greens believe that the government should consider creating a special supplement for mental health once that review has been carried out.


All these improvements, along with a significant increase in the number of packages available and funding for wages, are welcome. But the Australian Greens also recognise that, in order to ensure access to and quality of care in the face of rapidly increasing demand, aged-care services need to be financially viable and capable of achieving growth. This legislation will provide the architecture for our aged-care system's future. However, there are limits on the scope of this reform because the government did not go as far as implementing all the recommendations from the Productivity Commission.


Clearly, the issue of how aged care is to be funded into the future is going to need ongoing discussion with the broader Australian community as this pressure increases. Nevertheless, this legislation does represent some significant changes to the way aged care is delivered. For example, consumers will have access to greater control over how they pay for their care and they will be expected to contribute to the cost of their care if they can afford it. The asset-rich, income-poor consumers who have largely avoided paying for high-care places will now contribute the same as somebody else with the same overall means but with a different mix of assets and income. The distinctions between high care and low care, and the associated restrictions on who is asked to pay for their care, will disappear. Overall more consumers will be contributing to the cost of their accommodation and care, and providers will have to contend with the increased control of consumers to choose how they pay for their accommodation, on a daily basis or in a lump sum. 


The overall viability of the sector is an issue of concern to us. As well as participating in this inquiry, I have consulted widely with the sector and taken very seriously the concerns of industry about the impacts of legislation could have on their individual businesses. Their ability to navigate the new system and implement these reforms on the ground will determine how many more aged-care places are available and the quality of those services, which in turn is crucial for delivering better aged care for consumers. The current reform package does not necessarily achieve neutrality. There is no neutrality between new daily accommodation payments, DAPs, and the refundable accommodation deposits, RADs, because of the decision to maintain existing arrangements for the primary residence in the assets test. 


The most significant change to residential care is focused on the lump-sum payments—formerly accommodation bonds, which are now the RADs. There will now be a clearer link between the cost of delivering accommodation and the cost of that accommodation, whether that is reflected in the lump-sum deposits that individuals use to pay for their accommodation or whether they choose to pay on a daily basis. While these reforms put restrictions on the size of the bonds, they increase the total pool of people who can pay their accommodation fee through a lump sum, as well as lift the distinction between high care and low care. It means that more people will potentially be paying for their care via a lump-sum payment. With this reform those consumers who may have waited too long to enter care because of the perceived barrier that large, low-care bonds have represented will have more options available to them, including the DAPs, and will be able to negotiate combinations of DAPs and RADs. However, as a result, providers have to face less certainty about how consumers will choose to pay their contributions. Evidence to the committee's inquiry demonstrated that this has implications for their business planning, given the industry's heavy reliance on the capital that upfront bond payments provide. In other words, they use that money to build new accommodation. A move away from lump sums will require them to find new ways to attract bank loans to finance their operations and build new facilities and service their debt. These are all matters that I have considered very seriously, particularly as there are some very effective and capable providers who run important services for low-income Australians by making low-care beds available or by operating in regional areas. These services have been and will continue performing ongoing juggling acts to make ends meet. These reforms must strengthen, rather than undermine, these services.


The KPMG modelling on the financial implications of this reform have helped resolve some of these concerns by trying to quantify the effects on the capital available to aged-care providers, but I acknowledge that this modelling cannot account for all factors, and I have made that point in our additional comments to the committee inquiry. I recognise that this modelling may not have resolved all their concerns about what real consumers may actually choose to do, because it is not possible to model everything. There are a number of reasons why people make the particular decision to choose a lump sum or, conversely, a daily payment. I acknowledge that there will be some uncertainty for them to contend with, as the industry is in transition, which is why I have spent a lot of time talking to providers and why the overwhelming message from most of the providers is that they want this legislation to go through—because we need reform.


The shift in the industry's financing structures will be gradual, as all existing contracts—in other words, all the people who are currently in aged care—will be grandfathered under transitional arrangements, but short-term liquidity problems will need to be addressed immediately once issues become apparent. We cannot leave those until the general review of the legislation later down the track; we must address these problems as they arise. However, the Australian Greens are reluctant and do not want to address the issue of the equivalence in treatment of the lump sum and the daily payment by simply allowing lump sum payments to also receive protection from asset testing. The Australian Greens believe this would unwind most of the progress that has been made on ensuring that assets are means-tested and that consumers contribute to the cost of their care. This would in turn undermine the financial viability of the sector into the future. We in fact asked for modelling of these various options and we can see no way of addressing the inequity between daily payments and rates unless changes are made about addressing the value of the primary residence; and, as yet, Australia is not prepared to address that issue, so we cannot fix this particular problem.


We can, however, look at how we address any transitional problems, any viability problems, for the sector. That is why the Australian Greens have introduced amendments to recognise the Aged Care Financing Authority in the legislation as a specialised monitoring body, separate from the Department of Health and Ageing, with a similar composition of industry experience to its current membership. One of the documents I tabled addresses some of the requests that the minister has made to ACFA in their work and in their review process. ACFA can undertake this monitoring work with a view to ensuring the financial viability of the sector and provide timely analysis and make recommendations to the government about how and when to implement transitional arrangements that can address liquidity and capital problems as they arise. 


I am glad that the government has also responded to our concerns with an up-front commitment to subsidise business advisory services to residential aged-care providers that need assistance to implement the new accommodation payment system. Some of that information was articulated in the government's response to the Senate committee inquiry.


We have also been concerned about how consumers will be affected by the new co-contribution component and we have paid particular attention to the new home-care fees. While full pensioners will receive greater support under this legislation—and we are very supportive of that and appreciate the fact that our most vulnerable Australians are being supported in this manner—low-income part-pensioners may face some relatively large fee increases while still facing a range of other cost-of-living pressures. It would be disappointing if this group began to self-ration their care dollars. This was raised as a potential issue during the committee inquiry, and we looked at it carefully. Unfortunately, if we start fiddling with the taper rates, that would lead to a reduction in the number of packages available. We are not sure if the increase in the care fees will have a negative impact in terms of self-rationing. This is another issue that we expect ACFA to watch closely and advise the government on. Again, this issue cannot be left unaddressed in the long term. If people are self-rationing care, if they are unable to meet the costs of care, action needs to be taken as soon as possible. ACFA have a comprehensive work plan set out in the letter that I tabled in this place, and we will very carefully watch ACFA implement that work plan. They are essential, to my mind, in terms of how these reform processes are going to work. 


On the whole, the Australian Greens believe that the Living Longer legislation is an important step forward in ensuring quality care is accessible to all older Australians. For that reason, we also support the workforce supplement. We appreciate the fact that the government has made some changes to that and we support those changes because they address some of the concerns of the sector. Our amendments and the commitments that the government has made in response to the very comprehensive committee inquiry have improved the bills further. What we now have before us is an architecture that should ensure the delivery of better outcomes for older Australians and the aged-care sector alike, both now and into the future.


We have listened carefully to all the stakeholders involved in this discussion. It is very clear to us that aged-care providers want this reform. Yes, there are concerns with this reform. We are concerned about some of the weighting for the daily accommodation payment and what that will do to consumer choices—in other words, they may choose the daily payments. However, until we are ready to have a broader discussion—and I agree with the government: this Australian community is not yet ready to have that broader discussion about how we use some of our accumulated assets to pay for our care into the future—this is the best we can do.


We very carefully looked at what the options were for different modelling, for taking into account what is in and out of the assets test, bearing in mind that the assets test is very close, is linked directly, to the age pension assets means-testing process. There was certainly not an appetite to delink those two. You cannot make any other changes to the DAPs and RAD unless you are prepared to significantly increase the cost of care or take the guts out of this package in terms of funding, and we are not prepared to do that.


The Greens will be supporting the package of these bills. We strongly support the passing of these bills on the basis of the homelessness supplement and also the amendments that we have already tabled in the Senate. We support these bills.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:06):  It gives me a lot of pleasure to stand up and talk about aged-care issues more broadly and the government's aged-care reforms but I do need to stress that, of all the guillotines that have fallen on bills in this Senate over the last few days and that will fall over the next few days, it is most shameful that we should have to be rushed in our deliberation of aged-care reforms that go to the heart of how we treat older Australians. It is true that many of the bills that the Senate is debating this week are important bills. It is hard to imagine a bill that is more important than how we deal with aged care in our country. I just want to echo the comments of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. She was quite right: we will be living longer but not necessarily living better as result of the government's aged-care reforms. I will restrict my comments, unfortunately, to five minutes to allow Senator McKenzie, my colleague from Victoria, who I know wants to talk about regional aged-care issues, to do so. It is disappointing that I will not have longer to talk about my own interests, but I think that in the interests of coalition bipartisanship I will share some time with Senator McKenzie.


We need to be clear about what it is that we are addressing here. Let us be clear: we are addressing falling levels of confidence amongst aged-care providers about their ability to deliver aged care. We are talking about increased financial stress amongst rural and regional aged-care providers, particularly those across smaller regional communities like areas that I represent in Western Australia, like the Great Southern. We are talking about the need to properly reward aged-care workers for the effort and the passion that they show in their work, but the proposals for rewarding aged-care workers in the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and related bills are not suitable.


Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells was very, very correct when she said this is a complex and complicated approach to the future financing of aged care in our country. When we think about why financing is such a critical issue, we only need to look at the comments of Peter Cosgrove some weeks ago when he talked about a shortfall of 66,000 home care places by 2050 and said that 83,000 new nursing home places will be needed over the next nine years. He went on to say that the number of people over 65 will double to six million by 2050, pointing to the fact that aged-care reform and aged-care discussion is central to how we manage ourselves as we go forward as a country. On the issue of the aged-care workforce, he said:


The aged services workforce of 350,000 will need to triple by 2050 to serve the increasing demand for care. The majority of aged care workers are over 45 with a third nearing retirement.


So there is an issue that needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed in a considered manner. Rushing aged-care bills through the parliament like this is certainly not the way to proceed.


There are many issues that I would have liked to have addressed in my time, but I will just quote from Dr Lucy Morris, who is the CEO of Baptistcare in Perth, in Western Australia, and her very, very considered comments in regard to these particular bills. Dr Lucy Morris, in April this year, said:


I believe that the specific issues of rural, regional and remote Australia providers, particularly in WA, have been ignored. These include issues around the ACLEI changes going to the viability, the implications of the workforce supplement, ongoing issues about access to staff, professional services training and increased costs of service delivery. The 28-day choice of payment methodology is going to cripple them. There is lack of access to capital. There are lower incomes generally in the country. Sixty per cent of our services are provided in rural and regional WA. 


…   …   …


Our concern about our capacity to provide affordable services to the marginalised, in line with our mission, and at the same time generate a surplus to future-proof our services and continue to invest in capital infrastructure, which has come almost to a halt in the last few years, is significant. 


Reform of the aged-care sector is important. It should not be done in the way it is being done by this government.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:10):  I rise to make a shortened contribution to this debate on what could have been a significant opportunity for this government to deal with the real issues across the aged-care system. This focus-group-tested and press-release-happy-titled Living Longer Living Better aged-care reform package, announced on 20 April, is a package of five bills to give effect to the government's response to the Productivity Commission's report into caring for older Australians. 


A lot of comments have been made about rural and regional issues related to the provision of aged-care services, because there are some real concerns about the impact of this package on those services, on the people who use them and on the communities that support them. In regional Australia there are 1,225 residential aged-care providers, 1,100 of which have 60 or fewer beds, the number of beds being a figure that is generally used to define how viable a provider will be. In the Bendigo electorate, where my office is situated, over 17 per cent of the population is 65 years of age or older, which is above the average in my home state of Victoria. As is the case in other regional areas, available residential and home care services for the elderly are at below average levels. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has already mentioned, ageing in place is incredibly important for those who live in regional areas, because it is not only about the individual's wellbeing but also about the stability of community and the cohesiveness of our families. 


Again, this package of bills contained no detail. Providers and stakeholders were asked to comment on how the bills would affect them and the work that they do without being provided with any detail. Rural providers, throughout the brief consultation we were able to conduct into this package of bills, raised several challenges, including the relatively high cost of establishing and delivering services in rural areas; difficulties in attracting, retaining and professionally developing suitably qualified staff; the limited availability of medical practitioners; low-income asset value; distance; logistics of continuous care provision; and so on. 


I believe this package of bills fails to address the challenges faced by our rural providers. The early provisions which can potentially come into force on Monday next week will actually set the standards in efficiency within the Public Service. Good luck with that coming into effect! What we on our side know is that this is not about aged-care services; it is about buying votes. 


I participated in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. We travelled across the country in a very brief period of time. It is regrettable that sufficient time to consider this important legislation was further eroded by the majority of Labor and Greens senators, who voted to bring forward the reporting date of this committee from 17 June to 31 May. As I said, stakeholders have had limited time and the devil is always in the detail. 


Reform is required, and the majority of the sector actually supported the Productivity Commission's report, yet here we are with a grab bag of legislation that really only adopts less than 10 per cent of what the Productivity Commission sought to recommend. Obviously, though, the coalition as the champions of rural and regional Australia have made significant recommendations for how this package of bills could be made better for rural and regional areas, and that is outlined in our dissenting report.



But this government continues the rush to legislate without detail. The amendments moved by the coalition, by the Greens and by Senator Xenophon deserve greater scrutiny. We should be going into committee to do that, but—as usual—we are disrespected as senators. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:32):  Last week we had a five-minute false start on the debate on this aged care package of legislation. As shadow minister for ageing, I want to place on record the appalling process that this government has adopted. So much for these measures being, as the Prime Minister said, a second-term priority for Labor. These bills will join the 55 bills to be guillotined this week, which is almost double the 32 bills guillotined in the entire period that the coalition had control of the Senate. All up, some 216 bills have been guillotined under the Labor-Green alliance. It is disgraceful that this debate on five complex bills is being guillotined. As late as yesterday the government tabled yet more amendments. 


Whilst we may see passage of these bills today, through this very truncated and rushed process, the real detail of this legislation is in the 18 pieces of delegated legislation yet to be tabled, some of which commence operation next Monday. This is political blackmail by a minister showing contempt for the ageing and aged-care sector in general and a real lack of interest in older Australians. The 18 pieces of delegated legislation will no doubt be tabled out of session, thereby precluding proper scrutiny by this parliament. This delegated legislation will include the workforce supplement, which has created so much concern and alarm in the sector. 


No move for disallowance of any of these instruments is possible until the new parliament, given that 15 sitting days need to elapse before they come into effect. We would remind the sector that the future of these instruments rests with the new parliament. In the meantime, Minister Butler will no doubt continue to falsely promote that aged-care workers will get pay rises, knowing full well that their future is not certain. I am sure we will see more false advertisements like this one in The Retiree, wrongly asserting:


From July, $1.2 billion will flow into the pay packets of 350,000 aged care workers across Australia thanks to Federal Labor.


That was authorised by Minister Butler himself, with the address being his electorate office in Semaphore, South Australia. This is false. It is wrong. It is a lie. It is a fabrication. In media reports of 6 March, Minister Butler admitted it is unclear how many of the 350,000 aged-care workers will benefit from the $1.2 billion funding. So, Minister, stop peddling falsehoods and giving false hope for pay rises that will never materialise because providers cannot afford them and the on-costs associated with them.


That brings us to today. It is 727 days from the time the Productivity Commission delivered its Caring for older Australians report to the government on 28 June 2011—almost two years to the day. The government took two years and gives us 45 minutes. That is really showing us the value of Labor's 'second term priority' for ageing Australians.


These bills also pave the way for the creation of an Aged Care Pricing Commissioner to oversee and manage the new pricing arrangements that come into effect on 1 July 2014. The original draft bills allowed for the establishment of that position from 1 January 2014, allowing six months to set in place the appropriate new arrangements and to allow aged-care providers to submit applications for the relevant price variations. But, despite the operation of these provisions and those relating to quality issues not coming into force until 1 July next year, the government has advertised the positions.


The government's intention became clear last week when they tabled a list of amendments to their own bills dated 14 June—only eight days after the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing gave assurances about the filling of these positions. Now the commencement date for the pricing commissioner has been brought forward from 1 January 2014 to 1 August 2013. Let me be clear. The government are not changing the commencement of the revised pricing arrangements. They are just giving the new commissioner 11 months to get his or her house in order and have used dubious claims from industry to justify this outrageous slap to the looming caretaker period, which rears its head only twelve days later.


Not only will the coalition seek to amend the bills to restore the commencement date to 1 January 2014; we will also seek to remove any opportunity for the authority of the pricing commissioner to be delegated to an officer of the Department of Health and Ageing. The pricing commissioner should be independent of the department and be able to maintain integrity at all times.


Let me now move on to the very confusing issue of the accommodation pricing issues that are so complex and so convoluted that they will probably create a whole new industry in accommodation pricing consultants. The coalition supports the removal of the distinction between low care and high care and the consequent introduction of bonds across all residential care accommodation for those with the financial means. The coalition also recognises the importance of giving choice to consumers to select the most appropriate location and type of accommodation best suited to their needs. However, the coalition is not convinced that the new arrangements for accommodation pricing will achieve the improvements the minister and the government are spruiking.


The introduction of refundable accommodation deposits, RADs—accommodation bonds by another name—and daily accommodation payments, DAPs, instead of accommodation charges and income tested fees will be a further confusing part of the aged-care conundrum. Further complications add to the intrigue of making the right decision if there are means-testing and asset-testing components to add to the equation. Overlay that with considerations around the multiple choices on what to do with sizeable assets, such as the resident's house and superannuation funds, and you end up with a very confusing situation. This is likely to be well beyond easy understanding by many older Australians and their families or carers assisting them with such momentous decisions.


I now turn to some other concerns of the coalition regarding these bills covered in the dissenting report of the Senate committee, some of which are the subject of our amendments. There were many concerns raised in the Senate inquiry and, given the guillotine, we have been prevented from canvassing them properly and fully. Firstly, there are the ACFI appraisals. The bills change the point at which the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing can intervene when an aged-care provider has ACFI claim errors. The current wording of the section in the legislation requires that a substantial number of appraisals must be involved before invoking the secretary's powers to suspend providers from making ACFI appraisals. The proposed change is to remove the words 'substantial number', providing greater opportunity for the secretary to suspend an approved provider. The potential that this could occur after one simple mistake is overbearing bureaucracy.


Secondly, the issue of lifetime contribution caps saw many submitters raise concerns that the proposal to set annual and lifetime caps on contributions does not recognise the increasing trends in life spans of older Australians and the benefits to residents from the quality of care and services that are the foundations of these longer stays in residential care. There are also concerns associated with such things as the removal of the retention and the impact this will have on providers. The list goes on. Coalition senators are concerned that these changes have been ill-considered and not backed up with proper financial modelling to ensure confidence in, and certainty of, the economics of the proposals. Coalition senators recommend that the lifetime cap and its specified level be reconsidered, subject to further modelling and analysis of the impact of the lifetime cap on consumers and the industry.


Thirdly, the dementia supplement was intended to cover the 'additional costs involved in caring for people with dementia and other mental health issues'. The coalition believes that further clarification and expansion of the definition is required and that the name should reflect those targeted older Australians who may be eligible for the supplement. 


Now, to lost opportunities. Those of us who have wound our way around the maze of illness, disablement and increasing frailty of a parent through the process of ACAT to find a suitable vacant place in a nice home will know how challenging this can be for any family. Instead of taking an opportunity to simplify the process of moving from full independence to community care or to residential care, the government have gone completely in the other direction and created an even bigger, more confusing process. They have completely ignored the opportunity to reduce the confusion and have, instead, introduced RADs, DAPs and combinations of the two, as well as draw-down options, top-up arrangements, time limits and cooling-off periods. Experts will be challenged by these choices. We have to question the rationale of introducing such convolutions for the average Australian family.


I now turn to concerns of coalition senators regarding the impact of the proposed changes in regional, rural and remote areas. Many older Australians indicate a desire to age in place. This is the same for people residing in the non-metropolitan areas of Australia, but this is substantially more difficult for them to achieve, particularly as their care level needs increase. Ageing in a local community is important not only for the individual's wellbeing but also for the stability of community and the cohesiveness of family. Coalition senators recognise the significant role that aged-care facilities play in rural townships by enabling families to remain connected as people age closer to home, family and community. We remain very concerned that the impact of the changes will adversely affect the viability of many providers in regional, rural and remote areas.


I have talked a lot about the impact of these bills on care recipients and their families. I now want to move the focus to the other side of the equation—to the hundreds of approved aged-care providers. Over the last six years, we have seen a major decline in the business confidence levels across all spheres of care operations. It does not matter if I talk to large commercial operators, the bigger mission based providers, the smaller community based facilities or the few remaining 'mum and dad' family-owned homes: they all tell the same sad story that 60 per cent of all nursing homes are operating in negative financial territory. 


We know that community care operators across the country are all facing huge increases in demand for services. Those services are also coping with changes in the governance and funding processes that are being thrust upon them, with little care and understanding by the Gillard Labor government. The picture is not rosy with a financially stressed aged-care sector; the ongoing uncertainty created by a dysfunctional government which holds all the money cards; the ongoing conflicts and disconnects with the state and territory governments, particularly in relation to the recent Home and Community Care, HACC, changes; the increasing numbers of older Australians seeking care and accommodations services; and the ever-increasing frailty of those who do manage to get the type of care they need. All of this suggests that the five bills we have before us are just not good enough to assist the many providers that have taken on the challenging tasks of delivering care and accommodation services and facilities in this country.


The third 'corner' in this triangular playing field is the government. Any government in Australia today, or the one that will exist in another 80 days, will be challenged by the continuing high costs of our ageing population. There is simply very little 'new' money to perform miracles and tackle these problems. 


The government cherry-picked from the landmark Productivity Commission's report Caring for Older Australians, ignoring the majority of the report and committing little in the way of innovation to supplement and support those few recommendations it has been inclined to tackle.


While these five bills introduce some worthwhile improvements, older Australians deserve greater consideration. Their families and carers deserve support and assistance at a time of great stress. Decisions to relinquish independence, even if it is in decline, are difficult for all involved. While the government may assert that the arrangements in its package may give greater choice, these choices are now harder to fathom, harder to make and harder to live with over time. This is a very poor effort after such a long gestation period. The government itself has recognised the need for amendments and is joined by the coalition, the Greens and the Independent Senator Xenophon.


The coalition will oppose all government and Greens amendments that relate to the early commencement date for the Aged Care Pricing Commissioner. The government has other amendments on various issues, such as people with special needs and home care, as well as amendments of a technical nature. The coalition will not oppose those amendments. The Greens have proposed amendments relating to a homeless supplement, information requests from the Aged Care Commissioner and the formalising of the establishment of the Aged Care Financing Authority. The coalition will not oppose those amendments. Senator Xenophon has proposed changes to the review processes set down in the bills. The coalition agrees that earlier evaluation is appropriate and will not oppose the amendment from Senator Xenophon.


In conclusion, this has been an appalling process. After such long delays and holding patterns over the last two years, we now have a ridiculously rushed process with far less time for sufficient, appropriate and confident scrutiny by the parliament. In the last two weeks the Living Longer Living Better bills have been thrust into a race, competing with hundreds of other bills and legislative business. Today we will suffer the guillotine simply to get this legislation to the next step. The government and the minister have only themselves to blame. The government has wasted time. It has now run out of time; Australia has simply run out of patience. This is not real reform. It is just more regulation, more bureaucracy and more red tape. In the end, it will not achieve the end objective which is to give older Australians the care they need, when they need it and where they need it. So while our older Australians are living longer, under this regime they will not necessarily be living better.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-06-26,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:47):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and accompanying legislation. Before I commence my speech, I seek leave to table three pieces of correspondence from the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler, which I have circulated to the whips.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The Australian Greens are strongly supportive of responsible and much needed reform within the aged-care sector. As our population continues to age, the already significant challenges faced by the sector will increase. They can only be addressed through comprehensive reform. We see this reform as being part of that process. This reform has been sought by consumers, aged-care providers and workers. Instead of whipping up hysteria around these changes, we actually listened to what people had to say. We know that people support these reforms and that, in particular, the majority of aged-care providers support these reforms, although they want some amendments, which I will address in my contribution to this debate. Aged care has not dominated the agenda in the way that other major reforms have this year, but it is vitally important reform that will touch most lives at some point, whether it is they are helping a loved one access the services and care they need or whether they are accessing that care themselves.


I know that many organisations have been working on this reform over a long period of time and have successfully put aged care onto the political agenda, firstly with the Productivity Commission process and then through the NACA blueprint. It is because of this tenacity that there will be more options for care, particularly in home care, which will help Australians be able to age in place for as long as possible with flexible care that can change as their needs change.


The Australian Greens believe that all people should be supported with high quality services, regardless of their capacity to pay, so it is particularly pleasing that funding is available to support vulnerable people who are unable to meet the costs on their own. For this reason we have particularly addressed the issue of homelessness, as indicated in our contribution through the committee process where we highlighted this issue, and my colleague Adam Bandt spoke of this issue in the lower house. There are services such as Wintringham Specialist Aged Care—and I acknowledge representatives of Wintringham in the gallery now—and these organisations do absolutely amazing work in providing care and support to some of the most marginalised and disadvantaged members of our community. Individuals who have experienced homelessness are highly likely to need specialised support to address complex behavioural and mental health needs. While facilities such as Wintringham have managed to cobble together some of the mainstream funding available, evidence presented to the inquiry clearly demonstrated that the service had lost about $20 a day per resident with the new ACFI arrangements. Given that these services are not likely to be collecting any fees from their residents, their long-time viability is in question.


Our preference would have been to move an amendment to the legislation, and I did circulate an amendment in the chamber. Unfortunately, due to some complications, that will not be possible, so I indicate that I will be withdrawing the amendment that specifically relates to the homelessness supplement. One of the pieces of correspondence I have tabled is a commitment by the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler, to implement a homelessness supplement through the principles process. That commitment will be operationalised over the next couple of days and will be implemented on 29 June. In other words, the government has committed funding to a homelessness supplement which will work in combination with the viability supplement. Minister Butler outlines in his correspondence—I understand he will also make a statement about this—that this will be a transitional supplement while the viability supplement is reviewed and that that transitional supplement will continue until a new proper homelessness supplement is put in place. The homelessness supplement will be $15 a day and will work in combination with the other services homeless people will be able to access. I think that is a very positive move, and I am very pleased that the government has agreed to implement that homelessness supplement.


Similarly, I am glad to see that LGBTI people will also be enshrined as a special needs category in the legislation. This group of people are another group of people that have been marginalised when it comes to accessing aged-care services, and recognising them in this legislation will ensure that there is a focus on addressing discrimination on the basis of sexuality in all training and planning aspects of aged care. I believe this is a group who also need legal protections from discrimination, which is why the Greens so strongly supported the amendment that passed through this place earlier this week.


The Greens also welcome the range of other special needs that have been acknowledged in this legislation, including culturally and linguistically diversity and care leavers. I am also particularly glad that the government has taken up the committee recommendation to make amendments to include those affected by forced adoptions, an issue that everybody in this place will know is very close to my heart. Similarly, the addition of specialised supplements for veterans in dementia care is welcome. I am very supportive of the renaming of the dementia supplement to acknowledge that the supplement also covers cognitive impairment and complex behaviours. 


However, broader mental health needs still seem to have missed out. Older Australians should have access to quality mental health services, just as other Australians do. This can be particularly difficult in residential care, just as we know accessing GP services in residential aged care is difficult. The government response notes that the review of the legislation should include the mental health needs of older Australians, and the Australian Greens believe that the government should consider creating a special supplement for mental health once that review has been carried out.


All these improvements, along with a significant increase in the number of packages available and funding for wages, are welcome. But the Australian Greens also recognise that, in order to ensure access to and quality of care in the face of rapidly increasing demand, aged-care services need to be financially viable and capable of achieving growth. This legislation will provide the architecture for our aged-care system's future. However, there are limits on the scope of this reform because the government did not go as far as implementing all the recommendations from the Productivity Commission.


Clearly, the issue of how aged care is to be funded into the future is going to need ongoing discussion with the broader Australian community as this pressure increases. Nevertheless, this legislation does represent some significant changes to the way aged care is delivered. For example, consumers will have access to greater control over how they pay for their care and they will be expected to contribute to the cost of their care if they can afford it. The asset-rich, income-poor consumers who have largely avoided paying for high-care places will now contribute the same as somebody else with the same overall means but with a different mix of assets and income. The distinctions between high care and low care, and the associated restrictions on who is asked to pay for their care, will disappear. Overall more consumers will be contributing to the cost of their accommodation and care, and providers will have to contend with the increased control of consumers to choose how they pay for their accommodation, on a daily basis or in a lump sum. 


The overall viability of the sector is an issue of concern to us. As well as participating in this inquiry, I have consulted widely with the sector and taken very seriously the concerns of industry about the impacts of legislation could have on their individual businesses. Their ability to navigate the new system and implement these reforms on the ground will determine how many more aged-care places are available and the quality of those services, which in turn is crucial for delivering better aged care for consumers. The current reform package does not necessarily achieve neutrality. There is no neutrality between new daily accommodation payments, DAPs, and the refundable accommodation deposits, RADs, because of the decision to maintain existing arrangements for the primary residence in the assets test. 


The most significant change to residential care is focused on the lump-sum payments—formerly accommodation bonds, which are now the RADs. There will now be a clearer link between the cost of delivering accommodation and the cost of that accommodation, whether that is reflected in the lump-sum deposits that individuals use to pay for their accommodation or whether they choose to pay on a daily basis. While these reforms put restrictions on the size of the bonds, they increase the total pool of people who can pay their accommodation fee through a lump sum, as well as lift the distinction between high care and low care. It means that more people will potentially be paying for their care via a lump-sum payment. With this reform those consumers who may have waited too long to enter care because of the perceived barrier that large, low-care bonds have represented will have more options available to them, including the DAPs, and will be able to negotiate combinations of DAPs and RADs. However, as a result, providers have to face less certainty about how consumers will choose to pay their contributions. Evidence to the committee's inquiry demonstrated that this has implications for their business planning, given the industry's heavy reliance on the capital that upfront bond payments provide. In other words, they use that money to build new accommodation. A move away from lump sums will require them to find new ways to attract bank loans to finance their operations and build new facilities and service their debt. These are all matters that I have considered very seriously, particularly as there are some very effective and capable providers who run important services for low-income Australians by making low-care beds available or by operating in regional areas. These services have been and will continue performing ongoing juggling acts to make ends meet. These reforms must strengthen, rather than undermine, these services.


The KPMG modelling on the financial implications of this reform have helped resolve some of these concerns by trying to quantify the effects on the capital available to aged-care providers, but I acknowledge that this modelling cannot account for all factors, and I have made that point in our additional comments to the committee inquiry. I recognise that this modelling may not have resolved all their concerns about what real consumers may actually choose to do, because it is not possible to model everything. There are a number of reasons why people make the particular decision to choose a lump sum or, conversely, a daily payment. I acknowledge that there will be some uncertainty for them to contend with, as the industry is in transition, which is why I have spent a lot of time talking to providers and why the overwhelming message from most of the providers is that they want this legislation to go through—because we need reform.


The shift in the industry's financing structures will be gradual, as all existing contracts—in other words, all the people who are currently in aged care—will be grandfathered under transitional arrangements, but short-term liquidity problems will need to be addressed immediately once issues become apparent. We cannot leave those until the general review of the legislation later down the track; we must address these problems as they arise. However, the Australian Greens are reluctant and do not want to address the issue of the equivalence in treatment of the lump sum and the daily payment by simply allowing lump sum payments to also receive protection from asset testing. The Australian Greens believe this would unwind most of the progress that has been made on ensuring that assets are means-tested and that consumers contribute to the cost of their care. This would in turn undermine the financial viability of the sector into the future. We in fact asked for modelling of these various options and we can see no way of addressing the inequity between daily payments and rates unless changes are made about addressing the value of the primary residence; and, as yet, Australia is not prepared to address that issue, so we cannot fix this particular problem.


We can, however, look at how we address any transitional problems, any viability problems, for the sector. That is why the Australian Greens have introduced amendments to recognise the Aged Care Financing Authority in the legislation as a specialised monitoring body, separate from the Department of Health and Ageing, with a similar composition of industry experience to its current membership. One of the documents I tabled addresses some of the requests that the minister has made to ACFA in their work and in their review process. ACFA can undertake this monitoring work with a view to ensuring the financial viability of the sector and provide timely analysis and make recommendations to the government about how and when to implement transitional arrangements that can address liquidity and capital problems as they arise. 


I am glad that the government has also responded to our concerns with an up-front commitment to subsidise business advisory services to residential aged-care providers that need assistance to implement the new accommodation payment system. Some of that information was articulated in the government's response to the Senate committee inquiry.


We have also been concerned about how consumers will be affected by the new co-contribution component and we have paid particular attention to the new home-care fees. While full pensioners will receive greater support under this legislation—and we are very supportive of that and appreciate the fact that our most vulnerable Australians are being supported in this manner—low-income part-pensioners may face some relatively large fee increases while still facing a range of other cost-of-living pressures. It would be disappointing if this group began to self-ration their care dollars. This was raised as a potential issue during the committee inquiry, and we looked at it carefully. Unfortunately, if we start fiddling with the taper rates, that would lead to a reduction in the number of packages available. We are not sure if the increase in the care fees will have a negative impact in terms of self-rationing. This is another issue that we expect ACFA to watch closely and advise the government on. Again, this issue cannot be left unaddressed in the long term. If people are self-rationing care, if they are unable to meet the costs of care, action needs to be taken as soon as possible. ACFA have a comprehensive work plan set out in the letter that I tabled in this place, and we will very carefully watch ACFA implement that work plan. They are essential, to my mind, in terms of how these reform processes are going to work. 


On the whole, the Australian Greens believe that the Living Longer legislation is an important step forward in ensuring quality care is accessible to all older Australians. For that reason, we also support the workforce supplement. We appreciate the fact that the government has made some changes to that and we support those changes because they address some of the concerns of the sector. Our amendments and the commitments that the government has made in response to the very comprehensive committee inquiry have improved the bills further. What we now have before us is an architecture that should ensure the delivery of better outcomes for older Australians and the aged-care sector alike, both now and into the future.


We have listened carefully to all the stakeholders involved in this discussion. It is very clear to us that aged-care providers want this reform. Yes, there are concerns with this reform. We are concerned about some of the weighting for the daily accommodation payment and what that will do to consumer choices—in other words, they may choose the daily payments. However, until we are ready to have a broader discussion—and I agree with the government: this Australian community is not yet ready to have that broader discussion about how we use some of our accumulated assets to pay for our care into the future—this is the best we can do.


We very carefully looked at what the options were for different modelling, for taking into account what is in and out of the assets test, bearing in mind that the assets test is very close, is linked directly, to the age pension assets means-testing process. There was certainly not an appetite to delink those two. You cannot make any other changes to the DAPs and RAD unless you are prepared to significantly increase the cost of care or take the guts out of this package in terms of funding, and we are not prepared to do that.


The Greens will be supporting the package of these bills. We strongly support the passing of these bills on the basis of the homelessness supplement and also the amendments that we have already tabled in the Senate. We support these bills.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:06):  It gives me a lot of pleasure to stand up and talk about aged-care issues more broadly and the government's aged-care reforms but I do need to stress that, of all the guillotines that have fallen on bills in this Senate over the last few days and that will fall over the next few days, it is most shameful that we should have to be rushed in our deliberation of aged-care reforms that go to the heart of how we treat older Australians. It is true that many of the bills that the Senate is debating this week are important bills. It is hard to imagine a bill that is more important than how we deal with aged care in our country. I just want to echo the comments of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. She was quite right: we will be living longer but not necessarily living better as result of the government's aged-care reforms. I will restrict my comments, unfortunately, to five minutes to allow Senator McKenzie, my colleague from Victoria, who I know wants to talk about regional aged-care issues, to do so. It is disappointing that I will not have longer to talk about my own interests, but I think that in the interests of coalition bipartisanship I will share some time with Senator McKenzie.


We need to be clear about what it is that we are addressing here. Let us be clear: we are addressing falling levels of confidence amongst aged-care providers about their ability to deliver aged care. We are talking about increased financial stress amongst rural and regional aged-care providers, particularly those across smaller regional communities like areas that I represent in Western Australia, like the Great Southern. We are talking about the need to properly reward aged-care workers for the effort and the passion that they show in their work, but the proposals for rewarding aged-care workers in the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and related bills are not suitable.


Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells was very, very correct when she said this is a complex and complicated approach to the future financing of aged care in our country. When we think about why financing is such a critical issue, we only need to look at the comments of Peter Cosgrove some weeks ago when he talked about a shortfall of 66,000 home care places by 2050 and said that 83,000 new nursing home places will be needed over the next nine years. He went on to say that the number of people over 65 will double to six million by 2050, pointing to the fact that aged-care reform and aged-care discussion is central to how we manage ourselves as we go forward as a country. On the issue of the aged-care workforce, he said:


The aged services workforce of 350,000 will need to triple by 2050 to serve the increasing demand for care. The majority of aged care workers are over 45 with a third nearing retirement.


So there is an issue that needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed in a considered manner. Rushing aged-care bills through the parliament like this is certainly not the way to proceed.


There are many issues that I would have liked to have addressed in my time, but I will just quote from Dr Lucy Morris, who is the CEO of Baptistcare in Perth, in Western Australia, and her very, very considered comments in regard to these particular bills. Dr Lucy Morris, in April this year, said:


I believe that the specific issues of rural, regional and remote Australia providers, particularly in WA, have been ignored. These include issues around the ACLEI changes going to the viability, the implications of the workforce supplement, ongoing issues about access to staff, professional services training and increased costs of service delivery. The 28-day choice of payment methodology is going to cripple them. There is lack of access to capital. There are lower incomes generally in the country. Sixty per cent of our services are provided in rural and regional WA. 


…   …   …


Our concern about our capacity to provide affordable services to the marginalised, in line with our mission, and at the same time generate a surplus to future-proof our services and continue to invest in capital infrastructure, which has come almost to a halt in the last few years, is significant. 


Reform of the aged-care sector is important. It should not be done in the way it is being done by this government.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:10):  I rise to make a shortened contribution to this debate on what could have been a significant opportunity for this government to deal with the real issues across the aged-care system. This focus-group-tested and press-release-happy-titled Living Longer Living Better aged-care reform package, announced on 20 April, is a package of five bills to give effect to the government's response to the Productivity Commission's report into caring for older Australians. 


A lot of comments have been made about rural and regional issues related to the provision of aged-care services, because there are some real concerns about the impact of this package on those services, on the people who use them and on the communities that support them. In regional Australia there are 1,225 residential aged-care providers, 1,100 of which have 60 or fewer beds, the number of beds being a figure that is generally used to define how viable a provider will be. In the Bendigo electorate, where my office is situated, over 17 per cent of the population is 65 years of age or older, which is above the average in my home state of Victoria. As is the case in other regional areas, available residential and home care services for the elderly are at below average levels. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has already mentioned, ageing in place is incredibly important for those who live in regional areas, because it is not only about the individual's wellbeing but also about the stability of community and the cohesiveness of our families. 


Again, this package of bills contained no detail. Providers and stakeholders were asked to comment on how the bills would affect them and the work that they do without being provided with any detail. Rural providers, throughout the brief consultation we were able to conduct into this package of bills, raised several challenges, including the relatively high cost of establishing and delivering services in rural areas; difficulties in attracting, retaining and professionally developing suitably qualified staff; the limited availability of medical practitioners; low-income asset value; distance; logistics of continuous care provision; and so on. 


I believe this package of bills fails to address the challenges faced by our rural providers. The early provisions which can potentially come into force on Monday next week will actually set the standards in efficiency within the Public Service. Good luck with that coming into effect! What we on our side know is that this is not about aged-care services; it is about buying votes. 


I participated in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. We travelled across the country in a very brief period of time. It is regrettable that sufficient time to consider this important legislation was further eroded by the majority of Labor and Greens senators, who voted to bring forward the reporting date of this committee from 17 June to 31 May. As I said, stakeholders have had limited time and the devil is always in the detail. 


Reform is required, and the majority of the sector actually supported the Productivity Commission's report, yet here we are with a grab bag of legislation that really only adopts less than 10 per cent of what the Productivity Commission sought to recommend. Obviously, though, the coalition as the champions of rural and regional Australia have made significant recommendations for how this package of bills could be made better for rural and regional areas, and that is outlined in our dissenting report.



But this government continues the rush to legislate without detail. The amendments moved by the coalition, by the Greens and by Senator Xenophon deserve greater scrutiny. We should be going into committee to do that, but—as usual—we are disrespected as senators. (Time expired)

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (10:35):  I seek leave to move a motion:


That the Senate notes:


The Australian Education Bill 2013 was debated in the House of Representatives for less than two hours; 


The government allowed just three days for a Senate inquiry into the bill and refused to allow time for hearings—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  I will see whether leave is granted first before you read it all out. I get the gist of what you are saying, and I think everyone else understands it.


Leave not granted.




Senator MASON:
  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Abetz from moving a motion to provide for consideration of matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the Australian Education Bill 2013 and a related bill.


The government is, of course, entitled to stand for re-election on whatever grounds it wants. It has chosen to stand for re-election on two signature policies: the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the so-called Gonski reforms. It is entitled to do that. The Prime Minister herself has said these are issues of legacy. These are the most significant policy changes in the areas of education and disability in the history of this country. She is entitled to do that. While the government is entitled to do that, the parliament of this country is entitled to scrutinise those proposals. This is what the opposition argues. 


The fact that the Australian Education Bill, known as the Gonski reforms, was debated in the House for less than two hours, that the inquiry was allowed just three days and that there are, indeed, 71 pages of amendments for the bill is absolutely obscene. We are talking about the expenditure of an enormous amount of money, and shortly we will go through the charade of the second reading speeches. Where will it really count? It will count in the committee stage. That is where we should be trawling through this legislation, because of its significance—and I acknowledge its significance—line by line. But we will not get there. The Senate will not be allowed do its job. 


We are concerned as to whether the reforms will even work. We are talking about $16.2 billion worth of expenditure. That is a lot of money. The opposition is concerned as to whether this will in fact make a difference. The government has already spent $20 billion on the Building the Education Revolution, computers in schools and various national partnerships. What has happened to our school results after the expenditure of $20 billion? The results have got worse: they are worse in the domestic tests and they are slipping in international comparative examinations. Our point is simply this: it is not that we do not think this area is important—of course it is; it is important to the future of our nation. We are concerned that, with that sort of expenditure—more than $16 billion over the next six years—this area of policy must be looked at. We are not convinced that the expenditure of this money is everything. We think that principal and school autonomy is just as important—perhaps even more important than the expenditure of this money; in other words, giving principals the power in many cases to determine who they have on their staff and for how long. We think that parental engagement is really critical. We want the community and the parents to be engaged in the educational life of children. We think that is even more important than the expenditure of this sort of money. We think this is extremely important for improved results. 


What about the huge debate about teacher quality? Whatever differences the opposition and the government may have on education, we now know—the results are in—that teacher quality is absolutely critical for educational results. We think there must be much more debate about that rather than spending $16½ billion without proper scrutiny. Curriculum is also absolutely critical to better educational outcomes. What we are going to do is spend all this money and change, in many significant ways, the red-tape arrangements and the relationships between states and the federal government. Why? Because we are told—take it on trust—that this will in fact lead to better educational outcomes for our children. 


Despite all the arguments about education I have had with those on the other side over the years, I have never doubted for one second the sincerity of the Prime Minister's commitment to raising the standard of education in this country. Not once, publicly or privately, have I doubted the sincerity of her commitment. What I dispute, however, is the merit of throwing $16 billion at this issue—and it is a very important issue—when it has not received proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Prime Minister is entitled to run for re-election on this policy. She is absolutely entitled to do that—but only if there has been proper scrutiny of how that money is going to be spent over the next six years. 


There are many policy, red-tape and very difficult federal-state relations issues which have to be resolved. Because of this ridiculous guillotining of this signature bill, the Senate is unable to do its job. (Time expired)

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (10:41):  Senator Mason, it is sad to see you attempt to carry out a stunt. You say you do not question the genuineness of the Prime Minister's commitment to education, yet you throw lines out about the government supposedly 'throwing' $16 billion at education. You know better than that.


You have asked for more time to deal with this legislation, yet, as I pointed out when we set up the time management motion, this bill has had a lengthy and detailed gestation. You might argue about the limitations on parliamentary time, yet the only person in Senate estimates asking questions about the amendments which were before us at that time was Senator McKenzie. The coalition did not use estimates time to deal with these issues. The amendments may not have been there earlier in the week, Senator Mason, but you had more than adequate time. You did not use estimates time to ask questions related to these measures.


I have already made the point about the necessity for time management. We did a calculation of how many bills we would have progressed in the last two sessions without time management. The answer was a dismal 12. That is how much work would occur without time management being utilised to deal with critical and important legislation—and this bill is. Indexation at the moment is 3.9 per cent. Next year it will drop to three per cent. Christopher Pyne might think he can delude people about these facts, but you know better, Senator Mason. You know that the AGSRC this year is 3.9 per cent. You know that. You know it is not six per cent and you know it is not 5.6 per cent; you know it is 3.9.

(
Senator Marshall
):  All senators should be aware that all their remarks should be addressed through the chair.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I am grateful for that reminder, Mr Acting Deputy President, to address my remarks through you—tempted as I am to respond to some of the cheap rhetoric and stunts perpetrated by the other side on the education reform process. Senator Mason normally knows better. That it is encouraged in this environment is astounding. I do not want to waste any more of the Senate's time dealing with a procedural motion like this. I do not want to eat into the hour and a half that has been allowed for this debate so that we can hear some substance from Senator Mason when he makes his speech. I would rather listen to him attempt to justify the cheap rhetoric that comes from Mr Pyne on these issues than waste more Senate time on procedural matters. On that basis, I move:


That the question be now put.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the question be now put.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (10:56):  We are debating the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. The Prime Minister has described the government's Gonski reforms as 'the biggest change to school education in 40 years', yet the Senate has been given only two hours and 45 minutes, or 165 minutes, to scrutinise and debate these bills. This is an insult to the Senate and it is an insult to the taxpayers, whom the government wants to saddle with a $16.2 billion bill for its reforms. That is 165 minutes to debate the expenditure of $16.2 billion.


The government is as careless with people's money as it is with the constitutional process of Senate scrutiny and Senate review. Of course, this is not the first time that the Senate has debated the Australian Education Bill. The difference is that the last time, a few months ago, we were debating a nine-page document which was short on detail and rich on platitudes and motherhood statements. It was more of a policy document, or an aspirational rhapsody, than detailed legislation. Now we have in front of us two bills and, sure, there is plenty of detail—I accept that. Yet there is not enough time to debate them properly on this the second or perhaps the third last day of sittings of the second term of the Rudd and Gillard governments.


The government has had years to get this done and to get it done properly. The Prime Minister—the then Minister for Education—has been talking for a long time about her desire to see a new school funding model. Mr David Gonski was commissioned in 2010 to look into it, he delivered his report in November 2011 and here we are today, more than a year and a half later, with less than three hours to debate bills that reflect a deeply flawed new funding model which has been rejected by many states and territories.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That is not true.




Senator MASON:
  Yes, it is. This farce provides a telling epitaph for the Labor government. Like the French Revolution, the government's Building the Education Revolution, which started with much promise and public enthusiasm, ends a year later in disillusionment and the guillotine. 


The Australian Education Bill 2013 establishes a new federal funding formula for non-government schools. It also amends the legislation to include funding arrangements for government schools but outlines different arrangements for government schools depending on whether their state government has agreed to those changes. Under the new system, all participating schools will be entitled to a base amount of funding for every student which will indexed annually. This will be the new schooling resource standard, colloquially known by the acronym SRS. Non-government schools will receive a percentage of the SRS amount based on the school's socioeconomic status score, which is referred to today as a 'capacity to contribute'. This capacity to contribute will not apply to government schools, special and special-assistance schools, sole-provider schools and schools with a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


In addition, students and schools will attract six different types of loadings: students with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, students with low socioeconomic status, students who have low English proficiency, schools that are not in major cities, and of course small-size schools. It sounds good, doesn't it? After six years of the Labor government, I shudder every time the government think they have a good idea. Even if, like broken clocks, they are sometimes right, the implementation is so often botched that it makes you wish that Labor had just stuck to bad ideas and stopped giving good ideas such a bad name.


In reality, there are numerous problems with Labor's attempt to implement school funding reforms recommended by Mr Gonski and his review. The shadow education minister, Mr Pyne, stakeholders in the Catholic and independent school sectors, as well as the governments of Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, have identified a number of them over the past few months. Some of these concerns are contained in the amendment I intend to move shortly at this second reading stage. There is the persistent concern about schools actually being worse off under the new funding system. The government maintains that no school will be worse off. State and territory governments beg to differ. According to them, around 469 government schools in Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory alone will lose out, never mind potentially hundreds of Catholic and independent schools. In my office in Brisbane, there have been many calls and much concern has been expressed, particularly by Catholic and independent schools, about whether they will be worse off, but in some cases even by government schools. Without any doubt and without any debate, concern has certainly been expressed—even the government would need to acknowledge that. They have yet to—how do I put this?—satisfy both government and non-government schools that none of them will be worse off. That is yet to be satisfied.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator MASON:
  That is correct. If anyone in the Labor Party thinks that every school sector in this country is convinced that they will not be worse off, that is incorrect. As I stand here in the Senate today, they still are. The funding inequities are not limited to bricks and mortar schools into our towns and cities. The Christian Education Ministries have highlighted what they see as the government's legislated underfunding of distance education school students in the non-government sector. This was an issue raised with me just the other day. Students receiving their education in this system only attract 35 per cent of the schooling resource standard, but, despite repeated attempts, the Christian Education Ministries are yet to receive an adequate explanation on how the government arrived at this figure. This is just an example—it is not the only one—of repeated concern amongst different school sectors in this country, particularly, I might add, in my home state of Queensland.


Of course, it does not help that throughout all this process the Gillard government has demonstrated a singular lack of transparency and openness. It is hard to reconcile the government's rhetoric and spin with what we are reading in the budget papers and what we actually know about the proposals. Take, for example, the Prime Minister's claim that $9.8 billion of additional funds will be required to transition to the new system over the next six years, between now and 2019, yet in the 2013-14 budget there is only $2.98 billion over the forward estimates, never mind that $2.1 billion of the $2.98 billion is not new money at all but merely various national partnerships that have been cut by the government and redirected towards financing Gonski, thus leaving only $880 million in genuine new money over the next four years.


Even with that $2.98 billion, the government remains short on its commitment—about $2.6 billion short, in fact—because, if we take the government at its word on the $9.8 billion over six years, the allocation over the forward estimates should be $5.6 billion. When I asked the education department officials at the budget estimates in June why there is only $2.98 billion in the budget when there should be $5.6 billion instead, they were confounded and did not explain. All this suggests that the government's reforms consist of a trickle of money right now and the promise of a windfall sometime way in the future. If you believe this government will give you billions of dollars sometime after the next two elections, then I have a nice bridge on Sydney Harbour to sell to you. The government has quite simply been making it up as it goes along, promising everyone money it does not have and, when these enticements are not enough, it promises some more money.


Then there is red tape—always a big favourite of this government. States, non-government authorities and individual schools will be required by regulation to provide extensive information to the federal government. Information requirements will include school census data, other data for the purposes of a new national collection regime to conduct research on school education, implementation plans, student reports to parents and other information about a school. State governments in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland all suggest that the National Plan for School Improvement extends the reach of the federal government into the operations of state schools and will result in further duplication and compliance and more red tape.


Last but not least, there is concern about proposals to change the capacity-to-contribute measure for non-government schools in the future. The bilateral agreement between the federal and New South Wales governments suggests that the federal government will review the socioeconomic status score—that methodology—by 2017 to ensure this remains the most appropriate means of assessing the relative educational advantage of non-government schools.


This agreement suggests that capacity to contribute will be defined as 'the anticipated level of private contribution will be based on a school's SES score until a new, individual measure of parental capacity to contribute is developed'. There is no mention of this new measure in the revised legislation. Just consider Labor's recent forays into class warfare and stirring up of class envy, and its deep-seated suspicion of, if not outright hostility to, non-government schools. Who could forget the infamous school 'hit list'? If I were a Catholic or an independent school, I would be very worried. The government should rule out the introduction of a new means test beyond 2017, but, of course, it will not do that.


These are all real and immediate problems with these two education bills. There are also deeper policy and philosophical problems with Labor's plans for our schools. The government's Gonski reforms are a typical social democratic measure. Labor has yet to find a problem that it could not throw money at. The money, of course, it does not have, and it has to borrow it. In this case, it is throwing tomorrow's children's money to supposedly fix today's children's problems. What evidence is there that more money will mean better schools? What is the evidence that more money will mean better schools and better educational outcomes? Ben Jensen, the director of the Grattan Institute School Education Program noted that:


Despite its strengths, the Gonski review retells the same old, and failed, story of Australian education: that the only way to fix our schools is to spend more money and to change the way it is divided between schools and students.


…   …   …


Supporters of Gonski claim it is a 'once in a generation opportunity'. That will be true only if the money is well spent. If it is spent the way education money is being spent in the past, it will be a complete waste—and risk dooming further reform efforts for a generation.


Across the past decade, education spending has increased by nearly three times as much as Gonski is proposing, yet our school performance has stagnated or has fallen.


Mr Jensen is merely echoing a growing international consensus which now acknowledges that there is little or no relationship between spending per student and student outcomes and that other factors, such as teacher quality, parental involvement, principal and school autonomy, as well as a robust curriculum, play a far greater role in giving children a quality education—a far greater role in giving kids a better education.


For Labor, it is not about the outcomes, certainly not medium- and long-term outcomes, but about short-term political advantage. 'We care about education,' says the Labor Party. 'Look how much money we are spending. Please re-elect us, because we're throwing all this money at the issue.' In reality, Labor are like a deadbeat dad who blew all the money on booze and smokes and who now breaks his baby girl's piggy bank, steals the money and uses it to buy her a bike to show how much he loves her. That is what has happened to the Labor Party.


If the government throws another $5 billion, $10 billion or $15 billion at schools, will it actually make any difference? Past experience is not very encouraging. Over the past six years, in addition to all the recurrent spending, Labor has already spent over $20 billion on computers in schools, the school halls program and various national partnerships. Did all that money make our system any better? Did that extra $20 billion make our kids smarter, improve their literacy or numeracy, or help them acquire new knowledge and new skills? Did it? Judging by both domestic and international results, the answer is a resounding 'No!' The 2012 NAPLAN results show that literacy and numeracy, as measured in years 3, 5, 7 and 9, have been, for all intents and purposes, stagnant since 2008. Yes, there have been some slight improvements here and there, some up and down, but, overall, very little improvement. Even the minister, Mr Garrett, was forced to acknowledge in December last year that:


There shouldn't be a single education minister in the states nor a single senior state education bureaucrat who can take any comfort from these NAPLANs.


Neither, by the way, should the minister and the federal bureaucracy, which so far have managed to get no bang whatsoever for their $20 billion bucks, just a very expensive whimper.


If NAPLAN results are discouraging, how do we, as a nation, compare to other developed countries, including our regional neighbours and our competitors? The answer is also, unfortunately, not that great. Take the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which tests 15-year-old students on their preparedness to use the knowledge and skills they have gained at school to meet real-life challenges. The latest PISA results show that Australian students are making no progress and, in some cases, are actually going backwards. For example, the 2009 results show a 13-point drop in reading performance compared to 2000. Or take the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, which revealed that a quarter of Australia's year 4 students fail to meet the minimum standard in reading for their age. In that test, Australia ranked 27th out of 48 countries in reading, on a similar level to New Zealand, Poland and Lithuania. Or take the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, which shows our students stagnating for years and years, while, at the same time, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan have experienced dramatic improvements, and even the United States has shown a steadier improvement in performance.


So, what is the answer? What is Labor's answer? It is: 'We have spent $20 billion already in an education revolution, all for no results, so let's just now spend another $16 billion on top of that in the Gonski reforms.' All of us want our schools to be well-resourced, but we also know that money is not necessarily the only answer, particularly considering the random, wasteful and unaccountable manner in which Labor tends to throw it at any given problem it sees.


The two bills we are debating today represent a deeply flawed proposal which substitutes another cash splash for serious educational reform. It promises schools money the government does not have in two elections from now. It claims to be better and fairer than the old system. Yet it leaves hundreds if not thousands of government and non-government schools worse off. Labor has once again managed to achieve the impossible by taking an important area of public policy and turning it into a debacle of historic proportions. In fact, to paraphrase the Prime Minister, it is the biggest debacle in school education in 40 years.


I have circulated the amendment in my name on behalf of the coalition. The amendment calls on the Senate to note the need for the government to provide certainty that individual schools will not be left worse off under the new arrangements, and the importance of more transparency regarding the financial impact of the proposed arrangements. The amendment also calls on the Senate to note its concern with parts of the National Plan for School Improvement that increase the federal interference in the operation of state government and Catholic schools by micromanaging schools and, of course, increasing red tape, and with proposals to change the capacity to contribute measure for non-government schools into the future.


This has been a debacle, not because the intention of the government is not good, but simply because, like so many good ideas that the government thinks they have, the implementation has been and will be a shambles. I move:


At the end of the motion, add: ""but the Senate:


(a) notes:


   (i) the need for the Government to provide certainty that individual schools will not be left worse off under the new arrangements, and


   (ii) the importance of more transparency regarding the financial impact of the proposed arrangements; and


(b) further notes its concern about:


   (i) parts of the National Plan for School Improvement, which have the effect of micromanaging schools or increasing red-tape, and the increased federal interference in the operations of state government and Catholic schools; and


   (ii) proposals to change the capacity to contribute measure for non-government schools in the future.""

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:16):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. To the extent that they establish a framework for needs based funding of schools in Australia the Australian Greens commend these two pieces of legislation. The Australian Greens believe that education is the foundation of democracy, and a well-resourced, public education system striving for excellence is the guarantee of a healthy and fair society. It is the right of all children to have access and opportunity to high-quality and affordable education and for their parents to expect as much. The public system is the only guarantee of this right.


The Greens have argued for a decade that our national funding model needs to be changed to make it fairer, to make sure that public education is properly funded throughout Australia and to invest billions more in education commensurate with the funding of our peers in other developed countries. In an increasingly divided community, where people's destinies are often determined by their postcodes, quality public education can be a unifying force. It fosters connection and understanding by bringing together children who would otherwise always move in different orbits. It can be the lifeline for all kids, whoever they are, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances, to achieve their full potential and to be the best they can be. It is also recognised that, as one of the best financial investments a nation can make, higher education standards and outcomes for everyone will enhance our country's human capital and increase skills, innovation and productivity in our community. We believe that a principled, transparent and enduring schools funding model, where public money is fairly prioritised according to need, is necessary to ensure a world-quality public school system that is accessible to all children no matter what their background or circumstances. It is true that this legislation does not go as far towards establishing that model as we believe is necessary, but it is certainly a big step in the right direction, and it is the most important educational funding reform in Australia in decades. Needs based funding is necessary to ensure public schools are funded to provide a world-class education for any student regardless of their background.


The Gonski review of funding for schooling was commissioned to devise an optimal education funding model. The Gonski review concluded that our current system is opaque, complex and inequitable with disadvantage concentrated in particular schools, predominantly government schools, which educate the lion's share of students with disadvantage. Gonski recommended a needs based funding model and a substantial increase in national education funding of $5 billion per year, which has subsequently been increased for inflation to $6.5 billion per year. Despite the coalition's disparagement about the need for money and throwing money at the problem, it was a universal consensus recommendation of the Gonski review that, indeed, Australia's funding of our national education system was lagging behind those of our peers in the developed world.


It is ludicrous to suggest that this is not about money. It is about many things. It is about more than money, but it is certainly about money as well. Why is it otherwise that the wealthy schools are not offering to give the money back that they receive? Because, of course, it is about money. Having visited schools across Australia, it has been very clear to me that those disadvantaged public schools could do so much more if they had more resources available to them to enhance the educational opportunities of those students from disadvantage that they educate so well already.


The Gonski review also concluded that an independent and expert national schools resourcing body should determine the applicable schooling resource standards. The Australian Greens strongly regret that this legislative framework fails to provide for this body. Such a body, independent of governments and the various sectors and interests that characterise education debates in Australia, could provide the core of the governance necessary to ensure that funding for schooling is provided in a way that maximises its educational impact and minimises self-interest and sectoral interests, as are often advocated by the main players in the system. An independent national schools resourcing body would develop, maintain, review and index the schooling resource standards and associated loadings to provide for currency and effectiveness. The Australian Greens lament the fact that this key component of the model that the Gonski review devised is missing from the legislation.


Another key recommendation of the Gonski review is that, in the case of the non-government sector, the assessment of a school's need for public funding should consider the capacity of the parents who enrol their children in the school to contribute financially towards the school's resource requirements. A genuine needs based funding model would ensure that all resources of a school are taken into account in determining need.


Such an approach needs to be carefully implemented—there is considerable diversity in the existing private contribution among non-government schools—however, the Gonski review concluded that this is achievable in developing a new framework subject to other funding parameters and transitional arrangements. I will be moving a second reading amendment to encapsulate the points that I have been making.


The Australian Greens have two substantive amendments to the Australian Education Bill. The first relates to yearly reporting obligations, which provide for transparency in how public funds are distributed within a system and moves these from the draft regulations into the legislation. This would require schools to report their resources—their assets, income, fees and other aspects—as an essential element of transparency and accountability in the context of needs based funding. We wish to embed this in legislation rather than leave it in a regulation and run the risk of it being undone by a future coalition government which has not yet acknowledged that there is an inequity at the heart of our current schools funding system, as was identified by the Gonski review. 


This would also ideally overcome the risk of money being dissipated within bureaucracies before it arrives at the gates of the schools where it is most sorely needed. We also propose an independent review of the education funding model that this bill established, commencing in 2018.


The second Australian Greens amendment would simply require non-government schools to comply with antidiscrimination law. Equality is a core principle underpinning Australia's modern, proud democracy. Any school which is in receipt of large amounts of public funding should not have recourse to the exemption provisions set out in sections 37 and 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which allow it to discriminate against Australians at will. 


The fact is that there are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex students in every education system in Australia, including religious schools. Sadly, recent research shows that the situation with respect to homophobia and homophobic abuse in schools is not improving. And systemic discrimination—discrimination upheld by social institutions and governments—legitimises such incidents. On the other hand, it is well established that policy protections for people's rights are associated with decreased risks of experiencing homophobic violence and decreased risks of self-harm and suicide rates.


In formulating this education reform, the government has taken the opportunity to increase policy requirements for schools, including more information gathering, and submitters to the inquiry on this bill noted that the architecture of the Australian Education Bill gives the Commonwealth the potential to exercise a high degree of control over the way in which government, Catholic and independent education systems and schools deliver education to Australian students.


The Australian Greens believe that this education reform package is an opportunity to bring school standards on discrimination into line with community standards, and set a benchmark for protecting people's rights. This is a great opportunity for Australia to align itself squarely with international human rights standards. It is very clear to the Australian Greens that if an organisation is receiving public funding to provide a service the Australian public has the right to expect it to abide by basic, widely held community standards and antidiscrimination principles. 


Those are the two substantive amendments the Australian Greens will be moving. I move the Australian Greens second reading amendment in the terms circulated in the chamber. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Senator Wright, just to clarify the procedure here, we have a second reading amendment here before us, which we will need to deal with. Once that is dealt with you can move your amendment and we will deal with yours. That is all going to happen, as I understand it, at one o'clock. It will be put at one o'clock, after Senator Mason's. I am saying that just so that you are clear about where we are travelling here.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:27):  This plan before our chamber today to fix the inequities in our education system has been needed in this nation for a very long time. We have had rampant inequity and inequality take hold, with no plan to address that until now. I am very pleased to say that, through the Gonski review, this Labor government has been working very hard on getting the solutions in place.


The inequality has been a great cost to the nation, and it is time to do something about it. It is time for this parliament to do something about it. That is why it is very important that these changes pass this week. When you look at the impact of inequality on our nation, it is profound. Today, the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians own 61 per cent of the nation's wealth and the poorest 20 per cent own just one per cent. This is something that is reflected, also, in our education systems. 


We are a good deal less equal than countries such as Japan, Sweden and Norway, which have education systems that are also far more equal. We are one of the most unequal developed countries—keeping company with the US and Britain. This inequality is embedded in our nation's education system. So addressing inequality in education is certainly a key to fixing our education system. On that note, what we know from looking at education around the globe is that education systems that are more equal—systems that remove the inequality and give all students an opportunity—have much better educational outcomes. It is proven, globally, that this is the fact: nations that have more equal education systems do better. They have much better education outcomes overall and as a whole. 


The current inequality comes at a great cost. We have needed a plan to fix this for a long time. A lot of the inequalities in our education system have been driven by the way our education system is funded, and it is time it was fixed. I am very proud to have the opportunity to do that in this place today. I note that when this plan passes some 60 per cent of the nation's students will be covered. But I think it is important that we see this nation realise 100 per cent coverage. On that note, I really want to see Western Australia come into this scheme. It is critical because, while WA is reasonably well resourced—we are, as a whole, closer to the student resource standard than some other states are—the most disadvantaged schools in my home state do not meet the resource standard put forward in this model. To my National Party colleagues across the chamber: it is rural and regional students that are currently the most disadvantaged in Western Australia. These are the students that would benefit from being brought into this model.


The Labor government is serious about education reform in Australia. It is about time we had a fair funding system in place so that every school, regardless of their state, regardless of the sector they are in and regardless of location—including rural and regional schools, schools in remote communities and schools in disadvantaged suburbs—get the money they need to do a great job. The cost of inequality is great. I would like to quote Dr Carmen Lawrence, who has been a significant contributor to the discussion around education equity and who was on the Gonski review. She said, in an article in The Monthlylast year:


In Australia, almost 80% of students from the lowest quarter of socioeconomic disadvantage attend government schools. The drift of students and resources from government to non-government schools has accelerated here in the last decade or so and further concentrated wealthier students in the private sector. As a result, there are more schools with very high proportions of students from disadvantaged backgrounds – mainly in the government system – and more with high concentrations of the most advantaged – mainly in private schools.


This is not about class warfare, as the opposition claims. It is not about envy—far from it. Far from it being about the politics of envy, it is about all parents wanting the best for their children. It is about making sure that no child in this country in the school that they are in is getting left behind. Parents want choice, but some parents have no choice. Choices are being taken away by the inequities in our education system. It is time to make sure those students are not left behind. I will give you a very clear example of how our country's students are being left behind. Dr Lawrence went on to say in this article:


In one country town in Western Australia, the local government high school lost ground dramatically after four private schools were opened; the most disadvantaged children were left behind with fewer teachers per student than in the new private schools. The total cost of education in the community skyrocketed, without any aggregate improvement in children's scores on routine tests.


I am not saying that it is a bad thing for new schools to be opened in communities—far from it. I am saying that it is absolutely immoral to leave behind students who have no education choices, to leave behind those schoolchildren who inevitably have less choice in education. Every student in this country deserves that choice. Parents making hard economic decisions in their households deserve the choice between a good private school and a good government school. That is the option that we should be giving students and families in this country.


One in 12 Australian students is currently not meeting minimum standards in reading, writing and maths in our country. We have a good deal of these students in WA, so I really want to see Western Australia become part of this plan. I think the plan has the potential to see our classrooms in the top five in the world by 2025, because it is a plan to properly resource all schools, all our children, teachers and classrooms, for generations to come. It is something that will see the bedrock of education in this country meet the kinds of quality standards that we expect—quality standards that are comparable with the best performing countries around the globe. Without these reforms before us, there is no plan to do that. The National Plan for School Improvement includes a new funding approach to make sure we get these things right. It responds to the problems in the system. In our plan, every state and every sector will see increased funding and more support for students in the classroom.


I note that Senator Mason is looking for a guarantee that no school will be worse off. We have made that commitment. As a bare minimum, we want every school in Australia to receive its current funding plus indexation of three per cent. This is not a competition between education sectors. We simply want to make sure that no student gets left behind. Schools that need more support to support their students will get it, irrespective of sector. We are prepared to guarantee this, and we are asking the states and territories to do the same.


Today, I ask Mr Colin Barnett to do the same for Western Australia's students. He now has but a few days left to sign up to this deal. He has to get it lined up by 30 June to make sure that Western Australian schools also have the opportunity of fixing the problems in our education system. The plan that we have before us responds to the needs of states, like WA, who have higher costs attached to delivering education in our system. As I said before, where the problems are in WA, where we fail to meet the student resource standard, is, most profoundly, in disadvantaged communities and in rural and regional areas.


This is where the funding under this model is targeted. It is a great benefit for Western Australia and it is time, in my view, for Senator Barnett to accept this offer. It is time for all schools in Western Australia to benefit from a fairer and more stable school funding system. Under the offer that we have made to Western Australia that is embedded in the plan before us, we have total funding growth for WA of $2.8 billion, which would make a massive difference to Western Australian students.


I am pleased that the offer was increased, because the $922 million that is on the table will go a very long way. There is $922 million under the current investment plan and then we have got the indexation, which will also see funding in Western Australia continuing to grow. This indexation needs to be locked in by both the Commonwealth and the states coming to an agreement. The Commonwealth is making a commitment to indexation of 4.7 per cent and we are asking the states to commit to three per cent so that both the states and the Commonwealth are playing their part in seeing education funding grow in our country.


We want all sectors to have the extra resources for our nation's schools that need it. I do not think school principals and teachers around Western Australia think locking in funding growth of around $2.8 billion is a bad deal. It is a good deal, it is a well-targeted deal and it will make an enormous difference to Western Australian schools. It makes good sense for WA.


I note that a decrease in funding would have occurred under the previous model when it stopped. WA will receive the same funding guarantee that we gave to New South Wales. That means every year they will receive an increase in base funding. What we have currently is a very volatile education funding system. The model introduced by the previous government sees indexation declining by a further three per cent. This means Western Australian schools have more funding year on year on year and have more certainty and more confidence about funding. So schools in Western Australia will be benefiting from this new suite of reforms if they come on board—and it is high time that Western Australia did. All schools in WA need to move on to a needs based funding model, consistent with the school-resource standard, to make sure that students in Western Australia do not get left behind.


I would like to contrast that with what we have before us in the opposition's non-plan for education. The education spokesperson for the coalition, Christopher Pyne, has confirmed that the coalition want to keep in place a broken school-funding model that could see up to $5.4 million cut from Australian children. He has dismissed the findings of the Gonski review, which was very strongly welcomed, right around the country, by the education community. I know this from talking to the Primary Principals Association, where principals from all three sectors—Catholic, independent and government—work together. They all told me the system is broken and that they are committed to seeing progress made on these questions. They are working across sectors to say, 'Yes, the system is broken, and we want to be part of the solutions.' But Mr Pyne has not listened to schools and parents around the country. In fact, the coalition has a plan to sack one in seven teachers, squeeze more children into classrooms and slash funding to disadvantaged schools. Mr Pyne has said that teaching quality would be his highest priority. I cannot see how that can possibly be the case, because the coalition has in fact announced that it would cut $425 million out of the Teacher Quality National Partnership. They said that in the 2010 federal election. So if that is how Christopher Pyne treats his main priority, how will he treat the rest of the education system?


I want to acknowledge the amendments moved by the Greens. These amendments would create legal uncertainty in respect of the affected parts of the bill and include in the bill matters that the government thinks are better addressed in regulations. I also note that putting these information requirements into the act, rather than leaving them to regulations, would likely increase the complexity of the act, and that is something the government does not support. Further, one of the government's key concerns is that there has been considerable buy-in from different parts of the education sector—from government schools, from non-government schools and from Catholic and independent schools—to get them to support these reforms and to get their support for a path forward and, at this stage, the government thinks these amendments would represent a threat to the goodwill that we have generated in terms of being able to move forward on these very important questions. That is why the government will not be supporting these amendments. The government also has concerns that this level of detail in the primary legislation would limit the capacity to amend the requirements to respond to the changing needs of the bill through future regulations, because it will start to create contradictions between the act and the regulations.


In closing, I want to say that we cannot let this current broken system continue. It is doing a great disservice to the nation's students. It is driving inequities in our education system and it is driving down education standards. It leaves hundreds and thousands of young Australians behind, many in government schools but also in schools in the Catholic and independent sector, who will get extra resources under these reforms, all of whom deserve the resources and support that come with this legislation.


We know, on the other hand, that Mr Christopher Pyne and Mr Tony Abbott have no alternative plan for school funding that fixes these inequities, only a plan to maintain a broken system that is doing a great disservice to our nation's children, maintaining a broken system that will see schools lose $16 billion in six years. No school will be worse off under the current model, they say. That is not true, as the current system sees many schools go backwards, especially the most needy, and that is what we aim to address in this parliament today. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:46):  I too rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. But before I do that, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, can I firstly just acknowledge, as you are in the chair this morning, the enormous contribution that you have made to the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Thank you.




Senator KROGER:
  This is your third-last day in the Commonwealth parliament. Those of us who have worked with you on committees and have been working with you in this chamber have high regard for your professionalism, the depth of your appreciation of so many issues, the breadth of your knowledge in relation to the processes of this place and particularly, may I say, your respect for and empathy with so many communities, particularly the Indigenous community. I know that you have taken the opportunity—probably rightfully so—at times to educate me on your perspectives on that. Congratulations for your time and your contributions, and all the best following the end of this 43rd Parliament.




Senator Mason:
  Hear, hear!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Thank you very much.




Senator KROGER:
  I turn to the bills. It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on these bills, because education is an issue that I have had a lifelong passion for. In fact, it was an issue that I raised in my first speech in this place. I spoke at length about my particular personal passion in relation to education and what we provide for all those young people coming through the school system and on to tertiary education. Not only do I speak in terms of the coalition's perspective and my personal perspective on this but I would also like to be a voice for the people—I was trying to think whether I should term it as hundreds or thousands; like so many, I have been contacted by probably now thousands who are either principals or schoolteachers, and certainly parents—who have all expressed their enormous concern about these education bills. They have written to us, called and actually visited me in my electorate office. We have spent considerable time listening to the concerns of those who are caught up in the education process, whether that is as a stakeholder—that is, as a family, as parents who have children going through the system—or as those who seek to pursue a career in the education sector. So many have expressed their concerns, and it is as much for them that I speak today as their voice in expressing their concerns on these bills.


In my first speech in this place, I reflected on my parents' interest in and passion for education and how they taught me that education is the No. 1 equaliser in society. It is actually access to education and choice of education that provide an opportunity to give people a hand up in life, not a handout. That is why it is of such critical concern to us in the coalition, and it is why we have been so consistent over the years—and I refer to the former Howard government period. It is why we spent so much time and had such a priority in this area to ensure that strong education standards applied to all within Australia.


I have to say that on a personal basis I think that one of the great things that we should be considering is having a system whereby a fiscal amount, if you like, is applied and assigned to an individual child regardless of where that child is educated so that the parents themselves have the opportunity to choose which school is in the best interest of their children and, more importantly, which schools reflect the values and principles of the way in which those families wish to raise their children. But that is an argument for another day.


I will briefly reflect on my parents, though, because I think this is a great example. My brother and sister and I were the first in our family who were offered private education. We were the first in our extended family who went to private schools. Interestingly, though, the three of us did not go to the same school. My parents determined that each of us had different requirements and different needs, and they determined that different schools would bring out the best in us and suit us in very different ways. That is a very relevant example, certainly for me, of where different schools and the different principles applied at those schools supported individuals in different ways. It is the parents—only the parents—who can determine what education system best suits their own children. So any education public policy introduced or mandated by a government should be very cognisant of that fact.


It is a crying shame that, on the third last day of the 43rd Parliament, these bills are numbered 23rd and 24th of 55 bills to be guillotined. It is an absolute crying shame, as Senator Mason alluded to when he sought to suspend standing orders so that we could debate this longer. It is an absolute travesty for us all that in the House they only had two hours to look at, scrutinise and deal with these bills. We just heard from Senator Pratt. These are bills that the government themselves believe are absolutely critical to the long-term future of all Australians. Why are the government only allowing two hours in the House and less time here in the Senate for us to debate a public policy which they have proposed and which they, the government, have suggested is so important to them? Without wanting to influence those who might be listening to this broadcast and without wanting to influence those who would make their own minds up on this, I think the facts stand for themselves.


It is an absolute tragedy that the committee inquiry into this only went for three days. For something as significant and as comprehensive as this, only three days were allowed to examine the implications of the introduction of the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. This is just too serious to play politics with. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of a rushed public policy, rushed politics, serving an agenda other than the one we should be critically concerned about: the future of our youth in Australia.


I also suggest that the government are being quite misleading when they keep on referring to these measures, loosely—I do say loosely—as being part of the Gonski recommendations. The one person we have not heard from since these bills have been formulated for us to consider is the esteemed David Gonski himself. He is not associating himself with these bills. What he did was undertake a very comprehensive review and make a number of recommendations, and the government have cherry-picked aspects of that review and incorporated them in these bills. It is very deceptive to suggest that this is the conclusion of all the recommendations made in the review, because that is far from the truth.


We know that because the Gonski review called for no less than $6.5 billion in new funding each and every year. That is $6½ billion in each and every year, to a total of over $39 billion. Let's put that into some sort of context. What are we looking at here? Labor has promised $9 billion by 2019, which is six years away. There is a dramatic difference between what Mr David Gonski recommended by way of an injection of funds towards the restructure of the education sector and what we see before us.


As Senator Mason commented earlier, the issue here—and this applies to absolutely every issue that the government touch—is that they think, if you throw a bucketload of cash at something and make a huge injection of cash, that will produce the best outcome for whatever area it is. It is such a typically Labor and Greens' view that the solution for absolutely everything put before us is to throw money at it. I would proffer that that is not the solution. Whether under the former Rudd government or under the current Gillard government, there is example after example where throwing good money after bad did not return good public policy. It did not come up with the outcome. We only have to go back and look at the school halls that were built across the country in a flurry. Some $14.5 billion was thrown at building new school halls.


In fact, I visited a number of schools during the construction program. One small school in a small country town in northern Victoria that had fewer than 200 students had $1 million directed to building a new edifice for the Gillard government. They said that in the history of the town they had never seen such a cash flow into their small country town—this was $1 million. If you translate that across fewer than 200 students it does not take much to work out whether or not that was an effective way to increase the education outcomes for each of those children. I have to say that the parents I met at the school on that day were highly questioning of the appropriateness of the way in which that was being delivered. They said, 'If the government wants to throw $1 million at us we are hardly going to say no to it.' The point was that there was no real belief that it was going to change the education outcomes.


That is just one example. Look at the computers in schools program. Every student would have a computer on their desk. When Prime Minister Gillard was education minister, we remember that. It changed over time. How did that improve the standards of the kids? Not one person on the other side of the chamber could attest to the fact that this program in any way demonstrably increased the education outcomes for those students. We have already seen $14.5 billion—we are talking here about $9 billion by 2019—spent in building structures with no suggestion that this has in any way improved the education outcome of a single student. If the government is serious about increasing education outcomes for all Australian students they would have had a far more comprehensive and appropriate look at the way in which they do it. History suggests that this is not going to be the case.


The federal budget impact shows that we are actually looking at a $315 million reduction in school funding over the forward estimates for the next four years. I have with me some four pages listing Victorian schools and the way they will be affected by this funding decision. They will be dramatically affected by this funding arrangement.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator KROGER:
  I would be delighted to take the interjection I have just heard across the chamber, because I would like to ask why it is that small Catholic schools with very low funding thresholds are able to deliver higher education standards than so many other schools that have a higher and stronger funding model. There are many Catholic schools and independent schools operating on small and tight budgets that successfully come up with good education outcomes. In my mind there is one real reason for that: it is to do with teacher quality. During the recently concluded 'Teaching and learning—maximising our investment in Australian schools' Senate inquiry—and, Madam Acting Deputy President, you participated in this inquiry—we heard about the critical role of the teachers in terms of the education outcomes of the kids; it is by raising the standard of the teachers and actually rewarding them and rewarding the very good, effective and committed teachers who have the greatest impact on the students. During the inquiry you will recall a young man, a refugee, who I think was from a school in Cranbourne, Victoria, who was so concerned about marginalisation within the school that he took it upon himself, with the support of teachers, to run programs within the school. This was out of left field. It was the teachers themselves who identified the strength of what he was doing and supported him. It has made a difference to that school today.


I hate to say it, but this policy is not worth the paper it is printed on. The government is a disgrace. This is another public policy that should be tossed out the door. (Time expired)

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-06-26,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:06):  I rise to speak about the Australian Education Bill 2013. The education bill is to be commended for identifying five key areas needing reform. There is no doubt that education reform is necessary. Teaching standards need to be improved. Some students are missing out on a quality education. More opportunities must be provided for students with disabilities. The objectives are praiseworthy. But there is no consensus that the Australian Education Bill provides a solution.


This bill has caused enormous dissension in the community. It has created a division between primary and secondary schooling and tertiary education by stealing from Peter to pay Paul. The increased funding to schools is at the expense of the university sector. This has alienated both the vice-chancellors and the Tertiary Education Union.


There are still many unanswered questions in relation to primary and secondary education. I have had overwhelming representation from constituents concerned that their questions relating to the bills have not been answered by the minister, despite representation from parents, schools and organisations as significant as the Catholic Education Office. The Catholic education sector is responsible for educating 23 per cent of Australian students. It does so on 90 per cent of what is spent per capita on students in government schools. This 90 per cent comprises government funding and parental fee contribution. These schools still have questions in relation to funding under these bills. A considerable number of its schools are disadvantaged and in low-socioeconomic areas. There is clearly a need to provide additional funding to close this gap between Catholic schools and government schools. Further, there is no guarantee that government funding to Catholic schools will keep pace with the cost of educating children in government schools.


While the bills propose higher levels of funding for students with disabilities, this must be guaranteed for all students, regardless of the school that they attend. It is not clear to parents or to schools as to how these bills will assist students in Australian schools. It is not clear as to how this will occur through increasing the level of government bureaucracy. What is needed is a real improvement in teacher education so that the needs of all students can be met. Educational theory outlines many modes of learning and assessment. Despite this, focus on teaching and assessment is becoming narrower, as evidenced by NAPLAN testing, which ignores the needs of visual, manual and practical learning. Most schools have responded by narrowing their teaching to drilling students in order to maximise NAPLAN results.


Interestingly, those schools that have improved their NAPLAN performance are those that have broadened their curriculums along the lines of inquiry based learning. One of these schools is a Catholic school in a low-socioeconomic area in Ballarat. All teachers need training to identify even common learning issues such as dyslexia, which affects 10 per cent of students in schools. Teachers need to be trained in appropriate strategies to assist these students. Until this happens, many students will continue to disengage from the education system because it does not meet their needs.


The answer to improving education is more diversity and broader choices in education. One of the aims of these bills is to empower school leadership. Again, it is hard to imagine how this will occur when schools are burdened with additional bureaucracy and greater compliance measures. These bills, combined with the introduction of a national curriculum, can potentially narrow schooling and education choices. What is needed is imagination and innovation.


One way of encouraging diversity is to give families more choice in the type of education provided to their children rather than simply a system that concentrates power in the hands of the federal government. A voucher system or tax credits to parents to enable them to choose their child's school would both empower parents and promote excellence in education. The schools providing appropriate and targeted education would receive greater patronage.


The UK has moved in the direction of community involvement and community responsibility for education by the mutualisation of schools. The schools are run by stakeholders—parents, teachers and even students—who have a direct interest in the outcomes. It is early days but such innovations are showing great promise. We do not need more of the same. We do not need more bureaucracy. We do not need greater federal control of education. I will not be supporting these bills.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:12):  I rise to make some comments on the legislation before us today. The amended Australian Education Bill 2013 and related bills establish a new federal funding model formula for non-government schools. The legislation has also been amended to include different funding arrangements for government schools dependent on whether their state government has agreed to the changes. The states and territories, as we all know, have until 30 June to agree to the new school funding model. Only New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia have entered into an agreement with the federal government to date.


Under the schooling resource standard, all participating schools—and all non-government schools are deemed to be participating schools—are entitled to a base amount of funding for every student. The base amount of funding per primary student is $9,271 and per secondary student is $12,193. The SRS amount is indexed annually by three per cent.


I will confine my remarks to a shorter period of time today to leave as much time as possible for other colleagues to make contributions, given that we are being guillotined and are ceasing this debate at one o'clock. The fact that we have such a limited time—as other colleagues have said—to debate these bills is absolutely deplorable. It comes back to the fact that this government has no ability not only to run the country properly but to run the chamber and the process of parliament properly. This does an absolute disservice to particularly our families and students around this nation, who deserve to have the parliament be given the opportunity to properly scrutinise this legislation.


And it has indeed been a shambolic process. In 2012, the original Australian Education Bill was just nine pages long. It contained myriad motherhood statements. The amended legislation being rushed through the parliament is now 129 pages long. We simply cannot give this new legislation that is before us an appropriate level of scrutiny in the short amount of time available.


And it is a shambolic process. We have only three of the states lined up, as I said. They have until 30 June to agree or disagree with the federal government about whether or not they are going to sign up. Yet we see the legislation coming before the parliament today to be finalised. It is a completely shambolic process. And Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory still have real concerns. I understand that Tasmania has concerns about the power that is going to sit with the federal minister, and I understand that is on the record. I will make some brief comment on the position of New South Wales. My good friend the minister in New South Wales, Adrian Piccoli, has indeed signed up—in good faith, from his New South Wales perspective. But from my perspective as a federal senator I have to look at the entire nation and how this piece of legislation is going to affect all states and territories.


This is all far too late—this last-minute rush. We are talking about an incredibly and complicated new process to be applied to our schools through this piece of legislation, and this model is to begin on 1 January 2014. That is an extraordinary ask on those schools, and on those who run the schools—who, as I understand it, say that this type of process normally takes 12 to 18 months to bed down. Yet, because of the shambolic nature of this government, we are now looking at a mere few months by which this model is supposed to be in place. But look at this government's history of implementing policy. Perhaps if it had been a government—as my good colleague the shadow minister, the member for Sturt in the other place, said—that had a track record of good delivery of good policy, we might perhaps not be quite so concerned about the short time frame. But think about this government's history—and I keep using the word 'shambolic', because it is the one I find most appropriate—of policy implementation, such as the pink batts debacle, the absolute disaster of the overpriced school halls and the snap ban of the live export trade; in terms of a policy disaster, that one has to be one of the worst we have seen from this government—but that is a discussion for another day.


So on this side of the chamber we certainly do not have any confidence that this government can have this model implemented, have this policy properly run through by the due date of 1 January. Interestingly, in the Gonski report we saw that $6½ billion was supposed to go to this. Over the forward estimates, over the four years, the expectation then would be $26 billion. But what we have actually seen from this government over the forward estimates is a $325 million cut. Then we are supposed to believe that this is going to turn into some sort of river of gold—$7.8 billion—in years 5 and 6. Again, on this side of the chamber we just have no confidence in this government that they will be able to either (a) deliver the model in time or (b) deliver the funding that is indeed necessary.


And the lack of clarity that we have seen continues. There has been a lot of confusion and concern in the community. Through the Senate estimates process I have tried over a long period of time now, as has my very good colleague Senator Mason, to ascertain some detail as to how this model is going to work. And I have to say, until very recently there was very, very little information. There is now, of course, some information in the amendments—on the loadings and the relevant definitions for regional and remote schools—and also information available on the Better Schools website. But there is still a real difficulty in deciphering how the new funding system will actually operate—how it is going to translate into dollar terms for individual schools. And there is still a lot of confusion in the school sector as to what the funding changes actually mean.


In the recent budget estimates I asked where I personally could go to see the actual impact on regional schools—my specific area of interest—and was told that anyone trying to decipher the impact of the changes would have to know the school's current finances, size, location and so on and then refer to the complex amendments to the bill and apply some very confusing formulas. So it is not at all surprising that there is a pervasive belief out there in the community that there is still such a lack of clarity around this.


The Council of Catholic School Parents and the NSW Parents' Council indicated earlier in June that it is an overly complex, convoluted model that lacks transparency, that they cannot see what the school's actual funding is. The president of the NSW Parents' Council, Stephen Grieve, said:


If a doctor of mathematics cannot understand the model and what funding our children will get next year, how are parents meant to comprehend the bill?


I think that is one of the real flaws: we do not have the transparency necessary to see how this is going to operate. Unfortunately, words of comfort and surety from the government just do not cut it on this side of the chamber, because we simply do not have the confidence in this government that what they are saying will actually happen.


We also have some concerns around the new tool that is apparently coming in in 2017, around the individual parental capacity to pay. Now the minister has said that what he actually meant was the aggregate parental capacity to pay. But the legislation still says 'individual'. How is this going to play out for those parents and families out in our communities? Is this going to be a means test? And how is it going to work? We have no problem, on this side of the chamber, with improving outcomes in education for students. But we do not want to see this lack of clarity resulting in negative impacts on those families and students in the school sector—particularly, from my point of view and from that of many of my colleagues, those in the regional school sector.


Money itself is not going to solve these problems. As my very good colleague Senator Mason said earlier, a bucket of money is not going to solve this. And unfortunately this government relies all too often on a bucket of money, thinking it is going to solve a problem. Indeed, we only have to look at the NBN to see that this is a principle that this government has tried time and time again. Money itself is not going to solve these problems.


While I understand that a lot of the schools realise, as we do, that financial assistance is going to be necessary for some of this improvement, we actually need to look at and focus on things like principal autonomy, parental engagement, a strong and robust curriculum and teacher quality. If those things are not improved, no amount of money thrown into the system is going to make the slightest bit of difference, unless attached to that is the deliberative and proper assessment of how we actually improve those things for students in those schools.


I was going to go on with a number of other areas but, as I say, in deference to other colleagues who I know want to speak, I will cut my comments short. But I do have to say that I believe that there has been a real lack of consultation with and information provision to, in particular, the regional communities, in terms of this government getting out there and communicating and properly consulting with regional communities. The information that has come through to us in the Senate estimates process has been very weighted to the city areas, and that is absolutely not acceptable.


The other thing that is not acceptable is the $2.8 billion worth of cuts that the government has put in place, hitting the university sector and our students, to try and pay for this. If this government had not racked up around $256 billion worth of debt, now heading towards $370 billion, we would not be looking at the funding cuts that we are seeing in the university sector and for those students. That is simply wrong and just shows that this government has absolutely no ability to manage money. Our students should not have to be cash cows for this Labor government to pay for a policy that it wants to put in place.


On this side of the chamber, as I say, we are absolutely supportive of making sure that our students get the best opportunities they possibly can through their schooling life—particularly those students in regional schools, right across those regional areas. That is my particular focus. We will continue to support those students and families to ensure that they have better outcomes in the future.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:24):  It was the Chinese philosopher Confucius who said this: 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for 10 years, plant trees; if your plan is for 100 years, educate your children.' Nobody in this chamber would argue with the point on which Senator Nash concluded: that all of us have a very keen interest, obviously, in the best education for our children.


It is with great disappointment that I rise to oppose the Australian Education Bill 2013 and its associated legislation. As the deputy chair of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee, it is a great disappointment to me that a circumstance developed that in the other place there was less than two hours debate on 70 pages of amendments associated with the legislation. It was only last week, on 18 June, that the Senate referred the bills to the committee of which I am the deputy chairman, with the need for an inquiry and a report by 20 August 2013—an entirely reasonable time. Unfortunately, that was cut short by the majority members from the Labor government, to the extent that there would then be only three days—three days!—of opportunity for parties to make a submission, which concluded on Friday, 21 June, for a report on Monday, 24 June. In other words, there was to be expenditure by state and federal governments—in other words, taxpayers—of some $100 billion over the forward estimates, and there was only three days' opportunity for people to place submissions, and no time at all for there to be a hearing or hearings held. That is the disdain in which this government holds the people and the parliament and, more particularly, this Senate.


People might say, 'Look, there've been plenty of opportunities to debate the issues over time.' But there simply has not been put before interested parties and those vitally affected by this legislation anywhere near the documentation necessary for them to become informed and to advise their own constituents. So we have had a totally and utterly limited period of time. We have had no chance to scrutinise the submissions. We have had no chance to test the witnesses. And we are now being asked to approve this legislation. This is just totally and utterly unacceptable.


I will go very briefly to some of the submissions placed in those 72 hours. The themes of the complexity of the legislation and the lack of clarity ran through nearly all of them. The Independent Schools Council of Australia said:


The timing of the passage of these pieces of legislation is critical for non-government schools, as current Commonwealth Government funding arrangements expire at the end of 2013.


That is a mere six months away. The complexity of the legislation, particularly as it related to indexation, was a matter of enormous concern, and still has not been answered. Criticism of the lack of clarity also came from state governments, the Queensland government pointing out the plethora of detailed examples of the lack of clarity, the following being just one of them:


The Bill sets out a complex set of authorities and relationships, which is compounded when overlaid with participating and non-participating status. In parts, the Bill switches between concepts of 'participating schools' and 'participating states and territories'.


And on it goes. There were also pleas that the government would release the year-by-year figures for the next three years, where Commonwealth education funding goes backwards in each state and territory; they were unaddressed.


Submissions also mentioned the lack of consultation. I will illustrate the way in which this government consults with some newspaper headlines. For example, under the headline 'Gillard to punish Gonski hold-outs' we read:


JULIA Gillard will punish recalcitrant states that refuse to sign up to the government's education reforms with lower funding for their schools.


In a Victorian paper, under the headline 'Schools face burdens irrespective of the Gonski deal,' we read:


Brighton Secondary College principal Julie Podbury said state schools already wrote plans for improvement.


So why is there the necessity for a Canberra bureaucrat or a plethora of Canberra bureaucrats? As to the Northern Territory, Prime Minister Gillard not only threatened to impose difficulties for the Northern Territory government in the education space, but also made it very clear that other funding from the federal government to the Northern Territory may be adversely affected. As to Queensland, under the headline 'Gonski gets zilch, state goes local', we read that:


THE Newman government will forge ahead with its own education reforms, refusing to allocate funds to support the commonwealth's Gonski blueprint …


This is the way in which this federal government consults. 'Private schools tucked into Gonski'—Catholic and independent schools will be locked into the Gonski funding model regardless of whether Prime Minister Julia Gillard can convince more states and territories to sign up.


I come to my own state of Western Australia, which was offered a paltry $138 million over six years to sign away its schools to federal control in Canberra at a time when the New South Wales government was offered $5 billion. When I asked in estimates how this could be, do you know what the answer was? The answer was that because, over time, failed Labor governments in New South Wales, some of them led by now Senator Bob Carr, had failed to invest in state education in New South Wales and therefore they needed extra funding to bring them up to a standard at which they should always have been. In our state of Western Australia, under Premier Barnett and premiers before him, including Labor and the Liberal coalition, there was heavy investment.


In estimates I challenged the minister about how it could be that one state could get $5 billion and the other $138 million. Prime Minister Gillard rushed over to WA and she would appear to have increased the $138 million to $900 million. We have no idea where the money is coming from, but who cares with this mob when we have $300 billion of debt and we are paying a billion dollars a month interest on the debt at the moment. It turns out that the $900 million was actually $300 million of state money. Take that away, Senator Mason, and there is $600 million left. It sounds wonderful, doesn't it? How many years was it over? Six years. Premier Barnett told us the other day that the Western Australian budget for running the state schools is $4 billion a year, and Prime Minister Gillard, in return for the states handing over control, was throwing around $600 million of money she did not have and certainly gave no indication of where it was coming from.


'Review for rebel state schools'—the list goes on. This is how this government consults with its stakeholders. Breaches in previous undertakings by the Commonwealth was evident in submissions from witnesses to this particular inquiry who could not appear at a hearing because one was not permitted. The Tasmanian government, a Labor government, submitted that the bill as drafted ignores the roles and responsibilities as agreed, providing the Commonwealth with the ability to impose prescriptive policy and operational requirements on school systems and schools, both government and non-government.


I propose to conclude on this matter, if I may, to allow others to speak, by drawing attention to an inquiry which you, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, were a participant in recently: the teaching and learning inquiry of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee. I am proud to say that the report and recommendations were unanimous from everybody who participated. These were the principles that we considered were necessary to improve teaching and learning in this country. The first: active involvement by parents from the youngest age of their children. That is not a high-cost factor; it does not get a guernsey in this funding. The second: the need for school autonomy, as exhibited, for example, in Finland. What does this legislation do? It takes school autonomy away. A principal cannot employ a teacher or sack a teacher; they have to put a plan to a bureaucrat in Canberra. Where would decisions be best made for the Turkey Creek school in the Kimberley? Where would decisions best be made for the Mukinbudin Primary School in the wheat belt? Not here in Canberra. The committee rejected the concept that, by definition, low socioeconomic students must be automatically disadvantaged in their education outcomes. That is something that our committee came up with. I must say, in deference to the recommendations of Gonski and his colleagues, that was a matter that they picked up.


Other principles included: professional learning by teachers practically in the schools, day to day; and curriculum and curriculum development devolved down to the level where the principal and the staff are best equipped. Senator Mason, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, the unfortunate thing is that, once again, an opportunity has been missed, money has been grossly wasted, and there has been a lack of consultation with the stakeholders, be they state, Catholic or independent schools, and there is a circumstance where we will not receive the outcomes. We will have growth management by Canberra and a waste of taxpayers' money.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:35):  I indicate that I share the concerns of Senator Mason and Senator Back in relation to the lack of appropriate process in the way that these bills have been rushed through and the lack of adequate debate. This is not the way to run a parliament. Respectfully, this is not the way to deal with such an important package of legislation.


There is a wonderful quote from WB Yeats that sums up how I feel about education. He said:


Education is not the filling a pail but the lighting of a fire.


My fear with this bill is that the government is too narrowly focused on filling a pail full of money rather than igniting the debate we must have about better outcomes for students. Sometimes one can lead to the other, but, without a clear policy framework and the right objectives, we will continue to fail our students and ultimately the nation.


A lot has been said about the decline in Australia's literacy and numeracy levels. There are many different arguments about how we should fix this: more tests, fewer tests, more money for students, more money for teachers—the list goes on and on. Something that is often forgotten is how we value learning and education as a nation. Governments value it because—forgive me for sounding cynical—there are votes to be won when you promise to fix a problem. Academics and commentators value it because they know its importance to our nation. And teachers and educators value it because they know what it is like to see a child or an adult gain understanding—the light that goes on when something suddenly becomes clear and it all makes sense. But do we as a nation value it? Do we value our teachers, our schools and our capacity for higher education? In my view, we do not—not enough.


In December last year the Australian Council for Educational Research released a report on the most recent international studies of student achievement. The council stated:


The study revealed that many Australian Year 4 students have substantial literacy problems, with around one-quarter of students not meeting the Intermediate benchmark – the standard generally considered in international achievement studies to be the minimally acceptable standard of proficiency.


The report went on to find that Australian students achieved a mean score of 505 in year 8 mathematics. South Korea, which was a top-performing country, achieved a mean score of 613. Further, 37 per cent of Australian students did not meet the Intermediate benchmark, 26 per cent achieved the Low international benchmark and 11 per cent were below this level.


How do we make up this lost ground? Ben Jensen, the director of the Grattan Institute's School Education Program, wrote an excellent opinion piece for the Weekend Australian earlier this year, in February, in which he called for better support and skills development for teachers, rather than more funding for schools. Jensen has approached the problem in a way that I find non-ideological and nonpartisan. I think we need to listen to voices such as his in this debate. Jensen said:


For decades, politicians and educators have argued over funding, and whether more money should go to public or private schools. As they did, children's learning was neglected. Our primary school students have the lowest literacy levels of any country in the English-speaking developed world. The performance of our secondary students is falling. The average 15-year-old maths student in Australia performs at a level two years below their counterpart in Shanghai.


Jensen goes on:


It is an appalling situation. The schools debate in Australia has always focused on money: how much and who gets what. How children learn and how to help them learn better, has been pushed aside.


It is time for a new story in Australian school education. Not whether public or private is better or deserves more funds, not whether teacher and principal performance pay, school autonomy or computers will lift the quality of our schools. Not wasting money on reducing class sizes.


None of these policies has been found to do much at all for student learning. Instead, the world's best school systems—in Finland, Ontario, Singapore and Shanghai—focus relentlessly on how to improve what happens in the classroom.


To me, that makes perfect sense. Of course schools need funding to meet their needs. But, in my view, there is no point in having an iPad for every child if their teacher does not have the skills or support to teach them to read. What is more, teachers are no longer just educators; they are adjudicators, psychologists, enforcers, philosophers, even nutritionists, sports coaches and career counsellors. 


Our expectations of what teachers should do have gone far beyond 'the three Rs'. Instead, they are expected to coach and support children in all facets of life during their time at school. But, too often, what they spend their time doing is everything but teaching basic literacy and numeracy skills. The ever-growing gap between the haves and have-nots in Australia means that many children are simply slipping through the cracks. Teachers have far too little support when it comes to dealing with the complex problems children often bring with them to school, and that lack of support means other children sometimes just do not get a look in.


Of course I support a better and fairer funding model for our schools. But if it is not linked to meaningful outcomes, and it does not teach more kids to read and add up, then this policy, in itself, will not work. It is not a simple equation. Money in does not equal education out. That is why the focus, after this bill is passed, must be on making sure that Australian kids not only do not slip further behind internationally but also are given a chance to reach their full potential.


Finally, Madam Acting Deputy President, often a work of fiction has a ring of truth to it, and I know you are a fan of this particular program. I would like to finish off with a quote from Sam Seaborn of Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing. Justifying his position on education funding, he said:


…education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. That's my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.


Seguing from The West Wing to what we are dealing with here, I am not convinced, sadly, that this bill has figured out how to do it either. But I hope this legislation can be used as a building block to achieve the reforms every Australian child deserves.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (12:42):  I did not want to spend too much time, in the very limited time we have, making the point that, yet again, there is legislation being rushed through here. But, perhaps quoting from the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Campbell Newman, in a submission he made to the education, employment and workplace relations committee inquiry, will suffice to give people the details of how appalling the inquiry into this bill has been. I quote from the letter, which says: 'The fact that your committee received a reference for an inquiry on 19 June requiring submissions by 21 June 2013 and reporting by 24 June indicates their contempt for the business of government and of the Australian parliament by the federal government.' It is impossible to disagree with that. I think it succinctly puts the very poor process that we have in place, and we continue to have poor processes all over the place in terms of this legislation.


I am particularly interested in the effect of this legislation on students with disability. As an unintended consequence, this legislation may be causing a preference for special schools over mainstream schools. There is no explanation anywhere for why the loading for students with a disability in special schools should be 20 per cent higher than the loading for students with a disability in mainstream schools. The suggestion seems to be that this is a temporary loading for special schools, but this is not spelt out, and a number of people who submitted in the lightning-fast time they had to address this inquiry were not confident that this was the case. But, even so, why is it there?


There is nothing specific in the bill or in the regulation that creates any concrete expectations that education systems will be able to delivery fully on the national disability standards, or that Australia's obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will be met. It would seem quite relevant to me, and it was certainly a position put by Children with Disability Australia that, at the very minimum, the obligations of this government to meet those standards should be referenced somewhere in the bill.


We have the situation where the loadings appear to be set up in such a way as to encourage short-termism and encourage lack of resources in the sector of education for students with a disability. There is a high degree of difficulty associated with the development of a disability loading, and there is a lot yet to be finalised and introduced. There is no clarity around the reform package, but there is also no clarity around how it will apply to students with a disability. Of course, the odds of us getting a successful outcome on this are very low. I would have thought that the government could have acknowledged—in what has been referred to as the rhetoric and aspiration in this document—that, as Senator Xenophon was pointing out earlier, not just the academic performance of our schools across the board as something to be ashamed of, but our treatment of children with disability is something to be particularly ashamed of.


Children with Disability Australia described it as a national disgrace. They pointed out that 63 per cent of school children with a disability experience difficulty fitting in at school, 29.6 per cent of people between 15 and 64 with a disability completed year 12 compared to 49.3 per cent of people without a disability—that is almost half. They added that 12.7 per cent of people with a disability have a bachelor's degree or higher, and for people without a disability that figure is 19.7 per cent. Around 15 per cent of Australia's students require additional assistance, but only five per cent receive funded support. Clearly, improving these measures over time is complex, but getting a start on it is urgent. Students with disability have been marginalised in our system for long enough, and it beggars belief that, in 2013, this government would think that a system that somehow preferences special schools over students with disability in mainstream schools is a good thing. It is just unbelievable.


As I said, the loading system has been set up in such a way that it would appear to disadvantage mainstream schools which make the effort to follow the law and do their job of accepting students with a disability. The funding is on a per-student basis. There is no requirement for how the funding would be distributed within systems, and the loading appears to be payable for the year's enrolment that you have now. Whilst extending the national partnership agreement for More Support for Students with Disabilities is a start, it does not help with the issue of stop-start funding and no funding to improve the resources or the learning. It is just funding per student per year with nothing into the future. It is not endemic, it is not recurrent and it is not permanent. It is an unusual and difficult mess. I would urge the government to keep in mind that we must not end up with a system that has the perverse effect of giving special schools higher funding than mainstream schools that have students with a disability.


I would like to conclude my remarks so that others can speak by pointing out another comment from the Queensland Premier, the Hon. Campbell Newman, who makes the point that, I think, Ms Gillard continues to forget. The Queensland government is the owner and manager of state schools and is the regulator of non-state schools and provides nearly 90 per cent of government funding for state schools. The Queensland government aims to remove needless red tape and regulation in general and will not support the federal government adding even more regulation. I have no idea why Ms Gillard would be surprised that the majority of states have not signed up to her 'con-ski' reform, as has been referred to by the shadow education minister, Christopher Pyne. It is disappointing that this government have gone about it in this way. I would urge them to have a look at the way they are intending to fund provisions for disadvantaged students and for students with a disability and to make sure that, if this were to occur, there would be no adverse consequences.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:51):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013, the related bill, and the 70-odd amendments. I think it is a record, and I would appreciate somebody telling me whether it is, but it is one of many records for this government. The thematic approach we have heard this morning from the speakers in this debate is one of waste, lack of consultation and disregard for good governance and for good parliamentary process. It is a thematic line that this Gillard government and the Rudd government seem to have lived by and will die by.


In its politicised DNA, partisan to the end, the Gillard government is using education policy to divide. As a former educator I am greatly disappointed to be standing here now, after work has been done on a needs based model to ensure that education right across our nation is of a high standard and quality, with state pitted again state, system against system, in a bidding war. 


The Prime Minister's approach to premiers has just beggared belief throughout this. We have heard some representations about that here today in the states' house. Tasmania is going through a grab for cash. I am sure at the ALP state conference on the weekend there will be the wrapped-up-in-a-box signature that everyone is looking for, but that will not happen before the Premier of Tasmania has sought to ensure that it will not lose the $105 million of extra GST funds it already receives for education.


In media reports there were comments earlier from the Northern Territory about how the Prime Minister is approaching a co-operative and supportive conversation about something of such national significance as a 'once-in-a-generation change to our education system'. She has asked for a response by the NT and has warned that funding under the national partnership agreement may be reconsidered if the Territory government does not cooperate. Federal education minister, Peter Garrett, says that the Territory government is playing a dangerous game by refusing to cooperate in negotiations.


My home state of Victoria has been in the media raising concerns that it has had with this negotiation. I use the term 'negotiation' lightly because it implies a conversation. Minister Dixon wrote to the Commonwealth at the start of this month asking to hold joint negotiations. Similarly, there have been concerns raised in the media, from Victoria's perspective, about constitutional issues with the bill before us. We know—it has been mentioned before—that until a couple of weeks ago this was just an aspirational piece of paper that nobody who cares about the future of our nation and the quality of education being delivered to our young people right across this nation could disagree with. Yet, as always, the devil is in the detail—and we have the devil before us today. The constitutional issues were raised by numerous states including, earlier this week in Tasmania, by Premier Giddings. 


There are concerns about increased Commonwealth policy oversight of state schools through the National Plan for School Improvement. This is yet another attempt by the Gillard government to grab power from the states and override the states' constitutional obligation to be in control of what happens on the ground within their own jurisdictions when it comes to education. 


Haste has meant that none of these issues has been able to be examined and considered by the Senate and our systems. The Australian people expect us to be thorough in this place on their behalf; not to spend their money—$100 billion—without scrutiny. That is exactly why every single one of us is in this chamber. We are here not just to govern but also, on behalf of the Australian people, to consider the devil in the detail, to come to some conclusions and to proceed from there. But this government is careless with our democracy.


Issues were raised. As has been mentioned, I was part of the inquiry into the aspirational four-page document and the much more detailed 129-page document, with its 70-odd amendments—the three-day inquiry, as Senator Back and I like to call it. There was no opportunity to seek clarification on written submissions and to delve further into the detail that stakeholders had raised. 


I would like to counter some of the claims that Senator Pratt made in her commentary on regional schools in WA. She said that if the Nationals were serious about standing up for kids attending schools in regional areas then they would be backing this bill. That is exactly why you have to look at the detail, Senator Pratt. When you look at the mechanism that is being used to determine the loading for location under this model you find that it is the ARIA model. That is fine if you are in a regional school in WA but if you are in a regional school in Victoria that has a different meaning and there is a different understanding of it. Under the ARIA model, as we discovered in estimates, relative to regional schools in WA, Victorian regional schools will be worse off. So check the Hansard on that one and get back to me. Unfortunately, in two minutes the time for debate will be over so we will not be able to hear the response from the government on that.


So this debate has been a farce and reduced to emotive slogans that even the owner of the name seems not to back, as these bills—and, more importantly, the negotiated reality—have skewed the report from David Gonski, which I think was delivered in December 2011. So, this is not a new conversation. Whilst we have had 70 amendments, with the devil in their detail, before us for a couple of weeks, we have been talking about this for 2½ years. 



A government senator interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Minister, you may say, 'Exactly!' but then you are expecting stakeholders and states to back the slogans without being able to go through the detail. It is not an appropriate way to govern and it is not a once-in-a-generation reform. 


Finally, I would like to reject outright any aspersions that the coalition does not back, as the birth right of every single citizen of this nation, the right to a quality education, private or public. For people across the way to assume that, because we want to scrutinise this—because state governments that are governed by parties that are on our side of politics are not rushing to sign up, because we have some questions we want to prosecute, because we do not want potentially to throw $100 billion away, because we want to get right—we do not think it is the birthright of every young Australian to receive a quality education, is offensive in the extreme.


Those of us on this side of the chamber know that, of the million young people that attend school in this country outside metropolitan cities, 660,000 attend state schools. So how can we back our communities without backing quality education in the regions in state schools that are focused on student outcomes? That, again brings me to the objectives in part 3(1)(i). As an educator I have real issues with a quality education being determined by a PISA result. That concern is actually shared by the AEU and the IEU, and I suggest you check out their quotes in our report to this bill. A quality education cannot simply be measured by statistics. The top five, by 2025—what a ridiculous measure to ascertain the quality of our education and—

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (10:56):  We are debating the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. The Prime Minister has described the government's Gonski reforms as 'the biggest change to school education in 40 years', yet the Senate has been given only two hours and 45 minutes, or 165 minutes, to scrutinise and debate these bills. This is an insult to the Senate and it is an insult to the taxpayers, whom the government wants to saddle with a $16.2 billion bill for its reforms. That is 165 minutes to debate the expenditure of $16.2 billion.


The government is as careless with people's money as it is with the constitutional process of Senate scrutiny and Senate review. Of course, this is not the first time that the Senate has debated the Australian Education Bill. The difference is that the last time, a few months ago, we were debating a nine-page document which was short on detail and rich on platitudes and motherhood statements. It was more of a policy document, or an aspirational rhapsody, than detailed legislation. Now we have in front of us two bills and, sure, there is plenty of detail—I accept that. Yet there is not enough time to debate them properly on this the second or perhaps the third last day of sittings of the second term of the Rudd and Gillard governments.


The government has had years to get this done and to get it done properly. The Prime Minister—the then Minister for Education—has been talking for a long time about her desire to see a new school funding model. Mr David Gonski was commissioned in 2010 to look into it, he delivered his report in November 2011 and here we are today, more than a year and a half later, with less than three hours to debate bills that reflect a deeply flawed new funding model which has been rejected by many states and territories.

  That is not true.

  Yes, it is. This farce provides a telling epitaph for the Labor government. Like the French Revolution, the government's Building the Education Revolution, which started with much promise and public enthusiasm, ends a year later in disillusionment and the guillotine. 


The Australian Education Bill 2013 establishes a new federal funding formula for non-government schools. It also amends the legislation to include funding arrangements for government schools but outlines different arrangements for government schools depending on whether their state government has agreed to those changes. Under the new system, all participating schools will be entitled to a base amount of funding for every student which will indexed annually. This will be the new schooling resource standard, colloquially known by the acronym SRS. Non-government schools will receive a percentage of the SRS amount based on the school's socioeconomic status score, which is referred to today as a 'capacity to contribute'. This capacity to contribute will not apply to government schools, special and special-assistance schools, sole-provider schools and schools with a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


In addition, students and schools will attract six different types of loadings: students with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, students with low socioeconomic status, students who have low English proficiency, schools that are not in major cities, and of course small-size schools. It sounds good, doesn't it? After six years of the Labor government, I shudder every time the government think they have a good idea. Even if, like broken clocks, they are sometimes right, the implementation is so often botched that it makes you wish that Labor had just stuck to bad ideas and stopped giving good ideas such a bad name.


In reality, there are numerous problems with Labor's attempt to implement school funding reforms recommended by Mr Gonski and his review. The shadow education minister, Mr Pyne, stakeholders in the Catholic and independent school sectors, as well as the governments of Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, have identified a number of them over the past few months. Some of these concerns are contained in the amendment I intend to move shortly at this second reading stage. There is the persistent concern about schools actually being worse off under the new funding system. The government maintains that no school will be worse off. State and territory governments beg to differ. According to them, around 469 government schools in Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory alone will lose out, never mind potentially hundreds of Catholic and independent schools. In my office in Brisbane, there have been many calls and much concern has been expressed, particularly by Catholic and independent schools, about whether they will be worse off, but in some cases even by government schools. Without any doubt and without any debate, concern has certainly been expressed—even the government would need to acknowledge that. They have yet to—how do I put this?—satisfy both government and non-government schools that none of them will be worse off. That is yet to be satisfied.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator MASON:
  That is correct. If anyone in the Labor Party thinks that every school sector in this country is convinced that they will not be worse off, that is incorrect. As I stand here in the Senate today, they still are. The funding inequities are not limited to bricks and mortar schools into our towns and cities. The Christian Education Ministries have highlighted what they see as the government's legislated underfunding of distance education school students in the non-government sector. This was an issue raised with me just the other day. Students receiving their education in this system only attract 35 per cent of the schooling resource standard, but, despite repeated attempts, the Christian Education Ministries are yet to receive an adequate explanation on how the government arrived at this figure. This is just an example—it is not the only one—of repeated concern amongst different school sectors in this country, particularly, I might add, in my home state of Queensland.


Of course, it does not help that throughout all this process the Gillard government has demonstrated a singular lack of transparency and openness. It is hard to reconcile the government's rhetoric and spin with what we are reading in the budget papers and what we actually know about the proposals. Take, for example, the Prime Minister's claim that $9.8 billion of additional funds will be required to transition to the new system over the next six years, between now and 2019, yet in the 2013-14 budget there is only $2.98 billion over the forward estimates, never mind that $2.1 billion of the $2.98 billion is not new money at all but merely various national partnerships that have been cut by the government and redirected towards financing Gonski, thus leaving only $880 million in genuine new money over the next four years.


Even with that $2.98 billion, the government remains short on its commitment—about $2.6 billion short, in fact—because, if we take the government at its word on the $9.8 billion over six years, the allocation over the forward estimates should be $5.6 billion. When I asked the education department officials at the budget estimates in June why there is only $2.98 billion in the budget when there should be $5.6 billion instead, they were confounded and did not explain. All this suggests that the government's reforms consist of a trickle of money right now and the promise of a windfall sometime way in the future. If you believe this government will give you billions of dollars sometime after the next two elections, then I have a nice bridge on Sydney Harbour to sell to you. The government has quite simply been making it up as it goes along, promising everyone money it does not have and, when these enticements are not enough, it promises some more money.


Then there is red tape—always a big favourite of this government. States, non-government authorities and individual schools will be required by regulation to provide extensive information to the federal government. Information requirements will include school census data, other data for the purposes of a new national collection regime to conduct research on school education, implementation plans, student reports to parents and other information about a school. State governments in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland all suggest that the National Plan for School Improvement extends the reach of the federal government into the operations of state schools and will result in further duplication and compliance and more red tape.


Last but not least, there is concern about proposals to change the capacity-to-contribute measure for non-government schools in the future. The bilateral agreement between the federal and New South Wales governments suggests that the federal government will review the socioeconomic status score—that methodology—by 2017 to ensure this remains the most appropriate means of assessing the relative educational advantage of non-government schools.


This agreement suggests that capacity to contribute will be defined as 'the anticipated level of private contribution will be based on a school's SES score until a new, individual measure of parental capacity to contribute is developed'. There is no mention of this new measure in the revised legislation. Just consider Labor's recent forays into class warfare and stirring up of class envy, and its deep-seated suspicion of, if not outright hostility to, non-government schools. Who could forget the infamous school 'hit list'? If I were a Catholic or an independent school, I would be very worried. The government should rule out the introduction of a new means test beyond 2017, but, of course, it will not do that.


These are all real and immediate problems with these two education bills. There are also deeper policy and philosophical problems with Labor's plans for our schools. The government's Gonski reforms are a typical social democratic measure. Labor has yet to find a problem that it could not throw money at. The money, of course, it does not have, and it has to borrow it. In this case, it is throwing tomorrow's children's money to supposedly fix today's children's problems. What evidence is there that more money will mean better schools? What is the evidence that more money will mean better schools and better educational outcomes? Ben Jensen, the director of the Grattan Institute School Education Program noted that:


Despite its strengths, the Gonski review retells the same old, and failed, story of Australian education: that the only way to fix our schools is to spend more money and to change the way it is divided between schools and students.


…   …   …


Supporters of Gonski claim it is a 'once in a generation opportunity'. That will be true only if the money is well spent. If it is spent the way education money is being spent in the past, it will be a complete waste—and risk dooming further reform efforts for a generation.


Across the past decade, education spending has increased by nearly three times as much as Gonski is proposing, yet our school performance has stagnated or has fallen.


Mr Jensen is merely echoing a growing international consensus which now acknowledges that there is little or no relationship between spending per student and student outcomes and that other factors, such as teacher quality, parental involvement, principal and school autonomy, as well as a robust curriculum, play a far greater role in giving children a quality education—a far greater role in giving kids a better education.


For Labor, it is not about the outcomes, certainly not medium- and long-term outcomes, but about short-term political advantage. 'We care about education,' says the Labor Party. 'Look how much money we are spending. Please re-elect us, because we're throwing all this money at the issue.' In reality, Labor are like a deadbeat dad who blew all the money on booze and smokes and who now breaks his baby girl's piggy bank, steals the money and uses it to buy her a bike to show how much he loves her. That is what has happened to the Labor Party.


If the government throws another $5 billion, $10 billion or $15 billion at schools, will it actually make any difference? Past experience is not very encouraging. Over the past six years, in addition to all the recurrent spending, Labor has already spent over $20 billion on computers in schools, the school halls program and various national partnerships. Did all that money make our system any better? Did that extra $20 billion make our kids smarter, improve their literacy or numeracy, or help them acquire new knowledge and new skills? Did it? Judging by both domestic and international results, the answer is a resounding 'No!' The 2012 NAPLAN results show that literacy and numeracy, as measured in years 3, 5, 7 and 9, have been, for all intents and purposes, stagnant since 2008. Yes, there have been some slight improvements here and there, some up and down, but, overall, very little improvement. Even the minister, Mr Garrett, was forced to acknowledge in December last year that:


There shouldn't be a single education minister in the states nor a single senior state education bureaucrat who can take any comfort from these NAPLANs.


Neither, by the way, should the minister and the federal bureaucracy, which so far have managed to get no bang whatsoever for their $20 billion bucks, just a very expensive whimper.


If NAPLAN results are discouraging, how do we, as a nation, compare to other developed countries, including our regional neighbours and our competitors? The answer is also, unfortunately, not that great. Take the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which tests 15-year-old students on their preparedness to use the knowledge and skills they have gained at school to meet real-life challenges. The latest PISA results show that Australian students are making no progress and, in some cases, are actually going backwards. For example, the 2009 results show a 13-point drop in reading performance compared to 2000. Or take the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, which revealed that a quarter of Australia's year 4 students fail to meet the minimum standard in reading for their age. In that test, Australia ranked 27th out of 48 countries in reading, on a similar level to New Zealand, Poland and Lithuania. Or take the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, which shows our students stagnating for years and years, while, at the same time, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan have experienced dramatic improvements, and even the United States has shown a steadier improvement in performance.


So, what is the answer? What is Labor's answer? It is: 'We have spent $20 billion already in an education revolution, all for no results, so let's just now spend another $16 billion on top of that in the Gonski reforms.' All of us want our schools to be well-resourced, but we also know that money is not necessarily the only answer, particularly considering the random, wasteful and unaccountable manner in which Labor tends to throw it at any given problem it sees.


The two bills we are debating today represent a deeply flawed proposal which substitutes another cash splash for serious educational reform. It promises schools money the government does not have in two elections from now. It claims to be better and fairer than the old system. Yet it leaves hundreds if not thousands of government and non-government schools worse off. Labor has once again managed to achieve the impossible by taking an important area of public policy and turning it into a debacle of historic proportions. In fact, to paraphrase the Prime Minister, it is the biggest debacle in school education in 40 years.


I have circulated the amendment in my name on behalf of the coalition. The amendment calls on the Senate to note the need for the government to provide certainty that individual schools will not be left worse off under the new arrangements, and the importance of more transparency regarding the financial impact of the proposed arrangements. The amendment also calls on the Senate to note its concern with parts of the National Plan for School Improvement that increase the federal interference in the operation of state government and Catholic schools by micromanaging schools and, of course, increasing red tape, and with proposals to change the capacity to contribute measure for non-government schools into the future.


This has been a debacle, not because the intention of the government is not good, but simply because, like so many good ideas that the government thinks they have, the implementation has been and will be a shambles. I move:


At the end of the motion, add: ""but the Senate:


(a) notes:


   (i) the need for the Government to provide certainty that individual schools will not be left worse off under the new arrangements, and


   (ii) the importance of more transparency regarding the financial impact of the proposed arrangements; and


(b) further notes its concern about:


   (i) parts of the National Plan for School Improvement, which have the effect of micromanaging schools or increasing red-tape, and the increased federal interference in the operations of state government and Catholic schools; and


   (ii) proposals to change the capacity to contribute measure for non-government schools in the future.""

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2013-06-26,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:16):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. To the extent that they establish a framework for needs based funding of schools in Australia the Australian Greens commend these two pieces of legislation. The Australian Greens believe that education is the foundation of democracy, and a well-resourced, public education system striving for excellence is the guarantee of a healthy and fair society. It is the right of all children to have access and opportunity to high-quality and affordable education and for their parents to expect as much. The public system is the only guarantee of this right.


The Greens have argued for a decade that our national funding model needs to be changed to make it fairer, to make sure that public education is properly funded throughout Australia and to invest billions more in education commensurate with the funding of our peers in other developed countries. In an increasingly divided community, where people's destinies are often determined by their postcodes, quality public education can be a unifying force. It fosters connection and understanding by bringing together children who would otherwise always move in different orbits. It can be the lifeline for all kids, whoever they are, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances, to achieve their full potential and to be the best they can be. It is also recognised that, as one of the best financial investments a nation can make, higher education standards and outcomes for everyone will enhance our country's human capital and increase skills, innovation and productivity in our community. We believe that a principled, transparent and enduring schools funding model, where public money is fairly prioritised according to need, is necessary to ensure a world-quality public school system that is accessible to all children no matter what their background or circumstances. It is true that this legislation does not go as far towards establishing that model as we believe is necessary, but it is certainly a big step in the right direction, and it is the most important educational funding reform in Australia in decades. Needs based funding is necessary to ensure public schools are funded to provide a world-class education for any student regardless of their background.


The Gonski review of funding for schooling was commissioned to devise an optimal education funding model. The Gonski review concluded that our current system is opaque, complex and inequitable with disadvantage concentrated in particular schools, predominantly government schools, which educate the lion's share of students with disadvantage. Gonski recommended a needs based funding model and a substantial increase in national education funding of $5 billion per year, which has subsequently been increased for inflation to $6.5 billion per year. Despite the coalition's disparagement about the need for money and throwing money at the problem, it was a universal consensus recommendation of the Gonski review that, indeed, Australia's funding of our national education system was lagging behind those of our peers in the developed world.


It is ludicrous to suggest that this is not about money. It is about many things. It is about more than money, but it is certainly about money as well. Why is it otherwise that the wealthy schools are not offering to give the money back that they receive? Because, of course, it is about money. Having visited schools across Australia, it has been very clear to me that those disadvantaged public schools could do so much more if they had more resources available to them to enhance the educational opportunities of those students from disadvantage that they educate so well already.


The Gonski review also concluded that an independent and expert national schools resourcing body should determine the applicable schooling resource standards. The Australian Greens strongly regret that this legislative framework fails to provide for this body. Such a body, independent of governments and the various sectors and interests that characterise education debates in Australia, could provide the core of the governance necessary to ensure that funding for schooling is provided in a way that maximises its educational impact and minimises self-interest and sectoral interests, as are often advocated by the main players in the system. An independent national schools resourcing body would develop, maintain, review and index the schooling resource standards and associated loadings to provide for currency and effectiveness. The Australian Greens lament the fact that this key component of the model that the Gonski review devised is missing from the legislation.


Another key recommendation of the Gonski review is that, in the case of the non-government sector, the assessment of a school's need for public funding should consider the capacity of the parents who enrol their children in the school to contribute financially towards the school's resource requirements. A genuine needs based funding model would ensure that all resources of a school are taken into account in determining need.


Such an approach needs to be carefully implemented—there is considerable diversity in the existing private contribution among non-government schools—however, the Gonski review concluded that this is achievable in developing a new framework subject to other funding parameters and transitional arrangements. I will be moving a second reading amendment to encapsulate the points that I have been making.


The Australian Greens have two substantive amendments to the Australian Education Bill. The first relates to yearly reporting obligations, which provide for transparency in how public funds are distributed within a system and moves these from the draft regulations into the legislation. This would require schools to report their resources—their assets, income, fees and other aspects—as an essential element of transparency and accountability in the context of needs based funding. We wish to embed this in legislation rather than leave it in a regulation and run the risk of it being undone by a future coalition government which has not yet acknowledged that there is an inequity at the heart of our current schools funding system, as was identified by the Gonski review. 


This would also ideally overcome the risk of money being dissipated within bureaucracies before it arrives at the gates of the schools where it is most sorely needed. We also propose an independent review of the education funding model that this bill established, commencing in 2018.


The second Australian Greens amendment would simply require non-government schools to comply with antidiscrimination law. Equality is a core principle underpinning Australia's modern, proud democracy. Any school which is in receipt of large amounts of public funding should not have recourse to the exemption provisions set out in sections 37 and 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which allow it to discriminate against Australians at will. 


The fact is that there are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex students in every education system in Australia, including religious schools. Sadly, recent research shows that the situation with respect to homophobia and homophobic abuse in schools is not improving. And systemic discrimination—discrimination upheld by social institutions and governments—legitimises such incidents. On the other hand, it is well established that policy protections for people's rights are associated with decreased risks of experiencing homophobic violence and decreased risks of self-harm and suicide rates.


In formulating this education reform, the government has taken the opportunity to increase policy requirements for schools, including more information gathering, and submitters to the inquiry on this bill noted that the architecture of the Australian Education Bill gives the Commonwealth the potential to exercise a high degree of control over the way in which government, Catholic and independent education systems and schools deliver education to Australian students.


The Australian Greens believe that this education reform package is an opportunity to bring school standards on discrimination into line with community standards, and set a benchmark for protecting people's rights. This is a great opportunity for Australia to align itself squarely with international human rights standards. It is very clear to the Australian Greens that if an organisation is receiving public funding to provide a service the Australian public has the right to expect it to abide by basic, widely held community standards and antidiscrimination principles. 


Those are the two substantive amendments the Australian Greens will be moving. I move the Australian Greens second reading amendment in the terms circulated in the chamber. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Senator Wright, just to clarify the procedure here, we have a second reading amendment here before us, which we will need to deal with. Once that is dealt with you can move your amendment and we will deal with yours. That is all going to happen, as I understand it, at one o'clock. It will be put at one o'clock, after Senator Mason's. I am saying that just so that you are clear about where we are travelling here.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2013-06-26,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:27):  This plan before our chamber today to fix the inequities in our education system has been needed in this nation for a very long time. We have had rampant inequity and inequality take hold, with no plan to address that until now. I am very pleased to say that, through the Gonski review, this Labor government has been working very hard on getting the solutions in place.


The inequality has been a great cost to the nation, and it is time to do something about it. It is time for this parliament to do something about it. That is why it is very important that these changes pass this week. When you look at the impact of inequality on our nation, it is profound. Today, the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians own 61 per cent of the nation's wealth and the poorest 20 per cent own just one per cent. This is something that is reflected, also, in our education systems. 


We are a good deal less equal than countries such as Japan, Sweden and Norway, which have education systems that are also far more equal. We are one of the most unequal developed countries—keeping company with the US and Britain. This inequality is embedded in our nation's education system. So addressing inequality in education is certainly a key to fixing our education system. On that note, what we know from looking at education around the globe is that education systems that are more equal—systems that remove the inequality and give all students an opportunity—have much better educational outcomes. It is proven, globally, that this is the fact: nations that have more equal education systems do better. They have much better education outcomes overall and as a whole. 


The current inequality comes at a great cost. We have needed a plan to fix this for a long time. A lot of the inequalities in our education system have been driven by the way our education system is funded, and it is time it was fixed. I am very proud to have the opportunity to do that in this place today. I note that when this plan passes some 60 per cent of the nation's students will be covered. But I think it is important that we see this nation realise 100 per cent coverage. On that note, I really want to see Western Australia come into this scheme. It is critical because, while WA is reasonably well resourced—we are, as a whole, closer to the student resource standard than some other states are—the most disadvantaged schools in my home state do not meet the resource standard put forward in this model. To my National Party colleagues across the chamber: it is rural and regional students that are currently the most disadvantaged in Western Australia. These are the students that would benefit from being brought into this model.


The Labor government is serious about education reform in Australia. It is about time we had a fair funding system in place so that every school, regardless of their state, regardless of the sector they are in and regardless of location—including rural and regional schools, schools in remote communities and schools in disadvantaged suburbs—get the money they need to do a great job. The cost of inequality is great. I would like to quote Dr Carmen Lawrence, who has been a significant contributor to the discussion around education equity and who was on the Gonski review. She said, in an article in The Monthlylast year:


In Australia, almost 80% of students from the lowest quarter of socioeconomic disadvantage attend government schools. The drift of students and resources from government to non-government schools has accelerated here in the last decade or so and further concentrated wealthier students in the private sector. As a result, there are more schools with very high proportions of students from disadvantaged backgrounds – mainly in the government system – and more with high concentrations of the most advantaged – mainly in private schools.


This is not about class warfare, as the opposition claims. It is not about envy—far from it. Far from it being about the politics of envy, it is about all parents wanting the best for their children. It is about making sure that no child in this country in the school that they are in is getting left behind. Parents want choice, but some parents have no choice. Choices are being taken away by the inequities in our education system. It is time to make sure those students are not left behind. I will give you a very clear example of how our country's students are being left behind. Dr Lawrence went on to say in this article:


In one country town in Western Australia, the local government high school lost ground dramatically after four private schools were opened; the most disadvantaged children were left behind with fewer teachers per student than in the new private schools. The total cost of education in the community skyrocketed, without any aggregate improvement in children's scores on routine tests.


I am not saying that it is a bad thing for new schools to be opened in communities—far from it. I am saying that it is absolutely immoral to leave behind students who have no education choices, to leave behind those schoolchildren who inevitably have less choice in education. Every student in this country deserves that choice. Parents making hard economic decisions in their households deserve the choice between a good private school and a good government school. That is the option that we should be giving students and families in this country.


One in 12 Australian students is currently not meeting minimum standards in reading, writing and maths in our country. We have a good deal of these students in WA, so I really want to see Western Australia become part of this plan. I think the plan has the potential to see our classrooms in the top five in the world by 2025, because it is a plan to properly resource all schools, all our children, teachers and classrooms, for generations to come. It is something that will see the bedrock of education in this country meet the kinds of quality standards that we expect—quality standards that are comparable with the best performing countries around the globe. Without these reforms before us, there is no plan to do that. The National Plan for School Improvement includes a new funding approach to make sure we get these things right. It responds to the problems in the system. In our plan, every state and every sector will see increased funding and more support for students in the classroom.


I note that Senator Mason is looking for a guarantee that no school will be worse off. We have made that commitment. As a bare minimum, we want every school in Australia to receive its current funding plus indexation of three per cent. This is not a competition between education sectors. We simply want to make sure that no student gets left behind. Schools that need more support to support their students will get it, irrespective of sector. We are prepared to guarantee this, and we are asking the states and territories to do the same.


Today, I ask Mr Colin Barnett to do the same for Western Australia's students. He now has but a few days left to sign up to this deal. He has to get it lined up by 30 June to make sure that Western Australian schools also have the opportunity of fixing the problems in our education system. The plan that we have before us responds to the needs of states, like WA, who have higher costs attached to delivering education in our system. As I said before, where the problems are in WA, where we fail to meet the student resource standard, is, most profoundly, in disadvantaged communities and in rural and regional areas.


This is where the funding under this model is targeted. It is a great benefit for Western Australia and it is time, in my view, for Senator Barnett to accept this offer. It is time for all schools in Western Australia to benefit from a fairer and more stable school funding system. Under the offer that we have made to Western Australia that is embedded in the plan before us, we have total funding growth for WA of $2.8 billion, which would make a massive difference to Western Australian students.


I am pleased that the offer was increased, because the $922 million that is on the table will go a very long way. There is $922 million under the current investment plan and then we have got the indexation, which will also see funding in Western Australia continuing to grow. This indexation needs to be locked in by both the Commonwealth and the states coming to an agreement. The Commonwealth is making a commitment to indexation of 4.7 per cent and we are asking the states to commit to three per cent so that both the states and the Commonwealth are playing their part in seeing education funding grow in our country.


We want all sectors to have the extra resources for our nation's schools that need it. I do not think school principals and teachers around Western Australia think locking in funding growth of around $2.8 billion is a bad deal. It is a good deal, it is a well-targeted deal and it will make an enormous difference to Western Australian schools. It makes good sense for WA.


I note that a decrease in funding would have occurred under the previous model when it stopped. WA will receive the same funding guarantee that we gave to New South Wales. That means every year they will receive an increase in base funding. What we have currently is a very volatile education funding system. The model introduced by the previous government sees indexation declining by a further three per cent. This means Western Australian schools have more funding year on year on year and have more certainty and more confidence about funding. So schools in Western Australia will be benefiting from this new suite of reforms if they come on board—and it is high time that Western Australia did. All schools in WA need to move on to a needs based funding model, consistent with the school-resource standard, to make sure that students in Western Australia do not get left behind.


I would like to contrast that with what we have before us in the opposition's non-plan for education. The education spokesperson for the coalition, Christopher Pyne, has confirmed that the coalition want to keep in place a broken school-funding model that could see up to $5.4 million cut from Australian children. He has dismissed the findings of the Gonski review, which was very strongly welcomed, right around the country, by the education community. I know this from talking to the Primary Principals Association, where principals from all three sectors—Catholic, independent and government—work together. They all told me the system is broken and that they are committed to seeing progress made on these questions. They are working across sectors to say, 'Yes, the system is broken, and we want to be part of the solutions.' But Mr Pyne has not listened to schools and parents around the country. In fact, the coalition has a plan to sack one in seven teachers, squeeze more children into classrooms and slash funding to disadvantaged schools. Mr Pyne has said that teaching quality would be his highest priority. I cannot see how that can possibly be the case, because the coalition has in fact announced that it would cut $425 million out of the Teacher Quality National Partnership. They said that in the 2010 federal election. So if that is how Christopher Pyne treats his main priority, how will he treat the rest of the education system?


I want to acknowledge the amendments moved by the Greens. These amendments would create legal uncertainty in respect of the affected parts of the bill and include in the bill matters that the government thinks are better addressed in regulations. I also note that putting these information requirements into the act, rather than leaving them to regulations, would likely increase the complexity of the act, and that is something the government does not support. Further, one of the government's key concerns is that there has been considerable buy-in from different parts of the education sector—from government schools, from non-government schools and from Catholic and independent schools—to get them to support these reforms and to get their support for a path forward and, at this stage, the government thinks these amendments would represent a threat to the goodwill that we have generated in terms of being able to move forward on these very important questions. That is why the government will not be supporting these amendments. The government also has concerns that this level of detail in the primary legislation would limit the capacity to amend the requirements to respond to the changing needs of the bill through future regulations, because it will start to create contradictions between the act and the regulations.


In closing, I want to say that we cannot let this current broken system continue. It is doing a great disservice to the nation's students. It is driving inequities in our education system and it is driving down education standards. It leaves hundreds and thousands of young Australians behind, many in government schools but also in schools in the Catholic and independent sector, who will get extra resources under these reforms, all of whom deserve the resources and support that come with this legislation.


We know, on the other hand, that Mr Christopher Pyne and Mr Tony Abbott have no alternative plan for school funding that fixes these inequities, only a plan to maintain a broken system that is doing a great disservice to our nation's children, maintaining a broken system that will see schools lose $16 billion in six years. No school will be worse off under the current model, they say. That is not true, as the current system sees many schools go backwards, especially the most needy, and that is what we aim to address in this parliament today. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:46):  I too rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. But before I do that, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, can I firstly just acknowledge, as you are in the chair this morning, the enormous contribution that you have made to the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Thank you.




Senator KROGER:
  This is your third-last day in the Commonwealth parliament. Those of us who have worked with you on committees and have been working with you in this chamber have high regard for your professionalism, the depth of your appreciation of so many issues, the breadth of your knowledge in relation to the processes of this place and particularly, may I say, your respect for and empathy with so many communities, particularly the Indigenous community. I know that you have taken the opportunity—probably rightfully so—at times to educate me on your perspectives on that. Congratulations for your time and your contributions, and all the best following the end of this 43rd Parliament.




Senator Mason:
  Hear, hear!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Thank you very much.




Senator KROGER:
  I turn to the bills. It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on these bills, because education is an issue that I have had a lifelong passion for. In fact, it was an issue that I raised in my first speech in this place. I spoke at length about my particular personal passion in relation to education and what we provide for all those young people coming through the school system and on to tertiary education. Not only do I speak in terms of the coalition's perspective and my personal perspective on this but I would also like to be a voice for the people—I was trying to think whether I should term it as hundreds or thousands; like so many, I have been contacted by probably now thousands who are either principals or schoolteachers, and certainly parents—who have all expressed their enormous concern about these education bills. They have written to us, called and actually visited me in my electorate office. We have spent considerable time listening to the concerns of those who are caught up in the education process, whether that is as a stakeholder—that is, as a family, as parents who have children going through the system—or as those who seek to pursue a career in the education sector. So many have expressed their concerns, and it is as much for them that I speak today as their voice in expressing their concerns on these bills.


In my first speech in this place, I reflected on my parents' interest in and passion for education and how they taught me that education is the No. 1 equaliser in society. It is actually access to education and choice of education that provide an opportunity to give people a hand up in life, not a handout. That is why it is of such critical concern to us in the coalition, and it is why we have been so consistent over the years—and I refer to the former Howard government period. It is why we spent so much time and had such a priority in this area to ensure that strong education standards applied to all within Australia.


I have to say that on a personal basis I think that one of the great things that we should be considering is having a system whereby a fiscal amount, if you like, is applied and assigned to an individual child regardless of where that child is educated so that the parents themselves have the opportunity to choose which school is in the best interest of their children and, more importantly, which schools reflect the values and principles of the way in which those families wish to raise their children. But that is an argument for another day.


I will briefly reflect on my parents, though, because I think this is a great example. My brother and sister and I were the first in our family who were offered private education. We were the first in our extended family who went to private schools. Interestingly, though, the three of us did not go to the same school. My parents determined that each of us had different requirements and different needs, and they determined that different schools would bring out the best in us and suit us in very different ways. That is a very relevant example, certainly for me, of where different schools and the different principles applied at those schools supported individuals in different ways. It is the parents—only the parents—who can determine what education system best suits their own children. So any education public policy introduced or mandated by a government should be very cognisant of that fact.


It is a crying shame that, on the third last day of the 43rd Parliament, these bills are numbered 23rd and 24th of 55 bills to be guillotined. It is an absolute crying shame, as Senator Mason alluded to when he sought to suspend standing orders so that we could debate this longer. It is an absolute travesty for us all that in the House they only had two hours to look at, scrutinise and deal with these bills. We just heard from Senator Pratt. These are bills that the government themselves believe are absolutely critical to the long-term future of all Australians. Why are the government only allowing two hours in the House and less time here in the Senate for us to debate a public policy which they have proposed and which they, the government, have suggested is so important to them? Without wanting to influence those who might be listening to this broadcast and without wanting to influence those who would make their own minds up on this, I think the facts stand for themselves.


It is an absolute tragedy that the committee inquiry into this only went for three days. For something as significant and as comprehensive as this, only three days were allowed to examine the implications of the introduction of the Australian Education Bill 2013 and the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. This is just too serious to play politics with. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of a rushed public policy, rushed politics, serving an agenda other than the one we should be critically concerned about: the future of our youth in Australia.


I also suggest that the government are being quite misleading when they keep on referring to these measures, loosely—I do say loosely—as being part of the Gonski recommendations. The one person we have not heard from since these bills have been formulated for us to consider is the esteemed David Gonski himself. He is not associating himself with these bills. What he did was undertake a very comprehensive review and make a number of recommendations, and the government have cherry-picked aspects of that review and incorporated them in these bills. It is very deceptive to suggest that this is the conclusion of all the recommendations made in the review, because that is far from the truth.


We know that because the Gonski review called for no less than $6.5 billion in new funding each and every year. That is $6½ billion in each and every year, to a total of over $39 billion. Let's put that into some sort of context. What are we looking at here? Labor has promised $9 billion by 2019, which is six years away. There is a dramatic difference between what Mr David Gonski recommended by way of an injection of funds towards the restructure of the education sector and what we see before us.


As Senator Mason commented earlier, the issue here—and this applies to absolutely every issue that the government touch—is that they think, if you throw a bucketload of cash at something and make a huge injection of cash, that will produce the best outcome for whatever area it is. It is such a typically Labor and Greens' view that the solution for absolutely everything put before us is to throw money at it. I would proffer that that is not the solution. Whether under the former Rudd government or under the current Gillard government, there is example after example where throwing good money after bad did not return good public policy. It did not come up with the outcome. We only have to go back and look at the school halls that were built across the country in a flurry. Some $14.5 billion was thrown at building new school halls.


In fact, I visited a number of schools during the construction program. One small school in a small country town in northern Victoria that had fewer than 200 students had $1 million directed to building a new edifice for the Gillard government. They said that in the history of the town they had never seen such a cash flow into their small country town—this was $1 million. If you translate that across fewer than 200 students it does not take much to work out whether or not that was an effective way to increase the education outcomes for each of those children. I have to say that the parents I met at the school on that day were highly questioning of the appropriateness of the way in which that was being delivered. They said, 'If the government wants to throw $1 million at us we are hardly going to say no to it.' The point was that there was no real belief that it was going to change the education outcomes.


That is just one example. Look at the computers in schools program. Every student would have a computer on their desk. When Prime Minister Gillard was education minister, we remember that. It changed over time. How did that improve the standards of the kids? Not one person on the other side of the chamber could attest to the fact that this program in any way demonstrably increased the education outcomes for those students. We have already seen $14.5 billion—we are talking here about $9 billion by 2019—spent in building structures with no suggestion that this has in any way improved the education outcome of a single student. If the government is serious about increasing education outcomes for all Australian students they would have had a far more comprehensive and appropriate look at the way in which they do it. History suggests that this is not going to be the case.


The federal budget impact shows that we are actually looking at a $315 million reduction in school funding over the forward estimates for the next four years. I have with me some four pages listing Victorian schools and the way they will be affected by this funding decision. They will be dramatically affected by this funding arrangement.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator KROGER:
  I would be delighted to take the interjection I have just heard across the chamber, because I would like to ask why it is that small Catholic schools with very low funding thresholds are able to deliver higher education standards than so many other schools that have a higher and stronger funding model. There are many Catholic schools and independent schools operating on small and tight budgets that successfully come up with good education outcomes. In my mind there is one real reason for that: it is to do with teacher quality. During the recently concluded 'Teaching and learning—maximising our investment in Australian schools' Senate inquiry—and, Madam Acting Deputy President, you participated in this inquiry—we heard about the critical role of the teachers in terms of the education outcomes of the kids; it is by raising the standard of the teachers and actually rewarding them and rewarding the very good, effective and committed teachers who have the greatest impact on the students. During the inquiry you will recall a young man, a refugee, who I think was from a school in Cranbourne, Victoria, who was so concerned about marginalisation within the school that he took it upon himself, with the support of teachers, to run programs within the school. This was out of left field. It was the teachers themselves who identified the strength of what he was doing and supported him. It has made a difference to that school today.


I hate to say it, but this policy is not worth the paper it is printed on. The government is a disgrace. This is another public policy that should be tossed out the door. (Time expired)

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-06-26,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:06):  I rise to speak about the Australian Education Bill 2013. The education bill is to be commended for identifying five key areas needing reform. There is no doubt that education reform is necessary. Teaching standards need to be improved. Some students are missing out on a quality education. More opportunities must be provided for students with disabilities. The objectives are praiseworthy. But there is no consensus that the Australian Education Bill provides a solution.


This bill has caused enormous dissension in the community. It has created a division between primary and secondary schooling and tertiary education by stealing from Peter to pay Paul. The increased funding to schools is at the expense of the university sector. This has alienated both the vice-chancellors and the Tertiary Education Union.


There are still many unanswered questions in relation to primary and secondary education. I have had overwhelming representation from constituents concerned that their questions relating to the bills have not been answered by the minister, despite representation from parents, schools and organisations as significant as the Catholic Education Office. The Catholic education sector is responsible for educating 23 per cent of Australian students. It does so on 90 per cent of what is spent per capita on students in government schools. This 90 per cent comprises government funding and parental fee contribution. These schools still have questions in relation to funding under these bills. A considerable number of its schools are disadvantaged and in low-socioeconomic areas. There is clearly a need to provide additional funding to close this gap between Catholic schools and government schools. Further, there is no guarantee that government funding to Catholic schools will keep pace with the cost of educating children in government schools.


While the bills propose higher levels of funding for students with disabilities, this must be guaranteed for all students, regardless of the school that they attend. It is not clear to parents or to schools as to how these bills will assist students in Australian schools. It is not clear as to how this will occur through increasing the level of government bureaucracy. What is needed is a real improvement in teacher education so that the needs of all students can be met. Educational theory outlines many modes of learning and assessment. Despite this, focus on teaching and assessment is becoming narrower, as evidenced by NAPLAN testing, which ignores the needs of visual, manual and practical learning. Most schools have responded by narrowing their teaching to drilling students in order to maximise NAPLAN results.


Interestingly, those schools that have improved their NAPLAN performance are those that have broadened their curriculums along the lines of inquiry based learning. One of these schools is a Catholic school in a low-socioeconomic area in Ballarat. All teachers need training to identify even common learning issues such as dyslexia, which affects 10 per cent of students in schools. Teachers need to be trained in appropriate strategies to assist these students. Until this happens, many students will continue to disengage from the education system because it does not meet their needs.


The answer to improving education is more diversity and broader choices in education. One of the aims of these bills is to empower school leadership. Again, it is hard to imagine how this will occur when schools are burdened with additional bureaucracy and greater compliance measures. These bills, combined with the introduction of a national curriculum, can potentially narrow schooling and education choices. What is needed is imagination and innovation.


One way of encouraging diversity is to give families more choice in the type of education provided to their children rather than simply a system that concentrates power in the hands of the federal government. A voucher system or tax credits to parents to enable them to choose their child's school would both empower parents and promote excellence in education. The schools providing appropriate and targeted education would receive greater patronage.


The UK has moved in the direction of community involvement and community responsibility for education by the mutualisation of schools. The schools are run by stakeholders—parents, teachers and even students—who have a direct interest in the outcomes. It is early days but such innovations are showing great promise. We do not need more of the same. We do not need more bureaucracy. We do not need greater federal control of education. I will not be supporting these bills.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:12):  I rise to make some comments on the legislation before us today. The amended Australian Education Bill 2013 and related bills establish a new federal funding model formula for non-government schools. The legislation has also been amended to include different funding arrangements for government schools dependent on whether their state government has agreed to the changes. The states and territories, as we all know, have until 30 June to agree to the new school funding model. Only New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia have entered into an agreement with the federal government to date.


Under the schooling resource standard, all participating schools—and all non-government schools are deemed to be participating schools—are entitled to a base amount of funding for every student. The base amount of funding per primary student is $9,271 and per secondary student is $12,193. The SRS amount is indexed annually by three per cent.


I will confine my remarks to a shorter period of time today to leave as much time as possible for other colleagues to make contributions, given that we are being guillotined and are ceasing this debate at one o'clock. The fact that we have such a limited time—as other colleagues have said—to debate these bills is absolutely deplorable. It comes back to the fact that this government has no ability not only to run the country properly but to run the chamber and the process of parliament properly. This does an absolute disservice to particularly our families and students around this nation, who deserve to have the parliament be given the opportunity to properly scrutinise this legislation.


And it has indeed been a shambolic process. In 2012, the original Australian Education Bill was just nine pages long. It contained myriad motherhood statements. The amended legislation being rushed through the parliament is now 129 pages long. We simply cannot give this new legislation that is before us an appropriate level of scrutiny in the short amount of time available.


And it is a shambolic process. We have only three of the states lined up, as I said. They have until 30 June to agree or disagree with the federal government about whether or not they are going to sign up. Yet we see the legislation coming before the parliament today to be finalised. It is a completely shambolic process. And Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory still have real concerns. I understand that Tasmania has concerns about the power that is going to sit with the federal minister, and I understand that is on the record. I will make some brief comment on the position of New South Wales. My good friend the minister in New South Wales, Adrian Piccoli, has indeed signed up—in good faith, from his New South Wales perspective. But from my perspective as a federal senator I have to look at the entire nation and how this piece of legislation is going to affect all states and territories.


This is all far too late—this last-minute rush. We are talking about an incredibly and complicated new process to be applied to our schools through this piece of legislation, and this model is to begin on 1 January 2014. That is an extraordinary ask on those schools, and on those who run the schools—who, as I understand it, say that this type of process normally takes 12 to 18 months to bed down. Yet, because of the shambolic nature of this government, we are now looking at a mere few months by which this model is supposed to be in place. But look at this government's history of implementing policy. Perhaps if it had been a government—as my good colleague the shadow minister, the member for Sturt in the other place, said—that had a track record of good delivery of good policy, we might perhaps not be quite so concerned about the short time frame. But think about this government's history—and I keep using the word 'shambolic', because it is the one I find most appropriate—of policy implementation, such as the pink batts debacle, the absolute disaster of the overpriced school halls and the snap ban of the live export trade; in terms of a policy disaster, that one has to be one of the worst we have seen from this government—but that is a discussion for another day.


So on this side of the chamber we certainly do not have any confidence that this government can have this model implemented, have this policy properly run through by the due date of 1 January. Interestingly, in the Gonski report we saw that $6½ billion was supposed to go to this. Over the forward estimates, over the four years, the expectation then would be $26 billion. But what we have actually seen from this government over the forward estimates is a $325 million cut. Then we are supposed to believe that this is going to turn into some sort of river of gold—$7.8 billion—in years 5 and 6. Again, on this side of the chamber we just have no confidence in this government that they will be able to either (a) deliver the model in time or (b) deliver the funding that is indeed necessary.


And the lack of clarity that we have seen continues. There has been a lot of confusion and concern in the community. Through the Senate estimates process I have tried over a long period of time now, as has my very good colleague Senator Mason, to ascertain some detail as to how this model is going to work. And I have to say, until very recently there was very, very little information. There is now, of course, some information in the amendments—on the loadings and the relevant definitions for regional and remote schools—and also information available on the Better Schools website. But there is still a real difficulty in deciphering how the new funding system will actually operate—how it is going to translate into dollar terms for individual schools. And there is still a lot of confusion in the school sector as to what the funding changes actually mean.


In the recent budget estimates I asked where I personally could go to see the actual impact on regional schools—my specific area of interest—and was told that anyone trying to decipher the impact of the changes would have to know the school's current finances, size, location and so on and then refer to the complex amendments to the bill and apply some very confusing formulas. So it is not at all surprising that there is a pervasive belief out there in the community that there is still such a lack of clarity around this.


The Council of Catholic School Parents and the NSW Parents' Council indicated earlier in June that it is an overly complex, convoluted model that lacks transparency, that they cannot see what the school's actual funding is. The president of the NSW Parents' Council, Stephen Grieve, said:


If a doctor of mathematics cannot understand the model and what funding our children will get next year, how are parents meant to comprehend the bill?


I think that is one of the real flaws: we do not have the transparency necessary to see how this is going to operate. Unfortunately, words of comfort and surety from the government just do not cut it on this side of the chamber, because we simply do not have the confidence in this government that what they are saying will actually happen.


We also have some concerns around the new tool that is apparently coming in in 2017, around the individual parental capacity to pay. Now the minister has said that what he actually meant was the aggregate parental capacity to pay. But the legislation still says 'individual'. How is this going to play out for those parents and families out in our communities? Is this going to be a means test? And how is it going to work? We have no problem, on this side of the chamber, with improving outcomes in education for students. But we do not want to see this lack of clarity resulting in negative impacts on those families and students in the school sector—particularly, from my point of view and from that of many of my colleagues, those in the regional school sector.


Money itself is not going to solve these problems. As my very good colleague Senator Mason said earlier, a bucket of money is not going to solve this. And unfortunately this government relies all too often on a bucket of money, thinking it is going to solve a problem. Indeed, we only have to look at the NBN to see that this is a principle that this government has tried time and time again. Money itself is not going to solve these problems.


While I understand that a lot of the schools realise, as we do, that financial assistance is going to be necessary for some of this improvement, we actually need to look at and focus on things like principal autonomy, parental engagement, a strong and robust curriculum and teacher quality. If those things are not improved, no amount of money thrown into the system is going to make the slightest bit of difference, unless attached to that is the deliberative and proper assessment of how we actually improve those things for students in those schools.


I was going to go on with a number of other areas but, as I say, in deference to other colleagues who I know want to speak, I will cut my comments short. But I do have to say that I believe that there has been a real lack of consultation with and information provision to, in particular, the regional communities, in terms of this government getting out there and communicating and properly consulting with regional communities. The information that has come through to us in the Senate estimates process has been very weighted to the city areas, and that is absolutely not acceptable.


The other thing that is not acceptable is the $2.8 billion worth of cuts that the government has put in place, hitting the university sector and our students, to try and pay for this. If this government had not racked up around $256 billion worth of debt, now heading towards $370 billion, we would not be looking at the funding cuts that we are seeing in the university sector and for those students. That is simply wrong and just shows that this government has absolutely no ability to manage money. Our students should not have to be cash cows for this Labor government to pay for a policy that it wants to put in place.


On this side of the chamber, as I say, we are absolutely supportive of making sure that our students get the best opportunities they possibly can through their schooling life—particularly those students in regional schools, right across those regional areas. That is my particular focus. We will continue to support those students and families to ensure that they have better outcomes in the future.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:24):  It was the Chinese philosopher Confucius who said this: 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for 10 years, plant trees; if your plan is for 100 years, educate your children.' Nobody in this chamber would argue with the point on which Senator Nash concluded: that all of us have a very keen interest, obviously, in the best education for our children.


It is with great disappointment that I rise to oppose the Australian Education Bill 2013 and its associated legislation. As the deputy chair of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee, it is a great disappointment to me that a circumstance developed that in the other place there was less than two hours debate on 70 pages of amendments associated with the legislation. It was only last week, on 18 June, that the Senate referred the bills to the committee of which I am the deputy chairman, with the need for an inquiry and a report by 20 August 2013—an entirely reasonable time. Unfortunately, that was cut short by the majority members from the Labor government, to the extent that there would then be only three days—three days!—of opportunity for parties to make a submission, which concluded on Friday, 21 June, for a report on Monday, 24 June. In other words, there was to be expenditure by state and federal governments—in other words, taxpayers—of some $100 billion over the forward estimates, and there was only three days' opportunity for people to place submissions, and no time at all for there to be a hearing or hearings held. That is the disdain in which this government holds the people and the parliament and, more particularly, this Senate.


People might say, 'Look, there've been plenty of opportunities to debate the issues over time.' But there simply has not been put before interested parties and those vitally affected by this legislation anywhere near the documentation necessary for them to become informed and to advise their own constituents. So we have had a totally and utterly limited period of time. We have had no chance to scrutinise the submissions. We have had no chance to test the witnesses. And we are now being asked to approve this legislation. This is just totally and utterly unacceptable.


I will go very briefly to some of the submissions placed in those 72 hours. The themes of the complexity of the legislation and the lack of clarity ran through nearly all of them. The Independent Schools Council of Australia said:


The timing of the passage of these pieces of legislation is critical for non-government schools, as current Commonwealth Government funding arrangements expire at the end of 2013.


That is a mere six months away. The complexity of the legislation, particularly as it related to indexation, was a matter of enormous concern, and still has not been answered. Criticism of the lack of clarity also came from state governments, the Queensland government pointing out the plethora of detailed examples of the lack of clarity, the following being just one of them:


The Bill sets out a complex set of authorities and relationships, which is compounded when overlaid with participating and non-participating status. In parts, the Bill switches between concepts of 'participating schools' and 'participating states and territories'.


And on it goes. There were also pleas that the government would release the year-by-year figures for the next three years, where Commonwealth education funding goes backwards in each state and territory; they were unaddressed.


Submissions also mentioned the lack of consultation. I will illustrate the way in which this government consults with some newspaper headlines. For example, under the headline 'Gillard to punish Gonski hold-outs' we read:


JULIA Gillard will punish recalcitrant states that refuse to sign up to the government's education reforms with lower funding for their schools.


In a Victorian paper, under the headline 'Schools face burdens irrespective of the Gonski deal,' we read:


Brighton Secondary College principal Julie Podbury said state schools already wrote plans for improvement.


So why is there the necessity for a Canberra bureaucrat or a plethora of Canberra bureaucrats? As to the Northern Territory, Prime Minister Gillard not only threatened to impose difficulties for the Northern Territory government in the education space, but also made it very clear that other funding from the federal government to the Northern Territory may be adversely affected. As to Queensland, under the headline 'Gonski gets zilch, state goes local', we read that:


THE Newman government will forge ahead with its own education reforms, refusing to allocate funds to support the commonwealth's Gonski blueprint …


This is the way in which this federal government consults. 'Private schools tucked into Gonski'—Catholic and independent schools will be locked into the Gonski funding model regardless of whether Prime Minister Julia Gillard can convince more states and territories to sign up.


I come to my own state of Western Australia, which was offered a paltry $138 million over six years to sign away its schools to federal control in Canberra at a time when the New South Wales government was offered $5 billion. When I asked in estimates how this could be, do you know what the answer was? The answer was that because, over time, failed Labor governments in New South Wales, some of them led by now Senator Bob Carr, had failed to invest in state education in New South Wales and therefore they needed extra funding to bring them up to a standard at which they should always have been. In our state of Western Australia, under Premier Barnett and premiers before him, including Labor and the Liberal coalition, there was heavy investment.


In estimates I challenged the minister about how it could be that one state could get $5 billion and the other $138 million. Prime Minister Gillard rushed over to WA and she would appear to have increased the $138 million to $900 million. We have no idea where the money is coming from, but who cares with this mob when we have $300 billion of debt and we are paying a billion dollars a month interest on the debt at the moment. It turns out that the $900 million was actually $300 million of state money. Take that away, Senator Mason, and there is $600 million left. It sounds wonderful, doesn't it? How many years was it over? Six years. Premier Barnett told us the other day that the Western Australian budget for running the state schools is $4 billion a year, and Prime Minister Gillard, in return for the states handing over control, was throwing around $600 million of money she did not have and certainly gave no indication of where it was coming from.


'Review for rebel state schools'—the list goes on. This is how this government consults with its stakeholders. Breaches in previous undertakings by the Commonwealth was evident in submissions from witnesses to this particular inquiry who could not appear at a hearing because one was not permitted. The Tasmanian government, a Labor government, submitted that the bill as drafted ignores the roles and responsibilities as agreed, providing the Commonwealth with the ability to impose prescriptive policy and operational requirements on school systems and schools, both government and non-government.


I propose to conclude on this matter, if I may, to allow others to speak, by drawing attention to an inquiry which you, Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, were a participant in recently: the teaching and learning inquiry of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee. I am proud to say that the report and recommendations were unanimous from everybody who participated. These were the principles that we considered were necessary to improve teaching and learning in this country. The first: active involvement by parents from the youngest age of their children. That is not a high-cost factor; it does not get a guernsey in this funding. The second: the need for school autonomy, as exhibited, for example, in Finland. What does this legislation do? It takes school autonomy away. A principal cannot employ a teacher or sack a teacher; they have to put a plan to a bureaucrat in Canberra. Where would decisions be best made for the Turkey Creek school in the Kimberley? Where would decisions best be made for the Mukinbudin Primary School in the wheat belt? Not here in Canberra. The committee rejected the concept that, by definition, low socioeconomic students must be automatically disadvantaged in their education outcomes. That is something that our committee came up with. I must say, in deference to the recommendations of Gonski and his colleagues, that was a matter that they picked up.


Other principles included: professional learning by teachers practically in the schools, day to day; and curriculum and curriculum development devolved down to the level where the principal and the staff are best equipped. Senator Mason, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, the unfortunate thing is that, once again, an opportunity has been missed, money has been grossly wasted, and there has been a lack of consultation with the stakeholders, be they state, Catholic or independent schools, and there is a circumstance where we will not receive the outcomes. We will have growth management by Canberra and a waste of taxpayers' money.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:35):  I indicate that I share the concerns of Senator Mason and Senator Back in relation to the lack of appropriate process in the way that these bills have been rushed through and the lack of adequate debate. This is not the way to run a parliament. Respectfully, this is not the way to deal with such an important package of legislation.


There is a wonderful quote from WB Yeats that sums up how I feel about education. He said:


Education is not the filling a pail but the lighting of a fire.


My fear with this bill is that the government is too narrowly focused on filling a pail full of money rather than igniting the debate we must have about better outcomes for students. Sometimes one can lead to the other, but, without a clear policy framework and the right objectives, we will continue to fail our students and ultimately the nation.


A lot has been said about the decline in Australia's literacy and numeracy levels. There are many different arguments about how we should fix this: more tests, fewer tests, more money for students, more money for teachers—the list goes on and on. Something that is often forgotten is how we value learning and education as a nation. Governments value it because—forgive me for sounding cynical—there are votes to be won when you promise to fix a problem. Academics and commentators value it because they know its importance to our nation. And teachers and educators value it because they know what it is like to see a child or an adult gain understanding—the light that goes on when something suddenly becomes clear and it all makes sense. But do we as a nation value it? Do we value our teachers, our schools and our capacity for higher education? In my view, we do not—not enough.


In December last year the Australian Council for Educational Research released a report on the most recent international studies of student achievement. The council stated:


The study revealed that many Australian Year 4 students have substantial literacy problems, with around one-quarter of students not meeting the Intermediate benchmark – the standard generally considered in international achievement studies to be the minimally acceptable standard of proficiency.


The report went on to find that Australian students achieved a mean score of 505 in year 8 mathematics. South Korea, which was a top-performing country, achieved a mean score of 613. Further, 37 per cent of Australian students did not meet the Intermediate benchmark, 26 per cent achieved the Low international benchmark and 11 per cent were below this level.


How do we make up this lost ground? Ben Jensen, the director of the Grattan Institute's School Education Program, wrote an excellent opinion piece for the Weekend Australian earlier this year, in February, in which he called for better support and skills development for teachers, rather than more funding for schools. Jensen has approached the problem in a way that I find non-ideological and nonpartisan. I think we need to listen to voices such as his in this debate. Jensen said:


For decades, politicians and educators have argued over funding, and whether more money should go to public or private schools. As they did, children's learning was neglected. Our primary school students have the lowest literacy levels of any country in the English-speaking developed world. The performance of our secondary students is falling. The average 15-year-old maths student in Australia performs at a level two years below their counterpart in Shanghai.


Jensen goes on:


It is an appalling situation. The schools debate in Australia has always focused on money: how much and who gets what. How children learn and how to help them learn better, has been pushed aside.


It is time for a new story in Australian school education. Not whether public or private is better or deserves more funds, not whether teacher and principal performance pay, school autonomy or computers will lift the quality of our schools. Not wasting money on reducing class sizes.


None of these policies has been found to do much at all for student learning. Instead, the world's best school systems—in Finland, Ontario, Singapore and Shanghai—focus relentlessly on how to improve what happens in the classroom.


To me, that makes perfect sense. Of course schools need funding to meet their needs. But, in my view, there is no point in having an iPad for every child if their teacher does not have the skills or support to teach them to read. What is more, teachers are no longer just educators; they are adjudicators, psychologists, enforcers, philosophers, even nutritionists, sports coaches and career counsellors. 


Our expectations of what teachers should do have gone far beyond 'the three Rs'. Instead, they are expected to coach and support children in all facets of life during their time at school. But, too often, what they spend their time doing is everything but teaching basic literacy and numeracy skills. The ever-growing gap between the haves and have-nots in Australia means that many children are simply slipping through the cracks. Teachers have far too little support when it comes to dealing with the complex problems children often bring with them to school, and that lack of support means other children sometimes just do not get a look in.


Of course I support a better and fairer funding model for our schools. But if it is not linked to meaningful outcomes, and it does not teach more kids to read and add up, then this policy, in itself, will not work. It is not a simple equation. Money in does not equal education out. That is why the focus, after this bill is passed, must be on making sure that Australian kids not only do not slip further behind internationally but also are given a chance to reach their full potential.


Finally, Madam Acting Deputy President, often a work of fiction has a ring of truth to it, and I know you are a fan of this particular program. I would like to finish off with a quote from Sam Seaborn of Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing. Justifying his position on education funding, he said:


…education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. That's my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.


Seguing from The West Wing to what we are dealing with here, I am not convinced, sadly, that this bill has figured out how to do it either. But I hope this legislation can be used as a building block to achieve the reforms every Australian child deserves.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-06-26,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (12:42):  I did not want to spend too much time, in the very limited time we have, making the point that, yet again, there is legislation being rushed through here. But, perhaps quoting from the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Campbell Newman, in a submission he made to the education, employment and workplace relations committee inquiry, will suffice to give people the details of how appalling the inquiry into this bill has been. I quote from the letter, which says: 'The fact that your committee received a reference for an inquiry on 19 June requiring submissions by 21 June 2013 and reporting by 24 June indicates their contempt for the business of government and of the Australian parliament by the federal government.' It is impossible to disagree with that. I think it succinctly puts the very poor process that we have in place, and we continue to have poor processes all over the place in terms of this legislation.


I am particularly interested in the effect of this legislation on students with disability. As an unintended consequence, this legislation may be causing a preference for special schools over mainstream schools. There is no explanation anywhere for why the loading for students with a disability in special schools should be 20 per cent higher than the loading for students with a disability in mainstream schools. The suggestion seems to be that this is a temporary loading for special schools, but this is not spelt out, and a number of people who submitted in the lightning-fast time they had to address this inquiry were not confident that this was the case. But, even so, why is it there?


There is nothing specific in the bill or in the regulation that creates any concrete expectations that education systems will be able to delivery fully on the national disability standards, or that Australia's obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will be met. It would seem quite relevant to me, and it was certainly a position put by Children with Disability Australia that, at the very minimum, the obligations of this government to meet those standards should be referenced somewhere in the bill.


We have the situation where the loadings appear to be set up in such a way as to encourage short-termism and encourage lack of resources in the sector of education for students with a disability. There is a high degree of difficulty associated with the development of a disability loading, and there is a lot yet to be finalised and introduced. There is no clarity around the reform package, but there is also no clarity around how it will apply to students with a disability. Of course, the odds of us getting a successful outcome on this are very low. I would have thought that the government could have acknowledged—in what has been referred to as the rhetoric and aspiration in this document—that, as Senator Xenophon was pointing out earlier, not just the academic performance of our schools across the board as something to be ashamed of, but our treatment of children with disability is something to be particularly ashamed of.


Children with Disability Australia described it as a national disgrace. They pointed out that 63 per cent of school children with a disability experience difficulty fitting in at school, 29.6 per cent of people between 15 and 64 with a disability completed year 12 compared to 49.3 per cent of people without a disability—that is almost half. They added that 12.7 per cent of people with a disability have a bachelor's degree or higher, and for people without a disability that figure is 19.7 per cent. Around 15 per cent of Australia's students require additional assistance, but only five per cent receive funded support. Clearly, improving these measures over time is complex, but getting a start on it is urgent. Students with disability have been marginalised in our system for long enough, and it beggars belief that, in 2013, this government would think that a system that somehow preferences special schools over students with disability in mainstream schools is a good thing. It is just unbelievable.


As I said, the loading system has been set up in such a way that it would appear to disadvantage mainstream schools which make the effort to follow the law and do their job of accepting students with a disability. The funding is on a per-student basis. There is no requirement for how the funding would be distributed within systems, and the loading appears to be payable for the year's enrolment that you have now. Whilst extending the national partnership agreement for More Support for Students with Disabilities is a start, it does not help with the issue of stop-start funding and no funding to improve the resources or the learning. It is just funding per student per year with nothing into the future. It is not endemic, it is not recurrent and it is not permanent. It is an unusual and difficult mess. I would urge the government to keep in mind that we must not end up with a system that has the perverse effect of giving special schools higher funding than mainstream schools that have students with a disability.


I would like to conclude my remarks so that others can speak by pointing out another comment from the Queensland Premier, the Hon. Campbell Newman, who makes the point that, I think, Ms Gillard continues to forget. The Queensland government is the owner and manager of state schools and is the regulator of non-state schools and provides nearly 90 per cent of government funding for state schools. The Queensland government aims to remove needless red tape and regulation in general and will not support the federal government adding even more regulation. I have no idea why Ms Gillard would be surprised that the majority of states have not signed up to her 'con-ski' reform, as has been referred to by the shadow education minister, Christopher Pyne. It is disappointing that this government have gone about it in this way. I would urge them to have a look at the way they are intending to fund provisions for disadvantaged students and for students with a disability and to make sure that, if this were to occur, there would be no adverse consequences.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:51):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Bill 2013, the related bill, and the 70-odd amendments. I think it is a record, and I would appreciate somebody telling me whether it is, but it is one of many records for this government. The thematic approach we have heard this morning from the speakers in this debate is one of waste, lack of consultation and disregard for good governance and for good parliamentary process. It is a thematic line that this Gillard government and the Rudd government seem to have lived by and will die by.


In its politicised DNA, partisan to the end, the Gillard government is using education policy to divide. As a former educator I am greatly disappointed to be standing here now, after work has been done on a needs based model to ensure that education right across our nation is of a high standard and quality, with state pitted again state, system against system, in a bidding war. 


The Prime Minister's approach to premiers has just beggared belief throughout this. We have heard some representations about that here today in the states' house. Tasmania is going through a grab for cash. I am sure at the ALP state conference on the weekend there will be the wrapped-up-in-a-box signature that everyone is looking for, but that will not happen before the Premier of Tasmania has sought to ensure that it will not lose the $105 million of extra GST funds it already receives for education.


In media reports there were comments earlier from the Northern Territory about how the Prime Minister is approaching a co-operative and supportive conversation about something of such national significance as a 'once-in-a-generation change to our education system'. She has asked for a response by the NT and has warned that funding under the national partnership agreement may be reconsidered if the Territory government does not cooperate. Federal education minister, Peter Garrett, says that the Territory government is playing a dangerous game by refusing to cooperate in negotiations.


My home state of Victoria has been in the media raising concerns that it has had with this negotiation. I use the term 'negotiation' lightly because it implies a conversation. Minister Dixon wrote to the Commonwealth at the start of this month asking to hold joint negotiations. Similarly, there have been concerns raised in the media, from Victoria's perspective, about constitutional issues with the bill before us. We know—it has been mentioned before—that until a couple of weeks ago this was just an aspirational piece of paper that nobody who cares about the future of our nation and the quality of education being delivered to our young people right across this nation could disagree with. Yet, as always, the devil is in the detail—and we have the devil before us today. The constitutional issues were raised by numerous states including, earlier this week in Tasmania, by Premier Giddings. 


There are concerns about increased Commonwealth policy oversight of state schools through the National Plan for School Improvement. This is yet another attempt by the Gillard government to grab power from the states and override the states' constitutional obligation to be in control of what happens on the ground within their own jurisdictions when it comes to education. 


Haste has meant that none of these issues has been able to be examined and considered by the Senate and our systems. The Australian people expect us to be thorough in this place on their behalf; not to spend their money—$100 billion—without scrutiny. That is exactly why every single one of us is in this chamber. We are here not just to govern but also, on behalf of the Australian people, to consider the devil in the detail, to come to some conclusions and to proceed from there. But this government is careless with our democracy.


Issues were raised. As has been mentioned, I was part of the inquiry into the aspirational four-page document and the much more detailed 129-page document, with its 70-odd amendments—the three-day inquiry, as Senator Back and I like to call it. There was no opportunity to seek clarification on written submissions and to delve further into the detail that stakeholders had raised. 


I would like to counter some of the claims that Senator Pratt made in her commentary on regional schools in WA. She said that if the Nationals were serious about standing up for kids attending schools in regional areas then they would be backing this bill. That is exactly why you have to look at the detail, Senator Pratt. When you look at the mechanism that is being used to determine the loading for location under this model you find that it is the ARIA model. That is fine if you are in a regional school in WA but if you are in a regional school in Victoria that has a different meaning and there is a different understanding of it. Under the ARIA model, as we discovered in estimates, relative to regional schools in WA, Victorian regional schools will be worse off. So check the Hansard on that one and get back to me. Unfortunately, in two minutes the time for debate will be over so we will not be able to hear the response from the government on that.


So this debate has been a farce and reduced to emotive slogans that even the owner of the name seems not to back, as these bills—and, more importantly, the negotiated reality—have skewed the report from David Gonski, which I think was delivered in December 2011. So, this is not a new conversation. Whilst we have had 70 amendments, with the devil in their detail, before us for a couple of weeks, we have been talking about this for 2½ years. 



A government senator interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Minister, you may say, 'Exactly!' but then you are expecting stakeholders and states to back the slogans without being able to go through the detail. It is not an appropriate way to govern and it is not a once-in-a-generation reform. 


Finally, I would like to reject outright any aspersions that the coalition does not back, as the birth right of every single citizen of this nation, the right to a quality education, private or public. For people across the way to assume that, because we want to scrutinise this—because state governments that are governed by parties that are on our side of politics are not rushing to sign up, because we have some questions we want to prosecute, because we do not want potentially to throw $100 billion away, because we want to get right—we do not think it is the birthright of every young Australian to receive a quality education, is offensive in the extreme.


Those of us on this side of the chamber know that, of the million young people that attend school in this country outside metropolitan cities, 660,000 attend state schools. So how can we back our communities without backing quality education in the regions in state schools that are focused on student outcomes? That, again brings me to the objectives in part 3(1)(i). As an educator I have real issues with a quality education being determined by a PISA result. That concern is actually shared by the AEU and the IEU, and I suggest you check out their quotes in our report to this bill. A quality education cannot simply be measured by statistics. The top five, by 2025—what a ridiculous measure to ascertain the quality of our education and—

The PRESIDENT
 (13:59):  Order! Today is a significant day for the Senate. After 37 years in the radio commentary booth, Terry Malcolm is about to retire. His last question time from the Senate is today. Terry began parliamentary broadcasting in 1976 when presenters were confined to a tiny booth overlooking the chamber at what is now known as Old Parliament House. Terry has ridden a wave of change since then, including the establishment of the radio service at what we know today as New Parliament House. 


Terry Malcolm has an abiding affection for Australian democracy. For a decade, he was the chief of staff for ABC NewsRadio's parliamentary broadcasting team. He was also a parliamentary guide for a similar length of time. For more than a third of a century, it was a rare parliamentary year that ended without Terry Malcolm's voice featuring in it; a year without Terry on ABC Radio at all was even rarer. Even after 37 years, Terry Malcolm has approached each day's broadcast with the same rigorous commitment to detail, clarity and professionalism. On behalf all senators, I wish Terry the very best in his retirement.


For the sake of the Hansard record, whilst clapping cannot be recorded in the Hansard, neither can the nod of appreciation from Terry, but that should also be included.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or explanation.


Obviously, it is not Senator Conroy's fault if the minister that he represents in here has not sent across a brief. But we have been in touch with the minister for environment; we gave them plenty of notice that I was going to put this matter to the chamber. As everyone in this chamber knows, answers to questions on notice are due within 30 days and the clock is running down on this parliament, and I am very keen for an answer to this question because it pertains to events occurring right now in my home state of Western Australia. This question, having been asked on 16 May 2013, should actually have been answered last week. It concerns a recommendation in April by the Western Australian EPA that the unwanted and obsolete Point Peron canal development should proceed so long as it meets certain conditions.


I would like to categorically emphasise the absolute rejection of this approval by the scientific community and the broader community of the region. Three hundred and eighty individual questions and matters have been submitted as part of the EPA appeal process. It is not just me who is keen for an answer; there are at least 8,000 people in Rockingham also waiting on an answer about the future of their backyard.


Point Peron is a place that they consider and we in the Greens consider is too precious to lose. This is a place that they and we will fight ferociously to defend from Premier Barnett's absolutely preposterous and obsolete 1980s-style canal housing development, which nobody in the region wants. If it is allowed to proceed, it will see the regional park on Point Peron bulldozed; the seagrass meadows and marine habitat of penguins, dolphins, fisheries and countless species in Mangles Bay dredged; and the adjoining freshwater Lake Richmond, which is home to one of just two surviving ancient thrombolite communities in WA, impacted very severely upon.


Question 2980 has several components, on all of these issues, and environmental vandalism is part and parcel of the Barnett government's unhappy reign. These issues are raised every day by the Greens across Australia as the only voice in parliament that is actually standing up for our precious environment.


This particular case is very different. The land in question was transferred from the Commonwealth to the state of Western Australia in 1964 on the strict condition that its future use be restricted to a reserve for recreation and/or parklands. The Commonwealth in 1968 then confirmed that the land must not be used for private industrial, commercial or residential development—a good commitment. Will the Commonwealth require the Western Australian government to honour these commitments—these commitments that were signed? The minister for finance in 2011 indicated in written correspondence, which I will quote: 'The Federal government has an expectation that the WA government will acknowledge the undertakings previously given in relation to the site.'


So it is a very simple question: will a written agreement signed between the state of Western Australia and the Commonwealth be honoured or not? Is a signed agreement an agreement or not? I expect an answer to my question 2980 very soon, and I ask that the government treat this particular development with the utmost caution. I would particularly commend Senator Conroy to bring a brief from the environment minister while this parliament still stands. It is not good enough for the campaigners, led by the inexhaustible Dawn Jecks, who has been pursuing state and federal governments on this matter for years; or my state Greens colleague Lynn MacLaren MLC, who has been working on this issue for years, representing the broad interests of the community of that part of the Perth metro area who do not want an unwanted and obsolete eighties-style canal development rammed into the coastline that they treat with such respect and regard.


This is a matter that the Commonwealth environment minister could put to rest very, very easily by simply noting that the Commonwealth will expect the Western Australian government to honour its agreement that was signed so many years ago when these agreements were exchanged. That is something that we believe should be clarified and resolved in this parliament and set to rest. Otherwise, we will continue to run the campaign all the way through and out the other side of the federal election, until this place is given the regard and the protection that it so richly deserves.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well, it is failure to supply. In the standing orders, there are two distinct motions. This one is not taking note of the answer.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Whatever the motion, that is the one I want to speak to.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You can speak to it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Deputy President, thank you for that guidance. I say to the previous speaker that the arrogance shown by Minister Conroy and Minister Burke just shows the contempt in which this government holds the Australian public, and yet this is a government that Senator Ludlam and his team have kept in power for the last three years. Fancy the hypocrisy of the Greens political party in complaining about Senator Conroy and Mr Burke, when they have kept them in power in the last three years!


This refusal, the cavalier way in which ministers in this chamber simply ignore the rules of the Senate and ignore senators who ask questions and expect answers and the way in which they simply do not follow the forms of a democratic parliament—that contempt is typical of the contempt with which the Labor Party have treated Australians in the last three years, from the time when the Prime Minister promised solemnly, hand on heart, that she would never introduce a carbon tax, and then immediately and capriciously and knowingly broke that solemn promise, until today, when ministers completely ignore the processes of democracy by refusing to answer questions. When Senator Ludlam, as a Greens senator, as part of the Labor-Greens alliance, gives notice to the minister that he is going to raise this, does the minister do anything about it at all? Absolutely nothing. The contempt and the arrogance with which the Labor Party treat this parliament is palpable. 


If the people of Australia need any other reason, any other evidence, of how poor this government is, they only have to look at the way in which the Labor Party treat with contempt the people of Australia in the way they run this parliament.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:11):  I was not intending to contribute on Senator Ludlam's motion regarding Senator Conroy, but I was inspired by Senator Macdonald to do so and indeed inspired out of deep concern about the pattern of behaviour that Senator Ludlam's motion highlights with regard to Senator Conroy and the approach that he and his office take to the answering of questions. 


Senator Ludlam may come into this chamber today and complain that Senator Conroy's office and Senator Conroy have failed to answer questions in a timely manner, but this is hardly the first occasion on which such a failure has occurred. We have had countless instances, both through the chamber and in particular through the Senate estimates process, where Senator Conroy has proven himself to be a serial offender in failing to answer questions in a timely manner or within the time limit set by the standing orders for this chamber or by the committees with regard to the return of questions on notice. 


I can recall sitting in Senate estimates committees where Senator Conroy has provided answers to questions that had been asked three, four or five months previously—and he has done so not weeks, not days, not even hours before the committee is to meet again but while the committee is meeting. While the committee is meeting, some months after the preceding Senate estimates, we get answers to questions asked at the previous Senate estimates. It is a completely contemptuous approach, a terrible precedent that this minister sets as the Leader of the Government in the Senate for all his fellow ministers in terms of the standards that they should be adhering to in being accountable to the parliament. That is what questions are for—a level of accountability, accountability through questions without notice and questions on notice in this chamber and of course accountability through the Senate estimates processes. 


On all of these levels, Senator Conroy is a demonstrated failure. He fails in this place to give answers to the questions that are asked of him, he fails to answer questions on notice in any sort of timely way and he fails abysmally to provide any type of answer in relation to Senate estimates proceedings. I am pleased that Senator Ludlam has called Senator Conroy out today and brought attention to this one instance, but I would hate for anybody to leave here thinking it is just one instance. There are many other instances that Senator Conroy and other ministers in this government are guilty of, and it is to their shame, just as it is to the shame of the Australian Greens that it is only now, in the dying days of this government, that they have started to highlight such failures on the government's part.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:14):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senator Cormann, Ryan, Ruston and Williams today relating to the carbon tax. 


Three years ago, we were told by Ms Julia Gillard, the then new Prime Minister, that she was taking charge of a good government that had lost its way. That was the justification given by Ms Gillard for her unprecedented seizing of the reins of the Labor Party leadership and the prime ministership of this country from Mr Kevin Rudd. She claimed that it was a good government that had lost its way; that caused people like Senator Farrell, Senator Feeney and Mr Shorten to engineer unprecedented change; and that saw the Australian people effectively go to bed one night with one prime minister and wake up the following morning to discover they had a different prime minister. The Australian people had absolutely no say in the matter, which was decided by the factional controllers of the Labor Party. 


It may then have been a good government that had lost its way, but now it is simply a government that is lost. Whether it is under Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard, this Labor government long ago lost any sense of unity. As the old saying goes: 'If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country.' That is clear from what we see from those opposite. The ongoing civil war in this government really knows no boundaries. Long ago, this government equally lost any credibility for its financial management of the country, with the record debts we have seen, the record levels of deficit and the promises to return the country to surplus this year, only to have those promises broken. This government long ago lost the confidence of the Australian people in its ability to successfully deliver any of its programs—be they the school halls program, which saw massive cost blow-outs and caused a great waste of taxpayer money; be it the pink batts program—




Senator Carol Brown:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: my understanding was that Senator Birmingham was taking note of the answers by Senator Conroy to questions in question time today, except for Senator Abetz's question. So far, Senator Birmingham has got nowhere near the questions or the answers given. I ask you to draw him back to the questions.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Birmingham is in order. He is responding to some of the content of the answers given by Senator Conroy. As you know, there is some latitude to the debate, providing you stick to the topic. Senator Birmingham is relevant.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  This government long ago lost any ability to claim to be making Australia more competitive, especially because of its carbon price. It is one of the many features of how this government has lost its way and its credibility—the carbon tax, the mining tax and making Australia's business environment one of the least cost competitive places in the Western world to do business. It is to the shame of this government that its policies, including those discussed today, are such a demonstration of how much it has lost its way. We now have the reality that this government has lost any sense of moral compass whatsoever, as each of its members spends far more time worrying about their own jobs than they do about the jobs of other Australians. Every single member of this government seems completely preoccupied, not with the impact of the carbon tax, not with the hurt to levels of confidence in the Australian business community and not with the hurt to the competitiveness of Australian business but with the bad polls that are afflicting their government and what they can do about it by changing the Labor leadership. Now, to be frank, the government have reached the point where they have lost any right to be taken seriously at all.


The cannibalisation of the Labor government is an amazing feat to watch. We have now seen leadership ballots and battles in June 2010, in February 2012, in March 2013 and now, again, in June 2013. It would all be a big joke if it were not so serious in terms of the harm it is doing to the country and if it were not for the fact that, with the sideshow happening opposite, the government have completely lost sight of the important policies and the harm that some of their policies, like the carbon tax, are doing to the Australian people. While the sideshow continues, Australia continues to suffer, with the highest carbon tax in the world and the broadest coverage of any carbon tax in the world, with an increase next year, an increase the year after that, with the expansion of the coverage to the trucking industry and with Senator Conroy today failing to rule out hitting the family farm or family car as well.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-06-26,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:20):  Once again, today in question time we heard a perpetuation of the fear and smear campaign that those opposite have delivered consistently, along their path of opposition, as critics of the emissions-trading scheme that we have introduced as a government. Many years ago, the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy that Senator Feeney and I were both on heard at first-hand evidence from economists explaining why we needed to introduce a emissions-trading scheme in our country, to serve it well and look after our unique environment. 


Let us look at the report card on the scheme, what this scheme has delivered since 1 July. For a start, emissions in the National Electricity Market are down now by 7.4 per cent. Renewable energy generation is up almost 30 per cent. I recall, during those inquiry hearings, people coming to us and explaining the renewable energy possibilities in this country, as far down south as the Great Ocean—wave energy, solar energy, wind technology. But all of those possibilities have generated one thing that I know those opposite have an issue with, and that is jobs. They will stop the jobs in this country if they are elected, because they will wind back all our renewable energy targets and accomplishments. 


According to the report card, as a result of our emissions-trading scheme, there have been 150,000 new jobs created. If it were not for our scheme, those 150,000 jobs would not have been created. We know those opposite will stop the jobs if they are elected, as a result of them winding back the emissions-trading scheme. We also know that they will claw back the good household assistance packages that were provided to many low-income earners and pensioners around the country. Those opposite claim that they will not take those amounts back off them, but we know that is a fallacy. We know that that is the situation their actions will lead to.


Recently, I was privileged to visit a sauce manufacturing company in the southern industrial areas of Yatala, on the way down to the Gold Coast. I was down there a few weeks ago. It is only a small company—and we heard today in the chamber questions about the impact of emissions trading on small businesses. This is a small business of a little under 70 employees. But, as a result of our assistance as a government in granting them a bit over $109,000, accompanied by their own contribution, they have installed renewable energy technologies. There are solar panels on the roofs of the factory building now, generating solar energy back into the enterprise to make sure that they are getting the benefit out of doing something for the environment, because in doing that they are cutting their emissions. In addition, that is helping them to reduce their power bills by $19,000 and they are intensifying their operations by 31 per cent. That is what this sort of scheme is all about—assisting small businesses, assisting the environment and protecting people from the effects of climate change.


I want to address what is happening in my own state. Up there we have a conservative government. I have never seen such a conservative government in my life. The Liberal National Party up there—



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  Senator Sterle, I will take that interjection. It would be a stark comparison between the two states to see which is the more conservative. Up there they are increasing electricity prices twofold. We have people out on the streets after the Premier up there sacked over 25,000 employees in that state. They are struggling on their knees, yet the Liberal-National Party Premier in Queensland wants to jack up electricity prices. You can imagine what that is doing to the economy and what it will do to people in that area. It is disgraceful that we see that sort of conduct from a Liberal-National Party government in my home state of Queensland. That is just a curtain-raiser for what we will see in this nation should we be extremely unfortunate and see those opposite form government in this nation. (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:26):  I rise to also take note of the answers given by Senator Conroy to questions asked by Senators Cormann, Ryan, Williams and Ruston. I want to take the chamber back—and it is good to see a couple of TWU old fellows on the other side here to listen—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Three of you, sorry, I apologise, Senator Furner.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  Senator Feeney, the soon-to-be member for Batman I think. Of course, it would have been far better if you were a woman, Senator Feeney; it would not have caused anywhere near the controversy. But I digress. Three years ago on Monday last was the changeover to the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. What time is it? Is she still the Prime Minister? It is half past three. I am not quite sure who is the Prime Minister.




Senator Furner:
  I rise on a point of order, Deputy President. It is the same point of order that Senator Brown took earlier. The questions that were put to the government in question time related to the carbon price. The question that related to leadership and other speculation was from Senator Abetz to Senator Conroy. I draw your attention to the fact that the senator over there is misleading the chamber with regard to taking note of answers.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you for the point of order. You are starting to debate it.




Senator Feeney:
  I rise on the same point of order, Deputy President. From the government's perspective this performance is so terrible that I have no desire to interrupt it.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, Senator Feeney. Senator Edwards, I draw your attention to the motion before the chair. You have not addressed the substance of the motion in your opening remarks. I am sure you are about to move there.




Senator EDWARDS:
  I am. In relation to the carbon tax questions, I am not quite sure where I can go back to, whether to Prime Minister Rudd's ETS proposal for which he was axed and brought down without an election or whether to Prime Minister Gillard's carbon tax that she introduced after going to the election saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. However, we have got a carbon tax. In actual fact it is the biggest carbon tax in the world by far. I point out that this week the price of carbon in Europe is around five euros, which is around $6.87 in our money. And you are proposing to put it up. I was very pleased to hear that the opposition climate spokesman, Greg Hunt, moved to suspend the standing orders to allow him to call on the government to scrap the increase which is proposed for 1 July, a five per cent increase on the biggest carbon tax in the world.


I really find it quite amusing when those on the other side, the Labor Party, talk about small business. They are the only government in this country that has taken big business to small business. I know because I still am involved in business. I do not know too many small businesses that use 10 megawatt hours a year. It must be somebody sitting at home with their computer on. It works out to a $260 increase. That is a lot of hot dinners. You can dumb it down. It is called reduction to the ridiculous: $5 a week, yes. Let us just reduce it. What is that a day? It is less than a dollar a day. It does not really matter, but, on top of all the other dollars a day that have gone on in the reign of this Rudd-Gillard government, there are just so many of them.


In answer to Senator Williams on fuel for heavy transport: 'Oh, it's only 29c.'




Senator Gallacher:
  27.




Senator EDWARDS:
  He said 29c a tonne per hundred kilometres. I am quite happy for you to take it up with him, Senator Gallacher, if you think it is 27. But I will only apply it to my own experience: for 7,000 tonnes of grapes coming through a winery with an average trip of about 200 kilometres per trip, that is an increased impost on that business of $4,060 per annum. But let us just reduce it, dumb it down, to that argument where the punters out there will not have any idea as to what on earth you are talking about. Anybody that drives a truck—

  Thank you. These trucks are going to be exempt, aren't they? For what? For two years. Okay, but it is coming at you like a tsunami. Where is Tony Sheldon on this one? Where is Tony Sheldon, your boss, on all these things? He is nowhere to be seen. It is—what do they call it?—a death tax. Road users get a carbon tax. How ridiculous. They are already paying an excise, and so are mums and dads, but you did not rule that out. Senator Conroy did not rule that out in his answers, did he? And look out for the farmers: you are coming after them as well.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:32):  It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Edwards—and I say that tongue in cheek, Mr Deputy President. I just think we have to clarify a couple of silly statements from Senator Edwards. We are 'coming for the farmers'—what a ridiculous statement. The minister has made that very, very clear. You know that that is a mistruth, Senator Edwards, so just keep stirring up the scare campaign.


But can I go to another point where Senator Edwards, in his stumbling five minutes—I do not know what it was, actually; it was something to do with grapes—actually attacked the good persona of the National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Tony Sheldon, when he said, 'Where is Tony Sheldon?' Let me just remind those opposite where Tony Sheldon and thousands of Australian truck drivers were, along with this side of the federal political sphere, probably about 18 months ago when we were introducing, through the other House, through Minister Shorten, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Let us have a little walk back through history, shall we, when in this place none other than the good Senators Gallacher, Feeney and Furner and I stood up here for hours and batted. There were 30 years of my previous life, and a lot longer for the good Senator Gallacher, to bring a safe, sustainable rate to Australia's truck industry, where our truckies could go out, leave home, kiss the kids goodbye, wave goodbye to the wife, head off up north or across the Nullarbor or wherever it might be, knowing that they could have a rate that would bring them home safely, a rate that would give them the—

  And I ask you to direct him to the noting of questions.

Senator Furner:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy President: certainly during question time Senator Williams asked questions in relation to the transport industry. Senator Sterle is clearly answering the taking note of answers provided here today, based on what was provided during question time. Even Senator Macdonald had his little toy truck out there in front of him, playing with it.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Furner. Senator Sterle, you are in order. You are sticking within the realm of the debate. You have the call.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you very much for that protection.



Senator Edwards interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Edwards, that is disorderly. Senator Sterle, you have the call.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I think the five minutes of Senator Edwards was disorderly, but that is not casting aspersions on your good self. I would not do that, Mr Deputy President.


As I said, on this side of the chamber, there are those of us who fought for years to give our Australian truckies the opportunity to leave home and get home safely in one piece and to be sustainable, because they are constantly faced with a barrage of challenges and costs. We talk about this side of the chamber. May I—through you, Mr Deputy President—mention Senators Williams, Cormann, Ryan and Ruston, who all of a sudden, in a one-hour period today, have all become friends of the trucking industry. I sit here and I do listen at times. I actually do listen if I can stay awake long enough with some of the rubbish that goes on in here. But how dare they in one hour today decide to become friends of the trucking industry, to be worried about the on-road costs of Australia's heavy vehicle industry, when in this chamber last year every man and woman of them, to a T, voted against the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal? They voted as a bloc, proudly, after filibustering debate, against safe rates for Australia's truck drivers. I find it highly hypocritical. In fact, the level of hypocrisy in this place does not surprise me, but today it did tweak a little nerve.


I have to just continue there. I think to myself, 'Are they standing up for Australia's trucking industry, or are they standing up for Australia's transport operators, those small businesses like I was for 11 fantastic years?' I built my own little business; I fed my family; I built a house—with the great support of my wife. I could not have done it without her. She was home bringing up two babies while I was away every fortnight running between Perth and Darwin on my own. There was no fatigue management in those days. There were no safe rates. There was no Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. There is now today. I say thank you to the Labor government, thank you to the Greens for their support and thank you to those great Independents, who realise that truckies do deserve to get home safely to their families.


I will come back to the accusations from those four senators. How dare they pretend to be friends of the trucking industry! I invited the Leader of the Nats to have a debate—I will not use the word 'blue' because there are sooks on the other side who want to report me—in any trucking yard in Australia with any trucking operator about the value of safe rates. None of you picked it up. The Leader of the Nats did not have the intestinal fortitude to bring on a debate with me, at his calling. None of you stood up for Australia's trucking industry. You are friends of the trucking industry? Who are you really friends with? The ATA? Is it the major operators? Or is it Coles and Woolies? (Time expired)

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:38):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Conroy to questions asked today by Senators Cormann, Ryan, Williams and Ruston. I rise to talk about the people who create jobs in this country, particularly those who create jobs in South Australia, and provide a future for our young people, our children.


The problem with this government, according to Mr Crean, one of the previous ministers who was sacked, is that the Prime Minister has a tin ear because she does not listen. When it comes to the carbon tax, we see no clearer case of this tin ear. On radio in South Australia, the Prime Minister was asked by Mr David Basham, head of South Australian dairy farmers, about the impact of the carbon tax on dairy. He highlighted the fact that this was costing small businesses in South Australia between $14,000 and $25,000, which is a significant impact. The Prime Minister's response? Did she listen? Did she care? No, her response was mere rhetoric: 'Oh,' she said, 'the industry will thrive.' Have all those scary stories come true? Here was somebody telling her about the real impact on small business and about the fact that dairy farmers were losing money. When they go out of business, not only is that product not available but the jobs that are supported, both on the farms and in the associated industries, go with it.


In terms of small business, we heard Senator Conroy today say, 'Oh, well, that impact is only about two per cent to a small business.' Does he not understand that the net profit margin for many small businesses is well under 10 per cent? That is a significant hit to a small business looking to fund investment in the business and growth, as well as quite often taking their salaries out of their profit margin. It is small business that creates jobs and opportunities for young people in South Australia and it is small businesses being impacted by the carbon tax, particularly when it goes up by five per cent in July. Small businesses are often the ones who are driving vehicles powered by diesel. With the abolition of the diesel rebate in July, their costs will increase further. In a competitive market, they have very little opportunity, if any, to pass that on to their customers, which means that there are more jobs at risk.


With small businesses in South Australia that work in the area of refrigerants and with the gas R404A, the ACCC has found that, of the original price of $98 per kilogram, the carbon tax was directly responsible for a 76 per cent rise in the price of that gas—some $74.98 that the ACCC found was directly attributable to the carbon tax. For larger business, just this month the head of GMH in South Australia, responding to the closure of Ford and to calls by unions that they should manufacture the Captiva SUV in South Australia, was talking about the fact that the input costs for manufacturing in Australia are too high for them to remain competitive. He was looking at all sorts of options, including reducing wages of both executives and workers, to achieve that. But the alternative, he said, would be for the Gillard government to scrap the carbon tax. From small business, from the agricultural sector with dairy farmers through to large business, people who create jobs for South Australians have one message for this government, which is demonstrating yet again its tin ear: the carbon tax is hurting business and damaging jobs for people in South Australia.


Lastly, I come to BHP and Olympic Dam. South Australia was devastated in April 2012 when BHP announced that they were shelving plans to expand Olympic Dam. There was a lot of talk about why that might be. One of the factors people do not often look at is that in the electrolytic refining of copper, which was one of the main products coming out of Olympic Dam, electricity availability and price is one of the top considerations for the viability of that copper-mining activity. You only have to go online and look at prospectuses of people who are looking to set up mines in places like Laos and South America and you see that availability and price of electricity rates very high. When BHP made that decision to shelve their option for expanding Olympic Dam, the carbon tax was $23 a tonne and it was planned to increase by 2020 to $37 a tonne. Just at a time when BHP would be hoping to see a return on their investment and the creation of lots of jobs, the carbon tax will be $350 a tonne by 2050. Is it any wonder that industry, from miners to big business to small business, is saying that the carbon tax is a job-destroying tax for South Australians?

Leave granted.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



OVERSEAS AID (MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS) BILL 2013


As the Greens spokesperson for international aid and development I am proud to introduce this Greens bill into the Senate to ensure that Australia pays its fair share towards alleviating global poverty. 


Good aid, spent well has helped reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty by 200 million over the last 5 years. But there are still 1.2 billion people living on less than the equivalent of $2 per day. As a rich and caring country Australia has a moral duty to help bring that number of people down to zero.


The Overseas Aid (Millennium Development Goals) Bill will enshrine that moral duty into law by requiring the Australian Government to meet the aid targets it has already signed up to. It will improve the quality and effectiveness of Australian aid so that the Australian community can be assured that aid money is spent on ending poverty overseas and not to fill domestic budget gaps. It also establishes an independent aid watchdog to hold the Government to account for its aid spending decisions.


It is unfortunate that we can no longer take the major parties at their word when it comes to their commitment to international aid. At the 2010 federal election both Labor and the Coalition stood on election platforms promising to increase aid to 0.5% of Australia's gross national income by 2015-16. As recently as November 2011 both Labor and the Coalition voted in support of a Greens motion in the Senate reaffirming this commitment.


Yet at the May 2012 budget the Labor Government postponed the 0.5% deadline for a year and in response the Coalition dropped its commitment to a timetable altogether. This was followed by the December 2012 decision to divert $375 million out of the overseas aid program to pay for onshore immigration detention – a gross misuse of aid money that flies in the face of the Government's own aid spending guidelines which it set out just one year ago. 


In May the Labor Government postponed the deadline for a further year, which means its 0.5% target now won't be reached until 2017-18.


These are not just broken promises to the Australian voters. These are promises that Australia made to the international community, the United Nations, and to women, men and children, who are forced to do what they can to survive each day on less than the price of a cup of coffee.


And they come with a financial cost. The May 2013 budget cut real aid spending by $2.9 billion over the next 4 years, compared to what was promised just one year previously. That includes $1.9 billion cut by postponing the 0.5% target to 2017-18 and $1 billion diverted to onshore immigration detention. That diversion has now been made a permanent feature of Labor's aid budget.


Just think about what $2.9 billion could do for people living in poverty and how much of a difference it could make.


The Government's 2011-2012 Annual Review of Aid Effectiveness found that Australian aid spending in that year had paid for life-saving assistance for more than 16 million people caught in disasters, clean water for 2.5 million people, immunisations for more than 2 million children, better sanitation for 1.6 million people, schools for more than 1 million children, and skilled birth attendants to deliver the babies of 230,000 women. Thanks to the efforts of the End of Polio campaign, Australian aid is helping to eradicate polio once and for all.


The case for increasing foreign aid is clear: aid money, spent effectively, can make a difference to people's lives. With a bigger program we can help more people and put an end to scourge of extreme poverty within a generation.


Some will argue that the United Nations target to spend 0.7% of Australia's gross national income on foreign aid is unaffordable. I argue that it is easily affordable for a country such as Australia which has largely weathered the global financial crisis, has not suffered a recession for more than two decades and which is ranked second in the UN's Human Development Index, which compares global living standards.


Far poorer countries than Australia already give more in foreign aid than we do. Australia is currently ranked 12th out of 24 donor nations – we spend only 0.37% of GDP on foreign aid. 


This puts us behind the UK, France and Ireland who have all recently experienced recession and are struggling economically. Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands have all been meeting the 0.7% target for many years. This year the UK joined them for the first time – the culmination of a 44-year community-driven campaign.


It is disappointing that Australia lags well behind the Millennium Development Goal target which asked countries to devote 0.7% of GNI to overseas aid by 2015. The Greens would much prefer to see Australia joining other countries to meet this 0.7% target by 2015, but ongoing cuts and set-backs to the aid budget mean that our government is far from reaching this target. What the Australian Greens want to do with the bill is put forward a responsible and realistic timeline for up-scaling aid, year by year, that we think Labor and Coalition MPs will be able to support. A timeline the government of the day cannot justify shying away from. 


The Greens bill ascribes a legally-binding timetable for Australia to reclaim our place in the world as a progressive nation that seeks to give everyone a fair go. It sets out annual minimum targets for aid spending that would ensure the Government reaches the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income to be spent on foreign aid by 2020-21.


However, it is not just the amount of money that is important but how it is spent and what it is spent on. 


The Australian community rightly expect that foreign aid should be spent on alleviating poverty overseas. Australian Governments past and present have agreed to this by signing up to the Millennium Development Goals which set eight objectives for the world: to halve extreme poverty and hunger, to achieve universal education, to promote gender equality, to reduce child mortality, to improve maternal health, to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, to ensure environmental sustainability, and to build a global partnership for development.


These goals should be the key drivers of the Australian aid program, not promoting our national political and commercial interests. 


I have already mentioned the fact that onshore immigration detention will rob the aid budget of $1 billion over the next 4 years. The government has also been accused of double-counting our climate aid. That is, reporting the same pool of climate aid as a contribution to both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) financing and as ODA, which contravenes UN requirements that climate finance be additional to ODA. The Australian government has also come under heavy criticism for so-called military aid, where ODA is channelled through the Australian Defence Forces with the purpose of winning hearts and minds in conflicts such as Afghanistan, rather than putting in place sustainable and appropriate projects developed in partnership with local communities to alleviate poverty. 


The Bill sets up a new category of excluded official development assistance to ensure that such expenditure that does not serve to alleviate poverty is not counted towards the annual aid targets, including the 0.7 per cent by 2020-21 target. Excluded official development assistance is defined in the bill as money provided by the Australian Government for climate finance, asylum seeker assistance in Australia or in another country that is a regional processing country under the Migration Act, or military assistance. 


In addition to this legal protection, the Bill creates an independent aid watchdog – the Independent Commissioner on Aid Effectiveness – to police aid spending and ensure that the Government is adhering to the spirit, as well as the letter, of the law. It is essential that Australia's aid program is transparent and accountable to the Australian government and to recipient communities. In 2006 AusAID established an Office of Development Effectiveness but this office has been a disappointment. Sitting within AusAID, it is less able to offer a robust unbiased critique of AusAID programs and it does not report directly to parliament. It is lacking teeth compared to Britain's Independent Commission on Aid Impact.


The Independent Commissioner on Aid Effectiveness, as defined in this bill, would sit at arm's length from AusAID and act as an independent watchdog to ensure Australia's aid is spent effectively to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The Commissioner would be independent of AusAID. It would report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and its reports would be tabled in parliament. 


The Independent Commissioner's role is essential to reassure the Australian community that aid money is being spent effectively to end poverty in developing countries. The bill is essential to make sure that we stick to our commitments on aid spending.


Many people have written to me in support of this bill and a push for Australian to give its fair share in aid. I would like to share some of their concerns.


Mark from Epping in NSW asked how can we say we are a caring country when we spend so much money on ourselves and our military and mining but not support the many countries and communities who are much worse off than us and struggling to survive?


Andy from Corinda in Queensland said that giving aid to those that need is not something we can just stop whenever it's inconvenient, it's a policy we need to continually enforce to develop our world and strive for equal opportunities everywhere.


Pip from Hurstville in Sydney summed up many people's feelings about the revelations that aid spending was being used for offshore detention centres. She wrote: 


""I was shocked and disgusted when I found out that our 'overseas aid' budget is being diverted to keeping refugees in truly inhumane conditions in our offshore detention centres. Who needs these funds most? It's not big business or even middle-class families. It's the world's poorest and most vulnerable who will benefit the most from our assistance. Australia may pride itself as being the 'lucky country', but if we're too selfish to commit our wealth to ending extreme poverty and hunger, I don't think we've got a lot to be proud of.""


When considering this bill I ask all Senators and Members to consider that we live in a region with some of the highest rates of poverty and child malnutrition in the world.


This sentiment from Elizabeth in South Australia captured simply the humanity and generosity that inspired me to introduce this Greens bill following the announcement in 2012 that Labor and the Coalition would walk away from a bipartisan commitment to increase overseas aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015, effectively a cut to the aid budget. She said:


""When we in Australia are so much wealthier than most other nations, the least we can do is maintain, if not increase, our overseas aid.""


I would like to take this opportunity to table below some more of the hundreds of messages of support I have received from many caring Australians which illustrate the depth of public support for a generous overseas aid program. I will table more supporting comments in further speeches as debate on the bill continues. 


Edward from the Tweed said: ""Australia has been blessed with all the good things on earth that we, as humans, need: clean air, water, sunshine, space and grace. Most of our citizens would applaud any party that was seen to share our good luck with the millions around the world who do not.


Signe from Liverpool in Sydney said: ""Great initiative. Aid saves lives and having a dedicated office to examine and confirm aid is reaching those most in need is a positive step that we as one of the richest nations on earth should and can provide.""


Ben from Adelaide said: ""Having an effective aid program with Australians out there working alongside people in host countries sounds like a much better strategy for peace and international goodwill than our current overseas military campaigns. Right now only the insiders see any worth in what we are doing in Iraq or Afghanistan. Let us put that destructive and wasteful money into activities of strategic and sustainable development.""


Taegan from Sydney said: ""We are wealthy. Others are not. Increase overseas aid.""


Joy from Morphett Vale said: ""We need to commit to ending extreme poverty and hunger.""


Denise from Far North Queensland said: ""Aid should not end up in the pockets of western corporations or oppressive regimes, but in programs that actually help the poor in tangible ways.""


Sarah from Perth said: ""Thanks for your work on Australia's aid obligations - both moral and legal!""


Heather from South Australia said: ""Australia could aim to bring the best maternity services to all of those countries where having and rearing children means risking women's lives.""


Fiona from Perth said: ""I definitely support an independent office to ensure that Australian aid goes to those who need it and to ensure that it is not frittered away on administration or sidelined by grasping governments here or in other countries.


Joan from Westlakes in South Australia said: ""Australia should be a leader in Overseas Aid so we can stand up and be proud.""


Willy from near Brisbane said: ""Thanks for standing up for our overseas aid budget when the major parties fail the compassion test.""


Janet from Adelaide said: ""Overseas aid is vital to the existence of people from poorer countries. Wake up Australia.""


Gosta from the ACT said: ""I have been involved with Plan International for 45 years and visited projects in Ecuador, Colombia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Burkina Faso. Every visit has made me convinced that our aid gives children a chance to grow up healthier, better educated and with a more positive outlook towards the world and its future; this is very worthwhile. That Australia is far from filling the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of its budget makes me quite sad.""


Bob from the Sunshine Coat said: ""Australia needs a strong commitment to the Pacific Island neighbours.""


Ted from Adelaide said: ""The 0.7 per cent target has been talked about for a long time. It is disappointing that growth in our overseas aid is not really seeking to meet this target.  It is time to review this situation - especially as the government is so proud that our economy is doing so well.""


Siobhan in Melbourne said: ""I would much prefer that CEO's and parliamentarians perks were capped than stop aid to poor countries.""


Richard from Evans Head in northern NSW said: ""I support your goal for Australian Aid. Overseas aid is critical to our future as a nation and is a moral imperative for a rich country like ours.""


Craig in Blackwood near Adelaide said: ""Cut fuel subsidies to mining companies. Increase the tax on superannuation for the wealthiest. Just don't disadvantage those who are already the most vulnerable and needy. There are, literally, lives at stake.""


Patricia from the Sunshine Coast said: ""Increasing overseas aid in a transparent way, improves global equity and may address some of the pressures which force people to become refugees.""


Elizabeth from Sydney said: ""Will we show our true strength of character and maturity as a nation and help those with less? Those without clean water and without food, and those who are living in tragic conditions of war or disease? Or will we be immature and keep everything for ourselves, without concern for the plight of our fellow humans? The choice is ours, and the world will remember Australia and Australians by the choice we make.""


Jim from Henley Beach near Adelaide said: ""Our two major political parties find easy targets to reduce funding when they try to win points off each other.""


Claire from Melbourne said: ""Climate change exacerbates existing problems such as poverty, lack of food security and political instability. Australia has a moral and ethical obligation to provide aid to countries with some of the most vulnerable people in the world.""


Anna from Toowoomba said: ""We are blessed to live in Australia, often simply through the luck of being born here. The wealth we have should be shared and is not ours alone.""


Piers from Falls Creek said: ""Despite the rhetoric from politicians, I consider Australia is well able to sustain this level of Aid. The UK has just lifted its Aid level to 0.7%. Australia is far better off than UK.""


Mark from near Adelaide said: ""I support increasing Australian government aid to overseas countries to help alleviate the suffering of millions of people who lack good food, water, housing, education, health, working conditions and other things that we Australian take for granted.""


Lynn from Perth said: ""Cutting foreign aid reflects poorly on our maturity as a nation. Using part of the foreign aid budget to fund our approach to the management of asylum seekers is reprehensible. I call on the Australian Government to increase the foreign aid budget, not reduce it. This cause should be beyond party politics.""


Sue from near Adelaide said: ""Australian people want an end to world poverty. We don't want to be a nation that turns its back on suffering whether it's human suffering through hunger, or animal suffering. We want a compassionate nation, and are willing to forgo some of our own ""frills"" to bring about more justice. This is why I would welcome an independent Office of Aid Effectiveness.""


Anna from St Kilda said: ""Cut Australia's aid budget and you undermine the good work that has been done to date. Cut foreign aid and you forfeit our international humanitarian obligations. Cut foreign aid and you send a message to the world that Australia's priorities lack humanity. Cut foreign aid and you dismantle the concept of a sustainable global community.""


And finally a comment from Mark, north of Perth, who was excited by the opportunity to have his voice heard in Parliament and hoped there were enough politicians of any persuasion to support the Greens bill. He said: ""Why should we increase Australian Aid and make it more effective? Because the Australian government, on behalf of the people of Australia, committed to the Millennium Development Goals. Because keeping promises is an important value, not just for Australia but for the millions of people affected by extreme poverty around the world. Because Australia should lead by example. We have the means more than any other country right now. If we act to reduce overseas aid in times of great prosperity, we have failed to set an example. Because extreme poverty is the kind of poverty that is human misery, starvation, hopelessness, drought, disease and is inescapable. Because overseas aid is part of a solution that empowers people in extreme poverty to help themselves. Because we are human, because we care and know in our hearts that extreme poverty is an unnatural state of existence and it is wrong.""


I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (16:19):  I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on its inquiry into the Foreign Investment Review Board natural interest test, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is a report that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has completed over the duration of a couple of years. During that time, there has been a change of attitude and an awareness across the government of a lot of the findings of this committee. The committee has made a series of recommendations—there are 29 in the final report and six in the interim report—which cover a range of issues that certainly identify that the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is a creature of the past. It has not kept up with modern communications and transport of the financial world. This report emphasises the absolutely critical importance of foreign investment and capital coming into Australia—in the case of agriculture, it is obviously a need for patient capital—but at the same time it emphasises the need for long-term foreign investment in Australia to be on a level playing field and that the present legislative and international tax conventions have not kept up with the modern transportability of capital and revenue.


The committee notes the current progress of the government, the OECD and G20 in this area and urges the government to continue pursuing international reforms. Amongst the key findings of the committee, the committee especially notes information gaps under five headings. There is a clear information gap in foreign acquisition. There is no national register. Obviously, land titles are registered on state databases. We think there is a need, with modern technology, to join the databases. It has been an ongoing argument as to what the threshold ought to be in defining sovereign investment and also corporate foreign investment, and how many million dollars it should be. This report has made a recommendation along those lines. But, in reality, if we set up the right titles registers, which will take a bit of doing, and connect them, then we ought to be able to, if we want to know everything over five million or anything over 10 million, say, press a button and there it is.


The present arrangement is certainly antiquated, and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is completely out of date. The committee was advised of that by the former chairman of FIRB. The new chairman, Mr Brian Wilson, has adopted a new attitude to the need to rejuvenate and make some recommendations to update the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. He has a positive view of encouraging foreign investment into Australia, while at the same time protecting Australia's sovereignty, because the challenge for the G20 nations, and the challenge to not having to redefine sovereignty, is to capture the revenue base. At the present time, there is something like $3 trillion annually, globally of tax avoidance through the incapacity of countries in the G20 to monitor and audit transfer pricing without any other tax avoidance measures.


This is a positive report for Australia's future. It emphasises that:


The committee considers that foreign investment can make a major contribution to future agricultural developments in Australia, including the Ord irrigation area.


…   …   …


However, the committee also considers that to maximise the benefits of such developments there are challenges to be overcome such as: limited access to long-term capital investment; restrictions from land tenure arrangements; and the trade and transparency of water entitlements.


In regard to the transparency issue, at the present time Australia has no idea of what is happening in Australia. What Australia should do is get the right database. Certainly the ABS, in its evidence to the committee, demonstrated that they do not have the capacity to know what is going on. In fact, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is so antiquated that, although it defines agricultural land, all land other than defined agricultural land in Australia is defined as urban land. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, in theory, you have to go to FIRB if you want to buy five acres in the Simpson Desert because it is defined as urban land. Yet you can buy half the Riverina, as long as you do not hit $248 million in one sale, and not bother reporting it to anyone.


That is the stupidity of legislation—the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act—which was written in the seventies, just after telegrams started to look a bit out of date. We need to move into the 21st century. Part of moving into the 21st century is having a database, regulations and rules that capture the revenue base. Only this week we have had a bit of an adventure with Archer Daniels Midland, which was an interesting excursion into the world of transparency of corporate dealings, tax avoidance, price fixing and God knows what.


It is fair to say that this report challenges the thinking of a lot of Australians. It has been well put together, and I would like to congratulate everyone on the committee for the work they have done. I would certainly like to congratulate the professional staff, including Dr Curran and Stephen Palethorpe and their offsiders. Later this afternoon we are going to have a quiet farewell drink for Dr Curran as he is moving on to much higher and more important career decisions. It is a great pleasure to be able to present a document which I could not speak to fully today in two or three minutes. It absolutely encompasses the challenges of the future, and, I have to say, very importantly, it should be read by people before it is editorialised or commented upon.


It is quite a challenge to the western world, as G20 now knows, to have solid foreign investment on a level playing field, which would include investment from the new player in the field, which ABS identified to the committee early on, the day President Obama was here down in the Old Parliament. That is the advent of foreign sovereign investment. We met some serious challenges there, and there are serious tax avoidance measures under the present legislation for sovereign investment. We want to provide encouragement, especially if we are going to develop Northern Australia, and people decide that agriculture is not about retiring to the coast, resting on your laurels and thinking of the past. We want to make sure it happens in a market that is fully commercial, that there is not a distortion of the capital market through capital coming in for a second purpose of a safe haven, rather than a commercial return, that we do not distort the capital market, that we do not distort the commodity market and that we capture the revenue base.


With those few words, I would like to thank everybody, and I would like to thank the chamber for the opportunity to present this report. It is sowing the seeds for the future of a strong Australia which can compete internationally and, at the same time, not have to redefine sovereignty as we know it. If we do not find out what is happening now, model it out for 20 or 30 years, and then say to ourselves as a nation, 'Is that where we want to be if we continue to do what we're doing now and don't make any changes? Is that where we want to finish up, and would that be in the national interest?' That is absolutely what, as a nation, we have got to do. We have to make sure we think beyond the next election and beyond tomorrow morning's headline. We have to think where we are going to be in 30 or 40 years time. If you look back 30 or 40 years we have come a long way. I offer my sincere thanks to the chamber and to the committee.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:29):  I rise to make some comments on the Foreign investment and the national interest report tabled today by the Senate Standing Committees on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I thank the committee secretariat who, as always, do an incredibly good job, led very capably and ably by Mr Stephen Palethorpe. I thank Dr Chris Curran for his work on this report and I also thank the rest of the secretariat team. This committee is incredibly fortunate to have the support from what, I believe, is probably one of the best committee secretariats in the building. So, I thank them very much.


This has been a most interesting inquiry, as Senator Heffernan said, but they are always interesting when Senator Heffernan is chairing. It has been running for quite some time. The committee recognised that this is an incredibly complex issue and, prior to this report, the long-term implications and the long-term impacts of foreign investment in this nation had not been given the level of scrutiny needed. I do not say that as a partisan comment. My views on foreign investment are fairly well known. From the committee's and my perspective, it is not a partisan comment. We believed that it was really important to properly and objectively look at issues that surround foreign investment and foreign ownership in Australia.


In regard to agricultural land and agricultural business, there is no doubt that we do not know at this stage the level of foreign ownership and investment in that agricultural land and business. That absolutely has to be the starting point and, as noted in the report, we put forward recommendations for mechanisms to do that. It is absolutely vital that we get an understanding of where we currently sit so that we are able to figure out where we are likely to be in the future. That is what has been missing from the scrutiny into foreign ownership and foreign investment.


What we have seen to date are a lot of short-term reactions responding to immediate capital injection from foreign entities. The committee agrees that foreign investment, where appropriate, is absolutely fine. The nation has relied on it in the past and will continue to rely on it in some ways, shapes and forms. What we need to know for the future of this nation is how we want the country to look, particularly in relation to agricultural land and agribusiness. How do we want the future of agriculture to look in this nation 20, 30 and 40 years down the track? The decisions we make now are going to affect how the nation is going to look in 30 or 40 years time in a policy sense. I think we need to be smarter and we need to be more forward thinking and step outside the immediacy of looking at this issue in terms of foreign investment as being good—we get the capital injection, we cannot do without it and that is the end of the story. Certainly that capital injection plays a part, but it is not the whole story. We have to stop being so short-sighted in thinking that that is the whole story. That is a lot of what this report is about and a lot of what the inquiry has been about.


I have to commend the chair, Senator Heffernan, for his leadership on many of the issues that we traversed during the course of the inquiry, particularly the taxation issues. There are those in government and in other high places who now have a much greater understanding of the potential ramifications of foreign investment in the construct of the current taxation system than they would otherwise have had if it had not been for Senator Heffernan so robustly raising many of these concerns throughout the course of the inquiry.


The issue is, as I say, one of identification, of actually figuring out how much foreign investment and ownership there is in our nation to start with. The Foreign Investment Review Board needs an enormous amount of work done. There certainly need to be changes done because, in my view and in the view of many of my colleagues, it is not operating as effectively or as efficiently as it should. When we look at the Foreign Investment Review Board there is nobody with agricultural expertise on that board. When you consider the number of proposals regarding agricultural land and business that come through for approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, to not have somebody on that board with agricultural expertise is simply stupid. It is unacceptable because, in my view, there is not the appropriate level of scrutiny that we should have in relation to those areas.


In fact, an application for foreign ownership of agricultural land or business has never been rejected by the Foreign Investment Review Board. That concerns me because I suspect there have been a number of instances where it should have been rejected. A couple of instances particularly come to mind. I think that the sale of Cubbie Station should have had a lot more scrutiny. The other that comes to mind is the approval from FIRB to the Treasurer for the potential takeover of SunRice by the Spanish company Ebro. It was recommended to the Treasurer as absolutely fine, tickety-boo, hunky-dory. This was a Spanish company about to own 100 per cent of SunRice, the Australian rice industry. Anyone who thinks that that would have been in the national interest simply does not understand the industry and certainly does not understand the agricultural sector. It took the industry itself to reject the proposal, recognising that it was not in their interest nor was it in the national interest.


It was subsequently good to see that SunRice is going from strength to strength. Had they sold it and had FIRB, in their wisdom, got their way then we would have seen a sensational Australian business fall into foreign hands when the necessity was simply not there. The limit for FIRB, the $244 million, as the chair has pointed out, is senseless. You are virtually only going to get one or two properties in the nation that are going to fall at that level or above which are going to trigger the scrutiny of the Foreign Investment Review Board.


What we have is the issue of accumulation. We have foreign entities coming into the nation and accumulating acquisitions. None of those individual purchases of parcels of land ever trigger the interest of FIRB. That is wrong and absolutely needs to be addressed, which is why we are recommending a drop of that trigger level to $15 million. In my view the trigger should probably be a lot lower or at zero, but, for the purposes of trying to get some forward movement, I think $15 million is certainly appropriate. And, being cumulative, any purchase after an entity has hit that level should trigger the interest of FIRB.


There are a range of recommendations that we have put forward. We certainly believe that this is an issue that, as an nation, we have to start paying attention to. As I said in the beginning, this is about the future of Australia, particularly how the agriculture sector is going to look.


We on this committee completely understand that, while a lot of these foreign entities are operating under commercial interests, they are also looking at Australian productive capacity—our paddocks—as a starting point to creating a food security pipeline back to their home nations. And fair enough—why wouldn't they? If I were another country around the globe that was looking at food security issues down the track, I would absolutely be trying to secure land in Australia to make sure that I could shore up the food security for my people of my country. It is a no-brainer. But we are not paying attention to that here. We are not looking long term. We are not looking down the track and saying, 'All right, at what level is this appropriate? At what level is this acceptable? How much foreign ownership is too much?' 


We might have this debate and decide that 100 per cent of foreign ownership is absolutely fine. My argument is that as a nation we have not had that debate yet. That, by the way, is not my view on foreign ownership but it may well be a majority view at the end of the day. The issue is that we have not had the debate. We are not thinking like grown-ups. We are not thinking like mature people—looking down the track and asking, 'How do we want the nation to look?' That is what is so important.


I believe that this report gives very good guidance in terms of those issues that, whoever is in government over the next period of years, we need to look at in a policy sense to get the policy settings right so that we have the sustainability in the agricultural sector of this nation into the future. That should be absolutely one of our key priorities.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2013-06-26,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:40):  I just want to say a few words on this report from a Greens perspective. Unfortunately I missed out on the trip to the north-west of Western Australia. Having been brought up there I would have loved to have gone back for the week. 


The Greens have long held very similar views in terms of the scrutiny that is required for direct foreign investment, particularly in agricultural land. Just over two years ago we introduced the concept of a register of agricultural land, in terms of policy. We would have liked to see a model very similar to the New Zealand model in terms of an acreage basis for acquisitions but we ultimately settled on $5 million. It was good to hear Senator Nash agreeing that the limit should be lower than $15 million. We felt $5 million was a good place to start in terms of setting up that register. I also concur with Senator Nash that the creeping acquisition of land is a problem, which is often not picked up except by ex post assessments of these types of arrangements. 


The issue of Foreign Investment Review Board trigger thresholds was also important for us in the context of free trade agreements, which we know are being negotiated at the moment. We have two very significant free trade agreements being negotiated: RCEP and the TPPA. We have seen previously that in free trade agreements, such as the free trade agreement with the US, the Foreign Investment Review Board trigger thresholds were significantly increased to facilitate, shall we say, or grease the wheels of those free trade agreements. United States companies had the limits, where they were not subject to FIRB approval, significantly raised. We do not want to see—we have certainly expressed concerns which have been incorporated in this report—the FIRB levels being sacrificed at the alter of free trade agreements and traded off for other benefits, because they are there for a reason, and they are very important.


Lastly—because I understand other people want to speak—I want to thank Stephen, Chris and the team for a fantastic effort. A lot of work went into this. Although he is not in the chamber any more I obviously want to thank Senator Heffernan for all his hard work.

 (South Australia) (16:42):  I rise to speak on the same report from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, and join with my Senate colleagues, Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Nash and Senator Heffernan, in taking note of this report. 


I will not rehash too much any of the issues that my colleagues have covered but before I get underway I also acknowledge the dedicated, intelligent hard work of the secretariat led by Mr Stephen Palethorpe and the departing Dr Chris Curran, who are present in this chamber—and rightly so. There have been nearly two years of hard work culminating in this report. They deserve much credit for cutting through and trying to find a balance in this very important and quite emotive issue for Australia. Thank you, fellows, and your team at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. 


I now move onto putting this into some perspective. I touched on this issue of emotion. Senators in this chamber and those listening to this contribution would know that last year there was a great deal of community sentiment expressed about the passing of one of the largest water and land holdings in this country, as a single entity—Cubbie Station—into foreign hands. It was quite a divisive debate and it remains a divisive debate. I hope to put that debate and the findings that we were able to come to into some perspective.


The United States, in 2011-12, was again the largest source of proposed investment in this country, at $36.6 billion 


Other major source countries of proposed investment in that same year, 2011-12 were: the United Kingdom, at $20.3 billion; China, with $16.2 billion; Japan, with $13.9 billion; and Canada, with $8.9 billion. As you can see from those figures from last year, there is a lot of money spent by a lot of countries in this, our land of Australia. There were 49 foreign investment approvals in agriculture, forestry and the fishing sector, worth $3.6 billion in the same year, 2011-12. This represents just two per cent of the approved foreign investment in Australia—two per cent, in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector. The largest source country of investment by value in the agricultural sector was Canada, at $1.4 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, at $0.6 billion, and the United States, at $0.5 billion—$500 million. Over the last five years the average level of foreign investment in the sector has been just over $2.5 billion.


There are 29 recommendations in this report, and I will touch on the one that I feel has a lot of relevance with regard to that emotive debate and trying to ensure that a rational debate can happen from here on out in this country about the way in which we source capital to fund our food security—and, keeping it in perspective—our resource community and so on. The committee made a recommendation that the government further strengthen Australians' tax regulations in order to protect against the erosion of Australia's tax revenue. In particular, the government should develop a more rigorous approach to prevent revenue leakage that may occur due to the business structures and practices used by foreign investors in relation to the transfer pricing of goods, the capital gains they pay, passive income, thin capitalisation and any other tax measures that may be deployed.


The issue is, of course, that you can have a company in this country and own farming property, and the principals can be Australian residents based in this country, but 100 per cent of the funding can be from an offshore base. That can be a sovereign wealth fund or a private fund from any of the countries which I mentioned earlier. They, effectively, are the owners. We need to look at those issues and tighten those loopholes to ensure that those who own the company are not necessarily those who can control it.


One of the other recommendations was that we commission an independent and wide-ranging review on Australia's regulatory network. We also thought that the national register for foreign ownership of agricultural land should be the primary mechanism for collecting and publishing information about foreign investment. That is very important, because we found out through the review process that there is a complete vacuum of information available to states and territories and the federal parliament to be able to make informed, realistic views on what is and is not good for this country. The register would include divestments as well, and the integrity of the register would be maintained so that public policy could be framed and gazetted to ensure that our food security was not under any threat.


The interpretation of 'agricultural land' came in for some scrutiny. What is agricultural land? What defines it? It is arguable from state to state and region to region what is and is not prime agricultural land. That needs to be identified. We also thought that it may be an idea to map the trends of foreign ownership of land in this country so that we can predict what policy instruments we need to employ to ensure that we do not get imbalances and that the government's and our expectations do not get out of step with those of the broader community. It should also aggregate the lands over five-year periods. My colleagues here earlier laid that out, so I will not go over that again. The other thing is that this information should be published. There is no better disinfectant than sunshine, and we think that information going regularly into the public domain will ensure that everybody can have a calm and reasoned view of who is investing, and why they are investing, in this country.


The big question was: is Australia able to feed itself into the future? Australia has a diverse and plentiful food supply, with enough food available from domestically produced and imported food to feed its population of nearly 23 million people. Even with a projected population of 30.9 million to 42.5 million people by 2056, food availability is not likely to become a problem for Australia. Australia produces enough food today to feed approximately 60 million people, so we do have a very high level of food security in this country.


In 2010, Australia was ranked the 16th biggest world food exporter by value and eighth in the world in terms of food trade surplus—the value of exports compared to the value of imports. During 2010-11, Australia imported $10.6 billion worth of food products—much less than the $27.1 billion of food exports. Asia receives between 55 and 60 per cent of Australia's agrifood exports, or about 40 per cent by value of our annual farm and fisheries food production. Australia has an abundant and diverse food supply. Over 90 per cent of fresh produce, including fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs, sold in Australia is domestically produced. Australians have the resources and wealth to import food to complement domestic supply and meet consumer preferences.


In closing, the wine industry in Australia has had a massive amount of foreign investment over the last 20 years. Without that foreign investment, the wine industry would be a vastly different business from it is today. I commend everybody for this report. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:52):  I believe that our current national interest test is very much a 'known unknown'—it is vague, it is imprecise and it is not in the national interest. It pains me to say it but I think we can learn from the New Zealanders, who have a much clearer national interest test—it is prescribed, it is set out, it is a much more efficient system that we have here, and I think it serves that nation much better than our test serves us. I also think it is important to note that credible potential Australian purchasers for Cubbie Station were overlooked in favour of a foreign based consortium because there is not a level playing field when it comes to comparing local investors against a foreign investment syndicate. I think it is a matter of shame that local investors missed out on Cubbie Station.


I want to finish by referring to the evidence of David Farley, the chief executive of AACo. What he wrote last year in the national media sums up the dilemma and the challenge that we have. He said: 


Why isn't a pathway being engineered for local investment, ahead of international? 


Why has the government lost confidence in local agribusiness developing our agricultural future?


There is no doubt that the world is facing an explosion in the demand for food, the global population forecast to peak at 9 billion within 38 years. 


Australia has a critical role to play in meeting the demand created from that expected 40 per cent increase.


…   …   …


I would say more respect should be paid to the expertise contained in our own agricultural industry and more effort put into making sure that Australia is equipped to play its role in the global demand for food.


That is the challenge: it is not just about foreign investment rules; it is about encouraging local investment in agriculture.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:54):  It gives me great pleasure to make a short contribution on the tabling of the rural and regional affairs references committee report into foreign investment and the national interest test. I note that the secretariat are sitting over on the benches. I thank them for their hard work on a report that I know has taken a long time. And I thank the hard-working and dedicated members of the committee, who approached their work from a bipartisan perspective. This inquiry, chaired by Senator Heffernan and supported ably by Senator Nash, Senator Edwards and others, looked at something which is of key interest to Australians—and not just those in regional Australia. It does not matter whether I go to branch meetings or town meetings in country Victoria or to state council meetings in Melbourne, who owns what, where and how much in our nation has become an increasingly contested space. It is a much debated and discussed issue throughout the nation. For instance, talkback radio is full of listeners ringing in—and they are not all from the regions—wanting to put forward their views on who should be able to own Australian land and agribusiness and who should not. 


This is a timely report and it makes some very good recommendations which I will briefly touch on. In Victoria we have had some discussion within our own borders as the result of drought and high levels of debt within certain areas in our own local industry. That has meant our own local agricultural industries have sought buyers and they have been more than happy to take some of the figures offered to them, which are way beyond what other farming enterprises—maybe those next door—are able to pay, therefore pushing up the price. It is good for the seller but it is not so good for others in the market. One of the sad things about the foreign investment conversation nationally is that international companies, agribusinesses and, sometimes, nations see investment in agriculture in Australia as a good thing, and sometimes we find it difficult to generate that level of local support when it comes to who is holding our land and agribusinesses. That is something I think talking about this issue can actually raise and encourage.


One of the highlights that came from one of the hearings that I was able to participate in is that we actually do not know what we do not know. In my own state of Victoria we do not collect this sort of data. We want to base foreign investment decisions on fact, not fear. That is very important going forward in this discussion. Until we are collecting the types of statistics that are going to allow us to know who owns what, where and how much they paid for it, we are not going to be able to have a sensible debate about this. We are not going to be able to put it into a context where we can discuss what the national interest looks like and what decisions around the national interest look like. I do not think we should be afraid of basing decisions on the national interest, but we need to be able to be united on what the national interest looks like.


I want to go to some of the recommendations. Recommendation 6 is that the review that Senator Heffernan touched on should specifically consider the definition of rural land and urban land. At present, if there is a foreign acquisition of a property in, say, Sydney or Melbourne it automatically comes to the attention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. But, unfortunately, you can buy 16 or 60 houses in Wycheproof and it will not come to the attention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. So there is a little bit of an inequity in what people are concerned about. I do not think we need to be afraid to stand up for our national interest and be concerned. But until we know what we do not know at the moment in terms of statistics, we are not able to make those sorts of decisions.


When we look at definitions of rural land, it has been incredibly difficult to actually get a concise definition. The definition of rural land is quite a contested space. Is it based on what it is used for? Is it based on geography, demographics or distance from a capital city? For instance, as we increasingly look at the way different land is used, you can have quite highly intensive primary production industry located quite close to urban centres. I am thinking particularly of maybe poultry, for instance—much different to broadacre farms. But we do need to get workable rural and urban land definitions so that we can start dealing with foreign investment.


Other nations have a variety of regimes to regulate and understand the level of foreign investment in their nations. We could be looking—and that is what part of Senator Heffernan's inquiry has done—at articulating and collating the different regimes that exist right throughout the nation on how they deal with foreign investment.


Another recommendation that particularly took my fancy was:


The committee recommends that the government require that any non-commercial production from agricultural land and businesses by foreign government entities (including for the purposes of food security) is undertaken within relevant Australian Government foreign aid programs.


This is a significant recommendation. If you go to the detail behind that recommendation in the report—and I note that the galleries are waiting for speakers a lot more eloquent than I am, but I would recommend to all of you that, when you get home, you download from Hansard this—




Senator Boswell:
  Compulsory reading!




Senator McKENZIE:
  compulsory reading—thank you, Senator Boswell; I will take that interjection. Currently, the FIRB review process takes place when the Foreign Investment Review Board is notified of foreign investment proposals that are above relevant thresholds. We have heard a bit of discussion about thresholds today. Obviously, when a property like Cubbie Station does not make the cut, we have serious problems with our threshold here in this nation.


I really congratulate the coalition on their approach to foreign investment. I am finding, when I go out particularly into regional Victoria and talk about the coalition's plan about foreign investment, that people on the ground are extremely interested in the fact that that threshold has to be looked at and that we want to reduce it, because out in the regions they know that there ain't too many properties at $248 million for foreign investment. I might leave my comments there.



The PRESIDENT:  Are you seeking leave to continue your remarks later?




Senator McKENZIE:
  Yes, thank you, Mr President.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (16:19):  I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on its inquiry into the Foreign Investment Review Board natural interest test, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This is a report that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has completed over the duration of a couple of years. During that time, there has been a change of attitude and an awareness across the government of a lot of the findings of this committee. The committee has made a series of recommendations—there are 29 in the final report and six in the interim report—which cover a range of issues that certainly identify that the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is a creature of the past. It has not kept up with modern communications and transport of the financial world. This report emphasises the absolutely critical importance of foreign investment and capital coming into Australia—in the case of agriculture, it is obviously a need for patient capital—but at the same time it emphasises the need for long-term foreign investment in Australia to be on a level playing field and that the present legislative and international tax conventions have not kept up with the modern transportability of capital and revenue.


The committee notes the current progress of the government, the OECD and G20 in this area and urges the government to continue pursuing international reforms. Amongst the key findings of the committee, the committee especially notes information gaps under five headings. There is a clear information gap in foreign acquisition. There is no national register. Obviously, land titles are registered on state databases. We think there is a need, with modern technology, to join the databases. It has been an ongoing argument as to what the threshold ought to be in defining sovereign investment and also corporate foreign investment, and how many million dollars it should be. This report has made a recommendation along those lines. But, in reality, if we set up the right titles registers, which will take a bit of doing, and connect them, then we ought to be able to, if we want to know everything over five million or anything over 10 million, say, press a button and there it is.


The present arrangement is certainly antiquated, and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is completely out of date. The committee was advised of that by the former chairman of FIRB. The new chairman, Mr Brian Wilson, has adopted a new attitude to the need to rejuvenate and make some recommendations to update the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. He has a positive view of encouraging foreign investment into Australia, while at the same time protecting Australia's sovereignty, because the challenge for the G20 nations, and the challenge to not having to redefine sovereignty, is to capture the revenue base. At the present time, there is something like $3 trillion annually, globally of tax avoidance through the incapacity of countries in the G20 to monitor and audit transfer pricing without any other tax avoidance measures.


This is a positive report for Australia's future. It emphasises that:


The committee considers that foreign investment can make a major contribution to future agricultural developments in Australia, including the Ord irrigation area.


…   …   …


However, the committee also considers that to maximise the benefits of such developments there are challenges to be overcome such as: limited access to long-term capital investment; restrictions from land tenure arrangements; and the trade and transparency of water entitlements.


In regard to the transparency issue, at the present time Australia has no idea of what is happening in Australia. What Australia should do is get the right database. Certainly the ABS, in its evidence to the committee, demonstrated that they do not have the capacity to know what is going on. In fact, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is so antiquated that, although it defines agricultural land, all land other than defined agricultural land in Australia is defined as urban land. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, in theory, you have to go to FIRB if you want to buy five acres in the Simpson Desert because it is defined as urban land. Yet you can buy half the Riverina, as long as you do not hit $248 million in one sale, and not bother reporting it to anyone.


That is the stupidity of legislation—the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act—which was written in the seventies, just after telegrams started to look a bit out of date. We need to move into the 21st century. Part of moving into the 21st century is having a database, regulations and rules that capture the revenue base. Only this week we have had a bit of an adventure with Archer Daniels Midland, which was an interesting excursion into the world of transparency of corporate dealings, tax avoidance, price fixing and God knows what.


It is fair to say that this report challenges the thinking of a lot of Australians. It has been well put together, and I would like to congratulate everyone on the committee for the work they have done. I would certainly like to congratulate the professional staff, including Dr Curran and Stephen Palethorpe and their offsiders. Later this afternoon we are going to have a quiet farewell drink for Dr Curran as he is moving on to much higher and more important career decisions. It is a great pleasure to be able to present a document which I could not speak to fully today in two or three minutes. It absolutely encompasses the challenges of the future, and, I have to say, very importantly, it should be read by people before it is editorialised or commented upon.


It is quite a challenge to the western world, as G20 now knows, to have solid foreign investment on a level playing field, which would include investment from the new player in the field, which ABS identified to the committee early on, the day President Obama was here down in the Old Parliament. That is the advent of foreign sovereign investment. We met some serious challenges there, and there are serious tax avoidance measures under the present legislation for sovereign investment. We want to provide encouragement, especially if we are going to develop Northern Australia, and people decide that agriculture is not about retiring to the coast, resting on your laurels and thinking of the past. We want to make sure it happens in a market that is fully commercial, that there is not a distortion of the capital market through capital coming in for a second purpose of a safe haven, rather than a commercial return, that we do not distort the capital market, that we do not distort the commodity market and that we capture the revenue base.


With those few words, I would like to thank everybody, and I would like to thank the chamber for the opportunity to present this report. It is sowing the seeds for the future of a strong Australia which can compete internationally and, at the same time, not have to redefine sovereignty as we know it. If we do not find out what is happening now, model it out for 20 or 30 years, and then say to ourselves as a nation, 'Is that where we want to be if we continue to do what we're doing now and don't make any changes? Is that where we want to finish up, and would that be in the national interest?' That is absolutely what, as a nation, we have got to do. We have to make sure we think beyond the next election and beyond tomorrow morning's headline. We have to think where we are going to be in 30 or 40 years time. If you look back 30 or 40 years we have come a long way. I offer my sincere thanks to the chamber and to the committee.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:29):  I rise to make some comments on the Foreign investment and the national interest report tabled today by the Senate Standing Committees on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I thank the committee secretariat who, as always, do an incredibly good job, led very capably and ably by Mr Stephen Palethorpe. I thank Dr Chris Curran for his work on this report and I also thank the rest of the secretariat team. This committee is incredibly fortunate to have the support from what, I believe, is probably one of the best committee secretariats in the building. So, I thank them very much.


This has been a most interesting inquiry, as Senator Heffernan said, but they are always interesting when Senator Heffernan is chairing. It has been running for quite some time. The committee recognised that this is an incredibly complex issue and, prior to this report, the long-term implications and the long-term impacts of foreign investment in this nation had not been given the level of scrutiny needed. I do not say that as a partisan comment. My views on foreign investment are fairly well known. From the committee's and my perspective, it is not a partisan comment. We believed that it was really important to properly and objectively look at issues that surround foreign investment and foreign ownership in Australia.


In regard to agricultural land and agricultural business, there is no doubt that we do not know at this stage the level of foreign ownership and investment in that agricultural land and business. That absolutely has to be the starting point and, as noted in the report, we put forward recommendations for mechanisms to do that. It is absolutely vital that we get an understanding of where we currently sit so that we are able to figure out where we are likely to be in the future. That is what has been missing from the scrutiny into foreign ownership and foreign investment.


What we have seen to date are a lot of short-term reactions responding to immediate capital injection from foreign entities. The committee agrees that foreign investment, where appropriate, is absolutely fine. The nation has relied on it in the past and will continue to rely on it in some ways, shapes and forms. What we need to know for the future of this nation is how we want the country to look, particularly in relation to agricultural land and agribusiness. How do we want the future of agriculture to look in this nation 20, 30 and 40 years down the track? The decisions we make now are going to affect how the nation is going to look in 30 or 40 years time in a policy sense. I think we need to be smarter and we need to be more forward thinking and step outside the immediacy of looking at this issue in terms of foreign investment as being good—we get the capital injection, we cannot do without it and that is the end of the story. Certainly that capital injection plays a part, but it is not the whole story. We have to stop being so short-sighted in thinking that that is the whole story. That is a lot of what this report is about and a lot of what the inquiry has been about.


I have to commend the chair, Senator Heffernan, for his leadership on many of the issues that we traversed during the course of the inquiry, particularly the taxation issues. There are those in government and in other high places who now have a much greater understanding of the potential ramifications of foreign investment in the construct of the current taxation system than they would otherwise have had if it had not been for Senator Heffernan so robustly raising many of these concerns throughout the course of the inquiry.


The issue is, as I say, one of identification, of actually figuring out how much foreign investment and ownership there is in our nation to start with. The Foreign Investment Review Board needs an enormous amount of work done. There certainly need to be changes done because, in my view and in the view of many of my colleagues, it is not operating as effectively or as efficiently as it should. When we look at the Foreign Investment Review Board there is nobody with agricultural expertise on that board. When you consider the number of proposals regarding agricultural land and business that come through for approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, to not have somebody on that board with agricultural expertise is simply stupid. It is unacceptable because, in my view, there is not the appropriate level of scrutiny that we should have in relation to those areas.


In fact, an application for foreign ownership of agricultural land or business has never been rejected by the Foreign Investment Review Board. That concerns me because I suspect there have been a number of instances where it should have been rejected. A couple of instances particularly come to mind. I think that the sale of Cubbie Station should have had a lot more scrutiny. The other that comes to mind is the approval from FIRB to the Treasurer for the potential takeover of SunRice by the Spanish company Ebro. It was recommended to the Treasurer as absolutely fine, tickety-boo, hunky-dory. This was a Spanish company about to own 100 per cent of SunRice, the Australian rice industry. Anyone who thinks that that would have been in the national interest simply does not understand the industry and certainly does not understand the agricultural sector. It took the industry itself to reject the proposal, recognising that it was not in their interest nor was it in the national interest.


It was subsequently good to see that SunRice is going from strength to strength. Had they sold it and had FIRB, in their wisdom, got their way then we would have seen a sensational Australian business fall into foreign hands when the necessity was simply not there. The limit for FIRB, the $244 million, as the chair has pointed out, is senseless. You are virtually only going to get one or two properties in the nation that are going to fall at that level or above which are going to trigger the scrutiny of the Foreign Investment Review Board.


What we have is the issue of accumulation. We have foreign entities coming into the nation and accumulating acquisitions. None of those individual purchases of parcels of land ever trigger the interest of FIRB. That is wrong and absolutely needs to be addressed, which is why we are recommending a drop of that trigger level to $15 million. In my view the trigger should probably be a lot lower or at zero, but, for the purposes of trying to get some forward movement, I think $15 million is certainly appropriate. And, being cumulative, any purchase after an entity has hit that level should trigger the interest of FIRB.


There are a range of recommendations that we have put forward. We certainly believe that this is an issue that, as an nation, we have to start paying attention to. As I said in the beginning, this is about the future of Australia, particularly how the agriculture sector is going to look.


We on this committee completely understand that, while a lot of these foreign entities are operating under commercial interests, they are also looking at Australian productive capacity—our paddocks—as a starting point to creating a food security pipeline back to their home nations. And fair enough—why wouldn't they? If I were another country around the globe that was looking at food security issues down the track, I would absolutely be trying to secure land in Australia to make sure that I could shore up the food security for my people of my country. It is a no-brainer. But we are not paying attention to that here. We are not looking long term. We are not looking down the track and saying, 'All right, at what level is this appropriate? At what level is this acceptable? How much foreign ownership is too much?' 


We might have this debate and decide that 100 per cent of foreign ownership is absolutely fine. My argument is that as a nation we have not had that debate yet. That, by the way, is not my view on foreign ownership but it may well be a majority view at the end of the day. The issue is that we have not had the debate. We are not thinking like grown-ups. We are not thinking like mature people—looking down the track and asking, 'How do we want the nation to look?' That is what is so important.


I believe that this report gives very good guidance in terms of those issues that, whoever is in government over the next period of years, we need to look at in a policy sense to get the policy settings right so that we have the sustainability in the agricultural sector of this nation into the future. That should be absolutely one of our key priorities.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2013-06-26,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:40):  I just want to say a few words on this report from a Greens perspective. Unfortunately I missed out on the trip to the north-west of Western Australia. Having been brought up there I would have loved to have gone back for the week. 


The Greens have long held very similar views in terms of the scrutiny that is required for direct foreign investment, particularly in agricultural land. Just over two years ago we introduced the concept of a register of agricultural land, in terms of policy. We would have liked to see a model very similar to the New Zealand model in terms of an acreage basis for acquisitions but we ultimately settled on $5 million. It was good to hear Senator Nash agreeing that the limit should be lower than $15 million. We felt $5 million was a good place to start in terms of setting up that register. I also concur with Senator Nash that the creeping acquisition of land is a problem, which is often not picked up except by ex post assessments of these types of arrangements. 


The issue of Foreign Investment Review Board trigger thresholds was also important for us in the context of free trade agreements, which we know are being negotiated at the moment. We have two very significant free trade agreements being negotiated: RCEP and the TPPA. We have seen previously that in free trade agreements, such as the free trade agreement with the US, the Foreign Investment Review Board trigger thresholds were significantly increased to facilitate, shall we say, or grease the wheels of those free trade agreements. United States companies had the limits, where they were not subject to FIRB approval, significantly raised. We do not want to see—we have certainly expressed concerns which have been incorporated in this report—the FIRB levels being sacrificed at the alter of free trade agreements and traded off for other benefits, because they are there for a reason, and they are very important.


Lastly—because I understand other people want to speak—I want to thank Stephen, Chris and the team for a fantastic effort. A lot of work went into this. Although he is not in the chamber any more I obviously want to thank Senator Heffernan for all his hard work.

 (South Australia) (16:42):  I rise to speak on the same report from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, and join with my Senate colleagues, Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Nash and Senator Heffernan, in taking note of this report. 


I will not rehash too much any of the issues that my colleagues have covered but before I get underway I also acknowledge the dedicated, intelligent hard work of the secretariat led by Mr Stephen Palethorpe and the departing Dr Chris Curran, who are present in this chamber—and rightly so. There have been nearly two years of hard work culminating in this report. They deserve much credit for cutting through and trying to find a balance in this very important and quite emotive issue for Australia. Thank you, fellows, and your team at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. 


I now move onto putting this into some perspective. I touched on this issue of emotion. Senators in this chamber and those listening to this contribution would know that last year there was a great deal of community sentiment expressed about the passing of one of the largest water and land holdings in this country, as a single entity—Cubbie Station—into foreign hands. It was quite a divisive debate and it remains a divisive debate. I hope to put that debate and the findings that we were able to come to into some perspective.


The United States, in 2011-12, was again the largest source of proposed investment in this country, at $36.6 billion 


Other major source countries of proposed investment in that same year, 2011-12 were: the United Kingdom, at $20.3 billion; China, with $16.2 billion; Japan, with $13.9 billion; and Canada, with $8.9 billion. As you can see from those figures from last year, there is a lot of money spent by a lot of countries in this, our land of Australia. There were 49 foreign investment approvals in agriculture, forestry and the fishing sector, worth $3.6 billion in the same year, 2011-12. This represents just two per cent of the approved foreign investment in Australia—two per cent, in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector. The largest source country of investment by value in the agricultural sector was Canada, at $1.4 billion, followed by the United Kingdom, at $0.6 billion, and the United States, at $0.5 billion—$500 million. Over the last five years the average level of foreign investment in the sector has been just over $2.5 billion.


There are 29 recommendations in this report, and I will touch on the one that I feel has a lot of relevance with regard to that emotive debate and trying to ensure that a rational debate can happen from here on out in this country about the way in which we source capital to fund our food security—and, keeping it in perspective—our resource community and so on. The committee made a recommendation that the government further strengthen Australians' tax regulations in order to protect against the erosion of Australia's tax revenue. In particular, the government should develop a more rigorous approach to prevent revenue leakage that may occur due to the business structures and practices used by foreign investors in relation to the transfer pricing of goods, the capital gains they pay, passive income, thin capitalisation and any other tax measures that may be deployed.


The issue is, of course, that you can have a company in this country and own farming property, and the principals can be Australian residents based in this country, but 100 per cent of the funding can be from an offshore base. That can be a sovereign wealth fund or a private fund from any of the countries which I mentioned earlier. They, effectively, are the owners. We need to look at those issues and tighten those loopholes to ensure that those who own the company are not necessarily those who can control it.


One of the other recommendations was that we commission an independent and wide-ranging review on Australia's regulatory network. We also thought that the national register for foreign ownership of agricultural land should be the primary mechanism for collecting and publishing information about foreign investment. That is very important, because we found out through the review process that there is a complete vacuum of information available to states and territories and the federal parliament to be able to make informed, realistic views on what is and is not good for this country. The register would include divestments as well, and the integrity of the register would be maintained so that public policy could be framed and gazetted to ensure that our food security was not under any threat.


The interpretation of 'agricultural land' came in for some scrutiny. What is agricultural land? What defines it? It is arguable from state to state and region to region what is and is not prime agricultural land. That needs to be identified. We also thought that it may be an idea to map the trends of foreign ownership of land in this country so that we can predict what policy instruments we need to employ to ensure that we do not get imbalances and that the government's and our expectations do not get out of step with those of the broader community. It should also aggregate the lands over five-year periods. My colleagues here earlier laid that out, so I will not go over that again. The other thing is that this information should be published. There is no better disinfectant than sunshine, and we think that information going regularly into the public domain will ensure that everybody can have a calm and reasoned view of who is investing, and why they are investing, in this country.


The big question was: is Australia able to feed itself into the future? Australia has a diverse and plentiful food supply, with enough food available from domestically produced and imported food to feed its population of nearly 23 million people. Even with a projected population of 30.9 million to 42.5 million people by 2056, food availability is not likely to become a problem for Australia. Australia produces enough food today to feed approximately 60 million people, so we do have a very high level of food security in this country.


In 2010, Australia was ranked the 16th biggest world food exporter by value and eighth in the world in terms of food trade surplus—the value of exports compared to the value of imports. During 2010-11, Australia imported $10.6 billion worth of food products—much less than the $27.1 billion of food exports. Asia receives between 55 and 60 per cent of Australia's agrifood exports, or about 40 per cent by value of our annual farm and fisheries food production. Australia has an abundant and diverse food supply. Over 90 per cent of fresh produce, including fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs, sold in Australia is domestically produced. Australians have the resources and wealth to import food to complement domestic supply and meet consumer preferences.


In closing, the wine industry in Australia has had a massive amount of foreign investment over the last 20 years. Without that foreign investment, the wine industry would be a vastly different business from it is today. I commend everybody for this report. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:52):  I believe that our current national interest test is very much a 'known unknown'—it is vague, it is imprecise and it is not in the national interest. It pains me to say it but I think we can learn from the New Zealanders, who have a much clearer national interest test—it is prescribed, it is set out, it is a much more efficient system that we have here, and I think it serves that nation much better than our test serves us. I also think it is important to note that credible potential Australian purchasers for Cubbie Station were overlooked in favour of a foreign based consortium because there is not a level playing field when it comes to comparing local investors against a foreign investment syndicate. I think it is a matter of shame that local investors missed out on Cubbie Station.


I want to finish by referring to the evidence of David Farley, the chief executive of AACo. What he wrote last year in the national media sums up the dilemma and the challenge that we have. He said: 


Why isn't a pathway being engineered for local investment, ahead of international? 


Why has the government lost confidence in local agribusiness developing our agricultural future?


There is no doubt that the world is facing an explosion in the demand for food, the global population forecast to peak at 9 billion within 38 years. 


Australia has a critical role to play in meeting the demand created from that expected 40 per cent increase.


…   …   …


I would say more respect should be paid to the expertise contained in our own agricultural industry and more effort put into making sure that Australia is equipped to play its role in the global demand for food.


That is the challenge: it is not just about foreign investment rules; it is about encouraging local investment in agriculture.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-06-26,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:54):  It gives me great pleasure to make a short contribution on the tabling of the rural and regional affairs references committee report into foreign investment and the national interest test. I note that the secretariat are sitting over on the benches. I thank them for their hard work on a report that I know has taken a long time. And I thank the hard-working and dedicated members of the committee, who approached their work from a bipartisan perspective. This inquiry, chaired by Senator Heffernan and supported ably by Senator Nash, Senator Edwards and others, looked at something which is of key interest to Australians—and not just those in regional Australia. It does not matter whether I go to branch meetings or town meetings in country Victoria or to state council meetings in Melbourne, who owns what, where and how much in our nation has become an increasingly contested space. It is a much debated and discussed issue throughout the nation. For instance, talkback radio is full of listeners ringing in—and they are not all from the regions—wanting to put forward their views on who should be able to own Australian land and agribusiness and who should not. 


This is a timely report and it makes some very good recommendations which I will briefly touch on. In Victoria we have had some discussion within our own borders as the result of drought and high levels of debt within certain areas in our own local industry. That has meant our own local agricultural industries have sought buyers and they have been more than happy to take some of the figures offered to them, which are way beyond what other farming enterprises—maybe those next door—are able to pay, therefore pushing up the price. It is good for the seller but it is not so good for others in the market. One of the sad things about the foreign investment conversation nationally is that international companies, agribusinesses and, sometimes, nations see investment in agriculture in Australia as a good thing, and sometimes we find it difficult to generate that level of local support when it comes to who is holding our land and agribusinesses. That is something I think talking about this issue can actually raise and encourage.


One of the highlights that came from one of the hearings that I was able to participate in is that we actually do not know what we do not know. In my own state of Victoria we do not collect this sort of data. We want to base foreign investment decisions on fact, not fear. That is very important going forward in this discussion. Until we are collecting the types of statistics that are going to allow us to know who owns what, where and how much they paid for it, we are not going to be able to have a sensible debate about this. We are not going to be able to put it into a context where we can discuss what the national interest looks like and what decisions around the national interest look like. I do not think we should be afraid of basing decisions on the national interest, but we need to be able to be united on what the national interest looks like.


I want to go to some of the recommendations. Recommendation 6 is that the review that Senator Heffernan touched on should specifically consider the definition of rural land and urban land. At present, if there is a foreign acquisition of a property in, say, Sydney or Melbourne it automatically comes to the attention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. But, unfortunately, you can buy 16 or 60 houses in Wycheproof and it will not come to the attention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. So there is a little bit of an inequity in what people are concerned about. I do not think we need to be afraid to stand up for our national interest and be concerned. But until we know what we do not know at the moment in terms of statistics, we are not able to make those sorts of decisions.


When we look at definitions of rural land, it has been incredibly difficult to actually get a concise definition. The definition of rural land is quite a contested space. Is it based on what it is used for? Is it based on geography, demographics or distance from a capital city? For instance, as we increasingly look at the way different land is used, you can have quite highly intensive primary production industry located quite close to urban centres. I am thinking particularly of maybe poultry, for instance—much different to broadacre farms. But we do need to get workable rural and urban land definitions so that we can start dealing with foreign investment.


Other nations have a variety of regimes to regulate and understand the level of foreign investment in their nations. We could be looking—and that is what part of Senator Heffernan's inquiry has done—at articulating and collating the different regimes that exist right throughout the nation on how they deal with foreign investment.


Another recommendation that particularly took my fancy was:


The committee recommends that the government require that any non-commercial production from agricultural land and businesses by foreign government entities (including for the purposes of food security) is undertaken within relevant Australian Government foreign aid programs.


This is a significant recommendation. If you go to the detail behind that recommendation in the report—and I note that the galleries are waiting for speakers a lot more eloquent than I am, but I would recommend to all of you that, when you get home, you download from Hansard this—




Senator Boswell:
  Compulsory reading!




Senator McKENZIE:
  compulsory reading—thank you, Senator Boswell; I will take that interjection. Currently, the FIRB review process takes place when the Foreign Investment Review Board is notified of foreign investment proposals that are above relevant thresholds. We have heard a bit of discussion about thresholds today. Obviously, when a property like Cubbie Station does not make the cut, we have serious problems with our threshold here in this nation.


I really congratulate the coalition on their approach to foreign investment. I am finding, when I go out particularly into regional Victoria and talk about the coalition's plan about foreign investment, that people on the ground are extremely interested in the fact that that threshold has to be looked at and that we want to reduce it, because out in the regions they know that there ain't too many properties at $248 million for foreign investment. I might leave my comments there.



The PRESIDENT:  Are you seeking leave to continue your remarks later?




Senator McKENZIE:
  Yes, thank you, Mr President.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (19:20):  Thanks, Mr Deputy President, and I thank the Senate. There are some people who believe that senators cannot communicate with the public—that they are very poor retail politicians. Many of my friends in the lower house belief that, but then along came Senator Barnaby Joyce, one of the greatest retail politicians of our age. He touched and gave voice to Queenslanders that most of us could never, ever reach. He gave voice to the outsiders—those outside the cafes, those outside the cities, those outside the univer­sities, those outside the chattering classes—and gave voice to those conservative, often rural, blue-collar families that Labor has increasingly forsaken. He has always done that and done it so convincing­ly. He spoke to them and he spoke for them. There is another side, too: the well-read, the inquisitive, the passionate bloke who arrived in the Senate with something to say and then had the gall to say it.


Barnaby taught me about courage. He might easily have remained in the Senate, safe and secure forever, but he took on Mr Windsor with a majority of 72 per cent, and today, well, he is one step closer. Finally, Barnaby taught me all about conviction. Early on, he opposed the Rudd government's CPRS. That leadership was critical. We would never have come so close in 2010, and we certainly would not be in the position we are today, if Senator Joyce had not led us. 


Barnaby, I know this is not goodbye, perhaps it is au revoir. We will see you again. Be gentle, mate, when you go to the lower house, because they do not know what is about to hit them.
