"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2006-11-09,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006
Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006
Copyright Amendment Bill 2006
Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006
Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006

Inspector of Transport Security (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2006
Medibank Private Sale Bill 2006
Telecommunications Amendment (Integrated Public Number Database) Bill 2006.
I table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statements read as follows—

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING BILL 2006


ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006


Purpose of the bills

This “first tranche” of legislation repeals and replaces much of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and better implements parts of the revised (June 2003) Forty Recommendations of the OECD-based Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and several of FATF’s Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. The remainder of the FATF Recommendations (except for those implemented by other legislation) will be implemented via a future “second tranche” of legislation.

Reasons for Urgency

Passage of the bills is required in the 2006 Spring sittings to implement outstanding international obligations (arising out of Australia’s membership of FATF) to upgrade anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Justice and Customs)

CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NEW ZEALAND RULES OF ORIGIN) BILL 2006


Purpose of the bill

The bill amends the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Tariff Act 1995 and the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 to incorporate consequential changes that will result from the amendment of Article 3 of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) relating to Rules of Origin.

Reasons for Urgency

If the bill is not passed in the 2006 Spring sittings, Australia will be unable to meet its obligations to implement the amendments to Article 3 of the ANZCERTA on 1 January 2007.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Justice and Customs)

COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006


Purpose of the bill

The bill amends the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 (CRWM Act) to:
provide that failure to comply with the site nomination rules in section 3B does not affect the validity of the Minister’s approval under section 3C of a nomination;
remove any entitlement to procedural fairness in relation to a nomination made under section 3A; and
provide, should a nominated site ultimately be chosen for the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility (CRWMF), for the Commonwealth to return the nominated site to its original owners when it is no longer required.
The bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to:
exclude the application of the Act to a site nomination under section 3A of the CRWM Act to ensure consistency with existing provisions of the Act relating to sections 3C and 7 of the CRWM Act.

Reasons for Urgency

The bill addresses concerns raised by the Northern Land Council (NLC) in relation to nominating a site under the CRWM Act. If not addressed, the NLC may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land.
Any nominated site needs to be included in the current CRWMF site characterisation programme as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration within the current CRWMF project schedule.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Education, Science and Training)

ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006


Purpose of the bill

The bill implements the government’s decision to make the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) more efficient and effective, to allow for the use of more strategic approaches and to provide greater certainty in decision-making.
In particular, the bill:
reduces processing time and costs for development interests;
provides an enhanced ability to deal with large-scale projects and give priority attention to projects of national importance through the use of strategic assessment and approvals approaches and putting in place measures to enable developers to avoid impacts on the matters of national environmental significance protected by the EPBC Act;
enables a better focus on protecting threatened species and ecological communities and heritage places that are of real national importance; and
clarifies and strengthens the enforcement provisions of the EPBC Act.
These changes will be made without weakening the protection that the EPBC Act provides for Australia’s biodiversity and heritage.

Reasons for Urgency

Passage of the bill is required in the 2006 Spring sittings to ensure that these critical amendments can commence operation on 1 January 2007. The amendments will provide the necessary regulatory framework to provide streamlined and certain decision-making under the EPBC Act along with more focused environmental protection and enhanced enforcement provisions.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage)

COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL 2006


Purpose of the bill

The bill contains provisions to implement Australia’s remaining obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) concerning intellectual property rights. It creates a liability scheme for certain activities relating to the circumvention of “effective technological measures”. These measures help protect copyright owners from piracy and will encourage the increased availability to consumers of copyright materials in digital form.
The AUSFTA sets out a number of permissible exceptions to the liability scheme for:
interoperability of software
studying encryption technology
testing security of computer networks
identifying and disabling “spyware”
security, law enforcement and similar governmental purposes, and
access for acquisition decisions by libraries, archives and educational institutions.
The AUSFTA also provides for additional limited exceptions where the case for such an exception has been demonstrated. The bill amends the Copyright Act 1968 to give effect to the liability scheme and the exceptions. Additional limited exceptions will be included in the Copyright Regulations on a case by case basis. A number will be included as a result of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs “Review of TPM Exceptions”.
The bill also implements the outcomes of several copyright reviews conducted by the government in 2005-06, including the outcome of the “Fair Use Review” and the review of protection for encoded broadcasts. The bill also extends the jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal, makes amendments so that Australia can accede to the World Intellectual Property Organization Internet treaties and makes a range of changes to the enforcement provisions in the Copyright Act.

Reasons for Urgency

The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement came into force on 1 January 2005. However, an additional two year period was granted for the commencement of the provisions relating to the liability scheme for the circumvention of effective technological measures. Those provisions, which will be given effect to by this bill, must commence on 1 January 2007.
(Circulated by authority of the Attorney-General)

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT (INTEGRATED PUBLIC NUMBER DATABASE) BILL 2006


Purpose of the bill

The bill clarifies arrangements for access to data contained in the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND).

Reasons for Urgency

The current regime under the Telecommunications Act 1997 for access to data held in the IPND is under pressure to balance the privacy of personal information on the database with the need to make information in the IPND available for public interest purposes. Demand for access to IPND data continues to grow due to its recognition as an accurate and up-to-date source of information. There are, however, reports of data sourced from the IPND also being used for inappropriate purposes, such as the illegitimate production of public number directories and debt collection activities.
Introduction and passage of the bill in the 2006 Spring sittings will allay increasing community and industry concerns about current access arrangements to the IPND.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts)

INSPECTOR OF TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2006


INSPECTOR OF TRANSPORT SECURITY (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2006


Purpose of the bills

The bills provide for the role of the Inspector of Transport Security to:
undertake an inquiry, when required by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (the Minister), into:
a major transport security incident;
a pattern or series of incidents that point to a systemic failure or possible weakness of aviation or maritime transport security regulatory systems; or
any other transport security matter;
undertake an inquiry, when required by the Minister, into a major land transport security incident, subject to agreement of the relevant state or territory government; and
report outcomes of an inquiry to the Minister in a reasonable timeframe.

Reasons for Urgency

The Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, was appointed by the government in 2004 on an administrative basis.
Following consultation undertaken by Mr Palmer with industry and relevant state bodies, it was decided that a legislative basis is essential to provide a solid basis for the “no blame” nature of the inquiries.
It is desirable that legislation be passed as soon as possible in order to ensure that the Inspector’s inquiries have an appropriate legal basis and protections.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services)

MEDIBANK PRIVATE LIMITED SALE BILL 2006


Purpose of the bill

The purpose of the bill is to remove a statutory prohibition on the sale of Medibank Private Limited’s shares, and to implement other measures appropriate to facilitate the sale of the Company.

Reasons for Urgency

On 12 September 2006, the Government announced its intention to sell Medibank Private Limited through a share market float in 2008. The legislation is essential to the sale of the Commonwealth’s shares in Medibank Private Limited, and the sale timetable is dependent upon the legislation being enacted.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin)

Senator Bob Brown to move on the next day of sitting:

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-11-09,"—In my remarks yesterday afternoon on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 I was making the point that there had been an amazing amount of very positive work done to review this legislation and acknowledge that it needed to be changed. But my fear is that the undue process—the lack of consideration of the actual legislation—could make it more difficult for us to engage with all those people who need to be involved in the ongoing process will feel pushed away and dismissed, and therefore not able to fully have their views understood and respected. This is an absolute shame because this legislation that touches upon families and children and their survival in our community has not been given the respect it deserves.
In the time that I have left, I want to make a couple of points about Labor’s concerns. One of the things that we raised in the committee inquiry was the impact of the changed model on those people who currently rely on their payments for their continuing survival in our community. I speak about this aspect having had the opportunity of being involved in the Senate’s poverty inquiry several years ago. That inquiry heard significant evidence from all states across Australia of the financial difficulties experienced by single parents. Their difficulties are not denied by most people—certainly not by the people who represent single parents or the welfare agencies in this country that work most closely with people who need support on a regular basis. Support is not only provided on the basis of a one-off crisis, which used to be the way that welfare agencies operated in Australia, agencies like St Vincent de Paul, Lifeline, Anglicare—the whole range of community support organisations—and, particularly, the Smith Family, who focus exclusively on issues to do with children. Those agencies provided evidence with one voice to the Senate inquiry on poverty—and many of them also provided submissions to this legislation inquiry—and pointed out the tenuous balance that single parents have in regard to their financial security. And we know that there is not just one stream of financial support.
In terms of the way that single families balance their income, we know that they have child support payments, which is the basis of the legislation the Senate is discussing at the moment, and we know that they have the family tax payment benefits brought in by this government as well as other elements of employment response that all come together in the bucket of money that families need to survive. One thing that is very clear about the bucket of money we are talking about for single parent families in lower income brackets is that it is precariously small. The debate that we are going to have on rejigging the model, which is the basis of the whole revamp of this legislation, will determine exactly how payments will be distributed—those payments being a major stream of finance for any single parent family. We know that the modelling is being conducted with strong research provided by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, and we welcome that. In fact, the role of the AIFS must be enhanced in any future consideration of the impact of this on Australian families. That is a particular concern for many of us on this side of the chamber.
Under questioning to the AIFS about the kind of work they did leading to the development of the child support legislation, we asked specifically whether the Welfare to Work legislation had been considered in their research and extensive modelling. They said no. We then asked whether that inquiry had been put to them, whether their significant expertise had been requested in the various considerations by the government about what the implementation of Welfare to Work would do to single parent families. They said no.
That was extremely confronting for us on the committee, because there has been a focus on single parent families by this government over a period of time, most particularly over the last 12 months or so as the Welfare to Work legislation has been brought through this place and implemented in the community. The Welfare to Work legislation focused on economic security for single parents. None of us have any argument with the concept of access to employment and the development of enhancements for single families. The issue about which we are arguing is how the government can pursue legislation in the child support area, using a range of consultation mechanisms and talking about where this is going to take single parent income into the future, whilst at the same time introduce another raft of legislation focused on those same families. It does not look at them together. In a period when we consistently talk about cross-departmental liaison and whole-of-government response, how could this be seen as credible?
In terms of where we go next, as I have said consistently, we need to have a process whereby people feel confident in the system and feel as though their issues are being taken into account by the system. They need to know that there will be genuine involvement in whatever happens in their interactions between them and the government. How can we move forward when such a basic issue is seemingly ignored? No-one seemed to have an argument with whether this was appropriate or not; it just had not been done. The message we have for the people dedicating their time to developing the child support legislation and the reform of the Child Support Scheme is: moving forward, please ensure that the consultative mechanisms involve the best possible resources that this country can offer—and we have them. That is one of the more frustrating elements. We have the Australian Institute of Family Studies, we have various community groups and we have people working to put forward the views of single parents.
One of the things we did find—and I know that this is no surprise to people—is that, when we had representatives looking at the issues of single mothers and the issues of non-custodial men, sometimes it was difficult to have them cooperate effectively at the table and to respect each other’s views. But we did have an understanding that, if we are going to proceed, that kind of discussion must occur. It may be difficult. It may sometimes be difficult when developing the legislation to balance effectively and to find a path upon which most people can agree, but the discussions must be had. People must be assured that their views are not being taken in a token way—that the issues will be genuinely reviewed and considered and the whole impact of what is happening in our society and economically will be taken into account so that one series of decisions will not be taken in isolation. That has been one of the serious faults until now.
There is no way that the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 will have the opportunity to succeed if those issues are not effectively considered. No piece of legislation can ever be considered in isolation, and no piece of legislation is beyond review. We need to have a process of review before the legislation is put in place. We have an opportunity to do that with this legislation because it is a part of a series of implementation processes, which I understand will not be concluded until 2008.
We have the chance to engage with people effectively throughout this whole process. But the engagement is dependent upon a sense that the voices will be respected and heard. If you lose trust now, if you in any way dismiss people from credibly partaking in this process, it will fail. We cannot afford it to fail because no-one believes that the child support system at the moment is working perfectly. In fact, I do not think anyone truly believes that the child support system will ever work perfectly. It is reliant on so many streams of information and knowledge and it is also dealing with people during a period of crisis. So we need to ensure that what is put in place is as effective as possible so that people feel confident in being part of the system. They need to be able to acknowledge that—even if their personal pet projects or issues are not taken up—they have been considered and the review process will continue.
The legislation is dynamic. If things are implemented and found to not be as effective as they ought, we must have the chance to come back and rejig things. I think that is something that our system allows, but we need to make sure that there is an ongoing review process and that it is not just at set times. This is not the kind of process that can rely on a two-year or 10-year review. At the beginning of the implementation of the new model, the process that I believe has been effectively put in place till now with the various streams of advisory groups, using the expertise that we have in this country, should be continued formally—not on an informal basis but formally. That commitment seemed to be given by the department and the government during the committee process that we had.
We have the opportunity now to move forward. I continue to be concerned about some of the implementation processes, and I believe that will come up in the committee process. How we ensure that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal process is effectively resourced and how we can make sure that the legal elements around that are implemented is something we can discuss.
I am pleased that the Child Support Agency received a considerable increase in resources in the last budget. I have said on previous occasions that I was deeply concerned that the Child Support Agency had not received appropriate resourcing over the last 10 years and that if we are going to have confidence in this system being able to be implemented fully we need to have a strongly resourced public sector that is doing the work that has to be done. They need to be well trained, well resourced and responsive to the range of people who are relying on child support for their financial security. In terms of where we go next, there needs to be an ongoing process of cross-departmental cooperation, because child support is not a single agency. It relies on so many other forms of legislation and bases. The department has been introducing things over a period of time. The Attorney-General’s Department, Centrelink and the Taxation Office all have to be brought together such that they focus on the issues of child support.
As we work through the Welfare to Work process, working with agencies who now work with the community is essential. The government have said that that is part of their plan. We want to be part of that plan. Wonderful people continue to come forward, consistently saying that they want to work with the government despite the fact that they know that their own issues may not be able to be dealt with completely. Those people from various community groups came to see us when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs was meeting. We must continue to value them. We respect their honesty. We also know that it is our community responsibility to respond to children particularly through the child support legislation. The hope that was brought to so many families when the original legislation was passed must be maintained. It can never be allowed to just go without question. Children are the central point of any legislation looking at child support, and the financial and social interests of children must be maintained into the future.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2006-11-09,"—I rise to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The Labor government established the Child Support Scheme in 1988. The existing scheme has been in place since 1989. The interim has seen a fundamental philosophical shift in family/carer models, articulated nicely by the Australian Institute of Family Studies—from a ‘one home, one carer’ model to a ‘two home, two family/carer’ model. They said:
This shift reflects mounting social science evidence that the interests of children post-divorce are generally best served when children can maintain ongoing and frequent contact with both parents who can cooperate. The Scheme was originally built in a world where fathers were typically the sole breadwinners in families while mothers were the primary carers of children. But with rapid social and economic change over the past decade or so in Australia—whereby both parents are increasingly in the labour force, relation breakdown is pervasive ...
The institute further stated:
… the shift from the old ‘sole (maternal) custody’ model towards greater sharing of the care of children makes sense—so long, of course, as children’s needs, interests and wishes are heard and protected.
I might also add: wellbeing.
The process of child support reform has been lengthy and complex. In December 2003, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs delivered its report on family separation issues: Every picture tells a story. That report recommended the establishment of a ministerial task force to inquire into the Child Support Scheme. The terms of reference for the task force, supported by the reference group, were:
1. Provide advice around the short-term recommendations of the Committee along the lines of those set out in the Report (Recommendation 25) that relate to:
increasing the minimum child support liability;
lowering the maximum ‘cap’ on the assessed income of parents;
changing the link between the child support payments and the time children spend with each parent; and
the treatment of any overtime income and income from a second job.
2. Evaluate the existing formula percentages and associated exempt and disregarded incomes, having regard to the findings of the Report and the available or commissioned research including:
data on the costs of children in separated households at different income levels, including the costs for both parents to maintain significant and meaningful contact with their children;
the costs for both parents of re-establishing homes for their children and themselves after separation;
advise on what research program is necessary to provide an ongoing basis for monitoring the child support formula.
3. Consider how the Child Support Scheme can play a role in encouraging couples to reach agreement about parenting arrangements.
4. Consider how Family Relationship Centres may contribute to the understanding of and compliance with the Child Support Scheme.
The task force was chaired by Professor Parkinson. Its report—which undertook a comprehensive assessment and made 30 recommendations to overhaul the system—was submitted to the government in May 2005 and was released in June 2005 as a two-volume report entitled In the best interests of children—reforming the Child Support Scheme, which has become known as the Parkinson report. At the time of the release of the Parkinson report, Labor indicated:
... that child support policy must put the interests of children first, reduce child poverty, ensure both parents contribute to their children’s well being and encourage them to maintain ongoing roles in their children’s lives.
The measures contained in this bill come on top of the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006, which was passed in June this year. That bill provided the legislative basis for stage 1 of the reforms of the Child Support Scheme. The bill changed the capacity-to-earn provisions for parents, increased and indexed the minimum payment, increased the amount of the child support payment that the non-resident parent can direct to specific purposes, dealt with a constitutional issue regarding application of the Child Support Scheme to ex-nuptial children in Western Australia, and reduced the cap on the income of non-resident parents which is assessable for child support purposes.
The Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which we are now debating, seeks to implement the second and third stage of the child support reform package. The second stage reforms will introduce the independent review of all Child Support Agency decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, broaden the powers of the courts to ensure that child support obligations are met and strengthen the relationship between the courts and the Child Support Scheme. The reforms will also allow separating parents more time to work out parenting arrangements before their family tax benefit is affected. These changes are due to commence on 1 January 2007.
Under the third stage of reform measures, the bill will introduce a new child support formula that will change the way child support payments are calculated, change the treatment of income from second jobs and overtime, change the treatment of parents with dependent stepchildren when calculating their child support liability, simplify the change of assessment rules for altering the amount of child support that is payable, and change the arrangements for parents who wish to make agreements for ongoing child support or lump sum payments. These changes are due to commence on 1 July 2008.
I know that all members of parliament and senators have received many emails, phone calls and letters about the Child Support Scheme. Many people have documented their concerns about the current system and the proposed provisions. I am also aware of many of the stories that have been related by the people involved. This is a very sensitive area of policy and it is one we need to get right. The decisions we make here today will affect how literally hundreds of thousands of families function.
On 14 September the bills were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which reported on 10 October 2006. All witnesses regretted the very short time frame the Senate committee had for its inquiry into the bill—except one, as Senator Moore indicated; the department did not list that as a concern. The Men’s Rights Agency commented, and I quote from the Senate report:
I have to say that the lack of time is really quite appalling. I will not say anymore; I think everyone else has covered it. But three days to produce a submission after 300 pages and 200 pages of explanatory memorandum is quite impossible.
This view was shared by the Senate community affairs committee in its report, which stated:
... the legislation is complex, detailed and the timeframe for consideration of the legislation was very short.
The Senate committee went on to recommend:
The Committee ... has considered the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme —New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 to the extent possible in the available time ...
Labor and Greens senators on the committee, in their additional comments to the report, stated:
Labor and the Greens believe that it is unreasonable for the government to expect witnesses to respond and express their views on such a complex and lengthy piece of legislation in such a short period of time.
They continued:
While Labor and Greens Senators are mindful that there are major implementation issues with aspects of the Bill, these issues are not serious enough to have warranted the restricted timeframe imposed on the Committee by the Government.
Labor’s approach to this policy area has always been guided by a set of core principles. Absolutely critical to these core principles is that the interests and wellbeing of children must always come first. Labor has previously expressed its support for child support reform but noted concerns about the potential negative financial impact on low-income, single parent households.
Labor recognises and has stated previously that the package as a whole is carefully crafted by an expert committee, which has endeavoured to provide a balance based on the results of its research. In designing a new payments formula, the task force has based its calculations on research into the actual costs of raising children. The most significant change in the bill is the introduction of a new formula for calculating the child support payment obligations of non-resident parents, which is to apply from 1 July 2008.
The bill also includes compliance, enforcement and recovery provisions. These provisions must ensure that obligations are being met appropriately. I welcome the fact that the agency will be able to pursue non-resident parents who fail to provide for their children, given that only half of non-resident parents meet their child support obligations in full and on time—a long overdue and much needed improvement. The difference between the current formula and the proposed formula for child support liability is that the current formula is calculated using fixed percentages of income and the proposed formula is based on evidence received on the actual costs of raising children, shared parental responsibility and the level of parental care. Analysis undertaken for the ministerial task force showed that, under the new formula, low-income families could experience reduced child support payments.
Labor and Greens senators of the Senate committee highlighted their concern in their comments:
... [we] are very concerned, however, that there is no publicly available modelling to estimate the impact of the new system on existing child support recipients and payers. The lack of analysis is doubly concerning given that the Government has made no provision to protect low income families who may lose income as a result of the Bill.
It is our understanding that the CSA will reassess all clients’ payments under the new formula once the Bill is passed and before it comes into effect on 1 July 2008.
The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, as the agency with policy responsibility for the Bill, should produce modelling to quantify the impact on existing child support customers, and make provision to protect low income households who may lose income. Such protections are critical given the risk of poverty already confronted by these families.
Labor’s view is that there has been failure to make adequate transitional arrangements for people who may lose under the new arrangements. In evidence to the Senate committee, Professor Parkinson and the Australian Institute of Family Studies both agreed that this was the case. Professor Parkinson also noted that the costs of child-rearing in families with very low incomes are now largely met by family payments. However, no evidence was produced to support this argument. The department indicated that it would undertake regular monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the new arrangements on affected families. The Australian Institute of Family Studies also indicated to the Senate inquiry that it would have an ongoing role in tracking the implementation of the new scheme, including finetuning the formula over the long term if required.
It is critical that the government implement adequate transitional arrangements and make sure that ongoing monitoring and evaluation is effective to ensure that these changes do not lead to income reductions for low-income families, who are already some of the most vulnerable in the community. We must be vigilant to ensure that these provisions do not cause these families to be worse off. As a result, the Labor Party will move to establish a Senate inquiry next year to properly examine the impact of the bill, particularly to examine whether any of these families are worse off. I hope the terms of reference for the inquiry, to be moved next year, will be supported by all senators.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-11-09,"—In response to the comprehensive recommendations made by the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson, the government has commenced the reform of the Child Support Scheme. This will ensure that the scheme works in the best interests of children while balancing the interests of parents and reflecting community expectations.
The first stage of the reforms commenced in July this year, and the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 delivers the legislation for the remaining two stages of the reforms. The bill also complements our recent reforms of the family law system. In particular, both the family law changes and the present bill aim to encourage shared parenting and to reduce conflict. The government is backing these reforms with a commitment of nearly $400 million to establish a network of family relationship centres and relationship support services in the community. One of the task force’s major findings was that the Child Support Scheme needed updating because of substantial changes in Australian society and in the situations of many Australian families since the scheme’s establishment in 1988.
The community has expressed concern about how children and their parents have coped following marriage and relationship breakdown. This was evident in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on child custody arrangements in the event of family separation. The report, Every picture tells a story, recommended that a task force be established to examine the child support formula. In addition, people are more aware of the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children’s lives after separation.
The new scheme is based on fairness to both parents and is focused on the needs and costs of children. It will also be better integrated with the family law and income support systems. These improvements should reduce conflict between parents about parenting arrangements and encourage shared parental responsibility. The new child support formula is at the heart of these reforms. The new formula is based on new expert Australian research on the costs of caring for children and reflects community beliefs about separated parenting.
There are a number of important differences between the current formula and the new formula. One difference is that the current formula fixes percentages of income, assuming people spend the same proportion of their income on children regardless of their level of income. However, the new research conducted by the task force shows that, while people with higher incomes spend more on their children than people with lower incomes, those on higher incomes spend less as a percentage of their total income. The current formula does not distinguish between the ages of children. This means that the much higher expenses associated with teenagers go unrecognised. Under the current formula, the income of resident parents is treated more generously than that of non-resident parents, and contact by the non-resident parent is not taken into account until it is at high levels. Finally, the treatment of second families is unfairly and inconsistently taken into account under the current formula.
In contrast, the new formula draws on Australian research into the real costs of children based on the level of parents’ incomes and the children’s ages. An income share approach, which means that both parents will have the same amount deducted as self-support, will be used and both parents’ incomes will be considered in establishing the costs of the children. The resulting costs will be apportioned between the parents according to their share of combined income.
In order to share non-resident parents’ involvement with their children, parents who care for their children for at least 14 per cent of the time will be recognised as contributing to the costs of the children through their care. In addition, first and second families will be treated equally. This will be done by using the actual costs of the children from the second family rather than a flat amount in working out child support payable for the first family. Another measure means that a resident parent will keep all of their family tax benefit if a non-resident parent has care of their child for less than 35 per cent of nights in a year.
The new formula will be introduced from 1 July 2008, and the Child Support Agency and Centrelink will ensure that parents are notified of the changes that affect them well in advance. The Child Support Agency and Centrelink will establish comprehensive systems to assist parents in adjusting for their new child support arrangements.
A number of reforms are due to commence on 1 January 2007. One major reform is the expansion of the role of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to provide an independent review of child support decisions. Presently, external administrative review of child support decisions is limited to review by the courts, which can be an expensive, time-consuming and frustrating process. The new arrangements will improve the consistency and transparency of child support decisions and will provide a review mechanism that is inexpensive, fair, informal and quick.
Other changes commencing on 1 January 2007 are amendments to simplify the relationship between the courts and the new Child Support Scheme. These changes include providing parents with better access to court enforcement of child support debts. The changes also align the court’s powers to seek information and evidence in relation to child support matters with those of the Child Support Registrar, thus increasing the court’s ability to understand and investigate matters. The courts will also have increased powers to make interim arrangements in relation to child support cases.
As well as the new formula, other changes are commencing on 1 July 2008. These changes are to improve the overall effectiveness and fairness of the scheme. If parents wish to make agreements between themselves about the payment of child support, including payment by way of a lump sum, the bill introduces changes to provide better legal protection and increased flexibility for these arrangements. Other changes relate to the family tax benefit. The family tax benefit intersects in many ways with the Child Support Scheme. In recognition of this, and to support parents in determining their child support arrangements, child support and family tax benefit will be more closely aligned as a result of the bill. Specifically, the maintenance arrangements for family tax benefit part A will be changed, with the result that reduction under the maintenance income test that applies to payment above the base level will be limited to those children in the family for whom child support is paid.
The bill will also align the income definitions used to calculate child support and family tax benefit. Currently, the respective income definitions lead to varying treatment for certain tax-free amounts, foreign income and fringe benefits. Certain definitions will be broadened. The definition of child support income will now include certain tax-free pensions and benefits that already apply for family tax benefit. The definition of foreign income for child support and family tax benefit will also be widened and they will be aligned with each other. The gross value of reportable fringe benefits, rather than the net value, will apply for the family tax benefit, as it already does for child support. The changes to income for family tax benefit will also apply for child-care benefit.
Another change is to improve the fairness of the minimum payment rules. The minimum payment for non-resident parents who pay child support in more than one case will be about $6.15 per week per case, up to a maximum of three cases. If parents deliberately minimise their income to avoid paying child support they will be required to pay $20 per child per week, up to a maximum of three children, unless they can prove their income is in fact very low.
The bill also recognises that, following separation, parents will have re-establishment costs. Accordingly, parents who use income from second jobs and overtime to re-establish themselves will be able to apply to have their child support calculated taking into account their re-establishment costs. This applies for the first three years after separation. Presently, the Child Support Scheme can create difficulties for parents who separate, attempt to reconcile and then separate again. Under the changes introduced by this bill, parents will be able to suspend child support payments for a period of six months when they get back together again. If the reconciliation is not successful, the resident parent will be able to reinstate the child support assessment without applying again. This measure aims to reduce any further conflict between the parents by removing the pressure of worrying about child support assessment.
Many parents also have financial responsibilities for stepchildren. These parents will now be able to apply to have the stepchild treated as a dependent child under the child support formula for the parent’s first family. There are circumstances in which parents may wish to change their child support assessment. The bill clarifies and simplifies these processes, which are currently very confusing for many parents.
This is a significant package of reforms and will introduce extensive changes to the Child Support Scheme. These changes will ensure that the Child Support Scheme is fairer to parents; therefore reducing conflict, which, as we all know, is in the best interests of children. I commend the bill to the Senate. I believe it should have a speedy passage. It has been very extensively debated and discussed for a considerable period of time. I note the thoughtful contributions made by senators in this debate. Hopefully, this bill can be passed into law as quickly as possible.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Chris Evans’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,13,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-11-09,"—On behalf of the Democrats I wish to make some comments on the provisions of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Bill 2006 and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. This legislation is the government’s response to the findings from the dosimetry and mortality in cancer incidence study of the Australian participants in those tests, which were released in June this year. The study identified increased cancer rates and cancer deaths amongst participants of the tests. Cancer rates were in fact 23 per cent higher among the participants than in the general population and death rates were 18 per cent higher. This legislation essentially provides the equivalent of a veteran’s white card for cancer testing and treatment of surviving participants in those tests during the 1950s and 1960s.
The Democrats support efforts, however long overdue, to provide fair and just treatment to those Australians who were involved in the tests. This is a welcome step in the right direction: a bill providing for non-liability treatment for cancers for the participants. It is now 50 years since the tests took place. Many people were exposed to the radiation and it has harmed them. These people have been poorly treated in our view over the last half a century or so. Indeed, about half of the test participants—that is some 5,000 to 6,000 people involved in the tests—have died without recognition and without justice.
Unfortunately, this bill does not go far enough. It is an inadequate and miserly response. It does nothing to address the longstanding issues that service personnel and civilian participants have been asking to have resolved. The reality is that the people involved in the tests are getting older and the longer the government takes to respond to their concerns the fewer participants will be around to benefit.
It took years for the government to commission the study into the health consequences of exposure to radiation at the test sites and it took a further seven years for them to finish the study. I acknowledge that this is a difficult area to research and to find hard evidence. It was difficult because a lot of that evidence was kept secret, or in fact was not kept at all or was tossed away. Research gets harder of course the longer it is put off, but it does need to be acknowledged that there have been many criticisms of this government funded research—its methodologies, the findings, the processes involved in overseeing the report and of course the way that government has interpreted and used it. Those criticisms include: the nominal roll of participants used to create the sample for the study was deficient; the radiation dosages allocated to participants in the study were underestimated and the effects of the radiation dosages were underestimated. The evidence was said to be inadequate to explain the higher rate of cancer among the nuclear test participants by other, non-radiation, causes.
The study assessed the correlation between all cancers experienced by the study population and radiation doses, instead of focusing on the correlation with increased cancer experience. The study ignored what is commonly referred to as the ‘healthy soldier’ effect, instead preferring to use the general population as a comparison. The study did not include cancer related deaths in the assessment of cancer incidence in the study population. The study focused on ionising radiation and did not assess the health impacts of exposure to other substances related to participation in the tests, such as asbestos, beryllium and highly enriched uranium. It did not address other non-cancer effects of participation in the tests such as sterility, defective immune systems and the like. Due to lack of data the study did not cover the period prior to 1982, and other studies indicate that the incidence of cancer and cancer deaths among test participants may have been highest then. And the study did not include Indigenous people and others exposed to the effects of the tests such as pastoralists. All of these criticisms identify ways in which exposure to radiation and consequent illness would have been underestimated. It needs to be pointed out that these criticisms have been raised on a number of occasions and in various ways, but the government has failed to respond in any meaningful sort of way.
The government also ignores the recommendations from the Clarke review. Back in 2003 that review recommended:
Participation by Australian Defence Force personnel in the British atomic tests be declared non-warlike hazardous and the legislation be amended to ensure that this declaration can have effect in extending VEA coverage.
The review also recommended that the cancer and mortality study be finalised quickly. As I said, the participants in the tests had to wait three more years for the study results, and then all they have is this lame response. The committee’s main report acknowledges that, according to the Clarke report, coverage as hazardous service under the VEA would provide greater entitlements than offered by this legislation, particularly to the widows of service people.
The fact is that this legislation provides an ability to treat people for cancer but it does little else. It does nothing to respond to the other health needs of participants. It does not respond to the health needs that the children of participants may have. It does not do anything for the partners and families of participants who have died as a consequence of their exposure to radiation during the tests. And the legislation does not go to the question of compensation—and that is the glaring deficiency in terms of this legislation.
Compensation, as we all know, has been very difficult for these victims to obtain. Only nine cases to date of compensation related to the effects of ionising radiation have been made by the Australian government under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The current compensation pathways present many difficulties for participants trying to obtain compensation. It is time consuming, very expensive and places the burden of proof on the individual. I might say that it is also the case that the government has fought these cases actively. In 2006 there were no successful cases under that scheme. These individuals of course have difficulty accessing hospital and dosage records and are ill-matched to meet the resources of the government.
The government, through the provision of these compensation payments to a small number of successful claimants, has acknowledged its liability for exposure to radiation during the tests. The compensation provided by the British government and subsequent efforts to remediate Maralinga are also recognition of the contamination resulting from the tests. The government has finally recognised that it has an obligation to provide at least cancer treatment for test participants.
We say that the government should act with integrity towards those who participated in the tests and their families. It should stop hiding behind denials of the consequences of exposure to radiation and address the issue of compensation. But the government has missed the point. This is not simply about health care for cancer; it is about a great debt that Australia owes to those who were exposed to, in some cases, very high levels of radiation as a result of being participants. Often those people did not understand that this was likely but went in good faith to work on those tests. Some would say that their reward was grossly inadequate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS IN BRITISH NUCLEAR TESTS (TREATMENT) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-11-09,"—This legislation is of particular interest to me because many of the people involved still live in my home state of South Australia, or their families do. Labor supports the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Bill 2006 and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 in their provision of non-liability treatment and testing of cancers among participants in the British nuclear tests in Australia.
Whilst Labor does support these bills, it should be noted that the bills do little to address the longstanding issues of recognition and compensation for the ill effects that are claimed to have been suffered by the nuclear test participants. The issues of recognition and compensation are especially pertinent to the Australian servicemen who participated in the tests. These servicemen have argued for a long time that their service should be classified as ‘non-warlike hazardous’ under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. They argue that a declaration of non-warlike hazardous service is justified due to the very unique nature of the tests.
The decision to grant a declaration of non-warlike hazardous service for any conflict or group can often be very controversial. Therefore, it is no surprise that the government asked the Clarke review to examine the standing of the Australian servicemen in respect of the VEA. The 2003 Clarke review examined this issue. Their conclusions were as follows:
The Committee believes that the British atomic test series was a unique, extraordinary event in Australia’s history. Atomic devices were exploded in Australia, with Australian forces potentially exposed to levels of radiation beyond what would today be considered safe levels. By common sense and by any reasonable measure, service in the test operations must be regarded as involving hazards beyond those of normal peacetime duties.
There is evidence that members of Australia’s armed services were placed in danger from ionising radiation and other toxic materials used in the test program, and natural justice for these members is long overdue. The Commonwealth Government should provide these members of Australia’s armed services with compensation coverage under the VEA.
The Committee considers that service with the British atomic tests should be assessed as non-warlike hazardous service for the purposes of the VEA. A declaration of non-warlike hazardous service would provide the ADF personnel who participated in the testing program with, at least, immediate and free health care for all cancers and for posttraumatic stress disorder whilst claims for compensation are made and determined under the VEA.
The Committee notes the development of a nominal roll of Australian atomic test participants. While it appears that many of the people whose names are on the preliminary roll may have left test sites prior to any tests being undertaken, the Committee also notes advice from DVA that the Department is aware of concerns about the accuracy of the roll and that work is continuing to refine it further. The Committee also notes that a proposal for reconstruction of dosage estimates is being considered. These matters need to proceed quickly and Government should assist with additional resources if necessary. The Government should also consider thoroughly addressing the concerns of the atomic test participants about access to records.
The committee recommended that:
Participation by Australian defence force personnel in the British atomic tests should be declared non-warlike hazardous and the legislation should be amended to ensure that this declaration can have effect in extending VEA coverage.
The Government move quickly to finalise the cancer and mortality study.
With these bills today, the government appears to have ignored these recommendations of its own taxpayer funded independent review. Not only has it ignored the recommendations of this independent review but also it has ignored a wide variety of ex-service organisations.
The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade examined these pieces of legislation and the report was tabled yesterday after a public hearing on Monday. At the public hearing a number of ex-service organisations supported bringing the servicemen who participated in the tests under the VEA. These organisations included the RSL, the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association, the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association, the Injured Service Persons Association and the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council. It is a shame that the government has failed to take the advice of these organisations in its decision to not extend coverage under the VEA for servicemen who participated in the tests.
I must admit that I find the minister’s refusal to implement this recommendation disappointing given that, when he was a backbencher, he wrote a submission to the Clarke review on this issue. I would now like to quote from it. It says:
Of all the individual cases and VEA ‘disappointments’ I have canvassed ... two distinct classes of claims seem unfairly treated.
I write in support of operational service such as mine clearing and nuclear veterans’ service being declared Hazardous Service under the Veteran’s Entitlements Act 1986.
Nuclear Veteran’s service should be declared as Hazardous service by the Review of Veterans’ Entitlements (Clarke Review), as Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel involved in the British atomic tests in Australia were placed in a life threatening environment. Only now are they and the community experiencing the true consequences of their service, in particular, the devastating impact of exposure on the health and wellbeing of our veterans.
A high proportion of our veterans involved in the atomic tests have experienced conditions attributed to their exposure to radiation, with many losing their lives.
The current minister, then a backbencher, concludes:
Veterans involved in British Atomic tests and mine clearance exercises deserve to be recognised as having carried out Hazardous Service. Although the battlefield may be less conventional the threat to life and the danger to which our veterans were exposed amount to an active deployment into harms way.
This raises the question of why the minister has dropped his support for the atomic test veterans. Why, when the minister finally had the chance to fix what he himself has called ‘unfair treatment’ and ‘disappointments’, did he not take it? Why, when so many ex-service organisations have come out in support of the Clarke recommendations, has the minister ignored them?
Labor support the bills, especially the awarding of non-liability treatment to all participants. However, servicemen are not included. Our position is that the government has not gone far enough and that, under the VEA, this legislation should have also awarded coverage to servicemen. It has been a longstanding position of the Labor Party that, when in government, we will reconsider this government’s refusal to recognise the service of the atomic test veterans as ‘non-warlike hazardous’.
Finally, I urge the minister to read the committee report and to consider some of the issues that were raised with regard to the health study which formed the basis of this legislative response. The committee report noted criticisms of the study—which Senator Allison outlined in her contribution—which included that the nominal roll of participants used to create the sample for the study was deficient; the radiation dosages allocated to participants in the study were underestimated; the effects of the radiation dosages were underestimated; and there was insufficient evidence to explain the higher rate of cancer among the nuclear test participants by other non-radiation causes. Further, the study assessed the correlation between all cancers experienced by the study population and radiation doses, instead of focusing on the correlation with increased cancer experience. The study did not include cancer related deaths in the assessment of cancer incidence in the study population. The study focused on ionising radiation and did not assess the health impacts of exposure to other substances related to participation in the tests, such as asbestos, beryllium and highly enriched uranium. The study did not address other non-cancer health effects of participation in the tests, such as sterility and defective immune systems, due to lack of data. The study did not cover the period prior to 1982, when other studies indicate that the incidence of cancer and cancer deaths among test participants may have been highest. The study did not include Indigenous people and others who were exposed to the effects of the tests.
It should be noted that the committee in no way could validate any of these concerns. However, the committee noted its concern that the department’s conduct of the consultation process had drawn criticism from a range of people and organisations. I urge the minister to address some of these concerns, and I suggest that he organise meetings with some of the more strident critics of the health study. While these bills do not go far enough and fail to address the issue of recognition for servicemen, Labor will support them. We hope that they will make a big difference to those most in need of this treatment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS IN BRITISH NUCLEAR TESTS (TREATMENT) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—The Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Bill 2006 and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 give effect to the government’s decision to provide non-liability treatment and testing for cancer for eligible Australian participants of the British nuclear tests. I thank Senator Hurley and Senator Allison for their general support of the legislation. The government will not be accepting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Allison on behalf of the Democrats. However, the decision on the amendment will made by the Senate.
The government has recognised the special health needs of some nuclear test participants identified through the Mortality and Cancer Incidence Study conducted on behalf of the Repatriation Commission. Although the study found that the rate of some cancers among nuclear test participants was higher than in the general Australian population, it did not link the increase in cancer rates to exposure to radiation. Despite this lack of association between cancer rates and radiation exposure, the government has decided that it is appropriate to provide treatment for nuclear participants who have any form of cancer.
Persons who may be eligible under this legislation are Australian Defence Force personnel, Australian Public Service employees and third-party civilian contractors. Treatment will be provided through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and persons eligible will have access to extensive healthcare services, including GP services, hospital care and pharmaceutical benefits. Persons eligible under this legislation will also be entitled to travelling expenses for costs incurred in receiving treatment or testing for cancer. Furthermore, Australian nuclear test participants will have continued access, under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, to existing statutory workers compensation schemes and to the administrative scheme administered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.
These bills will also assist in addressing the health needs of the Australian military and civilian personnel who participated in the British nuclear tests and they demonstrate this government’s commitment to this group of Australians. I commend these bills to the Senate and note their part in providing good social policy outcomes for Australia’s veteran community to whom we owe so much.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-11-09,"—This Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2006 will amend the Navigation Act 1912 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, implementing two revised annexes to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or the MARPOL convention: annex I, ‘Prevention of pollution by oil’; and annex II, ‘Prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances’. The International Maritime Organisation adopted the revised annexes in October 2004 and, like most international agreements, there is a long lead time before they come into force—in this case it is 1 January 2007. Australia is a member state of the IMO and this bill is required as part of Australia’s obligation as a member.
Revised annex I, ‘Prevention of pollution by oil’, incorporates the amendments adopted since the 1983 MARPOL agreement. This includes the regulations on the phasing-in of double-hull requirements for oil tankers. In addition, separate chapters have been created for the construction and equipment provisions out of the operational requirements, and makes clear the distinctions between the requirements for new ships and those for existing ships. The new requirements in the revised annex include: for oil tankers constructed on or after 1 January 2007, pump-room bottom protection on oil tankers of 5,000 tonnes deadweight and above; and for oil tankers delivered on or after 1 January 2010, accidental oil outflow performance. Construction requirements for these tankers are to provide adequate protection against oil pollution in the event of stranding or collision. Both of these changes are a step forward in protecting the environment in the case of accidents.
Revised annex II includes a new four-category system for noxious and liquid substances. These new categories are: category X, noxious liquid substances that, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are considered to present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health; category Y, noxious liquid substances that, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are considered to present a hazard or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea; category Z, noxious liquid substances that, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are considered to present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health; and other substances which have been evaluated and found to fall outside of the previous three categories because they are considered to present no harm to marine resources, human health, amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea when discharged into the sea by those operations previously mentioned. The discharge of bilge, ballast water, other residues or mixtures containing these substances are not subject to any requirements of MARPOL annex II.
Technological improvements in ship building, such as efficient stripping techniques, have made possible significantly lower discharge levels of certain products; therefore, this has been incorporated into annex II. For ships constructed on or after 1 January 2007, the maximum permitted residue in the tank and its associated piping left after discharge will be set at a maximum of 75 litres for products in categories X, Y and Z. This compares with previous limits that set a maximum of 100 or 300 litres, depending on the product category. This is a significant reduction.
Alongside the revision of annex II, the marine pollution hazards of thousands of chemicals have been evaluated. This has resulted in a hazard profile which indexes the substance according to its bio-accumulation, biodegradation, acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, long-term health effects and effects on marine wildlife and on benthic habitats—that is, the habitat of animals and plants that live on the floor of the sea. This is also a significant advance. It is very important that the detrimental effects of substances are known. This assists in cases of accidental spills and knowing the required action that needs to be taken. Vegetable oils, which were previously categorised as being unrestricted, will be carried now in chemical tankers. The revised annex includes provision for the administration to exempt ships certified to carry individually identified vegetable oils, subject to certain provisions relating to the location of the cargo tanks carrying the identified vegetable oil.
In all, this is a welcome piece of legislation which the opposition will support. In relation to ships’ cargoes, we have seen in the news recently the story of a vessel held off the coast of Australia because it is reputed to have a stowaway on board—a macaque monkey. It probably sounds amusing that there is a monkey on board that no-one can catch. Unfortunately, these monkeys are known to carry diseases which are a significant risk to Australia’s quarantine environment. I understand that if the monkey is not caught and euthanased before arrival, the vessel will be required to tie up away from a berth until the monkey is caught and euthanased. I welcome that. That is entirely appropriate. But the contrast that I cannot help but make is this: a whole range of vessels come to our coasts with crews whose identities are only communicated to us by fax a matter of hours before the vessels arrive, whose passports are not able to be seen before their arrival and whose identities cannot be checked other than against a register of known terrorists.
Hundreds and thousands of vessels arrive on our coasts in those circumstances and we do not hold the vessels offshore. We do not restrict in any significant way the entry of vessels other than to require the supply of the names of the crew in a way that, frankly, does not give me confidence that we can really know the identity of every crew member of every vessel that arrives in Australia. So there is one standard in relation to quarantine—and quite an acceptable one—and another standard in relation to the crews of foreign flagged vessels arriving in our ports. I wonder if Australians are comfortable with that. We will support this legislation. It is important maritime environmental legislation and it is this nation’s obligation under conventions we have signed—a welcome trend from the government in that regard.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,15,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—I thank Senator O’Brien for his contribution to the debate on the Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2006. I will just make a few comments to sum up. Firstly, the legislation is necessary to align Australia’s requirements with our international obligations as a member state of the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, and a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973/78 known, as Senator O’Brien said, as MARPOL. The bill covers two elements of MARPOL: annex I, which covers the prevention of pollution by oil, and annex II, which covers the prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances. The revised text of annex I and annex II was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in October 2004 and will enter into force internationally on 1 January 2007.
The internationally agreed amendments to annex I and annex II, as I said, will come into effect on 1 January 2007. The revised annexes will allow Australia to enforce more stringent technical requirements to protect the marine environment and human health from oil and chemical pollution, thus demonstrating the government’s continuing efforts to enhance Australia’s maritime pollution prevention regime. I might add that industry supports these amendments. The enactment of the proposed act will provide Australia with consistent national standards that could be applied to all Australian ships as well as foreign ships operating in Australian waters. The enactment will also ensure the protection of Australia’s maritime environment and human health through the application of current and enhanced environmental standards. I commend the bill to the Senate.

The purpose of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Pre-transfer Contracts) Bill 2006 is to enable the Commonwealth to transfer its ownership of any residual mortgage insurance contracts written by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation prior to its restructure and abolition in 1997 to another person and following on from that is the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Repeal Bill 2006 which is to repeal the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Act 1996. Much of that Act is now redundant and the operative provisions in the repealed Act are included in the accompanying HLIC (Transfer of Pre-transfer Contracts) Bill 2006.
These two Bills bring to a conclusion the selling off of a well performing government asset by the Coalition Government. The Democrats opposed the sale of the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation at the time, as they have opposed the sale of a number of other well-performing government assets before and since.
The Housing Loan Insurance Commission insured home loan lenders against losses secured by mortgages, and aimed to increase home loan affordability for low and middle income earners. It was a successful and profitable statutory authority. However, this Coalition Government did not see its role as continuing to provide such a service to low and middle income earners and sold it off in 1997.
It has to be said that the Opposition’s track record in this respect is not commendable either, as the initial legislation to sell the HLIC was introduced by the Keating Government and that Government oversaw the sale of several quality government assets into the private sector during its tenure. Many would argue that Labor began the trend to privatisation of government assets which has been so thoroughly embraced by the current Government.
Even though the Democrats opposed the legislation which sold off the HLIC we are not opposing these two bills as they are simply administrative in nature and clean up the financial loose ends that were left behind from the sale of the asset.
One of the reasons I wanted to speak on these Bills is the presence in them of special appropriations. As the Senate is aware, this is a matter of ongoing concern to me and many others, and I have spoken on it several times in the past.
It is also a matter upon which the Auditor General has reported in Audit Report No. 15 2004-05 Performance audit—financial management of special appropriations and is of concern to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee which in 2005 prepared a report on Accountability and Standing Appropriations.
As I have pointed out in the past, the number of special appropriations has increased steadily during the life of the Commonwealth. In 1909-10 they were only 10% of the total Commonwealth expenditure and by 2002-03 they accounted for 80% of it.
Every year we are presented with the annual appropriations for the year. However those figures do not represent the full annual expenditure of the Government because tucked away in bills, like these two bills, are special appropriations which commence with the passage of the legislation and have no fixed end. They could represent a bottomless pit of taxpayers’ money going out from consolidated revenue with little accountability to the Parliament.
This brings into play issues of transparency and accountability, a matter which was raised by the Auditor General in his report. And I quote:
The sound governance, management and reporting of appropriations requires certainty, clarity and consistency in the application of the Commonwealth’s financial management framework. The audit findings indicate that the manner in which the financial framework has been interpreted and implemented has not been consistent with those characteristics. While many of the issues are quite technical, in a legal sense there are important considerations of appropriate accountability, including transparency, in relation to the Parliament. Overall, ANAO considers that there have been significant shortcomings in the financial management of various Special Appropriations. Given the fundamental importance of appropriations to Parliamentary control over expenditure, changes need to be made to secure proper appropriation management in the Commonwealth. In particular, there has been inadequate attention by a number of entities to their responsibility to ensure that a correct, valid appropriation to support a particular payment has been identified before spending funds from the CRF, and to accurately disclose their use of Special Appropriations.
Some of the concerns raised in that report have been addressed, but there is still some way to go.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee identified concerns regarding appropriations. I would draw the Senate’s attention to the paragraph in that report which pointed out that allowing the executive government to spend unspecified amounts of money for an indefinite time into the future might infringe on the Committee’s term of reference relating to delegation and exercise of legislative power. Not only that—it is not a transparent or accountable way in which to govern.
Of course that is not to deny that special appropriations are sometimes necessary, unavoidable and desirable, but they need to be much less of a general rule than they are at present.
The Committee called for the inclusion of an explanation in a Bill’s Explanatory Memorandum as to the reason for an appropriation and why it was more suitable for it to be included as a special appropriation rather than as an annual appropriation.
I am pleased to see that the EMs for these bills do provide such an explanation and in all the circumstances outlined in the EM, the reasons for the appropriations seem, on the face of it, to be reasonable. The EMs also confirm that the accountability to Parliament will be met through the Treasury Portfolio Budget Statements and the Treasury Annual Report.
However this still leaves the fact that there is no end date for these appropriations. The presumption is that they will lapse when payments under any agreements have been made, or when transfer of all assets is complete. Given the attention that special appropriations have received from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Auditor General, I think it would be proper for an end date to be articulated in the Explanatory Memorandum or confirmed by the Minister in his second reading speech, and if that cannot be forecast now, for a periodic review to confirm the status of the standing appropriation.
As the Committee pointed out, it remains for the Senate to determine whether, in the circumstances of the legislation, special appropriations are suitable for the purposes for which they are proposed.
After scrutinising the relevant paragraphs of these Bills, these particular appropriations appear to be suitable for the purpose intended. We do not seek to amend the Bills. We do, however look forward to receiving reports in the Treasury Portfolio Budget Statements and the Treasury Annual Report as to how the money appropriated has been spent and a report as to when they are finally completed. Accountability must be observed
I ask the Minister for an assurance that the special appropriations will be repealed as soon as they are exhausted and not left lying on the statute books for some creative/illegal/improper use of them in the future, in the light of the Auditor-General’s report, and some real worries that have emerged in terms of the use of some standing appropriations.",SENATE,<title>HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE CORPORATION (TRANSFER OF PRE-TRANSFER CONTRACTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,16,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—In anticipation of reading your contribution, Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, now that it has been incorporated, I thank you for your contribution and I thank Senator Scullion for moving the incorporation. It will be up to your usual standard, Mr Acting Deputy President, which is much higher than the standard of most speeches either given in this place or incorporated.
 (Senator Murray)—You are too kind.
—These bills provide the framework for the government to divest ownership of the Commonwealth residual mortgage insurance contracts to an acquirer at such time as an agreement to do so has been reached. The need to wind up the Commonwealth involvement in the lenders mortgage insurance business has long been recognised by the government. These bills enable the government to achieve this and I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-11-09,"—The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 amends the act which was introduced in 1999 to assist eligible Australian defence personnel and ex-members to purchase their own home. For ADF personnel, assistance with housing, in latter years, has been a most valued benefit, building on the assistance also traditionally provided to veterans returning from overseas engagements. These days, of course, the differential for serving ADF personnel is not so dramatic, but the benefits are no less valuable.
This scheme provides a subsidy on the interest of a home loan borrowed from an approved lender, in this case, the National Australia Bank. Single members have an entitlement to a subsidy up to a ceiling of $80,000. Married or de facto couples who each have an entitlement have a combined ceiling of $160,000 on one property. The Defence Housing Authority, the DHA, administers the scheme on behalf of the Department of Defence. The act was last amended in 1996 when the eligibility period was reduced from six years to five years of full-time service.
The amount of the limit of any one loan to be subsidised was then increased from $40,000 up to $80,000, with some retrospectivity. The benefit was also extended to active and emergency service personnel. Fringe benefits tax is payable, except where the entitlement was obtained due to reserve service only or as the result of warlike or operational non-warlike service. The subsidy is only payable where the beneficiary lives in the house mortgaged and where no other property is owned at the time of application. The subsidy is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest of the loan. The DHA calculates that average over a 25-year period, divides that by 300—which is the number of monthly repayments—and then multiplies that result by 40 to reach the subsidy payable.
The only change to the subsidy is through changes to interest rates in the period of the loan. There are special arrangements for the establishment and benchmarking of that interest rate which form part of the agreement between DHA and the bank. The key point in 1996 and presumably today was to get the best deal for ADF members. That deal, it must be said, some 10 years on no longer stacks up and is no longer as worthwhile as it was in 1991 and 1996. The total amount borrowed is subject to normal bank rules, but the subsidy that is granted only applies to the first $80,000. The balance over that limit is treated as a normal top-up loan, which is negotiated at standard commercial home loan rates. The original loan amount is used for the calculation of the subsidy regardless of loan repayments.
As an example, a loan of $80,000 at, say, 7.07 per cent would normally require a repayment of $569 per month, but the subsidy on that would be $120.93, leaving a reduced payment of $448 a month. That is a significant saving. The drawback, though, is that if you are in advance of repayments—paying early—you cannot redraw. That is, you cannot re-borrow the amount you have paid in advance. However, you can transfer the loan to a new property once the existing property is sold. In essence, that is how the scheme works.
There are of course many shortcomings to this program which are now most noticeable as recruitment dries up and incentives to join the ADF are few and far between. In fact, this amendment bill misses the opportunity to do something about that. This bill does little more than extend the life of the current program for 12 months while the minister sorts something out. The bill does nothing more than extend the operation of the act until 31 December 2007, at which time—we are advised—a review will be conducted. Frankly, that review should have been conducted more than a year ago because the shortcomings of this scheme have been understood for a significant period of time. I will outline those shortcomings. The upper limit of the subsidy in no way recognises the real cost of housing or the average size of mortgages these days. It pays no heed to the comparative advantage and cost of rental accommodation and the subsidy implicit in those rents. The scheme also restricts ADF personnel to the very limited range of home loan products negotiated by the government with the National Australia Bank. It fails to recognise the needs of ADF personnel who are shifted from pillar to post almost annually, with enormous disruption to their families. These are major drawbacks and have been known as weaknesses for many years. As usual, ADF personnel have been taken for granted and are expected to be grateful for what they have.
We are now losing personnel in droves and not attracting sufficient new men and women. This is a problem of the government’s own making. It is a problem caused by its own negligence and its repeated failure to act over the last 10 years but more particularly in the last five or six years. Recruitment is now a panic issue, and the publicity machine, making silk out of a sow’s ear as usual, is in overdrive. ADF personnel need to know that this is not a new phenomenon. It has been a problem of great concern for years. But, as is so often the case, they are ignored. This is not just about budget money. It is about caring for those people who are used as props for government publicity; it is about recruiting the people we need and, more importantly, once having introduced them into the service, keeping them and re-signing them for term after term.
It is little wonder that Defence cannot compete. In this case, there will be no action until 2008 at the earliest—after the review is concluded, we presume—which is when the new sunset clause in this bill comes into effect. We simply urge the government to get serious, do this review in a few months and get fresh legislation into the parliament to smarten up this antique scheme as a matter of urgency. This bill, then, simply extends the current scheme effectively until 2008. Entitlements will be preserved, as will the agreement with the National Australia Bank.
As I understand it, there are about 6,500 ADF personnel using this scheme. You can assume that that represents pretty much the total of ADF personnel who find homeownership attractive while in service. In comparison, almost 70 per cent of the general population are committed to homeownership—but that is getting much harder for the obvious reasons that have been in the press of late. Interest rates are going through the roof, and that is all due to key strategic decisions made by the government prior to and around the time of the last election. Those whose votes the Prime Minister tried to buy are now suffering dearly.
Fortunately, ADF personnel will not be represented in large numbers among them—simply because there are too many obstacles to homeownership in their way. To begin with, they cannot settle anywhere without being shifted with high frequency. We know of ADF families whose children may have attended as many as 20 different schools. These people are modern-day gypsies. For them, renting is the only option. Compounding that, we have military bases scattered everywhere, not often with any rationale except that of history. Noticeably they are often in conservative party electorates—pork-barrelling at the time was the key motive. Even new bases and transfers of units are from non-conservative electorates to marginal conservative electorates. There is not the slightest attempt to look at a real rationale which puts people and defence needs first.
Sadly, for ADF personnel it is unlikely that owning a home will become an option prior to discharge. Indeed, getting out simply to achieve that life goal is, for any family, a huge incentive. It seems to be a strange circumstance that so many ADF personnel rent from DHA at an admittedly generous subsidy but fail to buy a house, even with this assistance, because the ceiling, with modern-day prices, is at too low a level. Why couldn’t DHA encourage ADF personnel to buy under the scheme and allow DHA to manage their leases when they are posted? One can only imagine innovative options going beyond the current limits which would give ADF people the same benefits of homeownership as the rest of us.
In conclusion, the review will be conducted in late 2007 into early 2008. We do hope this review produces some recommendations that provide a modern approach both to homeownership and to rental options within the ADF. We trust that the review will be actioned as a matter of urgency.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—I would like to take this opportunity to briefly sum up this Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006. I note that Senator Mark Bishop, the shadow minister for industry, procurement and personnel, has provided general support for this legislation and that the opposition will support it. Much of what Senator Mark Bishop said in his shadow capacity lacks a little credibility and consistency because, whilst supporting the scheme, he attacked the government. The government is simply getting on with the job of looking after our very important Defence community.
This bill seeks to extend the operation of the Defence Home Owners Scheme, from 31 December 2006 until 31 December 2007. The extension will provide the Department of Defence with the opportunity to develop a scheme that will be more contemporary to meeting the needs of Defence and ADF members. A review is to be completed in time to allow the implementation of a new scheme by the end of next year, 31 December 2007. The objectives of the review will be to develop a homeowners assistance scheme that supports ADF recruitment, retention and resettlement of ADF members, that recognises the benefits that homeownership provides to Defence and ADF members and that is cost-effective to the Commonwealth.
The home loans market has changed significantly since the introduction of the DHOS. It is, therefore, appropriate that a scheme that is more reflective of the contemporary needs of Defence and ADF members in the community is in place. Four options are undergoing detailed development: firstly, subsidy assistance not tied to a home loan; secondly, subsidy assistance tied to a single or panel of home loan providers; thirdly, deposit assistance linked to either career retention or mobility points; and, fourthly, an allowance for owner-occupiers.
This review is to be completed by the end of next year. Extension of the finishing time prescribed in the act will ensure that the eligible ADF members continue to have access to homeownership assistance and will preserve the entitlement of those members who have not accessed the scheme pending the outcome of the review. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—in reply—I thank the opposition for supporting this legislation. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006 has played an important role in the fight against brucellosis and tuberculosis. The funds held in the NCDEA have been derived solely from cattle and buffalo industry levies and charges and from the interest on these moneys. We are aware that, although the threats posed by brucellosis and TB have been reduced, other diseases could have a significant impact on Australian cattle herds. Transfer of the NCDEA funds to a trust fund, the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund, will ensure that these moneys can be used for a wider range of purposes related to cattle health and diseases while still retaining the ability to fund any future activities related to bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.
The bill enables any funds in excess of what will be required in the future for brucellosis and TB programs to be used in the ongoing work of building a strong biosecurity framework for Australian buffalo and cattle industries. It has the full support of these industries. I am delighted that it has the support of the opposition as well and will foster the industry’s ability to play an active role in maintaining Australia’s animal health status. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—I am pleased that the opposition is supporting the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment (Antarctic Seals and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This legislation significantly strengthens the government’s protection of the Antarctic environment by incorporating the provisions of the seals regulations into the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act by giving effect to an Antarctic Treaty measure prohibiting the collection of meteorites and rocks and revising penalties throughout the act to bring them into line with other similar environmental legislation. It is legislation that I understand entirely and I commend it to the Senate.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2006-11-09,"—The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is a welcome regulatory reform to the structure of an important statutory body, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The bill will change the board management structure to reflect more closely the recommendations that were made by my fellow South Australian, Mr John Uhrig, in his important 2003 report entitled Corporate governance of statutory bodies and statutory office holders. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation—or EFIC, as it is commonly known—has been in its current form since 1991 and, under the foreign affairs portfolio, it has been charged with four key functions: firstly, to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade by providing insurance and financial services and products to persons involved directly or indirectly in export trade; secondly, to encourage banks and other financial institutions in Australia to finance or assist in financing exports; thirdly, to manage the Australian government’s aid-supported mixed credit program—a facility which is now discontinued, although loans are still outstanding under it; and, fourthly, to provide information and advice regarding insurance and financial arrangements to support exports.
In these tasks, EFIC has been highly successful. EFIC has run consistent surpluses since 1991, except for the 1996-97 year during the East Asian financial crisis. EFIC has facilitated an increase in Australian exports from $99 billion in the 1995-96 financial year to $164 billion in 2004-05. A number of Howard government reforms to make our economy more internationally competitive have contributed to this export growth. However, it cannot be denied that the security provided to our exporters by EFIC is an important factor. According to EFIC’s annual report, tabled in the parliament several weeks ago, as at 30 June 2006, EFIC was managing exposures of some $3 billion across 32 countries. However, the Howard government recognises that there is no room for complacency.
The board management structure of EFIC currently is determined under the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991. Following the implementation of the legislation that we are debating today, EFIC’s operation, consistent with the recommendations of the Uhrig report on corporate governance in the public sector, will fall under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. We can expect that Australian exports will continue to rise sharply in the next few years with the continued emergence of China and India. It is, therefore, necessary that the management structures of EFIC be as effective as they can be to deal with large amounts of exports and future business opportunities arising from the increased interest in Australian goods and services.
It should be reinforced that this is a result of the economic stability which the Howard government has provided through innovative and effective policies. The restructuring of the EFIC board in line with the recommendations of the Uhrig report demonstrates the continuing good work of the Howard government. This involves: first, the removal of the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Trade Commission from the EFIC board; second, the reduction in the number of other members—not including the chair, the deputy chair, the managing director and the government member—from not fewer than four nor more than six to not fewer than two nor more than five; third, after consulting the minister, the EFIC board, not the minister, as currently required, will have the power to appoint the managing director and deputy managing director; and, finally, appointments to the EFIC board, other than in respect of the government member, will be limited to three years with a limit of two terms—or three terms for EFIC board members who serve as chair.
This bill was considered by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee during August 2006. Taking into account the submissions made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and EFIC itself, the committee recommended that the bill be passed. The Senate committee found that the proposed amendments are consistent with the Uhrig inquiry recommendations. It is important to remind ourselves when considering this bill that the bill does not alter the operations of the entire statutory body; it simply changes the management structure of the board. However, the Senate committee did express concern that the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill failed to adequately explain the link between the particular changes it makes to EFIC and the Uhrig report.
The legislative handbook of 2000 highlights criticism of explanatory memoranda generally and in 1995 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure noted that, too often, there is potential for legislation to be misinterpreted due to the failings of explanatory memoranda. In reference to this bill, the committee said:
In the committee’s view, the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill falls short in providing the level of detail necessary to assist legislators in their understanding of the proposed amendments. It provides little insight into the operation of the provisions of the bill and how the proposed amendments are in keeping with Mr Uhrig’s recommendations. It did not follow the advice contained in the Legislation Handbook that the explanation ‘should focus on explaining the effect and intent of the Bill.’
The committee went on to say:
There is no attempt, other than general references, to tie the amendments directly to the findings and recommendation of the Uhrig Report ... nor any commentary on deficiencies ... in the current legislation that the bill is intended to address.
That is why the committee recommended:
... that the government take steps to ensure that explanatory memoranda provide members of parliament with the information necessary to be able to make informed decisions about the legislation before them. For instance, it suggests that the Legislation Handbook be worded more forcefully to alert those preparing the documentation to the importance and function of an explanatory memorandum. It also suggests that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet monitor and report on the standard of memoranda.
The importance of explanatory memoranda in explaining legislation cannot be overstated. However, the concerns raised by the Senate committee are not necessarily as valid regarding this legislation as they may be in the case of other legislation, because a statutory body is likely to develop its own culture, following the restructuring of its management. The committee accepted evidence that the amendments do satisfy the intention of the Uhrig report. As was argued by Stephen Bartos in the Canberra Times, in his article ‘All quiet on the review front in the long wait to be Uhriged’, of 5 September 2006, it is not necessarily the content of the restructuring across government statutory bodies that is the most important result of the Uhrig report but rather that it ensures that statutory bodies are reassessed intermittently to ensure that their operations are as effective as they can be.
In a globalised economy, where dynamism means not only expansion but also contraction, Australia must remain an attractive destination for investment. To avoid the financial crises that have befallen other nations in recent times, we must have a vigorous culture of corporate governance. That will stabilise both foreign and domestic investment. Indeed, this point was articulated by the OECD, which said:
If countries are to reap the full benefits of the global capital market, and if they are to attract long-term ... capital, corporate governance arrangements must be credible, well understood across borders ... Even if corporations do not rely primarily on foreign sources of capital, adherence to good corporate governance practices will help improve the confidence of domestic investors, reduce the cost of capital ... and ultimately induce more stable sources of financing.
The concept of corporate governance sets out to achieve the best results by ensuring decisions are made effectively through implementing, monitoring and control mechanisms. The Howard government is providing leadership on this important issue by implementing the recommendations of the Uhrig report across our statutory bodies. The Labor Party has stood still on this matter, in the policy vacuum it adopts towards business.
The rollout of the recommendations contained within the Uhrig report is an important step forward towards better corporate governance, but still more can be done. Effective corporate governance will be able to anticipate a wider range of risks and opportunities in the marketplace. Through this practical mechanism, companies are able to reassess and manage, in different ways, their non-financial risks and maximise their long-term financial value. That is something which is set markedly to drive financial markets in the future.
It is important that we remember that effective reform on corporate governance must include corporate responsibility. The best results for the market can only be achieved when we encourage business to take into account their internal governance, in hand with external responsibility, to ensure a healthy economy. The recent report and recommendations on corporate responsibility by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I chair, are, I believe, quite pertinent here. They are consistent with the implementation of the Uhrig report.
There is no room for complacency. Issues of corporate governance and responsibility are important in securing Australia as a valuable site for investment throughout the 21st century. Therefore, I encourage the government to further publicise the benefits of effective corporate governance, following the full implementation of the Uhrig recommendations. On that basis, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-11-09,"—I thank the opposition for their support of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. I also thank Senator Chapman for his comments. I think he summed up the legislation beautifully. I have very little to add. I take on his comments about the role of explanatory memoranda. I acknowledge that. I have certain sympathy for what he had to say in that regard.
The intention of this legislation is to implement changes to the board management structure of EFIC. The bill forms part of the implementation of the government’s response to, as Senator Chapman said, the review of Mr John Uhrig. At this stage, it is expected that the changes to the EFIC board’s management structure will take place some time in the autumn of 2007. The bill is noncontroversial. The bill will have no financial impact. EFIC’s very important mandate and function will not be affected. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-11-09,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the minister recall asking the then Labor Leader of the Government in the Senate on 23 June 1994: ‘Australia’s real interest rates are already amongst the highest in the world; is this not a reflection of this government’s mismanagement of the economy?’ Is the minister aware that at the time he asked that question Australia’s interest rates were 64 per cent of the OECD average? Isn’t it the case now that interest rates in Australia are 40 per cent above the OECD average? Aren’t our interest rates also the second highest among the 19 most developed countries in the world? Isn’t that, according to the minister’s own logic, a reflection of this government’s mismanagement of the economy?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-11-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Won’t the new housing rate that the Prime Minister is so pleased about put us more than three percentage points above the average five per cent interest rate that applies in western Europe, Japan and North America—hardly all dying economies, Minister? Doesn’t that mean the Prime Minister’s claim that he has delivered record low interest rates is again totally false? And why are interest rates in Australia so much higher than the rest of the developed world, including economies doing well?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-09,"—I do not particularly recall that question, but I take Senator Sherry’s word for it that I asked that brilliant question back in 1994. The thing I do remember from 1994 very clearly was what Mr Beazley, the then finance minister, said when interest rates went up by no less than three-quarters of a per cent in one hit, in September 1994, to 9.5 per cent. Mr Beazley said:
... I point out that this is still a very low interest rate regime in Australian historical standards.
According to Mr Beazley in 1994, 9.5 per cent was a very low interest rate. I wonder what Mr Beazley thinks of an interest rate of 8.05 per cent. Of course, when he was in government, under Mr Keating and Mr Hawke, he never saw an interest rate as low as 8.05 per cent because interest rates never got that low under Labor, so Mr Beazley thought 9.5 per cent was a low interest rate. We are very proud of our record on managing fiscal policy in this country in order to endeavour to ensure that interest rates and therefore inflation remain low in this country.
In relation to Senator Sherry’s question on comparisons with the OECD, I take his word for it. I am prepared to accept his evidence without having checked it myself. On the face of it I will accept his evidence. What I would point out is that this country, almost uniquely, has had now some 15 years of continuous economic growth. The most remarkable thing is that in any other period in the history of this country, if we had had 15 years of continuous economic growth, we would now be at the point that we reached in 1989 when the Labor Party clearly said: ‘We’ve got to have a recession because the economy is growing too strongly. We’re going to have a recession and we’re going to have 17 per cent interest rates to crush the economy.’ That is what Labor did in government. They engineered a recession because they had lost control of the economy after that period of growth.
What is remarkable is that after 15 years of economic growth we still only have inflation at three per cent; we still only have a cash rate of 6.25 per cent. When you compare us to other OECD countries, you must always bear in mind that our economic growth rates have been much better than theirs over the last 10 years. We have grown much faster than the OECD countries. The OECD countries, by and large, have had to use low interest rate policies to stimulate their dying economies. The economies of Europe need massive stimulation because of their sclerotic approach to things like industrial relations. The countries of the OECD have industrial relations policies like the Labor Party’s, and that is why they have growth rates so low that they have to reduce interest rates to give the economy some stimulus. We are in a position where, after 15 years of growth, the cash rate is still only 6.25 per cent. In any other period in the history of this country, the Reserve Bank would have had to move to the sorts of rates we saw under the Labor Party which engineered a recession.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-09,"—Firstly, it is a complete verballing of the Prime Minister, which should be retracted, to say that the Prime Minister said he was pleased about the interest rate rise. That is a ridiculous assertion to make. The Prime Minister made it clear in his press conference yesterday that he did not like seeing an interest rate rise. Of course we understand the position of Australian families who have to pay a higher mortgage interest rate. So that is a complete misrepresentation of the Prime Minister’s position. Secondly, on the question of the extent to which our cash rate is higher than those of western Europe or Japan, I have explained that those economies have had zero or very low growth rates for considerable periods of time and much higher unemployment than our country. They have had to use their monetary policies to try to stimulate their sclerotic economies.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-11-09,"—My question is addressed to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister’s 2004 promise that he would keep interest rates at record lows. Is the minister aware of comments by truckie Wayne Phillips from Penrith in Western Sydney in the Australian newspaper today? He said:
“This is not the first hike in interest rates, it’s the fourth since the election—so much for the Howard Government’s promises.”
Aren’t battlers from Penrith, like Mr Phillips, in the seat of Lindsay, right to blame the Prime Minister for the fact that they are now paying an extra $260 a month on their mortgages, since they were told that interest rates would stay at record lows?

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-11-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Why does the Prime Minister continue to mislead Australians by saying that interest rates are still low, when debt and borrowing levels are three times higher today than they were 10 years ago? How is the Prime Minister’s false claim any help to battlers like Mr Phillips, who borrowed $50,000 to help his daughter buy a house and who may now have to cancel her wedding?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-09,"—I did notice the article in the Australian with that particular family. As I said before and as the Prime Minister has said before, we do understand that for a number of families in Australia an interest rate rise means that they could well be paying more on their mortgage. We would encourage all such households or families, where paying more on their mortgage is an issue for them, to talk to their financial advisers and their lending institutions to endeavour to ensure that they can renegotiate their loan in such a fashion that their household finances are not unduly affected.
As to the question of the Prime Minister’s statements at the last election, I can only repeat that again the Labor Party is verballing the Prime Minister. What the Prime Minister said to the people of Australia at the last federal election—which I know irks the Labor Party; we know that they cannot get over losing their fourth election in a row; they know they made a huge mistake going to the last election with Mr Mark Latham as their leader; they know that and they cannot get over that—was, ‘Who do you trust to produce lower interest rates: the Labor Party or the Liberal Party?’
Our assertion to the Australian people was that interest rates would always be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government. We adduced as evidence for that assertion the record of the Labor Party in government with respect to interest rates. Again we would assert that that record underpins the assertion we made in 2004—that under our government interest rates have averaged, I think, 7.18 per cent and under the Labor government they averaged 12.75 per cent. There is about a five-percentage-point difference between the average under the Labor government and the average under our government.
We also asserted at that time that the policies of the federal Labor Party would put upward pressure on inflation and therefore on interest rates. We drew attention to the fact that the Labor Party had some $40 billion of additional spending promises at the last election which would have put pressure on interest rates by threatening to take the federal budget from surplus into deficit; and that they wanted to reregulate the industrial relations arrangements of this country, which would again go back to the bad old days where a wage rise in one sector would flow right through the economy and therefore affect wage inflation, general inflation and interest rates. We stand by the assertions that we made in 2004. We will endeavour to ensure that, from our point of view, we do our utmost to keep pressure off inflation and off interest rates.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-09,"—With great respect to Senator Sterle, as I said Mr Beazley thinks that an interest rate of 9.5 per cent is low. Therefore, an interest rate of 8.05 per cent is particularly low by Australian standards and by the standards set by the Labor Party. While we do not like interest rates going up, 8.05 per cent is relatively low compared to the standard that the Labor Party set.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-11-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry, Sterle and O’Brien today relating to inflation and interest rates.
I first draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have now had four interest rate rises since this Prime Minister said that the government would keep interest rates at record lows. What we have seen in recent times is that this rate of increase in the cost of maintaining a roof over your head has had very serious consequences for many hundreds of thousands of Australians.
We have already seen over the last two years an increase of some 60 per cent in the rate of defaults in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. We have seen the rates of default increase by a third in South Australia. We have seen increasing numbers of Australians put in the clutches of the loan sharks, as a result of the failure of this government to regulate mortgage brokers.
We have seen hundreds of thousands of Australians forced into acute financial stress as a result of the policies of this government. And this has occurred in a context where this government went to the last election claiming that they would keep interest rates at record lows. Four rises later, we can now clearly see that that was a proposition predicated upon a lie—a fundamental lie.
We have a situation in this country where home buyers are rightly losing confidence in the record of this government. We have a situation now where, for the first time, we are seeing that the number of people actually buying a house has fallen—the percentage of people buying a house has fallen. If the proportion of families owning their homes in Australia had been maintained at 1996 levels, we would see 70,000 more Australians actually owning their homes.
For the first time, we are seeing first home buyers with mortgage rates much higher and less affordable than they were when interest rates were at 17 per cent. The percentage of income that is required to maintain your interest payments to keep a roof over your head now is much greater—in fact, 50 per cent greater—than it was when interest rates were at 17 per cent. And that is a simple mathematical equation that is predicated on the assumption that people are now required to borrow much more because the price of housing has skyrocketed.
We have a situation where, as a result of the rise yesterday, there has been a $50 increase in the monthly repayments on a $300,000 loan—that is an extra $195 a month since John Howard took personal responsibility for interest rates, as he did in the last election. That is an extra $380 a month since interest rates started to rise in May 2002.
We now have a situation where, as a result of this government’s actions, there are more and more Australians who are being forced into the hands of the loan sharks and are now losing their homes because they cannot meet the increased costs of debt; they cannot meet the increased costs of financing their mortgages. We have a situation where there are increasing numbers of Australians who are forced into the deregulated section of the market—the completely unregulated section of the market—where people are lent money on 100 per cent of the total value of a property.
In the west of Sydney we see declining rates in sales of property, where people now have negative equity in their properties. With interest rates increasing, people who cannot meet those payments are forced to sell their house and end up with less money than they started with. The four increases in interest rates are placing increasing burdens upon the families of this country, and since this government is responsible it should be held accountable. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-11-09,"—The words that come out of Senator Carr’s mouth never cease to amaze me. It must be Melbourne Cup week, because the Labor Party want to have a couple of bob each way. One minute they are complaining because the price of houses is too high and then, in the same breath, Senator Carr is saying the cost of houses is coming down, so people are losing their equity. You had better make up your mind. It is about time you started backing some of these horses on the nose, Senator Carr, because you cannot have two bob each way on interest rates. Either you are unhappy because the cost of houses is rising or you are unhappy because the cost of houses is falling. You cannot be unhappy about both; you must decide which one.
Senator Carr goes on about the four rises in interest rates since the last election. The Labor Party did not worry too much about a 0.25 per cent rise when they were in power—0.25 was not even considered. They went straightaway to a 0.75 per cent increase and then, only a few months later, another 0.75 per cent increase. So you were not talking about the smallest incremental rise possible, which this government has been faced with—0.25 per cent each time. The Labor Party—the party that Senator Carr belongs to—preferred to put it up by 0.75 per cent and then another 0.75 per cent until we reached the stage where people were paying 17½ per cent. That is only on a house loan. As I have said to the Senate before, I distinctly remember paying 24 per cent under Labor.
And, if you want to talk about people going to loan sharks and people borrowing money offshore, I can say that it was because of the pressure of 24 per cent interest rates that two of my neighbouring farms were lost. Because of the 24 per cent interest rates, they went overseas to borrow money at a cheaper rate and then, with the changing rate of the Australian dollar, they lost their properties—thanks to the Labor Party.
Can I also say to those people who are borrowing money for houses that one of my children bought a house six months ago—the first house they have ever owned. The first thing they did was ask, ‘How much can I afford in repayments?’ They worked it out and then locked the interest rate in so that if interest rates went up or down they would know exactly how much interest they would have to pay on the loan, because it was locked in for three years. Senator Carr makes no mention of the many people who chose to fix their interest rates. They are not affected by the interest rate rises. The only ones you are talking about are those—

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Sterle, you have not been in this place long, but I am sure that you remember plenty of people in the trucking businesses that you were involved in who were also paying 24 per cent interest rates and for longer. They paid 24 per cent under a Labor Party—the very Labor Party that you belong to—and they lost their trucks. I did not hear you speaking too loudly back in those days about the Labor Party, with its high interest rate policy of up to 24 per cent.
The Labor Party ought not come in here and talk about loan sharks. The very people they did not protect when they were in government suffered the indignity of losing their businesses because of 24 per cent interest rates. So, Senator Carr, you can come in here and talk about those people who have lost faith in the government. Let me tell you this: the last time the Australian public were tested at the ballot box, they rejected the Labor Party in a way not seen for a long time. And you, Senator Carr, were one of Mr Latham’s great supporters and you supported his policies. You supported all of those things which drove the Labor Party to the worst defeat it has had for some time. If you try to tell us that the Australian population have lost faith in the Howard government, you have a very short memory, because the last time they were tested they rejected outright the Labor Party for the sorts of policies they were proposing, both economically and in a lot of other fields, such as bringing home troops immediately. When you come in here and start raising the issue of interest rates, remember your history—and the people of Australia will never forget your record—in relation to interest rates. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-11-09,"—In rising to take note of answers, I note what an oxymoron ‘answers’ is. I think I have just misled the Senate and I apologise, but I will move on. I would like to quote a few paragraphs from one of the articles in the Australian today by Mr Steve Lewis entitled ‘Rates hike puts election tax cut off the agenda’. It clearly states:
With mortgage payments at a 10-year high, there is likely to be further pain for families, with the central bank signalling it may tighten monetary policy further.
It also goes on to quote Mr Simon Tennent, Executive Director of the Housing Industry Association. Mr Tennent alludes to the fact that ‘housing affordability had been pushed to its lowest level ever’—not in the last 10 years but ever. The article reads:
For the first time, home buyers are now required to spend 30 per cent of household income—the level at which borrowers are officially said to be in housing stress—to make the minimum repayments on the national average home loan.
“Based on what’s happened with house prices in the September quarter and this latest interest rate increase, the proportion of income will hit 30 per cent for the first time ever ...
That says a lot, doesn’t it? The Prime Minister can say, ‘Who do you trust?’ I look forward to seeing the ads popping up on the TV with the Pinocchio proboscis sticking out every time he opens his mouth on interest rates. Do not worry, he will not be the only one. He is followed by a gaggle of government senators who will be just as guilty.
While I am at it, I would like to refer to Senator Minchin, who told us yesterday:
While I acknowledge that those families with mortgages will pay more as a result of this rate rise, they will have the comfort of knowing that mortgage rates, even at 8.05 per cent, are considerably lower than they were when we came into office, when they were at 10.5 per cent.
Senator Minchin also said:
On the average mortgage, people are paying much less than they would be paying if mortgage rates had stayed at 10.5 per cent.
What an absolutely condescending statement. I do not think I have ever heard anything like it. How dare Senator Minchin treat the people of Australia with such contempt as to think that they are far better off now, with interest rate rises, housing affordability and what they are paying out of their pockets, than they were years ago under the Labor government!
Another interesting article comes from the West Australian newspaper, from my fine home state of Western Australia. It was written by Mr Shane Wright, and there is a wonderful table in it. One could never, ever accuse the West Australian newspaper of being a left-wing publication, I can assure you of that, but it has very good reporters. They have brought to the attention of all Western Australians and anyone else who—I was going to say ‘has been fortunate enough’, but there is nothing fortunate in this damn article—has seen the article that, back in 1996 when the Howard government came into power, the average mortgage of a home in WA was $233,000 and the official rate was 5.25 per cent. They have also listed what has happened every year since. When they get down to 2006 under the Howard government—and this is the interesting part—the average mortgage in Western Australia is now $314,000, the fixed rate is 6.25 per cent and the variable rate is eight per cent.
And we hear this condescending statement from the minister yesterday about how lucky Australians are and we should be thankful that interest rates are so much lower than what they were under Labor! The average mortgage in Western Australia alone is up by $90,000. I do not know what the rest of Australia would be thinking when they hear that, Senator Minchin, but I tell you what: I was absolutely disgusted. I am sure that intelligent people listening to your speech would have felt your statements were disgraceful.
I would like to also talk about the people in Western Australia. I will just choose a federal electorate—Hasluck, for example. The people of Hasluck have copped a double whammy: not only has Mr Howard broken his promise to them to keep interest rates at record lows but his government has ignored their pleas not to build a brickworks in their backyard—a brickworks that not only will pollute the environment that they and their children live in but, unfortunately, will likely decrease the value of their family homes.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-11-09,"—There are a few things I would like to talk about but, when I hear the Labor government talk about their economic credentials, that really is a trip into fantasyland.
—‘Labor government!’
—You’re 12 months early!
—If there is one thing I will back this government to the hilt on, it is its economic credentials—because you have absolutely none. I just want to run something past you. I think it is fair to say, ‘Interest rates were trending down and interest rates were trending up,’ but what you have to take into account, good gentlemen and ladies on the other side, is the differential of where Australia was with the US under this government and where Australia was with the US under your government, because that is what it is really all about: trends.
In 1990, the interest rate in Australia was 17 per cent, which basically meant that every five years you had to be able to get a return almost equivalent to the value of your business. As an accountant, I can tell you that is virtually impossible. It sends people broke. The US interest rate was 8.25 per cent. There is the differential: more than twice the US interest rate. In 2006, the interest rate in Australia is six per cent and the interest rate in the US is 5.25 per cent. That is a clear indication of a government that has its hands on the reins, as opposed to one that is full of opprobrium, probably half tanked and completely off the rails. It might not be unique: maybe there was just a glitch in the system and, at a certain point in time, the Labor Party had no idea!
I thought back on the history of it, on my early recollection—I was quite young at the time—of someone called Khemlani. I remember that form of Labor Party management, when they would actually go out to get loan sharks. You had the best one of the lot. You had one from Pakistan who was going to refinance Australia! That is the best form of loan shark in the world. You were going to hock the whole of Australia, but you managed to hock the whole of Australia later on when you built up $96 billion on our nation’s credit card—which, of course, this government had to repay.
The Labor Party were the brilliant triple bottom liners: high inflation, high unemployment and high interest rates. You could do the lot. You are incredible. And the wealth of experience! The Mark Latham statements—his economic credentials and where he was leading the nation—in the Latham Diaries have to be read to be believed. There was the black hole that Paul Keating left behind and the ‘recession we had to have’. Do you know how much angst that cost when people started going broke, and how the Labor Party were absolutely despised because people were going out of business? They were going broke. They were having to sell up. Their contracts were falling over. They could not meet their payments at the bank. That created misery in families throughout this nation. There was that fateful moment when the Prime Minister of this nation stood up and said: ‘This is the recession we had to have. This is what the Labor government has delivered to you.’ Whether you go back to Whitlam, whether you look at Keating, whether you look at Hawke or whether you look at Latham, your form is incredible. Your form is absolutely without merit.
You were talking about prices—the repayment prices for home loans. That is because the price of real estate in this nation has gone through the roof, based on the value of land. People have confidence in the economy. The fact is that people are wealthier now. They have greater wealth than they have ever had before. The value of their assets is far in excess of what they have ever had before. That is why they keep re-electing the coalition government—because they have become wealthier.
Interest rates are going up. I have to inform you that quite a few Australians have been prudent enough to lock in their interest rates. They have been locking in their interest rates at some of the lowest rates in the history of this nation. The reason they can do that is that the hands of the coalition government on the reins are steady. They know what they are up to. The first thing they did, like any astute housewife, was to pay off the unnecessary debt—to pay off the $96 billion that a wayward, out of control government had racked up on the nation’s credit card. They are major reasons why this government— (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-11-09,"—One really would have to be forgiven when listening to the government speakers in this debate for thinking that the Labor Party were actually the government of this country, because their only contribution to the debate about interest rates that we have heard so far has been harking back to what happened in very different economic circumstances, very different global circumstances, in previous governments. I will talk a bit about that in a moment.
Senator Joyce actually went back to the Labor government before that; he talked about the Whitlam government—as if what happened some 30 years ago has any relevance in today’s global economy, with the very complicated and complex global environment in which we live. It is no excuse for this government to talk about interest rates as if you can automatically compare what happens today to what happened in very different economic circumstances some time ago. I think it is an absolute cop-out for them.
What the government really need to do if we are going to get serious about having this debate in this country is face up to the fact that they are in government. I think the government actually like Senator Joyce to talk about them having their hand on the tiller or having their hand on the levers of the economy. He has now given us a new phrase about having their hands on the reins. If they have their hands on the reins of this economy, you would want to have a good look at that horse and maybe take it to the vet, because we are starting to see a very serious problem with eight successive interest rate increases, four since the last election. This government wants to continue to remain in denial about the impact that these changes to the economy are actually having and why they are actually taking place.
Senator Minchin, to his credit, actually tries to answer questions fulsomely. The trouble is that he is now being hung by his own words from previous occasions. The standards that he wanted to apply in different economic circumstances and the quotes and statements about the measures of the economy that he used once now seem to have gone out the window. He seems to be able to use the government’s spin—and I can understand that that is politics—about interest rates and how low they are without actually acknowledging where they are going to go and how they affect people. Again it is a feature of this government that in nearly every instance when things are going well they are totally responsible and take complete credit for everything that goes well, but as soon as things are not going particularly well then of course it is everyone else’s fault—it is either the states’ fault, the global economy’s fault or the previous Labor government’s fault. It is the fault of the Labor governments of 10 or in some cases 30 years ago that there are problems with the economy today! It is quite a bizarre approach. What did Senator Minchin tell us? He said that the reason for the interest rate rise now is the world economy. He talked about global demand.
—That’s what the Reserve Bank said. You’re quoting the Reserve Bank.
—You certainly were not disputing that view, Senator Minchin. You say it is due to the world economy. You agree with the fact that that is what the Reserve Bank says. You talked about global demand and then you went on, and I will quote you. You said, ‘We had to put a light touch on the brakes.’ I think that is a little bit in conflict with the line the government would have us believe—that they do not have any control over this and that this is something that the Reserve Bank does in complete isolation from the government. I think Senator Minchin has indicated that the government did give the Reserve Bank the green light for this increase. His words were, ‘We had to put a light touch on the brakes.’
It is fine for Senator Minchin to finally admit that, but the ‘light touch on the brakes’ does not just go to this economy; it goes to every household in this country. The eighth successive ‘light touch on the brakes’ of this economy has now led to $260 per month in extra mortgage payments on the average mortgage for Australians. That is $260 a month being taken out of the household budget, out of the household grocery bill. At the same time we see housing affordability crashing in this country. Senator Minchin also told us that—
—Wait for it!
—It will be profound.
—It is coming; yes, it will be profound. If only I had a few more minutes, I would probably be able to find it in my notes. Something tells me I will have to wait till the next time I am speaking in a take note of answers debate to continue on that issue.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Government Response by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance and Administration to the Joint Committee on Publications Report on the Distribution of the Parliamentary Papers Series


Response to the recommendations


Recommendation No. 7

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office monitor agency compliance with the Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes and provide a report, detailing defaulting agencies, to Parliament by no later than 30 June the following year.

AGIMO Response: Not Supported

It is the responsibility of each government agency, to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes (LDS).
Due to the devolved nature of Australian Government publishing, it is not feasible to know what agencies are publishing and what publications are not lodged with libraries via the LDS.
AGIMO will continue to build awareness of the LDS and remind agencies of their obligations. AGIMO will do this through direct communication with publishing agencies and the development of better practice guidance on publishing.

Recommendation No. 8

The Committee recommends that the Tabling Officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet write to each recipient of the internal Parliament House document distribution to determine their stock requirements.

PM&C Response: Supported

The government notes that the Tabling Officer already surveys and updates on a regular basis copy requirements of recipients of documents distributed within Parliament House, and agrees that the current practice be continued.

Recommendation No. 10

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office, together with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, investigate methods to reduce the duplication between the Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes and the Parliamentary Papers Series. A report of their findings is to be supplied to the Committee within six months of the tabling of this report, and any changes implemented within a further six months.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

AGIMO will work with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate to investigate methods of reducing duplication between the LDS & Parliamentary Paper Series (PPS).

Recommendation No. 13

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office continue to work with agencies to ensure that all government documents are made available online.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

AGIMO will continue to work with agencies to help ensure that Australian Government public accountability publications are made available online in accord with Government policy.

Recommendation No. 14

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office take steps to ensure that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online, including encouraging the use of persistent identifiers to online information.

AGIMO Response: Not Supported

Responsibility for ensuring that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online rests with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.
AGIMO considers that the creation of a digital repository would best meet this recommendation (refer to response to Recommendation 19).

Recommendation No. 16

The Committee recommends that agencies provide a website link, for all documents to be presented to Parliament, to the Tabling Officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This link is to be included in the daily list of documents scheduled for presentation to Parliament, which is circulated to Members and Senators.

PM&C Response: Not Supported

For some website implementations, it is not possible in all cases to allocate a web address to documents until they are ready to be posted on the Internet. The government therefore does not support this recommendation as it would be inappropriate to provide a website link to documents that are under embargo.

Recommendation No. 19

The Committee recommends that the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, in consultation with the Australian Government Information Management Office and other stakeholders, investigate and implement the development of an online digital repository for the Parliamentary Papers Series.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

Responsibility for ensuring that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online rests with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.

The government notes that the Tabling Officer already surveys and updates on a regular basis copy requirements of recipients of documents distributed within Parliament House, and agrees that the current practice be continued.

Recommendation No. 10

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office, together with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, investigate methods to reduce the duplication between the Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes and the Parliamentary Papers Series. A report of their findings is to be supplied to the Committee within six months of the tabling of this report, and any changes implemented within a further six months.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

AGIMO will work with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate to investigate methods of reducing duplication between the LDS & Parliamentary Paper Series (PPS).

Recommendation No. 13

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office continue to work with agencies to ensure that all government documents are made available online.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

AGIMO will continue to work with agencies to help ensure that Australian Government public accountability publications are made available online in accord with Government policy.

Recommendation No. 14

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Information Management Office take steps to ensure that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online, including encouraging the use of persistent identifiers to online information.

AGIMO Response: Not Supported

Responsibility for ensuring that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online rests with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.
AGIMO considers that the creation of a digital repository would best meet this recommendation (refer to response to Recommendation 19).

Recommendation No. 16

The Committee recommends that agencies provide a website link, for all documents to be presented to Parliament, to the Tabling Officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This link is to be included in the daily list of documents scheduled for presentation to Parliament, which is circulated to Members and Senators.

PM&C Response: Not Supported

For some website implementations, it is not possible in all cases to allocate a web address to documents until they are ready to be posted on the Internet. The government therefore does not support this recommendation as it would be inappropriate to provide a website link to documents that are under embargo.

Recommendation No. 19

The Committee recommends that the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, in consultation with the Australian Government Information Management Office and other stakeholders, investigate and implement the development of an online digital repository for the Parliamentary Papers Series.

AGIMO Response: Supported with Qualifications

Responsibility for ensuring that documents presented to Parliament are permanently available online rests with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.
AGIMO will liaise with other stakeholders (the National Library of Australia, the National Archives of Australia, the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate) in investigating the development of an online digital repository that will include the PPS.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,COMMITTEES,26,2,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-11-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
There is no doubt about the importance of proper and timely audits of government agencies to identify problems and ensure they are addressed in a timely manner. The Auditor-General has a key role to play in this regard, and this report highlights that fact. It is not just external audits that matter. Internal audits also play a key role in ensuring that small problems do not become big problems.
I have an outstanding question on notice to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry that directly relates to the auditing of activities by his department. My question concerns internal audits of AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. It concerns an application by an Australian company to import a product into this country and build an international business around that product. It concerns the investment of large amounts of money on the basis that AQIS was doing its job. It concerns commitments made and agreements entered into on the basis that AQIS could be relied on—that Australian companies could bank on its advice. In short, my question concerns the failure of the government to properly administer Australia’s quarantine system. It is, therefore, no surprise that the minister has been so reluctant to answer it.
Marnic Worldwide applied to AQIS to import marine worms for the recreational fishing industry. Marnic relied on advice from AQIS and, on the evidence available to me, did all the things it was asked to do. The company went to considerable lengths to make sure that it understood the advice it got. Communications with AQIS were fully and comprehensively recorded. It wanted to ensure that in the event of a problem down the track there would be a paper trail. Marnic was committing large amounts of money, and encouraging others to commit large amounts of money, so things had to be right.
We now know that the AQIS advice could not be relied upon. We know that because AQIS told us so. AQIS conceded that it provided the wrong advice to this Australian company, and the company is now locked in a process of seeking compensation for the damage done to it and others by AQIS. It would be bad enough if the failure of AQIS to give this company advice on which it could rely was the end of this matter, but it is not. Even though AQIS has admitted guilt, it is becoming increasingly clear that the government is not interested in a timely resolution to the matter of compensation for the company. There is little interest on the part of the government to move this matter to finality. This is a first-order issue for Marnic’s principals and their families, but clearly it is a very low priority for this department and this minister. Just as the process of assessing, processing and issuing an import permit to Marnic was flawed, so is the assessment process that is now being used to determine the level of compensation to which the company is entitled.
Marnic’s claim for compensation is being assessed by the department of agriculture under the Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration Scheme. It is a scheme devised by the Department of Finance and Administration. There are two stages to the assessment process. First, the investigating officer must determine whether or not there has been defective administration. Second, if that is found to be the case, the process progresses to determine the level of compensation payable.
In relation to the Marnic claim, stage 1 of the process was commenced on 7 November 2005—now over a year ago. It was completed on 23 February this year, but the findings were not communicated to Marnic until 2 March. This first part of the process was assessed against the published guidelines for this scheme. The CDDA guidelines were changed on 11 August this year, but no-one bothered to tell Marnic, the applicant. The company and its legal advisers continued to work to the old set of guidelines. There was contact between lawyers representing the department and lawyers representing the company on 21 August. This meeting was about setting up a future meeting with the investigating officer of the department, Mr Dalton, but there was no mention of new guidelines by the department’s lawyers. Marnic was advised that new guidelines were being applied to its claim in a phone call on 12 September, just prior to the Dalton meeting in Perth.
Between 11 August and 12 September the department pressed Marnic for information but did not say the rules had changed. On 31 August, Marnic lawyers forwarded a 10-page letter to Minter Ellison, who are representing the department, in response to a letter dated 25 August. Marnic’s legal advisers were working on the basis that CDDA mark I rules were in force, while the department and Minter’s were operating off CDDA mark II rules. In the Marnic letter there was a specific reference to paragraphs 24 and 27 in the CDDA mark I guidelines. These paragraphs were changed in the mark II version of the guidelines. That is neglect at best. Clearly, if Marnic had been advised that its claim was being assessed against new guidelines, its response to the government’s lawyers might have been different.
I raised this issue in the last estimates round. In relation to the CDDA guidelines, I was first told that the new version was the same as the old version and that, in substance, there was no change. I was then told that the department had written to the department of finance seeking advice on the differences between the old version and the new version. I was then told that the investigating officer, Mr Dalton, had received legal advice about the difference between the two sets of guidelines. All of that is bad enough. But what I have since discovered is that, while Minter’s were advising Mr Dalton and the department on how to manage this claim, the same firm was advising the department of finance on how to toughen up the CDDA guidelines. Forget about chinese walls—frankly, this is completely and utterly unacceptable.
At the estimates hearing, the secretary of the department advised me that, far from being an independent assessor, Mr Dalton is in fact answerable to one of the parties—the department. The secretary, Ms Hewitt, told the hearing that Mr Dalton was acting ‘on behalf’ of the department. Mr Dalton is the assessor of the CDDA claim, appointed to that position by the minister. It is clear that all the information that Mr Dalton is relying on is being filtered through the department, one of the parties to the matter. It is clear that Mr Dalton and the department have legal advice about the CDDA guidelines against which this claim is being assessed. I assume that advice was provided by Minter’s, who drafted the changes. But that advice is not available to Marnic. That means that one party to this action is being afforded a significant advantage over the other. What a mess this has become.
In my view it is clear that this whole process has now been compromised. Any semblance of natural justice has gone. Senators might recall the process followed in relation to the Hewett claim against AQIS. That matter was managed by a well-qualified person who was independent of AQIS and the department, a Mr Kennedy. In that case, Mr Kennedy went to considerable lengths to ensure that both parties were fully informed of all the facts of the matter. He ensured that if one party had relevant information it also went to the other party. He sought to ensure that there was an agreed set of facts. That is clearly not the case here.
Frankly, for the person assessing this claim to have received legal advice and then to have discussed it with one of the parties and not the others is a flagrant breach of natural justice. The minister must immediately appoint a person independent of the department to fully assess this claim and independently determine the extent of the damage. I also find it absolutely obnoxious that a claim lodged under one set of guidelines is now being assessed under a second set published in the course of the action by a legal body advising the department in relation to the very action the guidelines have changed on. That should be assessed by the minister. That may well also be a breach of natural justice. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-11-09,"—The Commonwealth Grants Commission revenue-sharing formula is often a matter of continuing stoushes between various states about the way that different Commonwealth revenue is divided up between the states and territories. Not surprisingly, each state and territory tends to think they should be getting more and some of the others should be getting less. Certainly, in recent times there has been a fairly continual propaganda campaign from governments, in New South Wales in particular and to a lesser extent in Victoria, targeting in particular Queensland and to a lesser extent Western Australia saying that Queensland basically is getting too much, we are getting more than our fair share, and that is at the expense of states like New South Wales.
I do not want to turn the Commonwealth Grants Commission revenue-sharing relativities issue into a state of origin contest but I do think it should at least be based on something more solid than jingoistic parochialism. To that extent I think this report is valuable. It is often talked about as though there is some simple formula, X divided by Y times Z, which gives so much money per state. That is not particularly accurate because the principle that the commission bases its calculations on is horizontal fiscal equalisation, and there are actually a range of mathematical formulae that the commission uses, simply as the means by which the commission seeks to implement that principle. To define or clarify what that principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation is: it is that state governments should receive funding from the pool of goods and services tax revenue and healthcare grants such that, if each made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency, each would have the capacity to provide services at the same standard. That is the principle and there are a range of formulae that go to ensuring as much as possible that that principle is implemented.
States have different capacities to raise revenue and different spending needs and obviously people also have different ideas about what is a need and what is a bit of vote-buying profligacy. For example, of course, Western Australia has a relatively large capacity to raise revenue from the mining industry compared with Tasmania. A state with a young population needs to spend more on primary education; states with older populations may need to spend more on health services. So, to provide states with equal capacity to provide services, states with below average revenue-raising capacity or above average spending needs receive a larger share. The commission needs to take account of factors that a state cannot control. When you start to look at the complexities of it and the attempts of the commission to make its assessment of revenue-raising capacity and spending needs so-called policy neutral, it is a fairly difficult task. The commission also has to take into account revenue-raising efforts which compare each state’s actual revenue with its assessed capacity. The issue here is really to try to make sure that, when we are talking about the Commonwealth Grants Commission formulae and the various relativities, it is not some nice simple measurement of total number of population equals X number of dollars per head and we all should get that mix.
The Northern Territory of course gets a significant amount extra per head because of a variety of factors, not least distance. Frankly, I think each state including my own state of Queensland could make a very strong case for all those different issues and criteria that come to implementing the formula that could be just as credible. If you look at, frankly, the pretty lamentable record of the New South Wales government when it comes to basic infrastructure and even getting that to work properly then I do not think really they can suggest that somehow or other they are making full value of the dollars they get. In saying that, I do not suggest the Queensland state government have a perfect record by any means but I do think that, when we have these debates, we need to recognise the need for them to be based on facts, substance and information rather than just blithe jingoistic parochialism. Wasting money, as state governments have done, buying big newspaper advertisements trying to promote their case is hardly the way to go. It is not going to influence the commission and it is not going to influence an informed debate. Certainly, from my point of view, I think Queensland very much has a case for saying that it is not getting any less than it should be. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-11-09,"—Unlike Senator Bartlett, who has given a very statesmanlike and learned address on the report on state revenue-sharing relativities, I intend to be a bit parochial. I have to say that the relativities, whilst they do not unfairly favour Queensland, do result in Queensland getting a substantially beneficial share of the Commonwealth revenue. Of course, Queensland gets it under the formula as it is, and I think that the formula is still appropriate. I have been very conscious, particularly in the time I was Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, that some of the states, particularly the old rust bucket states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, always complain about how much Queensland and Western Australia receive from these grants. But Queensland is a very decentralised state and it does have difficulties with infrastructure that perhaps other states such as New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia do not have.
—And Tasmania?
—I dare not say Tasmania with a Tasmanian in the chair and two other Tasmanians sitting around me! Although, perhaps I will take Senator Marshall’s interjection and include Tasmania in that. Whilst Queensland has not done better than it should, it has done pretty well out of the relativities.
One of the things that I am continually distressed about is that, with the huge amounts of money coming in from the Commonwealth through the financial assistance grants and the GST—which is based on the same sort of formula—Queensland still has enormously high taxes, particularly in the area of stamp duty and payroll tax. Senators will recall that, when we introduced the GST, there were all sorts of commitments, although never real commitments, from all of the Labor state premiers that, once they got their hands on every single cent of the GST—which, as we know, they have—they would address the state taxes that have really inhibited business growth and employment creation. Foremost amongst those was payroll tax. Some of the states have made some attempts to reduce taxes, but Queensland is one of the worst when it comes to the taxes that it continues to collect in spite of the fact that it is getting enormous revenues from the GST and the financial assistance grants delivered by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.
The Queensland government has criminally wasted money that has come to it and it has continued to accept more and more revenue from its own sources as a result of the property boom over the last few years. What has it done with its money? It certainly has not spent it on infrastructure. Most of the roads infrastructure in Queensland, be it at the local government level, national highway level or roads of national significance level, comes from the Commonwealth government. The contribution of the Queensland government is very small by comparison.
The Queensland government certainly has not been putting the money into health infrastructure. The health system in Queensland, once the envy of every state of Australia, is now a basket case. It is an absolute tragedy. Money has not been put into it where it counts. Certainly, there are an enormous number of spin doctors employed in the health system, as well as everywhere else in the government. There are a hell of a lot of pen pushers—people who fill in reports and do surveys and questionnaires. But the contribution to the medical staff, the doctors and nurses who actually do the work of looking after the health of Queenslanders, has been almost pitiful. Then there was the scandal of the Dr Death saga, when Dr Death was going to come back into Queensland to face the music. But he would have arrived in the middle of the election campaign, so what did Mr Beattie say? That he did not want him back. This is the sort of rubbish you have in Queensland. (Time expired)

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2006-11-09,"—I rise to speak on the Community Affairs Committee report Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers. Gynaecological cancers are not very often spoken about in the community, and those several hundred women each year who are diagnosed are often not able to find the support that they need. Some women say that when speaking of gynaecological cancers they have feelings of guilt, of shame and of embarrassment. As a result, the journey for gynaecological cancer sufferers is taken in a very painful silence. The symptoms are vague. This report outlines the cases of many women who courageously came and gave evidence to our committee and talked of their own experiences with various gynaecological cancers and in particular of the difficulties that they found because there was no national centre that they could go to for advice, comfort or support in their journey.
Today, 22 women—colleagues of mine in this place, including my colleague and friend Senator Fiona Nash and my colleagues across the chamber Senator Jan McLucas and Senator Ruth Webber—signed a letter to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, asking him to find a way to review the decision that was taken and announced today related to the use of Gardasil, the cervical cancer vaccine. It is very interesting that, once again, the women in this chamber have come together, as they have a number of times in the recent past, to argue for women’s issues which go beyond party politics. It is a credit to all women in this chamber that they see these issues as not being issues related to a single political party but being issues that are related to all women of all ages across Australia. This cervical cancer vaccine issue affects all women of all ages.
Nobel Prize winner Professor Ian Frazer and his team have developed this vaccine, which is found to be 100 per cent effective in protecting women from infection from the four strains of the human papilloma virus, which together now cause 70 per cent of all cervical cancers. These are particularly nasty cancers, and the statistics are very frightening. Some of the statistics that were reported to the committee and are represented in our report show that, in 2001, 1,537 women were diagnosed with uterine cancer and 735 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer. That number has increased a little because of the ageing of the population and also the fact that that statistic is now five years old. But there is no doubt—no doubt at all—that this particular cancer can become part of the history of terrible diseases that have befallen women in the past. This statistic can go gradually down to a very small number with the use of the vaccine Gardasil. It is very important that we look at ways in which this vaccine can be made available more quickly. I was particularly reassured to hear the Prime Minister say that it is not ‘if’ but ‘when’ this vaccine will become available. That is wonderfully reassuring, but what I want to see is that ‘when’ to be as quickly as possible: not next March and not 2008.
The provision of high-quality treatment for women with cancer, whether it is cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, vulval cancer or any of the other gynaecological cancers, is a critical element in improving health outcomes for women with these forms of cancer. Evidence showed that access to treatment was not equal across the community. Our report shows that a disproportionate number of women from rural, regional and remote areas, Indigenous populations and culturally diverse populations generally had very limited access to the services that they needed, whether it was for the initial diagnosis, for the surgery, for the post-operative treatment or for the psychosocial support. It is difficult for those women in all of those areas.
We concluded unanimously—again, across parties, all women on that committee, and Senator Gary Humphries, the chair of the committee—that there is value in bringing people together to strengthen the understanding of gynae cancer issues at the political and policy level and to provide many of the answers that are needed to lessen the impact of these cancers on women and their families. The committee found, and it is reflected in the report, that there should be increased and better coordinated funding to drive new developments in gynaecological oncology and to make more effective use of Australia’s talented researchers and investigators, the priority being given to a screening test for ovarian cancer to enable earlier identification of the disease and successful treatment, hopefully lowering those awful statistics that we heard about in evidence.
The principal recommendation from the committee, reported in the report we are discussing tonight, was for funding for $1 million to establish a national gynaecological cancer centre where we can coordinate, under the banner of the new organisation, Cancer Australia, to form a focus, a framework, for women and their families to have direct access to information on gynaecological cancer, so that when they are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and they type ‘ovarian cancer’ into the search networks on the internet they are not taken to websites in the United States and they are not directed to the Breast Cancer Centre. If you go through the Breast Cancer Centre’s website, you will find some material on ovarian cancer but not on the other cancers. What we want is our own national support group so that not only the women but also their families, their children, the doctors who first diagnosed them, the subsequent surgeons and the wonderful specialists who take care of them can be directed to a source of information.
The My Journey Kit has helped so many women with breast cancer in this country to know where they are going to go; what is going to happen to them; and how, luckily, they are in the statistical group in which more than 80 per cent will be cured. With gynaecological cancers those figures are lower, but, if we are able to get the survivors of these cancers to present My Journey Kits to people who are early diagnosis patients, we can give them the support, the psychosocial underpinning, if you like, that they need. They can then face their journey in the confidence that there are people who have survived these cancers, and can be willing to take part with a helping organisation, as you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, with the diabetes foundation. We can take part, as survivors, in helping newly diagnosed patients to know that there is a future and that, in that future, there may well be some early test available for the awful gynaecological cancer of ovarian cancer. Together with Gardasil, we will start to reduce the numbers and the awful statistics that apply to women in this country who have gynaecological cancers.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,31,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-11-09,"—I too rise to take note of the report Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers. As I said at the tabling of the report, some time back, the committee heard a lot of very personal and painful evidence from women who have been afflicted with these devastating cancers. We need to place on record yet again not only our thanks to them but also our thanks to all the members of the committee, the secretariat, the researchers who appeared before us and, particularly, Senator Ferris for sharing some pretty painful and personal stories and for being such a passionate advocate to try to ensure that no-one has to travel the journey that she has.
It is not often in this place that we come up with a unanimous report, but we did in this case. With a lot of health issues—and perhaps it is when women in this place get together—we tend to come up with a unanimous view on the way forward. Perhaps that is something that the male members of this chamber might like to consider. It has been an interesting week in terms of what happens when women work together in this chamber. Today, we got together in response to a somewhat surprising decision from the government, from the minister, about endorsing the PBAC decision to not subsidise the use of Gardasil. As I said during question time to Senator Santoro, whilst we will always respect the role of experts in evaluating which drugs or vaccines should be used, it is not that committee that makes the final decision. They make the recommendation; it is the minister and the cabinet that make the final decision, and they should never, ever try to hide behind the experts. If they are going to make the decision, they should accept full responsibility for that decision.
Not only were Professor Ian Frazer and all of us in this place a little stunned by the decision but a lot of women in the community were as well. There has been quite an outpouring of reaction. It would seem that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee made the decision because, they say, the vaccine program, which would have cost about $625 million over the first four years, was not value for money. I did not realise that the expert advisory committee was there to advise on value for money; I thought it was there to advise on the safety, efficacy and appropriateness of drugs and vaccines. I did not think it was their role to be economists and work out what was or what was not value for money. I thought that was the role of other advisers and, in the end, the minister and cabinet. So I question how they could arrive at that view, particularly as it is known, and Professor Ian Frazer and others have said, that there is absolutely no dispute that Gardasil works.
For the government, the minister, the cabinet and even the PBAC to knock it back on the basis that it is going to cost too much seems amazing. As even Senator Humphries, the chair of the inquiry, said on radio this morning, what cost do you put on a life? That really is what you have to weigh up when you are looking at a screening program for one of the most devastating cancers that can affect young women in our community. When we were discussing this earlier today, Senator Santoro went on to talk about the words of encouragement of the shadow minister for health, Ms Gillard, about the role of the PBAC. And she is right: it is the role of that expert advisory group to advise us on which drugs are appropriate and when. But it is never their job to consider price. I would have thought it is their job to consider value and it is then up to the government to consider and look at price. It is not up to the PBAC. It is up to them to consider the value of the medical treatment, but not whether it is value for money.
In the public debate that has surrounded the need, in my view, for Gardasil to be put on the PBS and for the screening program to commence as soon as possible, one of the things that have really concerned me has been some comments I read in the press earlier today from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, when he was defending the government’s decision to just accept the PBAC recommendation. He said he was going to work very hard on trying to make sure it was all fixed up for the next round in March. But, according to press reports, when he was asked whether he would have his three daughters vaccinated with the new breakthrough drug—the drug that it is admitted there are no problems with: it is absolutely successful and will not harm your health—he went on to say:
I won’t be rushing out to get my daughters vaccinated, maybe that’s because I’m a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard but, look, I won’t be.
I find that absolutely astounding. It is an absolute shame that the father of three daughters could say that—and not just as a father but as an opinion leader in our community and a key decision maker. Every now and then we have to lead by example. We have to say that we are going to put our personal morality a little to one side and look after the health of our loved ones. How could you, for whatever reason, decide that you would not spend the money? Even if this vaccine does not get listed on the PBS so that the screening program can take place in 2008, how could you, as a cabinet minister, say that you will not come up with the money to look after the health and safety of your daughters? That is a callous decision.
We have all championed far and wide the enormous contribution that Professor Frazer, the Australian of the Year, has made to the scientific and medical community, not only in this country but worldwide. He is someone we are all very proud of, someone who has chosen to make Australia his home so that he can continue with his endeavours. So I find it absolutely incredible that the minister can on the one hand champion Professor Frazer’s scientific work and on the other hand say that he will not use that pioneering research to look after the health and safety of his own children. I find that absolutely amazing.
Some of the other commentary on this issue has included, as Senator Ferris has said, the Prime Minister saying that he is confident that these issues will be addressed, that Gardasil will be listed and will be available for the screening program to take place in 2008. I am heartened by that. I would much rather that we acted a bit more promptly. Perhaps the screening program could have been well and truly in place if the government had chosen to accept the advice that the PBAC gave them but then said that they were not going to implement it and that it should be looked at again. Much is made of leaving these issues to experts, and it is very important to get expert advice. But if the minister were to intervene in this case it would not be the first time that there was such an intervention. I am sure we all remember the intervention after the public concern about the meningococcal C vaccine. That was political intervention—sensible and sensitive political intervention—to look after very young children. Surely young women in our community deserve the same intervention. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The provision of high-quality treatment for women with cancer, whether it is cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, vulval cancer or any of the other gynaecological cancers, is a critical element in improving health outcomes for women with these forms of cancer. Evidence showed that access to treatment was not equal across the community. Our report shows that a disproportionate number of women from rural, regional and remote areas, Indigenous populations and culturally diverse populations generally had very limited access to the services that they needed, whether it was for the initial diagnosis, for the surgery, for the post-operative treatment or for the psychosocial support. It is difficult for those women in all of those areas.
We concluded unanimously—again, across parties, all women on that committee, and Senator Gary Humphries, the chair of the committee—that there is value in bringing people together to strengthen the understanding of gynae cancer issues at the political and policy level and to provide many of the answers that are needed to lessen the impact of these cancers on women and their families. The committee found, and it is reflected in the report, that there should be increased and better coordinated funding to drive new developments in gynaecological oncology and to make more effective use of Australia’s talented researchers and investigators, the priority being given to a screening test for ovarian cancer to enable earlier identification of the disease and successful treatment, hopefully lowering those awful statistics that we heard about in evidence.
The principal recommendation from the committee, reported in the report we are discussing tonight, was for funding for $1 million to establish a national gynaecological cancer centre where we can coordinate, under the banner of the new organisation, Cancer Australia, to form a focus, a framework, for women and their families to have direct access to information on gynaecological cancer, so that when they are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and they type ‘ovarian cancer’ into the search networks on the internet they are not taken to websites in the United States and they are not directed to the Breast Cancer Centre. If you go through the Breast Cancer Centre’s website, you will find some material on ovarian cancer but not on the other cancers. What we want is our own national support group so that not only the women but also their families, their children, the doctors who first diagnosed them, the subsequent surgeons and the wonderful specialists who take care of them can be directed to a source of information.
The My Journey Kit has helped so many women with breast cancer in this country to know where they are going to go; what is going to happen to them; and how, luckily, they are in the statistical group in which more than 80 per cent will be cured. With gynaecological cancers those figures are lower, but, if we are able to get the survivors of these cancers to present My Journey Kits to people who are early diagnosis patients, we can give them the support, the psychosocial underpinning, if you like, that they need. They can then face their journey in the confidence that there are people who have survived these cancers, and can be willing to take part with a helping organisation, as you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, with the diabetes foundation. We can take part, as survivors, in helping newly diagnosed patients to know that there is a future and that, in that future, there may well be some early test available for the awful gynaecological cancer of ovarian cancer. Together with Gardasil, we will start to reduce the numbers and the awful statistics that apply to women in this country who have gynaecological cancers.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,31,2,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-11-09,"—I too rise to take note of the report Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers. As I said at the tabling of the report, some time back, the committee heard a lot of very personal and painful evidence from women who have been afflicted with these devastating cancers. We need to place on record yet again not only our thanks to them but also our thanks to all the members of the committee, the secretariat, the researchers who appeared before us and, particularly, Senator Ferris for sharing some pretty painful and personal stories and for being such a passionate advocate to try to ensure that no-one has to travel the journey that she has.
It is not often in this place that we come up with a unanimous report, but we did in this case. With a lot of health issues—and perhaps it is when women in this place get together—we tend to come up with a unanimous view on the way forward. Perhaps that is something that the male members of this chamber might like to consider. It has been an interesting week in terms of what happens when women work together in this chamber. Today, we got together in response to a somewhat surprising decision from the government, from the minister, about endorsing the PBAC decision to not subsidise the use of Gardasil. As I said during question time to Senator Santoro, whilst we will always respect the role of experts in evaluating which drugs or vaccines should be used, it is not that committee that makes the final decision. They make the recommendation; it is the minister and the cabinet that make the final decision, and they should never, ever try to hide behind the experts. If they are going to make the decision, they should accept full responsibility for that decision.
Not only were Professor Ian Frazer and all of us in this place a little stunned by the decision but a lot of women in the community were as well. There has been quite an outpouring of reaction. It would seem that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee made the decision because, they say, the vaccine program, which would have cost about $625 million over the first four years, was not value for money. I did not realise that the expert advisory committee was there to advise on value for money; I thought it was there to advise on the safety, efficacy and appropriateness of drugs and vaccines. I did not think it was their role to be economists and work out what was or what was not value for money. I thought that was the role of other advisers and, in the end, the minister and cabinet. So I question how they could arrive at that view, particularly as it is known, and Professor Ian Frazer and others have said, that there is absolutely no dispute that Gardasil works.
For the government, the minister, the cabinet and even the PBAC to knock it back on the basis that it is going to cost too much seems amazing. As even Senator Humphries, the chair of the inquiry, said on radio this morning, what cost do you put on a life? That really is what you have to weigh up when you are looking at a screening program for one of the most devastating cancers that can affect young women in our community. When we were discussing this earlier today, Senator Santoro went on to talk about the words of encouragement of the shadow minister for health, Ms Gillard, about the role of the PBAC. And she is right: it is the role of that expert advisory group to advise us on which drugs are appropriate and when. But it is never their job to consider price. I would have thought it is their job to consider value and it is then up to the government to consider and look at price. It is not up to the PBAC. It is up to them to consider the value of the medical treatment, but not whether it is value for money.
In the public debate that has surrounded the need, in my view, for Gardasil to be put on the PBS and for the screening program to commence as soon as possible, one of the things that have really concerned me has been some comments I read in the press earlier today from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, when he was defending the government’s decision to just accept the PBAC recommendation. He said he was going to work very hard on trying to make sure it was all fixed up for the next round in March. But, according to press reports, when he was asked whether he would have his three daughters vaccinated with the new breakthrough drug—the drug that it is admitted there are no problems with: it is absolutely successful and will not harm your health—he went on to say:
I won’t be rushing out to get my daughters vaccinated, maybe that’s because I’m a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard but, look, I won’t be.
I find that absolutely astounding. It is an absolute shame that the father of three daughters could say that—and not just as a father but as an opinion leader in our community and a key decision maker. Every now and then we have to lead by example. We have to say that we are going to put our personal morality a little to one side and look after the health of our loved ones. How could you, for whatever reason, decide that you would not spend the money? Even if this vaccine does not get listed on the PBS so that the screening program can take place in 2008, how could you, as a cabinet minister, say that you will not come up with the money to look after the health and safety of your daughters? That is a callous decision.
We have all championed far and wide the enormous contribution that Professor Frazer, the Australian of the Year, has made to the scientific and medical community, not only in this country but worldwide. He is someone we are all very proud of, someone who has chosen to make Australia his home so that he can continue with his endeavours. So I find it absolutely incredible that the minister can on the one hand champion Professor Frazer’s scientific work and on the other hand say that he will not use that pioneering research to look after the health and safety of his own children. I find that absolutely amazing.
Some of the other commentary on this issue has included, as Senator Ferris has said, the Prime Minister saying that he is confident that these issues will be addressed, that Gardasil will be listed and will be available for the screening program to take place in 2008. I am heartened by that. I would much rather that we acted a bit more promptly. Perhaps the screening program could have been well and truly in place if the government had chosen to accept the advice that the PBAC gave them but then said that they were not going to implement it and that it should be looked at again. Much is made of leaving these issues to experts, and it is very important to get expert advice. But if the minister were to intervene in this case it would not be the first time that there was such an intervention. I am sure we all remember the intervention after the public concern about the meningococcal C vaccine. That was political intervention—sensible and sensitive political intervention—to look after very young children. Surely young women in our community deserve the same intervention. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-11-09,"—Last weekend the Queensland division of Liberal Party met for the annual conference and three new vice-presidents were elected, Gary Spence, John Caris and John Clifford—and congratulations to them. The convention also adopted a motion, which I moved on behalf of the Burdekin branch of the Liberal Party, to introduce a sustainable cull of crocodiles in Queensland.
Commercial hunting of crocodiles began in the Northern Territory in 1945 and continued until 1971 when the species was protected due to the very marked decline in the population of crocodiles. The decline between 1945 and 1971 was assessed by the skins produced during that period. Between 1945 and 1971 the total number of skins from the Northern Territory entering trade was estimated to have been 113,000 but, of those, 87,000 were killed between 1945 and 1958 and only 26,000 between 1959 and 1971. After 1971 wild harvesting of the crocodile stopped but since then the population has increased from approximately 3,000 in 1971 to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 individuals in 1984.
In the Northern Territory there was, in 1980, permission given to begin farming crocodiles where farm stock was derived from wild harvest of crocodile eggs and from a captive breeding program. The industry has managed to ensure that it does not have any detrimental effects on crocodile populations. Since 1966, limited wild harvesting of adults and hatchlings has also occurred. The sustainability of the crocodile industry is evidenced by the continuing increase in the population of wild crocodiles, which in 1984 was estimated to be between 70,000 and 75,000. Wild harvesting of juvenile and adult crocodiles recommenced in 1997. Adult and juvenile crocodiles are harvested for several reasons including the provision of stock for farms, for immediate skin and flesh production and for the production of souvenirs. The crocodiles are allowed to be killed and used directly for skin and meat production or captured and used as stock in crocodile farms. The homing instincts of crocodiles and the expense of transporting and handling crocodiles does mean that many crocodiles taken from populated areas are not relocated.
In Queensland intensive harvesting of wild crocodiles began after the return of soldiers from the Second World War. The majority of these crocodile hunters were land based and over the years thousands of skins were exported and many juvenile crocodiles were hand caught to supply what was called the stuffer trade. The intensive harvesting severely depleted the population of wild crocodiles in Queensland and raised concerns about the long-term viability of the population. The species was fully protected under a Queensland act in 1974 and that remains the position as of today. Scientists have, however, estimated—and it can only be an estimate—that there are currently anywhere between 100,000 and 250,000 crocodiles in Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north-west of Western Australia.
In recent times, crocodiles have been seen much more often in more populated areas. A couple of weeks ago every day on the front page of the Townsville Bulletin there were reports of crocodiles being sighted off the Strand in Townsville. The Strand is a very popular tourism destination, a great place for locals to go swimming. There is a rock pool there and they do have stinger nets in season but the Strand beach is very popular and lots of parents take their children down there and let them run fairly unsupervised because it has always been known to be a very safe place. But the appearance of crocodiles off Kissing Point caused some real problems and the beaches were shut for three days at a time. In addition to this, crocodiles have been sighted in the Mackay boat harbour. They are now regularly seen in the delta creeks of the Burdekin River. I used to fish quite a lot in the delta creeks years ago. I do not go quite so much these days, although in the last 12 months I have had a bit of an opportunity to go down a bit more.
I remember that 20 or 30 years I would drag a bait net through the creeks at midnight, up to my chest in water, but it is something I would not do these days. Back 20, 30 or 40 years ago it was possible to do that because there were very few crocodiles in the area, but I barely get out of the boat to pump yabbies at the present time without being very cautious of crocodiles that might be around. I know that in Cairns crocodiles are often seen along the foreshore of the creeks close to the city. It does seem that crocodile populations are moving more into areas which are inhabited by human beings.
Just yesterday at Cape Tribulation, north of Cairns, a tourist—who was being a bit silly, I must say—tried to attract a crocodile to get a better photograph and was bitten by the crocodile and lucky not to have been dragged into the water, submerged and hidden for food to be eaten later on. It demonstrates the point that there are now more and more crocodiles in the same areas as human beings. Some would say, ‘Crocodiles were here first, they are entitled to be here and human beings shouldn’t be here.’ But, of course, the reality is that human beings are going to go to Strand Beach, Cape Tribulation or Mackay boat harbour or go fishing in the Burdekin creeks. I make a simple distinction: when it comes to the question of whether you protect the crocodile or the human being, I will always go with the human being.
I think this is now a time when we can cull crocodiles in Queensland and the rest of Australia. It is already happening to an extent in the Northern Territory. It can be done sustainably. I think we are clever enough these days to be able to manage wildlife populations. I only need to refer senators to the culling of kangaroos in Australia to demonstrate that point. Each year, we slaughter tens of thousands of kangaroos for meat production. Kangaroo meat is very tasty and healthy and is very much in demand overseas. I think it is sold a lot in Germany. I would like to eat more but my wife refuses to eat it. She says she will not eat the national emblem, and I know there are many Australians like that. But kangaroos are sustainably harvested and it is a real industry that creates employment out in western Queensland.
I think there is nothing wrong with sustainably harvesting Australia’s native wildlife. I think the same could apply to crocodiles as with kangaroos. With crocodiles, it is not so much a question of harvesting them for meat or for their skins as one of the safety of the general public. I think there is a place for crocodiles but it is not in the same place as humans congregate. Many may say it is a pity humans are in those places, but that is the reality. They are there and I think the time has come when we need to sustainably cull crocodiles for the safety of human beings.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Queensland Liberal Party: Annual Conference</title>,ADJOURNMENT,32,1,speech
