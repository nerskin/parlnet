The speeches read as follows—



TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES NO.1) BILL 2015


This Bill amends the tax law to lower the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points to 28.5 per cent for incorporated small business. 


Many would agree that small businesses make an important contribution to the Australian economy. 


Around 96 per cent of all Australia's businesses are small businesses. Small businesses produce over $330 billion of Australia's economic output and there is no doubt small business is at the forefront of Australia's jobs and growth. They employ over 4.5 million people, which accounts to around 43 per cent of non‑financial private sector jobs in Australia. But this would have been more, if it were not for 6 years of Labor where 519,000 jobs were lost in small business.


While small businesses have a significant role in the Australian economy, they face a unique set of operational challenges, and as a consequence typically have higher failure rates than larger companies. These unique characteristics make small businesses more vulnerable to shocks and changes in economic conditions than larger businesses. 


We know from the Intergenerational Report that there will be a significant challenge to maintain Australia's current rate of income growth. Future growth in living standards must be driven by higher levels of Australian productivity. 


It will require productivity growth to increase to around 3 per cent a year. This is well in excess of what Australia achieved in the past 50 years, and more than doubles that of the past decade. Put simply, growth in productivity will require more or better quality goods and services to be generated from the resources available.


Australians are well known for their enterprising spirit and their willingness to have a go. The hard working women and men of Australian small businesses are the engine room of our economy. In 2013-14 Australians started over 280,000 small businesses.


Small businesses are often the entities that test and pioneer innovative ideas and business practices, which are critical to future economic growth, job prospects and improved living standards.


This makes it particularly important that the policy settings support small business growth and innovation. 


As elected members of this Parliament, we need to understand and recognise where the impediments and headwinds are in every square of the economy and do our best to address them, so that those enterprising people with an idea, an aspiration, a sparkle in their eye and a fire in their belly can turn their ambition into economic activity to benefit themselves and the nation.


For a long period, we have been blessed by nature with resources that give us a competitive advantage and we see that we have benefited from that. However, as we look at the over the economic horizon  we cannot bank on that to sustain our living standards and our quality of life. 


The Australian economy is in the midst of a major economic transformation, moving from growth led by investment in resources projects to broader-based drivers of activity in non‑resources sectors.


We need entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, drive and risk taking to find new markets, develop new products, and establish new businesses. To achieve that, we need the ambition of enterprising women and men. 


This Government sees energising Australian enterprises as its priority. The Government's $5.5 billion Jobs and Small Business package in the 2015-16 Budget will create the right conditions for Australian small businesses to thrive and grow. It will help employers create new jobs and assist Australia's unemployed to access these jobs.


The Budget delivers the biggest small business package in Australia's history. It is about putting in place improved incentives for entrepreneurial behaviour.


Since the 2015-16 Budget announcement, I have had much positive feedback on the Jobs and Small Business package.


Comsec has said ""The measures in the federal Budget to support small business would have been a key driver of the lift in confidence."" 


COSBOA Chief Executive Peter Strong has said ""This is a fundamental and positive change that sends the right message to people looking to start a business.""


Australian Newsagents Federation has said ""This will definitely create further impetus and incentive for our members to invest in their businesses.""


This Bill reduces the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 28.5 per cent for small businesses with annual turnover under $2 million. This change is the centrepiece of the small business package. Because on this side of the House we are the best friends of small business. 


Small business companies will pay less tax for income years that commence on or after 1 July 2015. This change delivers on our election commitment to small business. 


Providing incorporated small businesses with a reduced rate of company tax will enable them to retain more earnings and improve their cash flow; a critical issue for small businesses. It is estimated that up to 780,000 companies could potentially benefit from this measure. 


New company registrations in the last financial year were the highest on record. This measure will help all new and existing small companies grow, thrive and compete.


Helping more small businesses become more profitable will give them greater capacity to invest and innovate by adopting new and improved ways of doing business, improving our nation's productivity and resulting in more jobs and higher wages for Australian workers. That means better living standards for all.


We understand that not all small businesses are incorporated so we will bring forward legislation to provide tax relief for unincorporated small businesses. In addition, later today I will introduce legislation to deliver assistance for all small businesses, including accelerated depreciation arrangements.


This Bill will also ensure that the maximum amount of franking credits a small incorporated business can attach to its dividends in a year will not be reduced along with the tax rate. This additional benefit will allow small companies to distribute surplus franking credits accumulated in previous years; reducing the tax their owners pay when they receive dividends. 


This will benefit owners of small business and effectively reduce the shareholders' overall tax paid regardless of their marginal tax rate.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


This Government is the friend of small business, and the 2015‑16 Budget is where we demonstrate our bona fides for that claim. This Bill is the first of several that will implement the small business measures announced in the Budget. This measure is appropriate and it is affordable, and I call on all to give it their full support.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURE NO. 2) BILL 2015


This Bill amends the tax law to help small businesses and primary producers to invest, grow and innovate. 


It provides accelerated depreciation arrangements as outlined in the Growing Jobs and Small Business package and the New Framework for Drought Preparedness, both of which were announced in the 2015-16 Budget.


A budget which has been widely welcomed. ACCI CEO Kate Carnell said ""Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy, so support for these businesses will boost overall jobs and investment. The government's measures will help to restore confidence among small businesses.""  NSW Business Chamber CEO Stephen Cartwright said ""These measures will be particularly well received in regional Australia where unemployment is at its highest and job opportunities are limited.""


Small businesses play a significant role in the Australian economy, particularly as a major employer and contributor to the economy. 


Small businesses make an important contribution to the Australian economy. 96 per cent of all Australia's businesses are small businesses. They employ over 4.5 million people. They are adaptable and able to respond profitably to changing circumstances.


Small businesses are often the entities that test and pioneer innovative ideas and business practices which are critical to future economic growth, job prospects and improved living standards.


Small businesses produce over $330 billion of Australia's economic output. While this is a significant role in the Australian economy, small businesses face a unique set of operational challenges, and as a consequence typically have higher failure rates than larger companies. This makes it particularly important that the policy settings support small business growth and innovation. 


This is why the Government announced the biggest jobs and small business package in the nation's history as a centrepiece of the 2015-16 Budget. The package included a tax cut for incorporated small businesses, tax relief for unincorporated small businesses and accelerated depreciation arrangements. These measures were designed to help small businesses grow, compete and employ more Australians.


Farmers too play a pivotal role in the Australian economy, and are at the heart of the Australian identity. 115,000 businesses report -agriculture as their main business activity. A further 13,900 report it as a secondary activity. 


Farmers are a significant employer, particularly in regional areas. These businesses make up 52 per cent of Australia's land mass. 99 per cent of agriculture businesses are Australian owned. 


The value of agriculture production was worth over $50 billion in 2013-14, contributing to around two per cent of Australia's gross domestic product and 15 per cent of total Australian merchandise exports.


In 2013-14, agriculture exports were worth around $40 billion, with over 60 per cent of production exported to more than 100 countries.


The agriculture industry plays an important role in the social fabric of Australia, being recognised by the Government as one of the five pillars of the Australian economy; the industry has prime place in our nation's future.


Agriculture is one of the sectors on which the prosperity of our nation is increasingly reliant. The Government has laid the foundations for a stronger agricultural sector. We have reduced regulation, removed the carbon tax, increased export market access, invested in infrastructure, refined the settings for foreign investment and secured FTAs with China, Korea and Japan.


Stronger farmers mean a stronger economy and we are focused on strengthening the competitiveness of the sector.


Boosting the competitiveness of the agriculture sector will contribute to Australia's broader economic growth, jobs, trade, innovation and productivity.


However, farmers have to cope with significant challenges, including severe weather events. Currently, some parts of the country are subject to unprecedented drought and large parts of the north have experienced a third failed wet season. This affects the financial position and wellbeing of farmers, their families and the surrounding rural communities. Helping farmers through times of drought is in our national interest. 


Considering the significant role farmers play in our economy, it is important they are provided with support and encouragement to better manage their risks and prepare for extreme weather events. 


The Government is committed to providing the necessary support to Australia's farmers to help them prepare for drought, and to provide them with a better tax system. 


In addition to providing farmers with a simplified accelerated depreciation regime, the Government is providing more money to:


continue the Drought Concessional Loan Scheme and the Drought Recovery Concessional Loan Scheme for an additional year; 


assist farmers to reduce the impact of pest animals in drought-affected areas; 


fund civil and civic infrastructure projects in drought affected areas through grants; and


extend existing social and community support services for farmers to 70 local government areas that are experiencing a severe and prolonged rainfall deficiency. 


Schedule 1 to this Bill amends the small business simplified depreciation rules in the tax law, to increase the threshold for immediately deductibility for capital assets.


The schedule will significantly increase this threshold from the current level of $1,000 to $20,000. This will mean that any small business buying an asset costing less than $20,000 will be able to immediately deduct the full cost of the asset. This measure is available for any business asset purchased and installed, ready for use, between 7:30pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time) on 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017.


This is a massive increase in the threshold and a massive gain to cash flow for small businesses. CPA Australia CEO Alex Malley said ""By allowing small businesses to immediately deduct assets costing less than $20,000 is a positive move which will support vital and much needed business investment.""


Currently, small businesses purchasing assets above $1,000 have to depreciate these assets over multiple income years. –In some cases this imposes complex record keeping requirements on small business, but it reduces their cash flow.


This Government is returning small business's profits to its owners and allowing them to make the decisions which best suit them; the decisions that allow them to grow their business and employ more Australians.


As part of the threshold increase, any assets that individually cost $20,000 or more can be pooled together in the general small business pool and depreciated at 15 per cent in the first year, and 30 per cent each year thereafter. Once an asset is placed in the pool, there is no requirement to track the item. This reduces paperwork and frees small business to get on with doing what they do best.


The pool itself may also be deducted entirely if its value is below the $20,000 threshold at the end of any financial year between 7:30 pm 12 May 2015 and 30 June 2017.


The law currently includes 'lock-out rules' that stop businesses that elect out of the simplified depreciation scheme from re entering for five years. To ensure fairness and the broadest availability of this measure, this schedule relaxes those rules so that the higher threshold is available. This will allow all small business entities to access this measure.


Consider an electrical business that purchases tools and other equipment for their small business. These tools can be expensive and the rules around depreciating them can be time consuming to understand. Under the expanded accelerated depreciation measure, this business can write-off each and every item under $20,000 that is purchased before 30 June 2017. 


Schedule 2 to this Bill amends the tax law to provide a more simplified accelerated depreciation regime for all farmers, in three ways. 


Firstly, the schedule will allow all primary producers to immediately deduct capital expenditure on fencing. 


The current depreciation treatment for fencing is complex, and can vary depending upon the type of fencing asset. For example, currently, a general farm fence may be depreciated over 30 years. An electric fence, on the other hand, may be depreciated over 20 years. An energiser for this electric fence is depreciated over a different period again. 


If the fence is used in landcare operations, for example, to segregate a section of land which may be affected by land degradation, its cost is immediately deductible.


If a farmer makes a repair to an existing fence, the repair costs are immediately deductible.


From 7:30 pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time) 12 May 2015, rather than repairing an existing fence which can be costly and time consuming, farmers can instead immediately deduct the cost of installing a new fence. This will reduce red tape and complexity. 


Farmers will no longer need to keep track of expenditure over extended periods of time. Farmers will have more cash in their pockets to spend, invest or pay off debt. New investment may also boost farm productivity. 


Consider Jake who installs 25 kilometres of new fencing, at a cost of $25,000 on his cattle farm. Under the current system, Jake is able to depreciate his fencing costs over a period of 30 years. Jake claims a depreciation deduction of $833 each year.


Now, Jake will be able to deduct the full cost of $25,000 immediately. 


These additional deductions mean that Jake will pay less tax if he makes a profit. Assuming Jake's marginal tax rate is 39 per cent, including the Medicare Levy, his tax liability would be reduced by $14,742. This means Jake will have more to spend, invest or pay off debt. 


The second and third amendments under this schedule will encourage primary producers to better prepare for and manage drought risks. 


Extreme weather events, such as drought, are an unavoidable reality for many farmers. Farm preparedness, such as having available sufficient feed and water, is vital to surviving extended periods of drought. 


Under this schedule, capital expenditure on water facilities, such as dams, tanks, bores, irrigation channels, pumps, water towers and windmills will now be immediately deductible. 


Currently, water facilities are depreciated in three equal amounts, over three years.


Farmers will now be able to invest in a new irrigation system, build a new dam or install a new pump and be able to immediately deduct for tax purposes the cost. 


The schedule will also allow for capital expenditure on fodder storage assets, such as silos to store animal feed, tanks to store liquid feed supplements and hay and grain storage sheds, to be depreciated over three years. 


Having fodder on hand is important for farmers during drought periods. Currently, a farmer wishing to prepare for drought who invests in a steel silo would need to depreciate and track the expenditure of the asset over a period of up to 30 years. Under the amendments, this is reduced to three years.


Consider Rob, a farmer who purchases a steel silo, at a cost of $21,000, for storing animal feed on his farm. Currently, Rob is able to depreciate the steel silo over 30 years and claims a depreciation deduction of $700 each year. 


Now, Rob will be able to depreciate the silo cost of $21,000 over three years giving him $6,300 more in deductions in each of the first three years. 


These additional deductions mean that Rob will pay less tax if he makes a profit. 


Assuming Rob marginal tax rate is 34.5 per cent, including the Medicare Levy, his tax liability would be reduced by $4,127 in each of the first three years, meaning that he will have additional funds to invest, pay off debt or spend. 


Accelerating the depreciation on water facilities and fodder storage assets will mean more money in farmers' pockets for investment in drought preparedness; a simplified depreciation system and an increase in farm productivity.


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memoranda.


This Government is the best friend of small businesses and farmers, and the 2015-16 Budget is where we demonstrate our bona fides for that claim. This bill is one of several that will implement the small business and primary producers measures announced in the Budget, thereby putting in place further significant acknowledgment and recognition in the tax law of the importance of small business, and of farmers, to our economy.


The measures are appropriate and they are affordable, and I call on all members to give it their full support.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:07):  Labor supports these bills. We have been saying this since budget night when our Shadow Treasurer said it, but let me say it again: we are supporting these bills. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures No.1) Bill 2015 amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28.5 per cent for companies that are small business entities with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million. It retains the company tax rate at 30 per cent for all other companies over the threshold. 


There are two parts to the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measure No. 2) Bill 2015. Schedule 1 deals with the $20,000 accelerated depreciation for small businesses and schedule 2 allows for accelerated depreciation for primary producers. In the No. 2 bill, schedule 1 amends the accelerated depreciation rules for small businesses—businesses with an aggregate annual turnover of less than $2 million—by temporarily increasing the threshold under which certain depreciating assets, costs incurred in relation to depreciating assets and general small business pools can be written off. 


An increased threshold of $20,000 applies from 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 12 May 2015 until 30 June 2017. From 1 July 2017 the threshold reverts to $1,000. The increased threshold is available to all small businesses, including those who previously opted out of the simplified depreciation rules. Schedule 2 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow primary producers to claim an immediate deduction for capital expenditure on water facilities and fencing assets and to deduct capital expenditure on fodder storage assets over three years. This will assist primary producers with drought preparedness and cash flow and encourage investment in productivity enhancing assets. 


We saw in the other place the embarrassing situation of the government, after saying time and time again that Labor must get out of the road and support the budget's tax measures and small business package, voting against a motion from the Leader of the Opposition to bring the bills to a speedy vote. Repeatedly we hear the government espousing its credentials in this area, saying that it wants to support small business. On our side, we say, 'Let us get on with it.' Instead, in the other place, there was the spectacle of hours and hours of speakers from the government lining up at the same time as the government was criticising Labor and claiming we were creating uncertainty. Our position remains clear. We will support this legislation, because we do support small business. And let us hope that in this place we do not see, as in the House, speaker after speaker from the government delaying progress here.


On the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures No. 1) Bill 2015, Labor will support the company tax cut of 1.5 per cent for small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $2 million given the serious economic impacts of the government's significant cuts to the sector since the last election. So, what we are doing here is remedial. The impact of this government's overall budgetary position and the loss of confidence for small business is what needs to be repaired.


Let us put on the record that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer cut more than $5 billion of tax assistance for micro and small businesses in last year's budget. They also slashed the instant asset write-off for small businesses—the very measure the government is now bringing back. These cuts have hurt small business's cash flow, and consumer sentiment and small business confidence has crashed because of this government's first budget. When we look at the other dire effects of this government's first budget, people often forget the impact on business confidence, and this has hit small business significantly. Now, in an effort to save their jobs, though, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are proposing assistance measures for small business. The Australian community rightly marked the government down following last year's disastrous budget, yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer continue to talk down the economy and blame everyone else for their problems. As a result, there was a direct hit to consumer and business confidence. In addition, this budget has doubled the deficit from $17 billion to just over $35 billion. And, according to the government's own budget papers—budget paper No. 1—under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer general government sector net debt has gone from 12.8 per cent of GDP in the 2013-14 year to 17.3 per cent of GDP in 2015-16, and it is climbing, and it is unprecedented.


The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, and others made clear from budget night onwards that Labor will support the small business measures in the budget given the urgent need for assistance to this significant sector of the Australian economy. Small business contributes annually in excess of $330 billion to our GDP and it is responsible for around 47 per cent of private sector employment. However, Labor notes the recent comments from respected chief economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Saul Eslake, who points out that almost 63 per cent of small business companies will derive no benefit from a 1.5 per cent company tax rate because they are neither profitable nor taxable. Labor also notes stakeholder concerns such as those of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry regarding the introduction of a two-tier tax system for small business and will monitor the change going forward to see if there are additional complexities and compliance issues arising from these new tax arrangements. I highlight the compliance issue. I have observed significant commentary on this issue since the announcement. It does not appear that the government has seriously thought through these measures, and we will wait, as we monitor those issues, as the arrangements go forward. 


Regarding the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures No. 2) Bill 2015, Labor will support the No. 2 bill to introduce accelerated depreciation for small business entities and primary producers. The $1,000 threshold for the cost of depreciating assets, costs incurred in relation to depreciating assets, and the low pool value deduction under the small business entity capital allowance provisions is temporarily increased to $20,000. As I identified at the outset of my speech on the second reading, the increased threshold applies only to assets that were first acquired at or after 7.30 pm, legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 12 May 2015, and first used or installed ready for use on or before 30 June 2017. Assets that do not satisfy these timing requirements will be subject to the $1,000 threshold.


Labor increased the instant asset write-off threshold for small business from $1,000 to $6,500 via the Tax Laws Amendment (Stronger, Fairer, Simpler and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The number of assets this applied to was unlimited. Labor's bill also introduced accelerated deductions for motor vehicles. This measure allowed small businesses to instantly write-off $5,000 plus 15 per cent of additional costs for new or used vehicles costing more than $6,500 in the income year that it is first used or installed ready for use. This increase in the instant asset write-off represented a boost to small business of $3.55 billion over the forward estimates and a boost from the accelerated depreciation for motor vehicles of $550 million over the same period. In addition, with the introduction of loss carry-back for companies, these three tax assistance measures for small business provided a boost of more than $5 billion to the small business sector. 


Labor's record on small business is a good record and one of which we can be proud. This contrasts with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer's appalling record on small business. On coming to government, their first actions were to cut the instant asset write-off, tax loss carry-back for companies and the accelerated depreciation for motor vehicles—measures which were vitally important to the sustainability and success of small business. Further, they made the cuts retrospective. The instant asset write-off threshold reduction was backdated to 1 January 2014, creating a red-tape nightmare for small businesses, many of whom may have already filed their annual tax return. For some, they would have had to file an amended return to the ATO and may even have incurred a tax liability.


Now, less than 12 months later and in a desperate attempt to save his own political skin, Tony Abbott has brought back Labor's instant asset write-off and increased it to $20,000—remedial and, indeed, responding to damage that should never have occurred. Again, Labor made our support for the measures contained in this bill, particularly given the urgent need for assistance to this significant sector of the Australian economy. However, Labor is concerned that the tax assistance measure is for only two years. These concerns have been also noted by stakeholders, who have raised the issue of the impact on the small business sector and broader economy when the threshold reverts back to $1, 000 from 1 July 2017. Labor will monitor the actions of the small business community, including any negative consequences resulting from a sudden drop in the threshold—$20,000 down to $1,000—following 1 July 2017. 


In conclusion, Labor believes in small business and has a great record in government on delivering significant tax assistance measures and reducing regulatory burdens for small business. We support small business because they support private sector jobs and because of their overall contribution to the Australian way of life and economy. For these reasons, we support these bills.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:19):  The Greens, also, will be supporting this package for small business, and this is a very good opportunity to remind the Senate and the Australian people that the Greens went to the last federal election with a very clear policy for a two per cent tax cut for small businesses with a turnover of under $2 million. This was debated amongst the Greens' membership and was supported across the board as an initiative that our party should be leading on—and I do believe that we have led on this tax cut for small business. Along with Labor, we are very involved in negotiations around the mining tax measures which support small business not just in terms of the instant asset write-off but also loss carry-back provisions and other measures.


We have always supported stimulating small business. We recognise the importance of small business not just to the economy—the two million small businesses and the contribution they make to employment—but also for there contribution to communities, to states such as Tasmania, where I am very proudly from. Dynamic small business is absolutely critical to our communities as well as to our economy. It gives people the flexibility to control their own destiny. It is hard work and often leads to higher risks. You are risking your capital and your time, without any guarantee of success, often in a very competitive industry. It is a segment of industry in this country that we should be supporting. Small businesses in my state of Tasmania—and I know the statistics are quite alarming right across Australia—have very high failure rates in the first three or four years of establishment. It is tough. It is hard. To give them a bit of a leg-up—whether it is through a tax cut or through other concessions such as the instant asset write-off—is the right thing to do. But we need to be very careful about how we do that.


We took our guidance on the instant asset write-off from the Henry review, which recommended a $10,000 cap on asset depreciation in perpetuity. We support that; that was our policy. But we do have very real concerns, which we have expressed in the media and to our members, about what is essentially a two-year stimulus package for small business. I have asked Senator Cormann these questions in detail at Senate estimates. We have concerns that capping the time frame on this to two years will lead to unintended consequences—and, standing here now, I would even say they are entirely predictable consequences. We will see a surge, a rush, to get access to these deductions in the next two years, especially for this tax year. That might bring expenditure forward, which is going to have budgetary implications. More importantly, it takes away certainty for small business in how they plan for the future. As I said, they have very high failure rates when they initially set up in business, so perhaps encouraging them to overspend in a two-year period could be counterproductive. We feel that, rather than having a lumpy item in their cash flow and in how they manage their cash flow, it would be better to give them an ongoing instant asset write-off so they can better plan for the capital that is required for their business.


I also want to make it very clear here today that if we do care about the sustainability of small business and want them to employ more Australians and grow our economy then they should be expecting a return from every single dollar they put into capital in their business. We do not want to see them going out and buying equipment that they do not necessarily need. For example, if you are a sole trader or in a partnership, it might be something that you want for your utility at home, it might be something that you want that you can write off against your income. It is absolutely critical that every dollar directed towards the instant asset write-off, towards capital in their business, needs to have a productive purpose. Otherwise, we are not going to achieve what this package should be setting out to do, and that is to put small business in this country on a long-term sustainable footing.


From the moment this measure was announced on budget night, it looked to me like a stimulus package. Forgive me for being cynical but, the week before this package, we had also had data suggesting that investment spending in this country was falling off a cliff. Investment spending is of course a critical component of gross domestic product; economic growth comes out in the national accounts. Investment spending was falling off a cliff for a number of reasons that are well understood, including the wind-back in the mining boom. This cannot be a short-term package simply to stimulate investment in this country to make the accounts look good. It has to be to put long-term businesses on a sustainable footing. It must address the issue of helping businesses survive those critical periods when they are at high risk of closing down and allow them to invest in their business not for one or two years but for five or 10 years.


We also believe this package should have included the loss carry-back provision. Senator Collins has made it clear this morning that the Greens and Labor, as the previous government, did have a package in place for small business. We had a $6½ thousand instant asset write-off threshold per item and a loss carry-back provision. A loss carry-back provision also helps small businesses manage their cash flows, and it is something that is missing from this package. It is actually very important. If you are going to be encouraging up-front spending in capital via a much larger instant asset write-off threshold of $20,000 it is especially important that you include loss carry-back provisions so if businesses do not get it right, if they do overspend, they have the potential to go back to previous years where they made profits and paid tax and get compensated for that. That is a really important part of this package that is missing from this.


The Greens would like to have seen the $20,000 limit for capital expenditure as a cumulative measure; we would like to have seen that as a cap across all asset classes, not $20,000 per item. I can speak from personal experience. My wife has a medical practice in Launceston, where we live. She employs 15 people. We have been looking at buying a laser for her business—the Clerk is looking at me, so I have to declare a conflict of interest. We will, no doubt, use this $20,000 provision for my wife's business. We have been looking at buying a laser for scar surgery, especially for breast cancer patients that we deal with. My wife's business turns over slightly less than a seven-figure sum; it is not a high-margin business. For my wife's business, $20,000 is a lot of money. We have been looking at this for seven months. We have not committed to it yet, but we will do so under this package. For a business our size—we are not quite a medium sized enterprise; we are a larger small business—$20,000 is a lot of money, even for one item. But to have no cap in place—so that business can go out and spend $200,000 or $300,000 on different items—is a real concern. We would like to have seen a cap but, to compensate small businesses, we would like to have seen it in perpetuity, we would like to have seen the figure extended into the future.


Senator Cormann, in estimates, did give the impression that the government might review this measure after two years. That would be a sensible thing to do given the concerns we have about small businesses overspending in the short term. But it would also be worth reviewing because it might be something that needs to be extended into the future beyond those two years. So, apart from the budgetary implications, the clear message today is that this package has to encourage productive spending. We do not want it to be just a stimulus to help Harvey Norman and the other retailers—and, incidentally, most of that money will probably go directly overseas to the exporters of goods and services to this country. We actually want the money to stay in this economy and we want businesses to be very careful about how they plan for their capital.


It is widely acknowledged that proprietary limited companies are not the largest component of small business in this country. Therefore, when sole traders and partnerships can write off these kinds of deductions against their other income it presents the potential for rorts of the system. I have gone through in a lot of detail the measures in place to prevent that, and I am still concerned. I can still see some very valid scenarios where someone who is a sole trader—it is very easy to set it up: you go and get yourself a tax file number or an ABN and set up a partnership—could set up a business, buy $100,000 worth of capital over one or two years and then, after three or four years, say, 'I didn't do my business plan well enough. Sorry, I'm going to have to close my business down.' They are then left with items that they can sell or that they can use for themselves. There are a lots of situations I can see where that would be very realistic within the guidelines and within the rules. So we have to be very careful that the system is not rorted and ensure that this money is used for productive purposes.


In terms of the tax cut, we would like to have seen a bigger tax cut for small business. We did get the Parliamentary Budget Office to cost a tax cut of five per cent across the board, as the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, outlined in his budget in reply speech. But that would cost $6 billion in the forward estimates. In the end, we felt that the other provisions that were in place—the instant asset write-off and the loss carry-back provisions—were more important for businesses across the board so they should come as a package. A tax cut to small business is something that the Greens Party have led on. We have been very engaged with Labor to support small business in the last five years.


I must point out how cynical it is that this government took away the package to small business last year and then, 12 months later, gave it back, albeit with a few small changes. There are some other good things I would like to acknowledge in this small business package such as the laws around franchising, and I commend Minister Billson for his work on this. But how cynical it is that the government took away packages for small business. When they brought down the axe on the mining tax, they brought down the axe on small business. That led to considerable uncertainty for small businesses in terms of how they go about planning their future. And now the government are trying to claim credit via a $25 million advertising campaign on national TV for a small business package that in dollar terms is exactly the same as the package put in place by the Greens and Labor. The government took away $5.4 billion from the budget last year and they have brought back $5.4 billion in a package this year.


Small businesses should be aware that they have been supported previously by the Labor-Greens government just as they are being supported by this government. Let's make that very clear. Politics is very cynical and it is very ruthless, but this package we are seeing here today, in dollar terms, is almost identical to what was taken off you last year by the very same government. It is good that we have tripartisan support—or wider than that if we include the crossbench—for stimulus for small business for productive investment and giving small businesses a leg-up with a two per cent tax cut to proprietary limited companies and a five per cent deduction for other entities. It is good that this country has come together to help support the small business sector, but we have to be very clear here today that all of us have contracted to helping small business in this country. If you want to be entirely correct about this, then you would say that small businesses are just as well off today as they were 12 months ago when this government axed the benefits that were provided under the mining tax legislation. Senator Cormann, would no doubt say that that was not properly funded and that that was a reason to take them away. But we argued at the time that they could have been well funded if we had just actually fixed the mining tax.


I learnt at university—and I used to teach my students this—that a good tax system taxes bad things such as pollution and health risks. A good tax levies taxes fairly across common pool resources that are owned by all of us such as superprofits on minerals. If necessary, and if it can, a good tax reduces tax on the good things such as work and effort. And that is what this is; this reduces a tax on the work of small business. What the Greens have always stood for is a very simple and basic philosophy that is well understood and well accepted by most economists: tax the bad things, the common pool resources, and reduce taxes on work and effort were possible. Of course, we also have the issue of bracket creep, which no doubt will need to be addressed by Senator Cormann in future.


This is the kind of thing we should be doing for small business. I would like to make it really clear here today that while we do have concerns—concerns that I would like to get on the record—around the $20,000 per item for only two years, we will be supporting the package. If we had had our way, we would have seen this capped at $20,000 per business, not per asset, and we would have liked to have seen it in perpetuity. We would also like to have seen a package in place—which I hope Senator Cormann will consider after two years—which helps small businesses have certainty, which helps them plan and which helps them get a productive return on their capital so that they can employ more Australians and create more wealth and prosperity, especially for our small communities, such as the one where I live in Tasmania. The Greens will be supporting this package.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:35):  Thank you to those senators who have contributed to the debate on these two important bills. The Australian economy is facing significant structural adjustments, and small businesses will play a very important role in that structural adjustment. Small businesses are adaptable, flexible and able to respond quickly and profitably to changing circumstances. Small businesses are often the entities that test and pioneer innovative ideas and business practices which are critical to future economic growth, job prospects and improved living standards. As such, the government's small business and jobs package that we are asked to vote on today is a central part of the government's long-term economic plan for stronger growth and more jobs and is designed to ensure that every Australian has the best possible opportunity to get ahead. 


All of this makes it particularly important that the policy settings that we have put in place support small business growth and innovation. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures No. 1) Bill 2015 amends the tax law to lower the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points to 28.5 per cent, potentially helping up to 780,000 incorporated small businesses to retain more earnings and improve their cash flow. The lower tax rate will apply from 1 July 2015 for incorporated small businesses. These amendments will also enable small companies to distribute surplus franking credits accumulated in previous years, reducing the tax their owners pay when they receive dividends. 


The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures No. 2) Bill 2015 amends the tax law to raise the immediate deductibility threshold under the small business simplified depreciation rules from $1,000 to $20,000 from 7.30 pm on 12 May 2015 budget night until 30 June 2017. This will allow small businesses to immediately deduct assets costing less than $20,000. Small businesses that purchase assets of $20,000 or more can use the simplified pooling arrangements and depreciate these assets at 15 per cent in the first year and 30 per cent per year thereafter. The usual lock-out rules will also be suspended for the same period so that businesses that may have opted out of those simplified depreciation rules in recent years can choose to use them now that the threshold will be significantly higher. 


These amendments will also provide a significant benefit to many primary producers with 97 per cent of primary producers being small businesses. To provide further assistance, the bill will also amend the tax law to allow all primary producers to access accelerated depreciation rates on fencing, water facilities and fodder storage assets from 7.30 pm on 12 May 2015. Primary producers can immediately deduct expenditure on fencing and water facilities such as dams, tanks, bores, irrigation channels, pumps, water towers and windmills, as well as fodder storage and assets such as silos and tanks used to store grain and other animal feed. These expenditures can be depreciated over three years. The amendments will improve farmers' cash flow, resilience and the need to track expenditure over time. Supporting small businesses and farmers in the hard times is essential to the success of the nation's economy at large. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:40):  The government does not expect any additional rorting as a result of this package because the eligibility requirements in terms of what is an allowable tax deduction or what is an allowable investment into an asset that can be depreciated remain the same. All we are doing with this package when it comes to the $20,000 immediate asset write-off is to accelerate the period within which the value of an asset can be depreciated. So we bring the tax deduction forward in effect and we are increasing the value of the threshold where that can take place, the value of the asset to $20,000 up from $1,000. All other things remain the same. So all of the compliance arrangements to prevent rorting, as Senator Whish-Wilson refers to, remain the same and the tax office would ensure compliance with the usual conditions that apply to applicable tax deductions for small business, and other businesses for that matter, in the usual way.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:42):  We went through this at great length during Senate estimates and the answer remains the same. The government obviously, as we always do, considers a whole range o2f information and obviously assesses and considers various options. We made a judgment that the $20,000 threshold was the appropriate threshold in the circumstances based on what was affordable within the budget and based on what would provide an appropriate incentive for small businesses with annual turnover of up to $2 million to encourage them to invest in their future success more Australians in the future.

I did ask this question at Senate estimates and there was no answer. I am interested to see what kinds of take-up rates we have had previously on $6,500 per item, was it a successful or popular measure and why the minister has confidence that there will be small businesses spending $20,000 per item.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  Unfortunately, we are passing this legislation today without that information. I would have presumed that a lot of thought had gone into setting that threshold and that you would have been confident at least in a large uptake. No doubt the fact that you are spending money on television advertisements to promote this is because you are trying to get the best possible uptake for this issue but considering it has been in place now for a number of years and small businesses are aware of asset thresholds and are aware of what they can and cannot depreciate, I still feel it is very important that you explain to us today why you believe this will be successful and why you believe it will stimulate the economy.

We are very confident that this measure, which invests in the future success of Australia's small businesses, will be successful but of course, as with all of these things, ultimately Senate estimates committees will have the opportunity down the track to review performance against forecasts, and against the objectives that we have outlined. I suspect that we will have that conversation at a later day. Having said that, I do not think that any of this should be an excuse to delay consideration of this bill; none of this should be an excuse to not facilitate the efficient passage of this very important package through the Senate today.

As I have indicated, the government has obviously made some assumptions in relation to the uptake of this measure in order to determine the impact on the budget bottom line. The government never considers second round effects—you only ever consider the first round effects in relation to these sorts of measures for budget purposes. The discussion that Senator Whish-Wilson wants to have here today is a discussion that is more appropriately had once the measure has been in place for a period and we can review how, essentially, this measure has performed against forecasts. That is not a conversation for today; that is a conversation for this time next year and even further down the track. As Senator Whish-Wilson has already indicated, this is a measure that is now proposed to be in place until 30 June 2017, so it is for a period of just over two years initially. At the end of that period we will be able to review how successful it has been in practice and we will be able to make informed judgements on what the appropriate way forward might be from that time onwards.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:50):  I just want to make a note here today that we wanted to raise these issues in the Senate rather than at Senate estimates, particularly at this committee stage before the bills are passed. We do have concerns about potential rorting and unintended consequences, which I outlined in my speech. We want to find out what the thinking was behind setting an essentially uncapped contribution to assets and a $20,000 per asset threshold, given that it has come up from $1,000 to $20,000. The Henry review recommended $10,000 and previously the Labor-Green government settled on $6½ thousand. Was it simply that the budget could not afford the bigger amount or was it that we actually think this is going to be a productive package for small business?


Senator Cormann, could you just quickly outline to us what the expected expenditure will be in the budget, particularly on the asset depreciation part of the measure?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:51):  The problem with the Labor-Green government and the Labor-Green coalition on the opposition side these days is that they do not understand the difference between revenue and expenditure. There will be no expenditure in relation to this because this is a measure which reduces tax. What this measure does is to leave people with more of their own cash today in order to encourage them to invest that money, which is their money, in their future success. And by targeting it towards profitable small businesses with an annual turnover of up to $2 million, obviously, you are encouraging profitable and successful small businesses to invest in their future success and encouraging them to pursue an ambition to be the most successful that they possibly can be. And by being more successful into the future those small businesses will be able to employ more Australians who, in turn, will be able to pursue opportunities to be successful and get ahead.


So, there is no expenditure linked to this measure. We have already indicated to you that from a tax office point of view the administration of this measure will be managed from within existing resources. So the impact on the budget bottom line, which is of course reflected in black and white in the budget papers, is an impact on revenue, because effectively it is a tax cut. The $20,000 immediate asset write-off brings forward the capacity to deduct tax and it helps improve cash flow for profitable small businesses.

Budget Paper No. 2 is where I would refer Senator Whish-Wilson to. The cost impact in terms of lower revenue from the $20,000 immediate asset depreciation measure is $1.8 billion and the overall impact of the small business tax cut is $3.3 billion over the forward estimates.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:54):  Obviously, that changes from year to year and, obviously, in order to be able to benefit from a tax deduction you have to have taxable income. If you provide somebody with a capacity to more quickly depreciate the value of an investment in an asset of up to $20,000, then obviously the only way that is going to be of benefit to you is if you have taxable income against which you can depreciate the value of those assets. As I have indicated in my summing up speech, potentially up to 780,000 incorporated small businesses will be able to benefit from various measures in this budget. All up, the small business package, targeted at small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million dollar, potentially will benefit—up to 96 per cent of businesses across Australia. Obviously, to a degree, their level of profitability is something we will review after the event, after this financial year is finalised.

Senator WHISH-WILSON

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:56):  That is a question, with all due respect, which ignores some of the practical realities. Obviously, in order to benefit from in particular the $20,000 immediate asset write-off you have to be profitable, you have to have a level of taxable income and obviously the businesses will have to meet the cost of the upfront investment. That is not a change compared to current circumstances except that of course we have increased the threshold that applies enabling people to still access that immediate asset write-off. Instead of having that apply to assets of up to $1,000 it now applies to assets of up to $20,000.  Fundamentally in terms of the architecture of the capacity to make that immediate deduction, nothing changes. The only thing that changes is the threshold up to which it applies.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:57):  Small businesses are obviously the same—last year, this year and next year. They are the best judges of what is a sensible commercial investment into their future success as a business. The government does not second guess the investment decisions of individual small businesses. Obviously individual small businesses, as they have in the past, will in the future have to make judgments on whether particular investments make sense for them, whether they can afford to make a particular investment. What we are doing here very simply is to provide an incentive for those businesses that are profitable with an annual return of up to $2 million, to immediately write-off an investment into their future success as a business to a value of up to $20,000. So all of the other commercial judgments that small businesses across Australia make on a daily basis will continue to have to be made. Nothing changes as a result of what the government is doing.

Senator Cormann said a moment ago that the revenue loss was expected to be in the vicinity of $1.8 billion forgone. Can the minister explain what are the assumptions underpinning the calculation of $1.8 billion as the cost to Treasury.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:59):  I would make the point again that these sorts of questions are the reason why we have a Senate estimates committee process and why, after the budget is delivered, for two weeks from nine in the morning until 11 o'clock at night, we sit down in however many different committees looking in very fine detail at every single one of the budget measures that the government has put forward—in order to drill down on these sorts of issues.


The important point to make here is that when we talk about a cost to the budget in terms of revenue forgone over the forward estimates, that is because of a bring-forward of a tax deduction that would have been able to be claimed in any event. Over time and eventually, businesses would have been able to claim the deduction for any such investment—but it would have been over a longer period of time. So I guess, over time, it will balance itself out.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (11:00):  Notwithstanding the budget estimates process, I am informed by my colleague that no amount of questioning necessarily generates answers in that process.


In terms of your assumption that the revenue loss will be 1.8 billion, you are saying that it is based on nothing other than the assumption that, if it were a longer period of time, that would be the cost and you have brought it forward. Given that this is now available to a much greater extent and in a shorter possible time, is there no change to your assumption about the fact that you will see a greater number of businesses take it up? And secondly, what are the risk factors you took into account for people starting a small business with a view to being able to try and take account of this? That is notwithstanding the fact that if they do not make a profit, then obviously they cannot write this off; that is clear. You are saying that your assumption is no change of behaviour in terms of small business. What I am asking is, did you take into account changed behaviour of small business by bringing it forward in the manner you have? And, if that is the case, why have you just calculated the same amount as you would have written off over time—or the same amount as it would have cost the government in expenditure over time?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (11:02):  Firstly, I have not said that we did not assume any change in behaviour; that is, with all due respect, Senator Milne seeking to verbal my previous answer. Of course we assume that there will be an increased level of investment as a result of this measure and into the future success of small businesses across Australia—that is the whole purpose of this measure. And so of course we have assumed that there would be an increased level of investment in future growth—future small-business-driven growth—as a result of the measure that we are discussing here today; otherwise why would we do it? In terms of some of the other questions: small business always has and always will have to make their own judgements, in terms of what makes sense for them as a commercial investment—a private investment—in their future success.


Senator Milne asked me about the uptake by new businesses: well, obviously, if a new business is immediately profitable so that it makes sense for them to access this sort of opportunity, good luck to them—that is great. We want more new businesses to be successful, and we want more new businesses to take advantage of this opportunity to be even more successful into the future. But I guess the inbuilt protection in the system, and the inbuilt protection in this measure, is this requirement to be profitable and to have a liability for a level of taxable income—in order to be able to beneficially access this particular initiative. So, subject to all those conditions—whether you are a new business or an old business, as long as you fulfil all of the requirements; as long as it makes sense for you to invest in a particular asset or piece of equipment to facilitate stronger success in the future, and as long as it is an allowable deduction in relation to all of the other requirements in our tax laws—then, obviously, we encourage small businesses across Australia to take advantage of this particular measure.

As a result of our efforts, over the first year in government we observed that the economy was now strengthening, that jobs growth was strengthening, that the budget position was improving, and that we were now on a credible and believable path back to surplus. We wanted to keep the momentum of stronger growth and stronger jobs growth going—which is why, as part of our focus on facilitating stronger growth in the context of significant structural adjustments in the mining sector and in various other parts of the economy, we made a judgement that this was the best way forward. And we also made a judgement on what was affordable in the context of the current budget position.

It is a key part of our long-term economic plan to strengthen growth, to create more jobs and to bring the budget back into surplus as soon as possible. What the government have been doing since we were elected in September 2013 is implementing our plan for stronger growth. That is why we got rid of the job-destroying carbon tax. That is why we got rid of the disastrous mining tax. That is why we have reduced red tape costs for business by more than $2 billion a year so far. That is why we are investing in economic-productivity-enhancing infrastructure. That is why we are working to improve market access for Australian businesses into key markets like China, South Korea and Japan. That is why we are pursuing an important package like this one: to encourage small business across Australia by having more of their own money at their disposal to invest; to encourage them to invest in their future success; to encourage them to become as successful as they possibly can be into the future so they can employ more Australians.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (11:11):  I have actually answered that question in many different ways over the last half hour or so. Small businesses in the past, small businesses today and small businesses into the future will be responsible for their own investment decisions, of course, their own decisions on how best to invest in their future success. As long as the various investments that they make qualify under the applicable tax laws as a tax deduction, then of course they will be able to claim that tax deduction. The government does not second-guess the commercial decisions made by millions of businesses across Australia. That is a matter for them. The reason we are pursuing this measure, the whole purpose of this measure, is to encourage profitable and successful small businesses to invest in their future success, to invest in being even more successful into the future. That is why the measure is structured as it is.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (11:12):  Firstly, one of the very encouraging economic green shoots that has been emerging in recent times under this government is that the number of bankruptcies is actually trending down. That is good news, which I am sure is welcomed by senators right across the chamber. The second point is a point that I have also previously made: obviously, in order to be able to benefit from a reduction in income tax or from a measure like the immediate asset write-off for investment in assets of up to $20,000, you need to be a profitable business. So for a new business to be able to access this sort of measure, the new business would have to be immediately profitable in order to be able to practically take advantage of either a tax deduction or the immediate asset write-off. If you do not pay any tax, obviously you are not going to be able to benefit from a tax deduction. You cannot cut tax for people or businesses who do not pay tax. So it is self-evident that this measure is squarely aimed at encouraging and incentivising the future success, the stronger success, of businesses that are already profitable.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Those questions focus on this government's attempts to avoid scrutiny across a range of different areas. It has become obvious to the Senate that, since its censure motion against Senator Brandis passed, his pattern of behaviour has only gotten worse. Let me run through, in the limited time that I have, some of those issues; I am sure that my colleagues will pick up the other matters raised. 


My question to Senator Brandis today focused on the Monis letter. He told us that on 27 May Katherine Jones—but indeed he himself—gave evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee estimates hearing. What happened next? Next Ms Bishop entered the House and accused both me and the shadow Attorney-General of asking contemptuous questions. This is not the first time that—either directly or indirectly—Senator Brandis has accused me of taking a contemptuous approach to something. So let us look more closely at what is occurring here. 


We heard today—and, in fact, Senator Brandis essentially blamed Mr Moraitis, his secretary, for this—that it took three full days for his department to satisfy him about a very basic inconsistency. When the inconsistency was pointed out to him on Monday, 1 June, he said that he wanted to understand the facts. Well, where are those facts, Senator Brandis? You did not give us those facts in answers to questions today, even though it took you three days to get them. You had to take further questions on notice because you do not have those basic facts in front of you. What has not been answered is why it took a full week after we were accused of asking contemptuous questions for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to be satisfied—sorry, to receive a correction. Indeed, we are far from satisfied, because we have had no opportunity to ask further questions. When we sought urgently to ask further questions within the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, government senators stalled. They will not make time available to deal with this issue, so we will need to investigate other means. 


Why won't government not face scrutiny on this? We suspect that there are issues with the other four documents that Mr Thawley referred to. Why was it that five documents were lost within the Attorney-General's Department? That is the critical issue. Why were four other documents made available to the Thawley review from other departments, when the lead department that is meant to have responsibility for national security could not provide those same documents? Where is the problem? Where is the logjam? 


We have been accused of asking contemptuous questions in relation to the Lindt siege. These are not contemptuous questions. These are questions about how well we will manage such things in the future and how well is the Attorney-General's Department assisting in identifying when we should be alert and when we should be responding to issues. We now know—unlike three weeks ago—that there were five documents that the Attorney-General's Department failed to identify. All that we got today from Senator Brandis was that he is essentially blaming his secretary for taking three days to come back to the parliament. It should not have taken three days from 1 June until 4 June to identify the facts behind the advice that you were given on 1 June. It brings back memories to me of the 'children overboard' affair: 'We have plausible deniability until the full facts are provided.' Why did the Attorney-General delay this so long?


Mr Moraitis had already been counselled by me on this occasion as to why it took one month to come back to the committee about the correction of whether he had lost his briefcase—why on earth it takes one month to correct the evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that, in fact, his briefcase had not been lost. This was the issue that Senator Brandis accused me of being contemptuous about—the nature of the evidence on the earlier occasion in relation to the Australia Human Rights Commission President. That is the other area where this government refuses to face scrutiny or, indeed, respond to a serious censure motion of this Senate. 


The pattern of behaviour of this Attorney has only become worse. We saw it again today in the discussion over payments to people smugglers. How can he stand behind operational reasons or operational factors on an important question that all in the public want to have clarified? (Time expired)

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:06):  I want to respond to all three areas that the Labor Party have raised in their questioning of ministers today. Senator Collins touched on two of them. If this is the best the Labor Party have got, they are in serious trouble. Let us look at each of them. Senator Collins has come here on this issue around the letter and the best attack that she could make was that it took three days to get to the bottom of the matter. That seems to be at the heart of the criticism from Senator Collins. I say to Senator Collins and to other senators opposite that, when it comes to national security, our record is one we are very proud of. It is an issue we treat with the utmost seriousness.


From time to time, as those opposite would know because they experienced it in government, incorrect information is provided, inadvertently, by officials. In this case, that was acknowledged and there was an effort to get to the bottom of it and ensure that the correct answer was given. So Senator Collins's great attack appears to be that it took a few days to ensure we got the accurate information and got it to the parliament. That is not a legitimate criticism; it is not a decent criticism. I think Senator Collins suggested that Senator Brandis was trying to blame his secretary. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, in getting to the bottom of it and coming back promptly, I think Minister Brandis would be very satisfied with the actions of his secretary. We could compare all sorts of instances under the previous government in terms of coming back and correcting the record, in some cases, on multiple occasions. And we would compare very favourably. But I come back to the central point and that is that we take our national security responsibilities very seriously.


What we have seen from those opposite on this issue is simply an attempt to play petty politics and petty point-scoring politics on what is a very serious issue. We will continue to work diligently, to ensure that the terrorist threat that this nation faces is dealt with in a strong and effective way. I believe that is what we are doing at the moment, but of course we need to be ever vigilant on these issues.


Other issues raised were around people smugglers and, of course, we had the reference to Professor Triggs. Those two of course are related, because one of the reasons that there have been criticisms of Professor Triggs by this government is that we saw the decision to launch an inquiry into the issue around children in detention at a time when this government had massively reduced the number of children in immigration detention. Professor Triggs was at an event today where I heard her reference 126 children now in detention. I do not know whether that is the exact up-to-date number but it was the number that Professor Triggs quoted today. That compares to around 2,000 at the height of the Labor Party's failed border protection policies. I note that there have been some protests in recent times—I note that this is Refugee Week—and I hope that at those protests there will be an acknowledgment, as they protest immigration detention policies and as they protest children in detention, that under this government we have seen a massive and substantial reduction in the number of children in detention with a view to there being none, as there was at the end of the Howard government.


So it is important that we put facts on the table when it comes to these matters and that we compare our record with the record of those opposite, who are asking the questions. When it comes to Professor Triggs's intervention, which senators opposite asked about, one reason that those on the government side do not have confidence in Professor Triggs is that she did not take it seriously enough to investigate children in detention, when in fact there were up to 2,000 under the former Labor government, but saw fit to investigate at a time when the coalition were dramatically reducing that number and dealing with the serious issues we had inherited. 


In fact, we were stopping the boats, something that those opposite said we could not do. Those opposite said that we could not stop the boats. We have and there have been significant benefits as a result. One of those benefits is that we have seen a significant reduction in the number of children in detention. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:12):  I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this take note of answers debate this afternoon because Senator Brandis's responses to questions without notice today epitomise what this government is. It is pompous, arrogant and out of touch. Senator Brandis showed all of those traits today. Senator Brandis is the Attorney-General, whose role is to defend the integrity of statutory public officials such as Professor Triggs and yet what does he do? He attacks that public official. Under Senator Brandis's watch the integrity of our system of governance in this country is declining badly because Senator Brandis is more intent on the politics of what he can do and not on what are the legal and constitutional issues that he should be looking after. 


Then there was the arrogance of Senator Brandis during Senate estimates when he was reading bush poems, when serious issues were being discussed. I looked to see what kind of bush poem epitomises Senator Brandis. The one that I found was Banjo Paterson's Mulga Bill. Mulga Bill was a man who claimed he was excellent at everything and he was going to be an excellent cyclist. Mulga Bill was full of pride, arrogance and self-delusion. Who does that remind you of? It certainly reminds me of Senator Brandis. Mulga Bill got on the bike and, as Banjo Paterson said, he did it with a 'lordly pride'. He lost control of the bike 


At the end of the poem, it says:


And then as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek


It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dean Man's Creek.


Well, Senator Brandis is in Dead Man's Creek, because Dead Man's Creek is where failed ministers go. That is why we have Mark Kenny in The Sydney Morning Herald saying that George Brandis 'could be the first man overboard'. And why shouldn't he be the first man overboard in this government? He has failed as the Attorney-General to do what an Attorney-General should do.


We have had these lofty speeches about looking after the security of this country. Senator Brandis was asleep at the wheel on national security at a time when we were told that we were under the highest threat in the history of this country. He has failed to put in proper procedures and protocols to deal with suspicious correspondence. His office received a letter from Man Haron Monis only weeks after the Prime Minister stood up and told all Australians that they had to be more alert and to refer everything suspicious they saw to relevant security agencies. This was correspondence from a known felon. He was on bail in relation to charges of violent assault. He had been in litigation with the Commonwealth and our highest court. He wanted to make contact with the head of ISIS and then referred to him as the 'Caliph', which is a term used by supporters of the group that this Prime Minister refers to as the 'death cult'. This was anything but routine correspondence, as claimed by Senator Brandis. This was a letter stamped as routine by Senator Brandis's office and referred to his department for a pro forma response. To make matters worse, it was not even referred to ASIO or the Australian Federal Police.


The Mulga Bill of the Senate, Senator Brandis, should not hang around and wait to get the flick. He should have the courage to say, 'I have failed; I have let the country down,' and he should just go away, onto the back bench, and read poetry—read Mulga Bill. (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:17):  I rise also to take note of answers and, particularly, the opposition's assertions about the scrutiny of the acting leader here. This is a very serious issue—the Lindt cafe siege and the security of this country are things that no Attorney-General would ever intend to stint on. I am sure it was not the former Attorney-General's intention to do that either, but it is interesting that Mr Dreyfus, the former Attorney-General of this country, was asleep at the wheel, if you could put it that way, on a national security issue. His record on the protection of our borders is nothing short of incompetent. He has tried to score a cheap political point out of a national tragedy and he ignores the fact that the matter was dealt with in exactly the same way that it would have been under him as the previous Attorney-General.


The letter was handled in accordance with long-established Attorney-General's Department procedures. Those procedures did not identify anything untoward in the letter. Those senators opposite—as do I and my staff—open mail every day in this place and at electorate offices. You attract the very highest level of intellect and capacity in the representations made to you, but you also receive some fairly crazy stuff. Mr Dreyfus also avoids the fact that the letters from Monis were sent to him as well as to other Labor ministers, including then Prime Minister Gillard and then Attorney-General McClelland. That is all missing from this debate, isn't it?



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator EDWARDS:
  This is about taking a national tragedy and using it for cheap political points. The director-general of ASIO, a person of impeccable credentials, has examined the letter and advised that it had been dealt with in an appropriate way—




Senator Conroy:
  Can't blame the security services!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator EDWARDS:
  by being referred to the Attorney-General's Department. Despite all the demonstrations and shrillness from over there, we have an opposition who are, indeed, somewhat missing.




Senator Conroy:
  You can't hide behind the security services.




Senator EDWARDS:
  This is about national security. I note Senator Conroy chipping in; at the time, he was the Minister for Defence.




Senator Conroy:
  No, I wasn't.




Senator EDWARDS:
  He is now the shadow minister for defence. He sat in the cabinet room while the previous government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, failed to do anything about developing a submarine shipbuilding contract—for six years. Not only did they fail to do that for six years; they took $16.8 billion from the Defence budget. This government will always do the right thing by the Australian people and will act within the law. When it comes to Operation Sovereign Borders, we will operate within the confines of the security of those operations.


Before I finish, I put on the record that, on 25 July 2012, the former Prime Minister Mr Kevin Rudd said:


The robust principle of all prime ministers and foreign ministers, past and present, is that we don't comment on intelligence matters.


Furthermore, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr, said on Sky News on 28 May 2013:


I won't comment on matters of intelligence and security for the obvious reason—we don't want to share with the world and potential aggressors what we know about what they might be doing and how they might be doing it.


I suggest that they get on with some more serious policy matters on the other side and stop getting in the way of a government that is doing a very good job.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:22):  In speaking to this motion to take note of answers I rise to defend the freedom of speech of community legal centres, a sector in our community that is performing very valuable work on behalf of the vulnerable in our society. I do not need to remind honourable senators that approximately 250,000 people every year help this sector's campaigns for reform on a range of issues, including domestic violence, child abuse and other issues. It was reported recently, and it prompted the question to the Attorney-General, that the sector is worried about gag clauses being contained in agreements which are being developed between federal and state governments.


Whilst the Attorney-General in his response has denied that these are in fact gag clauses, he has confirmed in his response that the funding that is going to be provided to the CLCs is not to be used for advocacy, and he indicated that community legal centres could pursue 'any causes they like', in his words. But in his words the resources are most urgently needed elsewhere, other than in the field of advocacy. This is I think a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of community legal centres and the struggle for justice which has taken place in this country over a number of decades in which our CLCs have been at the forefront. The extensive experience of these organisations at the very front line of service delivery means that they are often able to provide unique insights and contributions to policy development in their areas of expertise. And as organisations are in close contact with disadvantaged Australians through public advocacy they provide another important avenue to justice by giving a voice to those who are often less able to advocate for themselves.


Lawyers at community legal centres are in a unique position to learn through real-world experience what is working and what is not in important areas such as consumer protection law, prohibitions on predatory lending practices, and laws to protect women and children against domestic violence. I know that the Attorney-General has an interest in those areas, so it is somewhat concerning that this valuable work is being curtailed by the funding approach of the Commonwealth.


But now of course in addition to the brutal funding cuts to legal services that this government has imposed since coming to office the Abbott government has directed that community legal centres must not spend Commonwealth funds on advocacy or law reform work. As I have indicated, I believe that this is a misconception of the role of CLCs which has occurred over a number of decades, in three particular areas. Firstly, Senator Brandis appears to draw a peculiar distinction between the needs of individual clients and the needs of the broader community. So, CLCs are self-evidently intended to serve their communities as a whole. And there are longstanding relationships with other organisations and they have the understanding to pursue issues on behalf of their client base. Secondly, Senator Brandis's argument that funding for advocacy necessarily comes at the expense of so-called actual clients is in my view deeply misconceived. And of course it could be said that we are not talking about a zero-sum game in this area. Casework and advocacy are mutually reinforcing. The cumulative experience that CLCs gain in their casework informs their advocacy. CLCs become specialists in the types of legal problems that afflict their clients and their communities. And the third argument I would put is that the government has failed to understand that CLCs are not just a particular sort of charity intended to provide free legal advice or representation. Those who founded the CLC movement saw systemic injustice in Australian law and society, and they intended to change that system. The legal assistance sector as a whole will be the poorer if we allow them to be restricted the limited purpose. CLCs have made a contribution to law reform disproportionate to their modest size and funding and the expert advocacy of community lawyers has indisputably made our legal system fairer.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:33):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 26 May 2015, of the Honourable Leslie Royston Johnson, AM, former minister and member for Hughes, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


The Honourable Les Johnson was born in Sydney on 22 November 1924. He was educated at Belmore and Sydney Technical College, and in 1939, at the age of 14, he was apprenticed as a fitter and turner, going out to work at such a young age to help the family finances in the grips of the Great Depression. He also studied business administration at night school and became an organiser for the Federated Clerks Union in 1945. He then worked for the Red Cross, recruiting blood donors and setting up clubs for teenagers in inner Sydney. In 1948 he married Peggy and they had three children. In 1954, Les Johnson became proprietor of the local general store and newsagency and experienced firsthand the challenges of small business. In 1953, he was elected to the Sutherland Shire Council and he held office until 1956. Then, in 1955 he was the successful Labor Party candidate for the newly created federal electorate of Hughes. Thus began a parliamentary career that would span almost three decades.


He was re-elected at the three subsequent elections and then defeated in a close contest in 1966 by Don Dobie. However, he successfully recontested Hughes in 1969 and retained the seat until his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1984. Les Johnson was appointed to the ministry in 1972 upon the election of the Whitlam government and given the portfolio of Housing. He subsequently held the portfolios of Works, Housing and Construction, and Aboriginal Affairs. As one of the ministers in the Whitlam government, Les Johnson therefore partook in one of the most dramatic chapters in Australian political history. With his passing, there remain only five of the 27 men sworn in as members of the Whitlam government on 19 December 1972.


Mr Johnson had a lifelong and strong interest in Indigenous affairs. He was President of the Aboriginal Children's Advancement Society from 1963 to 1972, parliamentary representative on the council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies from 1976 to 1977, and he helped establish and operate the Kirinari hostels, which provided accommodation for Aboriginal boys attending high school. He was Opposition Whip from 1977 to 1983. When he was Opposition Whip he suggested that the term 'whip'—which, of course, has an English origin—should be replaced with a more Australian title. His proffered suggestions of 'boundary rider' and 'jackaroo' were not taken up.


On the election of the Hawke government, in 1983, Les Johnson chose not to stand for the caucus elections to the ministry. He was instead elected by the House as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees and served in that office with distinction throughout the first term of the Hawke government. In the 1984 election he retired from the House and was appointed the Australian high commissioner in Wellington. Sadly, his time in New Zealand was cut short by family illness and he and his wife chose to return to Australia in 1987. He became chairman of the Australia New Zealand Foundation in 1989 and held that post for eight years. In 1990 he was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for parliamentary and public service and, in particular, for service to the Aboriginal community, and he was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.


With the death of Malcolm Fraser, earlier this year, Les Johnson was the last of those elected to the House of Representatives in 1955 to have survived. The Honourable Les Johnson's career was one dedicated to community and public service. Sadly, his daughter Sally died shortly after the family's return from New Zealand and his wife of many years, Peggy, herself died in 2002. Les remarried, to Marion, and so to her, his surviving children, Grant and Jenny, and their families, on behalf with the government, I offer our most sincere sympathies today.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:38):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to speak on this motion of condolence on the passing of the Honourable Leslie Royston Johnson AM. The loss of Les Johnson is a sad one and I convey, at the outset, our thoughts for his family at this time.  Of course, Mr Johnson was also part of the Labor family and there are many associated with our movement who feel his passing especially keenly.


Originally a fitter and turner and an engineer, Les Johnson served as a shop steward with the Amalgamated Engineering Union and became an organiser with the Federated Clerks Union and a councillor on the Sutherland Shire Council before being elected to the House of Representatives as the inaugural member for Hughes in 1955. He had also been a proprietor of a general store and worked for the Red Cross recruiting blood donors and establishing clubs for teenagers in the inner suburbs of Sydney—all of this before the age of 30! On his election he was the youngest member of the House of Representatives at that time and—as the acting leader of the government has noted—he was the last surviving member of the 'class of 1955' following the passing of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser earlier this year.


The 1955 federal election was not a happy one for the Australian Labor Party, with the party losing a net 10 seats in the second election we contested with 'Doc' Evatt as leader. The swing against Labor was nearly five per cent and Johnson found himself in parliament at a time when the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, was at the height of his powers. With a government majority of 28 in the House of Representatives, it was a depressing time to be on the opposition benches. Further, it was a time when the split within Labor was taking its full effect. Not only did Les Johnson suffer the miserable years of opposition but also he further suffered the despair of defeat in the 1966 election, when the Labor primary vote fell to less than 40 per cent under Arthur Calwell and he lost his seat.


In an election dominated by the Vietnam War, which at that time was still widely supported amongst the Australian population, Johnson did not compromise his strong anti-war principles. As someone who had witnessed the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, in my home state of South Australia—without protective clothing—as well as having visited Vietnam during the early years of the conflict he was well-placed to offer a critique of the 'barrage of death and destruction' and 'dreadful carnage'—using his words—that he regarded the war to be. 


Fortunately, he was re-elected in 1969 following a seven per cent swing towards Labor, under the leadership of Gough Whitlam who occupied the nearby seat of Werriwa in Sydney's south-west. Many of Whitlam's policies resonated not just with Johnson's electors but also with Johnson himself. He would go on to play a pivotal role in implementing Labor's nation-building agenda and its policies of reconciliation with our first Australians following the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. He served as Minister for Housing, Minister for Works, Minister for Housing and Construction and also as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He worked alongside—and occasionally in conflict with—the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, another of our recently departed, the late Tom Uren.


Just as housing policy is a topical matter of discussion today, so too it was then. In his first speech, Johnson spoke of the difficulties that faced young couples looking to enter the housing market and, as minister, he pursued policies aimed at making 'dream homes' come true. In an article in early 1973 he spoke of beginning with the belief that the biggest social injustice in Australia is the economic barrier to housing. He wanted 'to get the right kind of people into the right kinds of houses in the right kind of environment at the lowest possible cost.'


As with housing, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Leslie Johnson was fulfilling the interests and pursuits he had been engaged in earlier in his political career. He had been president of the Aboriginal Children's Advancement Society from 1963 to 1972, raising funds for Aboriginal peoples in the process, and would be present when Gough Whitlam poured sand into the hands of Vincent Lingiari in 1975. Sadly, of course, like so many other talented and committed individuals, his service was cut short following the dismissal of the Whitlam government.


Back in opposition, after that time, he served as Opposition Whip and following the election of the Hawke government, in 1983, was Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees before leaving parliament the following year. The Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate has referenced Les Johnson's interesting suggestions that the title of whip be replaced by boundary rider or jackaroo—in many ways proving that the Whitlam government ministers did not lose their reforming zeal after losing office.


Having been the youngest member of parliament, when he arrived in this place in 1955, he was the 'father of the House' when he left the parliament. His place as member for Hughes was taken by Robert Tickner, who would himself become Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in the Hawke and Keating governments, and is now—in another link with Johnson—the chief executive of the Australian Red Cross.


Les Johnson continued to serve Australia, notably as High Commissioner to New Zealand from 1984 to 1987, and then as chair of the Australia New Zealand Foundation from 1989 to 1997. Labor mourns the passing of Les Johnson, a great contributor to our nation, and we again extend our sympathies to his wife, family and friends.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:44):  I stand to associate The Nationals with this condolence motion for the Honourable Les Johnson, AM, a devoted champion of the Left. Born in 1924, Johnson was the last of the 1955 cohort who entered federal parliament. He was the father of the House when we left in 1983. Another Whitlam minister, at one time Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, is being farewelled. He said to Malcolm Fraser not very long ago: 'We're an endangered species.' Malcolm Fraser was another one of the 1955 group. Approaching 60 myself, and born a year later, it is unsurprising.


Les Johnson was with Gough Whitlam when he poured soil through the hands of Vincent Lingiari, symbolising the handing back of land to the Gurindji people, in 1975. This was not only one of the most defining images that, I think, we all remember about Gough's prime ministership but a defining moment of when, if we look back and see, the return of lands and the respect of the connection between lands and Aboriginal people actually started. He was at the British bomb testing at Maralinga—and, as we have just heard, without protective clothing. He visited Vietnam during that war, always railing against the United States.


I think it was Les Johnson's unique background that explains his particular drive for politics. His father died when young Les was only six. Four brothers and sisters grew vegetables for sale during the Depression. He left school at 14 to earn money to help keep the family. It was a tough life, but Les got a rare education through the local gospel hall in the Sydney Domain, where he saw the speakers and joined in himself. A boy preacher on the streets of Sydney, it was all about words and ideas and performance.  On the practical side, Les was apprentice to a fitter and joiner, and signed up for the ALP when he was just 15. He went to technical college at night, but it did not take him long to become a shop steward for the Amalgamated Engineering Union. He continued his interest in words by buying a book on the art of debating and writing poetry. It must have been obvious that here was a young man who was going to make his mark.


During the war he became a man of the house when his two older brothers went off to war. There was a lot of responsibility on his young shoulders, including with being the local air raid warden for Enfield. His Labor Left moulding continued with time with the Eureka Youth League and as an organiser with The Federated Clerks Union of Australia. No doubt wanting to put his beliefs into action, and move from words to something more tangible, Johnson went to work with the Red Cross, recruiting blood donors and setting up clubs for teenagers in the inner Sydney suburbs. He showed a passion for his local area through all his life—the Sutherland Shire was the hub. He established a Council for Social Services and chaired the Gymea Progress Association. Johnson was also a president of the Aboriginal Children's Advancement Society and set up the Gymea branch of the ALP. He was involved with local government in the Southerland Shire and ran the local general store.


In 1955, Johnson contested the preselection for Labor in the new set of Hughes. There was a wide range of contestants—a field of 11. He came up through the middle. It was an amazing achievement at a young age with a poor background. They bank actually would not lend him money for a house, so he built it itself. This perhaps accounts for his passion for public housing, with a future that was going to enable him to do something about. He was never challenged for his Labor candidacy for Hughes, which he represented from 1955 to 1983—accept for the 1966 Vietnam election, when Labor's vote collapsed. He, meanwhile, worked for a chief of staff for Lionel Murphy and ramped up local support. He won the next election, in 1969, with 61 per cent of the primary vote. From here, high offices awaited the former boy preacher. Following Labor's win in the 1972 election, he was appointed to the Whitlam ministry as Minister for Housing. In October 1973, he was appointed to the additional portfolio of works. These portfolios fitted in with his great enthusiasm for public housing. Record levels were built in 1973 and 1974.


In 1975, Johnson became the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time of the birth of land rights, led by Gough Whitlam. In June of 1975 the racial discrimination bill was enacted, outlawing discrimination on the grounds of race, enabling Australia to ratify the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I understand that there is, in fact, a motion on the books today. We should recall that the genesis was, in fact, with Mr Johnson. The 1972 Woodward Royal Commission into land rights of the Northern Territory ultimately led to Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and, from there, to successful claims all over Australia, and to the eventual overturning of the concept of terra nullius, in the Mabo case, in 1992. The Whitlam legacy of the way we engage with Indigenous Australians today is an integral part of political life. This was a new political climate that Les Johnson was part of.



Johnson used his superb local organising skills to keep his seat in the 1975 and 1977 elections, which kept Labor in opposition. He became Chief Opposition Whip. When Hawke came to power in 1983, Johnson became the Deputy Speaker, not wanting to take a ministry. On his retirement, in December 1983, he was appointed as Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand—an awful long way from preaching on street corners. The Nationals send our condolences to Les Johnson's wife and family. They should be very proud of his achievements.

Senator WRIGHT:
  Today on the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, it still stands as a powerful symbol for the rule of law and against the arbitrary use of power. Most importantly, the Magna Carta affirmed that no-one was above the law so that all authorities—even despotic kings—were subject to and beneath the law. It also prohibited the arbitrary and illegal detention of people. How alarming it is, then, to have witnessed how often this parliament has passed legislation that undermines these very principles in recent years. On this significant anniversary, we should recommit to defending the tenor of the Magna Carta not only in principle but in practice, as we consider the laws that we make here.

More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:05):  Speaking about the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam said:


The main sufferers in Australian society—the main victims of social deprivation and restricted opportunity—have been the oldest Australians on the one hand and the newest Australians on the other. We stand in their debt. By this Act we shall be doing our best to redress past injustice and build a more just and tolerant future.


Gough Whitlam's words are just as relevant today as they were 40 years ago.


The Racial Discrimination Act was given assent on 11 June 1975. It was then, and remains today, a landmark piece of legislation. The act prohibits racial discrimination in our nation. It makes it unlawful to discriminate against people based on their race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. It makes it unlawful to impair any person's human rights or freedoms in the political, economic, social or cultural spheres, or in other fields of public life. It prohibits acts of racial vilification in public, including through the media, and it provides legal remedies against acts of discrimination.


The Racial Discrimination Act implemented the obligations which Australia took on when we ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It paved the way for many significant milestones in contemporary Australian history. The validity of the act was challenged by Queensland's Bjelke-Petersen government, leading to the High Court's Koowarta decision affirming the Commonwealth's external affairs power—an important and far-reaching decision in Australian constitutional law. The Racial Discrimination Act has played a significant role in ensuring the native title rights of Australia's indigenous people were recognised—more than 200 years after Europeans arrived on this land.


In 1982 Eddie Mabo and fellow representatives of the Meriam people commenced legal proceedings against the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. They sought declarations that they held traditional native title over the lands and waters of the Murray Islands, in the Torres Strait. The Bjelke-Petersen government responded in 1985 by passing the Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act, a piece of legislation that retrospectively extinguished native title rights without compensation. The High Court then held that this piece of legislation was invalid, because it was inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. That decision, in the Mabo No. 1 case, opened the way for the High Court's ruling in Mabo No. 2 that:


…the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands.


It was a ruling that overturned the legal doctrine that Australia was terra nullius—an empty land—when the British arrived. It was a decision that led to the recognition of native title in Australia, and it would not have happened but for the Racial Discrimination Act. The year after that landmark decision, the Keating government's Native Title Act was passed in this parliament. It is an example of how fundamental reforms work their transformative effects on society. It is an example of how progressive reforms can build on one another, and how tackling injustice in one area extends the remit of justice into new spheres.


But it is important to remember that this act has not only contributed to historic breakthroughs like Mabo and the native title legislation—the big news stories that have been in our headlines in years gone past. Every day of the week, in every community around this country, this legislation protects ordinary people from the poison of prejudice, bigotry and discrimination. Last week Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, launched the book I'm Not Racist But … 40 years of the Racial Discrimination Act.In the book, he gives three examples of discrimination:


A man of Sri Lankan background works at a warehouse but finds other employees of Anglo-Celtic background receiving better hours and pay rises; his co-workers frequently subject him to derogatory racial comments and harassment.


Second:


An aboriginal man makes arrangements to rent a room in a boarding house but is told by the caretaker when he arrives: 'We don't take anyone who is aboriginal because there have been problems in the past. This is management policy.


Third:


A woman of Asian background comes across an anti-immigration website on the internet: using inflammatory language involving racial epithets, it encourages people to abuse and attack Asians they encounter on the street.


As Commissioner Soutphommasane explains, these examples are drawn from actual complaints made under the Racial Discrimination Act. They are real life examples of what still does happen in Australia. In each case, the act provided a remedy: damages for the abused worker; an apology and compensation for the Aboriginal boarder; and the taking down of the abusive anti-Asian website.


There are some, including some in this place, who have tried to argue that the Racial Discrimination Act is some kind of gag on people simply expressing their opinions. I suspect that is the view of those of those who almost certainly have never experienced racial prejudice or discrimination. Speaking 20 years ago, on the 20th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act, Prime Minister Paul Keating made that point eloquently:


Legislation like this does not spring from any utopian vision of society or human nature. It springs from recognition of the less than perfect reality. And it doesn't spring from a wish to punish the perpetrators of racism, but from a desire to protect its victims.


I think that this is the essential point: we come to understand the necessity for this kind of legislation when we put ourselves in the position of the victims of racial discrimination or vilification or worse.


I would ask members and senators of this parliament to heed those words: put yourself in the position of the victims of racial discrimination or vilification, or worse.


The symbolic message sent by the Racial Discrimination Act goes well beyond words in legislation. This act sent a message to Australian society that our parliament believes that discrimination on the basis of someone's race, colour or national or ethnic origin is unacceptable. It shows any Australian who experiences racial vilification or discrimination that we stand beside you. We understand the pain that you, or your children or your grandchildren experience when you are victimised simply because of the colour of your skin or because of your ethnic origin.


In large part, the history of this act has been characterised by a measure of bipartisanship between the main political parties. In large part, that is its history. In large part, this act has a bipartisan history. It is a shame that in the past few years we have seen a break from that shared acknowledgement in this place of the importance of the Racial Discrimination Act.


We in this nation enjoy a remarkably tolerant, democratic and multicultural nation. We have chosen, over our history, to give collective expression to the values that underpin that tolerant, democratic and multicultural nation. The achievement of that fact is not by accident; it is because we have seen community leaders collectively articulate values consistent with this. We have given collective expression to these values in many ways, and I say to this place that the Racial Discrimination Act is one of these. It is a collective expression of our Australian values, a collective expression that Australians ought not be discriminated against on the basis of their race, and it is our collective agreement that we will, together, stand against bigotry and prejudice. For 40 years this act has been part of our collective expression of these important Australian values. I look forward to many more anniversaries of this act into the future.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:14): It is significant that on the same day that we came together at the reception this morning in the Great Hall in this place to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta—the 'great charter'—we are here today to discuss and to recognise the Racial Discrimination Act 40 years on. I would like to associate myself with many of the comments made by Senator Wong in opening this debate. One of the absolutely fundamental pillars of the Magna Carta which has survived through the 800 years to today is the fact that—then—no man; I will say, no person, is above the law. The Racial Discrimination Act is a most interesting piece of legislation, which draws attention to that precept of Magna Carta from so many years ago.


It was on 13 February 1975 that the then attorney-general in the Whitlam government, the late Kep Enderby, introduced the Racial Discrimination Bill to the House of Representatives. It was passed in June 1975, received its royal assent on 11 June that year, and came into force on 31 October—so it is appropriate that we are recognising this on 15 June, the first sitting day following the fortieth anniversary of its assent on 11 June 1975. Acting Deputy President, what does the act prescribe against? It is against the law to discriminate in areas including employment, and when seeking employment—and we heard an example given by Senator Wong of the Sri Lankan gentleman. It is against the law to discriminate, for example, in land, housing or accommodation, when buying or renting. It is against the law to discriminate in the provision of goods and services when buying an article or a service, applying for credit, or using banking services; when seeking assistance from government departments, from legal services or from doctors in hospitals; or when attending recreational or catering facilities such as restaurants, hotels or entertainment venues. The act prohibits discrimination in access to places and facilities for use by the public—parks, libraries, government offices, et cetera—and I want to come back to that in the context of our country contrasting with another. In advertising for a job, stating that people from certain ethnic groups cannot apply for a job or join a trade union, and certain other offensive behaviour, will be found to be discriminatory, if it is likely to 'offend, insult, humiliate, or intimidate'. That is an area that has been the subject of debate in this place and no doubt will go on to be further debated in the future.


It is interesting that the act does require certain behaviours by people. But the way that it has been framed in the first instance is not about punishing racism but about protecting people against prejudice—that is, that conciliation rather than coercion be the overriding principle. It is also interesting that, in the 40 years that the act has been in operation, and with more than 6,000 complaints having been resolved, as of last year only three per cent were required to be finalised in the Human Rights Commission. As we all know—and as was alluded to by the previous speaker—in the time that has elapsed since 1975, the states and territories around this country have themselves enacted anti-discrimination legislation. Here in the Commonwealth, we have extended the legislative framework to include sex discrimination, disability discrimination, and discrimination based on age—all of which are critically important.


I mention Australia's situation with regard to discrimination and I contrast it with that of my experience residing in the United States of America, where discrimination across state boundaries and between different states in the United States is there for everyone to see. I particularly refer to African Americans. My experience teaching at the University of California was that African Americans were evident in the university system as undergraduates, as graduate students and as academics, who would certainly have been housed in the same housing with equivalent levels of wealth and with equivalent levels of access to society—and then I drove from California to Lexington, Kentucky, where I had the opportunity as an academic visiting that great university for three months, and I saw the absolutely radical difference in the approach of the wider community to African Americans in that location, and I saw also that African Americans themselves in their own attitudes were absolutely profound in their difference. Then we look at Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and—for those people who have visited that city and have become aware of the problems that have occurred as a result of discrimination, I can only say this: in what we have observed in Australia in contrast to the United States, how different has been the story. I would like to draw on the comments of our Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, when he was marking the anniversary on 19 February this year—and he is speaking here of those who put together the Racial Discrimination Act in the first place. He said:


Its authors, advocates and early administrators foresaw its critical role in guiding a maturing nation. They were among the pioneers of Australian human rights law for whom we can be forever grateful for their unapologetic insistence on the formal recognition of dignity, respect, equality and freedom as fundamental human liberties.


He went on to make the point that this is not a static process. It is an emerging and evolving process. He makes the point that those with responsibility in this area must have the ability to intelligently read and respond to changes in Australian society and to the attitudes of those of us who make up Australian society. 


In the Governor-General's presentation that day, he referred to the statement of Martin Luther King: 


… it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated … the law may not change the heart, but it can restrain the heartless.


I think it is a fantastic circumstance that in this country we do have legislation which, of course, commits us to freedom, which enables us to enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the other traditional rights and liberties that we have all come to expect. In this country we want to reserve the right to speak our mind. But of course, at the same time, we must beware of our responsibilities. There is no place for racism among any in the Australian community. We recognise in this country that to enjoy all of our rights and freedoms people must be able to do so free from discrimination, and that our policies are designed to secure these objectives.


In the few minutes left, I want to draw the attention of the chamber to a term that we use very widely, and that is the term 'bigot'. Indeed, I wonder whether all of us who use it and throw it around have an understanding of the definition of a bigot. It is simply a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief or opinion; a person whose intolerance is devoted towards the opinions and prejudices of somebody else. I make that point because, if you were to take some of the robust discussion and the differences across this chamber at different times, a person looking in from the outside might accuse us of being guilty of the same.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:24):  I rise to contribute to this motion on the 40th anniversary of the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act in June 1975. The enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act was a critical turning point in Australia's history because of the role it played in signposting Australia's commitment to protecting and promoting what were internationally recognised and universal human rights. The Racial Discrimination Act was the first time that Australia had directly incorporated the language of an international human rights treaty into our domestic law. This was then upheld by the seminal High Court Koowarta case, which confirmed that the Commonwealth has external affairs powers that can be in the Constitution that can be used to implement our international obligations in domestic legislation. That decision then paved the way for other seminal legislation to protect against discrimination on other grounds such as gender, disability or age. Without those developments, it is unlikely that we would then have had the other nation-defining High Court decisions such as the Tasmanian dams case or the Mabo case. 


It is true to say that the Racial Discrimination Act did not have an easy birth. There were strong debates about whether Australia needed laws to protect against racism, even arguments that suggested that if racism existed in Australia it should be valued as a type of character-building experience for minorities. But pass it did, and now, here, 40 years on, the Racial Discrimination Act still raises controversy and strong opinions, as we have seen in relation to attempts to remove or amend provisions such as section 18C. The principles of equality, fairness and respect for human rights embodied in the Racial Discrimination Act still require vigilant defence and protection. So, along with many others around Australia, I have strongly defended the current version of section 18C. I have been motivated by the many Australians who have shared with me their very personal stories of racial abuse and discrimination, sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle, but often devastating in its impacts, and not defensible. I have also been motivated by the many, many Australians who see section 18C as part of a broader legal and moral commitment to racial equality and respect that speaks about who we are and what we stand for as a people. 


So it is that we must use these people and their voices to inspire us. The Greens will continue to speak out and amplify those voices in our parliament. In particular, we will remain vigilant defenders of the Racial Discrimination Act. We will be open to ways to improve its effectiveness, but we will always be guarding against any moves that would risk eroding the protections that it provides.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:28):  I rise to contribute to this 40-year anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act. Over the last 40 years, Labor has delivered a framework of human rights law that reflects Australia's rich and diverse multicultural society. Labor introduced the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 to make discrimination on the basis of race unlawful. In the 1990s, Labor added to these protections by banning racially charged offensive, insulting, intimidating and humiliating speech that leads to racial hatred. 


The Racial Discrimination Act 1975, also known as the RDA, was introduced by the Whitlam Labor government to make racial discrimination unlawful and to combat racial prejudice. The RDA makes it unlawful for anybody to discriminate against a person based on their race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. It also gives effect to Australia's international human rights obligations under the UN Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In accordance with these obligations, all people are guaranteed equality before the law without distinction as to race. It also provides that, regardless of ethnic background, people have a right to equal access to places and facilities, land, housing and other accommodation, goods and services, trade union membership and opportunities to work and find a job. The RDA also creates a process for mediation and conciliation of discrimination complaints, a process that is now undertaken by the Australian Human Rights Commission. 


'Legislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of racial discrimination,' Labor's Attorney-General Kep Enderby said to parliament in February 1975. As the 20th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act approached, three major inquiries found serious gaps in the protections provided by the law. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission report Multiculturalism and the law, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all argued in favour of an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism. 


In 1992 the National Inquiry into Racist Violence found that, while state and territory criminal law punishes the perpetrators of violence, it largely is inadequate to deal with conduct that is a precondition of racial violence. That conduct includes racially charged offensive speech. In response to these findings, Michael Lavarch, the Attorney-General in the Keating Labor government, introduced the Racial Hatred Bill 1994, which added a new part to the RDA. The new part IIA included a civil prohibition on racially motivated hate speech and a variety of defences to protect free speech. 'Racial hatred provides a climate in which people of a particular race or ethnic origin live in fear and in which discrimination can thrive,' said our then Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, in his speech to parliament in November 1994. Racism and bigotry, wherever expressed, are wrong. No-one has a right to be a bigot, particularly if they hurt someone. A bigot restrained will never suffer more than a victim shamed. 


Last year, Senator Brandis seemed to accept that racially motivated attacks are part and parcel of the 'intellectual freedom' Australians expect—despite there already being broad exemptions under section 18D from current laws where people make infringing statements in good faith. The Attorney-General consistently justified his belief by referring to the unfortunate Andrew Bolt, found by the Federal Court to have made racist comments in bad faith. Indeed, Mr Bolt knowingly published errors of fact and distortions of the truth. If he had a sincere intellectual point to make, it would have avoided infringement of section 18C.


Unlike the current law, legislated by a Labor government, which protects views offered in good faith, the government proposed to give a free pass to people who vilified ethnic and racial groups, as long as they could link their comments to any 'political, social, cultural, religious, artistic, academic or scientific matter'. That means comments in an online newspaper or in a political or art blog making incendiary, racist comments. It would include a sign threatening perhaps a Jewish group at a neo-Nazi rally against immigration. It remains very difficult to imagine any conduct that falls outside these exemptions put forward by Senator Brandis.


In August last year, Senator Brandis was told by the Prime Minister to backflip with pike and abandon on that disgraceful plan that he had to water down the protections afforded by section 18C. Sadly, this decision was not motivated by any overdue realisation that the government had made the wrong judgement call on 18C. Rather, the point eventually came where the Prime Minister could no longer ignore the enormous chorus of community anger about the government's plans, and what a large chorus it was. Australians from all walks of life joined together and walked together to oppose the government's racial discrimination changes—something so strong in our community that the government could not ignore it. People attended community forums to demonstrate their support for tolerance, social inclusion and multiculturalism and to affirm their opposition to bigotry and racism. They organised on Facebook, Twitter and other social media. They wrote and called their state and federal members of parliament. Australians marched in the streets to demonstrate their support for retaining protections against racist hate speech.


But, rather than listening to the voices of the Australian community and admitting that he made a wrong captain's call on 18C, the Prime Minister explained he was changing course simply because 18C had become a 'complication' for the government. And the Prime Minister did not rule out proceeding with plans to repeal 18C in the future, if the political environment were more favourable for him to do so. Australians, in the Senate and in the street, can and do use the avenues open to them to call out racism when they see it. We use the rules to defend what is good and to show that hatred and hate speech are out. We do not accept excuses that racially motivated vilification is an ordinary and acceptable part of living in our democracy. It is not. 


I would like to commend the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, for his book, I'm Not Racist But… 40 Years of the Racial Discrimination Act. I also thank the other contributors to that book: Christos Tsiolkas, Alice Pung, Maxine Beneba Clarke, Bindi Cole Chocka and Benjamin Law.


To build a society where people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds feel able to fully participate and where people can live, work and play side by side, we need to defend our right to speak freely but fairly 


The Racial Discrimination Act is integral to this. We have a wonderful, multicultural nation thanks to the laws and instruments that permit such a nation to flourish. I think Senator Wong articulated it very well when she said that the Racial Discrimination Act: 


…is a collective expression of our Australian values, a collective expression that Australian's ought not be discriminated against on the basis of their race, and it is our collective agreement that we will, together, stand against bigotry and prejudice.


I would like to commend all of those who, day in and day out, stamp out racism in our community and those leaders who also do so—especially Adam Goodes, the Sydney Swans player, who has been an inspiring ambassador for the Racism. It Stops with Me campaign. I would like to thank the AFL for its ongoing stance against racism and all those in the community who continue to support a strong Racial Discrimination Act.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:38):  Today is indeed a very auspicious day. We are here this afternoon talking about the 40th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act. Some of us earlier today commemorated the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. Time does not allow me to elaborate on the links between the Racial Discrimination Act and Magna Carta. In the last parliamentary sitting week, the President of the Senate was joined by the current Clerk of the Senate to launch the second edition of Australia's Magna Carta. It includes a chapter from the former and now late Clerk, Harry Evans, which is entitled 'Bad King John and the Australian Constitution'. Before turning to the importance of the motion before us, I would like to quote a little from his chapter, where Mr Evans made the following suggestion:


I want to suggest that Magna Carta has a significance which is not dependent on its content. This is its contribution to the history of constitutionalism, and, in particular, to the development of the concept of a constitution.


In order to appreciate this significance, it is necessary to realise that many concepts and institutions of government which we now take for granted and which we regard as obvious developed extremely slowly over a long period and in very small accretions. Even the most simple ideas and institutions have been a long time in developing. It is also necessary to appreciate that there are very few really new ideas or institutions. The modern epoch has made very few original contributions to government. 


They are very wise words, indeed, from the former Clerk of this place. Finally, he goes on to say:


So perhaps after all we may gaze upon our copy of Magna Carta with some awe and reverence, not because of its content or for its legal significance but for the contribution it made to the development of the written constitution and the concept of rights of the citizen. In a sense, all written constitutions, including our own, and all declarations of rights, are its descendants. Remembering that, and other aspects to which I have referred, may help us a little on our way into another century.


It is particularly important to think that a document that originated 800 years ago is the origin of the democratic institutions that we in this nation enjoy and others in other nations enjoy as well.


There is an important point that is worth observing in the context of this debate on the 40th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act. For the most part, the contribution of other senators this afternoon has been a very worthy one and, for the most part, I add my sentiments to their sentiments. Fortieth birthdays are significant milestones and I would argue that those of us who have turned 40—I do not want to be rude, Mr President, but I cannot see anyone who would not be 40—would almost certainly have used the occasion as an opportunity to reflect and make an assessment about those four decades. If we are honest with ourselves in looking back, we do make assessments about those things that have gone well and those things that could have gone better. In my view, that should be no different for legislation. In marking the 40th anniversary of the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 there is, indeed, very much to be proud of. Multiculturalism—I often wonder why it is not called 'cultural pluralism'—did not begin with Gough Whitlam, as much as some in this place would like to believe that to be the case.


The passage of the legislation in 1975 represented an important milestone in Australia's evolution and in our transition to becoming a more multicultural society. Likewise, racial tolerance did not simply come into being with the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act. What the legislation did, however, do was crystallise values of tolerance that were already alive in the Australian community. In effect, in passing the legislation, the parliament was giving formal notice of the Australian community's desire to be an open and racially tolerant society. The legislation has not been static for 40 years, and Senator Singh alluded to that in her contribution. There have been amendments over the years, most notably, I would argue, amendments to section 18C, which have now moved beyond the original intention of the legislation and have upset the delicate balance between protection from discrimination and freedom of speech.


The point I am making is this: that in the same way as the Magna Carta, which we are celebrating today, has had 800 years of influence over our parliamentary democracy and our traditions we should be open to the fact that the Racial Discrimination Act, which was passed 40 years ago, should be open to discussion, should be open to change and should be open to reform. I am proud to say that in this place I am one of those people who believes there are some elements of the Racial Discrimination Act that can, and should be, reformed. It is not new news to senators that I and a number of other senators have proposed the evolution of the Racial Discrimination Act, particularly in regards of section 18C, to better promote freedom of speech in our country and, importantly, to transfer the burden from legislation to every individual in this country to challenge discrimination and abusive and offensive things whenever they are said and heard.


Just briefly, I am proud to say that I am not alone. Senator Bernardi, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day have a similar view to me.




Senator Cameron:
  All the Tea Party senators.




Senator SMITH:
  If Senator Cameron was well schooled in this issue, he would know that my views are shared by the Chief Justice of the High Court.




Senator Cameron:
  Oh, wow!




Senator SMITH:
  If Senator Cameron had respect for the law, he would be curious to know what the Chief Justice of our High Court had to say.

  And I'll bet he doesn't.




Senator SMITH:
  I was waiting for an invitation, but you are quite right, Senator O'Sullivan.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order in the chamber! Continue, Senator Smith. We have been going very well up until now.




Senator SMITH:
  I will continue in that spirit, Mr Acting Deputy President. What did Justice Robert French, the Chief Justice of the High Court now, say in regards to the Racial Discrimination Act and particularly in regards to section 18C? Justice French said:


The lower registers of the preceding definitions [in 18C] and in particular those of 'offend' and 'insult' seem a long way removed from the mischief to which Art 4 of CERD is directed. They also seem a long way from some of the evils to which Part IIA [of the RDA] is directed as described in the Second Reading Speech.


Let me abbreviate that for you, Senator Cameron. The Chief Justice is saying that the words 'offend' and 'insult' are not working in the way that was originally intended.


Would you like to hear from the esteemed human rights lawyer Sarah Joseph about her attitude to whether or not section 18C should be reformed?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Direct your comments through the chair, please, Senator Smith.




Senator SMITH:
  Perhaps another name that might be more familiar to Senator Cameron and, indeed, Senator Lines is Julian Burnside QC, a prominent human rights lawyer. What has he said in regards to reforming section 18C? He said:


… the mere fact that you insult or offend someone probably should not, of itself, give rise to legal liability. My personal view is that 18C probably reached a bit far so a bit of fine-tuning would probably be OK.


The point is a simple one. Legislation is not static. This place should be brave enough to embrace, discuss and debate reform and change.


Senator Wright is absolutely correct: reform of 18C is a contentious issue. It has brought strong opinions to this place. But this is what the Australian Senate is for. I am sure that every one of us, including you, Senator Cameron, has it within us to engage in a mature debate to bring forward a proper and healthy discussion about whether or not the Racial Discrimination Act should evolve.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:48):  My contribution to this debate and the fact that we are marking this very important anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act is to bring into focus Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I would argue that the act, while it has done some great things and we have made some progress, is still not protecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from prejudice or, in fact, racial abuse. It is very important to note that the only time that the Racial Discrimination Act has been set aside has been to enable legislation to impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Northern Territory intervention was an unfortunate example of where the Racial Discrimination Act was set aside. The intervention was exempted from the operation of that act. While I disagreed with many other things that the Labor government subsequently did in the Northern Territory with the intervention, one of the good things they did was restore the operation—although not quite fully—of the Racial Discrimination Act to that particular piece of legislation.


The law, as we know, makes it so you cannot lawfully discriminate and so you can protect people against prejudice. The point that I made earlier is that this act has not done that. If you go and talk to any Aboriginal community, they can recount occasion after occasion where they have been subjected to prejudice and racial abuse. When we were carrying out the hearings on constitutional recognition, we constantly heard that. Just a couple of months ago in South Australia a young man gave us an account of the abuse and prejudice he suffered at school. So we still have a long way to go. It is worth celebrating, but we in this country have more to do.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:50):  I want to go back to the words of Gough Whitlam on the proclamation of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 when he said:


There is nothing in the Constitution, or any other document, to entrench or even give expression to the rights of citizens and the democratic ideals on which our society is based. Unlike the United States, we have no bill of rights; unlike the US, our Constitution says nothing about civil liberties. There is a need to spell out in an enduring form the founding principles of our civilisation, and in particular the principle that all Australians, whatever their colour, race or creed, are equal before the law and have the same basic rights and opportunities.


When Mr Kep Enderby moved the bill, he said: 'It should have happened many years ago.' The bill was a significant step in the development of policy and the promotion of human rights in Australia.


Laws against racial vilification and racial discrimination should not be contested in Australia, but sadly they are. We are a country with a history of migration which has yet to reconcile, accept and respect that our first peoples, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, are still not recognised and are discriminated against in Australia. On a day when we celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, WA Chief Justice Martin reminds us that we fail to acknowledge that Aboriginals law is many thousands of years older than that which was created when the English earls and barons bailed up King John on the banks of the Thames near Runnymede. If parliaments are the place which set the example, not only do we need to do more to reflect, in our elected representatives, our multicultural and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; we must do it in the acts we debate in this place.


The Racial Discrimination Act has been under attack by the Abbott government, which sought to repeal section 18C of the act. An overwhelming backlash in the community ensured this attack on the act was dropped. But the record shows that the conservatives have tried to water down the act since it was introduced in 1975—indeed, they sought amendments which watered down the act on its introduction—and they have continued their attack on this act over the last 40 years. 


Why is it that when there is a clear need for this act in 2015, as there was in 1975, that conservatives continue to attack this act? We saw the extraordinary outcry just a few weeks ago when Adam Goodes did a celebration dance, a recognition and respect of his culture, a tribute to the Flying Boomerangs, an Indigenous youth program run by the AFL, that many commentators thought was outrageous and frightening. Anyone who watched that surely must have seen the delight on his face as he did that wonderful dance. It shows again that racial discrimination in our country continues, unfortunately, to be alive and well.


Why is it that, in the town of Geraldton, my 11-year-old Gidja granddaughter, on my taking her into a shop, said to me: 'I've been in this shop before and I don't like this shop.' I asked her: 'Why?' She told me that when she went into that shop with her mother, a Gidja woman, they were followed around. When I asked Charlee, 'Why was it that you were followed around by the owner of this shop', she said to me, as plain as anything, 'Because I'm Aboriginal.' That is the lesson that Australia has taught my 11-year-old granddaughter. She learnt that a long time ago—long before she got to the tender age of 11.


The Racial Discrimination Act is a good act. We need it, and we need to enact those principles. We need to enact the principles in the parliament and in our everyday lives, because the act, in and of itself, will not end discrimination. But, on the 40th anniversary of this act, I know, and many of my Labor colleagues know, that this act is as needed today as it was 40 years ago. I commend the act to the parliament—and I will continue to defend its operation.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:55):  It gives me great pleasure today to talk about the anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. But it is worth reflecting that racism visited Australia long before European settlement. The very first description of an Indigenous Australian was by the English explorer, William Dampier. He observed our continent's first peoples in 1699 and was less than complimentary, to say the least. Dampier was a man, I suppose you would say, of his less enlightened times. But his description of Indigenous Australians, when he encountered them, was miserable, simply because they did not keep livestock and they did not wear clothes like Europeans. I think this demonstrates the narrow prism through which significant difference is too often viewed. Our history, like that of any nation, is replete with these sorts of examples: from the punitive expeditions against local Aborigines, undertaken by the first settlers in Sydney Cove, to the anti-Chinese riots during the gold rush and the first acts of the Australian parliament in 1901 to restrict migration based on race and to deport specific islander labourers—the so-called beginning of the White Australia policy. 


As we stand here today, it is not very hard to realise just how far we have come since we first arrived in this place. But it began slowly with the abolition of the infamous 'dictation test' for new migrants in 1958, among other developments. This was followed by the effective dismantling of the White Australia policy in the 1960s and the historic 1967 referendum that saw power given to the government to legislate for the benefit of Indigenous Australians. We learnt to celebrate diversity and difference instead of fearing them. We began to realise the benefits of difference by recognising that, underneath our traditional dress and the colours of our skins, all people are pretty much the same.


I think it is important to note some of those brave activists and trailblazers who championed and forced this recognition: people like Charles Perkins, who organised the Freedom Ride of 1965 to expose discrimination and racism; people like Sir Douglas Nicholls, the first Indigenous Australian to hold a viceregal office as governor of my home state of South Australia; people like Egon Kisch, who embarrassed the Lyons government in 1934 by passing the dictation test in every possible European language, except for Gaelic, and won the right to stay in Australia after the High Court ruled he had been unfairly discriminated against; people like Eddie Mabo—who is a tremendous example—David Passey and James Rice, whose efforts led to the rejection of the false concept of terra nullius and laid the foundation for native title. There were just so many great people, most from groups suffering from some level of discrimination, who made us recognise that, underneath, we are all essentially the same. The formation and creation of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 formalised the recognition that these people in our past had put so much hard work into achieving.


We now have an act, despite what has been said by those opposite in some of the more negative contributions that we have heard on this matter of public importance, that will ensure Australians of all backgrounds are treated equally and have the same opportunities. This act makes it against the law for you to be treated unfairly or to be discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin and immigration status. The act also makes racial hatred against the law. We have seen a lot of debate in this place over recent times about the interpretation of that. But, at the end of the day, we must ensure that we are very clear that it is the act of racial hatred that does not happen. 


It is a great pleasure to be standing in a parliament at the moment that does not seek to perpetuate the problems that we have seen of the past but to learn of the problems of the past and operate under an act—like this particular act—that gives protection to every Australia, no matter what colour, creed, race or nationality; where they have come from; how they have come here; or when they have come here and, for that matter, those who were here before any of us got here. This act is 40 years old. It should be cause for great celebration that we stand here today and celebrate the fact that for 40 years we have had a racial discrimination act that looks after the people of Australia.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (17:00):  Forty years ago, Australia implemented one of the country's most progressive and important pieces of legislation: the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The act aims to ensure that Australians of all backgrounds are treated equally and have the same opportunities. I am proud to be Australian and I am supportive of our commitment to multiculturalism and unexclusiveness; but I know we need to do much more if we are to ensure that everyone in our great country is able to access and pursue the same opportunities and be treated with curtesy, respect and appropriate consideration.


Our very own Australian Human Rights Commission has a mission of human rights: everyone, everywhere and every day. Human rights should be basic rights. Sadly, in Australia this is not the case. In my home state of Queensland, it would seem landholders and farmers have no rights. They have no rights whatsoever. Coal seam gas mining companies can make a way onto farmers' land and commence mining coal seam gas without any approval needed from the landholder. Queensland landholders who attempt to resist CSG mining companies coming onto their land are subject to bullying, harassment and intimidation and are threatened with being taken to the Land Court of Queensland. To make matters worse, landholders then face the threat of court costs and fines for simply trying to protect their lands and their families from the devastating impact of CSG mining.


Communities across Queensland are turning into gas fields. I travelled to regional Queensland to see the devastation firsthand. The way this country is treating farmers and landholders has brought me to my knees. CSG mining depletes the earth of its water, dries up wells and bores, contaminates what little water there is left and poisons the earth. People affected by CSG mining are becoming ill, their children are waking up with blood noses, their animals are dying and the value of their land is plummeting.


When people seek help from the government or the CSG mining companies involved, they are made to jump through hoops or simply ignored. The way this country is treating Queensland farmers and landholders is nothing short of criminal. Communities across Australia are desperate to stop CSG mining. They want CSG miners off their land and off the land around them. There is plenty of gas available via other means. This country should not be allowing multinational companies to rape our land, harm our people and decimate our natural resources all for profits which go overseas.


Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss was quoted as saying that what the CSG industry in Queensland had provided was a valuable economic boost to regional areas, as well as revenue for the Queensland government at a time when coal royalties were declining. He was also quoted as saying that the CSG mining industry was now well accepted in rural communities and provided employment in towns. This is the most disgraceful, insulting and ignorant thing I have ever heard. The majority of Queensland communities, or Australian communities for that matter, do not want CSG mining. A quick Google search could tell you this. If Warren Truss seriously thinks that revenue is more important than the health of our people, then he should resign immediately. It is clear that Warren Truss, our very own Deputy Prime Minister, has no regard for the human rights of the people of Queensland, because if he did he would not say such stupid things.


Australia needs leadership. Our country needs to improve our commitment to human rights and the government needs to understand that Queensland landholders and farmers have human rights too. It is not appropriate to turn a blind eye to the damage that is being done to the people of Queensland. Revenue should never be put before the health of our people. This is why I am calling on the government to undertake a royal commission into the human impact of CSG mining, ban fracking and put a hold on any further CSG mining projects. I have a petition that over 60,000 people have signed.


We may be celebrating 40 years of a legislation commitment to human rights, but we urgently need to start understanding that the people of Queensland have rights as well. Human rights should come before money, before political donations from CSG mining companies and before mining revenue. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I do thank Minister Ley for her response to the resolution of the Senate of 18 March 2015 concerning mental health services, but in her response to the resolution the minister refers to her decision to give a 12-month funding extension to so-called front-line mental health services. While mental health organisations did welcome this funding extension, it is not by any means a long-term solution. It came far too late for many. In fact, it was cold comfort to those workers who are forced to leave their jobs and in many cases uproot their families and lives, moving back to the city from country areas or giving up well-established careers in the mental health sector because the government could not give organisations the funding certainty that they needed to give staff job security, keep them employed and do the requisite planning ahead for their services.


In fact, when I asked specifically about this 12-month funding extension issue during Senate estimates, no-one in the health department could tell me whether or not organisations would find themselves in exactly the same situation in 12 months time. They are pushed from pillar to post, with funding drip-fed on a 12-month cycle. It allows them no scope to plan ahead or to know what the capacity of their organisation will be in 12 months or two years time. What a way to do business.


Despite this government's rhetoric around mental health system reform, no-one can assure me that the recommendations of the comprehensive National Mental Health Commission's review of mental health services and programs will be addressed or implemented by the time this 12-month funding extension has expired. So while the government is working through the recommendations from the National Mental Health Commission review, another year will slip by without any change, and that is another year that Australians will not get the mental health care they need.


The review found that mental health care in Australia often comes too late, is fragmented, fails too often to prevent crisis situations and often does not take into account a person's broader social needs. It found inadequate responses to significantly higher rates of mental distress, trauma, suicide and intentional self-harm among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and that mental health funding is concentrated in expensive acute-care services and too little is directed towards prevention and early-intervention strategies. These things all paint a picture of a mental health system that is difficult to navigate and does not meet the needs of our Australian population. We need this government to take action on mental health now.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Smith
) (17:15):  I table a remonstrance presented by the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island containing grievances relating to the removal of self-government in the Norfolk Island. With the concurrence of the Senate, the document will be incorporated into Hansard. 




The document read as follows—





1 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF NORFOLK ISLAND—SELF GOVERNMENT



The Legislative Assembly for Norfolk Island respectfully addresses itself to—


The Honourable the President of the Senate and the Members of the Senate, 


The Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.


PREAMBLE


The passage in the Commonwealth Parliament of the Norfolk Island Act 1979 conferred on Norfolk Island a limited grant of self governing powers with its own legislature (the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island) with a plenary grant of legislative powers to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Territory established, with its own body politic under the Crown with a wide grant of executive powers and with its own judicial system.


The Legislative Assembly for Norfolk Island is constituted of 9 representatives of the people of Norfolk Island; duly and democratically elected pursuant to the Legislative Assembly Act 1979.


The Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in May 2015 removes the self government powers of Norfolk Island. It has been passed without genuine consultation and negotiation with the Norfolk Island Government, the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island or the people of Norfolk Island.


The Statement of Compatibility with Human Rights contained within the Explanatory Memorandum for the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 asserted that the proposal to remove self-government powers from Norfolk Island was the result of an extensive consultation process that found significant support for change within the Norfolk Island community.


Norfolk Island voters in a referendum conducted on 8 May 2015 under the Referendum Act 1964 voted by a 68% majority that the people of Norfolk Island should have the right to freely determine their political status, their economic, social and cultural development and be consulted at referendum or plebiscite on the future model of governance for Norfolk Island before such changes are acted on by the Australian Parliament.


GRIEVANCES


The Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island presents its grievances to the Commonwealth Parliament.


These are that:


(1) The people of Norfolk Island having been granted self governing powers, the duly elected representatives of the people of Norfolk Island are aggrieved that self government should be removed without genuine consultation and negotiation.


(2) The removal of self government in Norfolk Island breaches one of the conventions of self- government in the Westminster tradition that once self government is granted to a political entity, it should not thereafter be taken away except in the most extreme circumstances, for example, war or civil disturbance. See submission of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory, page 8 of Parliamentary Paper No. 281 of 1974 where it also states that it would be politically unthinkable to take away such powers after they had been granted.


PETITION


The Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island and its democratically elected Members respectfully request that the Commonwealth Parliament affirm the rights of the people of Norfolk Island to self-government by re-examining those aspects of the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 that result in the removal of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and call on the Prime Minister to confer on the people of Norfolk Island the right to freely determine their political status, their economic, social and cultural development and be consulted at referendum or plebiscite on the future model of governance for Norfolk Island before such changes are acted on by the Australian Parliament.


On 20 May 2015 the above Remonstrance was introduced by the Hon Robin E Adams MLA into the Fourteenth Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island and was passed on the same day. The Legislative Assembly requested the Remonstrance be delivered by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President of the Senate.

The speech read as follows—





LAW ENFORCEMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (POWERS) BILL 2015



This bill contains measures to clarify the questioning powers of the Australian Crime Commission and the Integrity Commissioner. 


This bill will help to ensure that the Crime Commission, Integrity Commissioner and Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity have access to necessary and appropriate powers so that they can play their part in the fight against serious and organised crime, foreign fighters and law enforcement corruption.


At the same time, this bill will strengthen checks and safeguards on examinations and hearings, to strike an appropriate balance between giving law enforcement and integrity agencies the powers they need to keep our community safe, and the need to preserve the fundamental right to a fair trial.




Background to examination and hearing powers



Examinations and hearings are crucial to the operations of the Crime Commission and Integrity Commissioner. A person questioned in an examination or hearing cannot hide behind the privilege against self-incrimination. They must answer all questions put to them. This enables the Crime Commission and the Integrity Commissioner to obtain information that would not otherwise be available through traditional policing and investigative methods. 


Access to these powers is particularly important in the fight against serious and organised crime and systemic corruption. Groups and individuals involved in these activities are well funded, actively attempt to frustrate investigations, and are skilled at countering law enforcement methods to avoid detection. 


The Crime Commission, the Integrity Commissioner and ACLEI use the information obtained through these questioning powers for a range of important law enforcement purposes, including to progress investigations, to develop, analyse and disseminate intelligence to partner agencies, to address systemic vulnerabilities in organisations and to disrupt the operations of organised criminal groups, like outlaw motor cycle gangs.


These are significant powers that override the right to silence. However, they are vital to law enforcement's ability to investigate, prevent and disrupt some of the most serious criminal activity.


Examinations and hearings are already subject to a number of checks and safeguards to balance these interests. This bill will strengthen these, and strike an appropriate balance between giving law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe, and the need to preserve the fundamental right to a fair trial.




Impact of recent cases



A number of recent court cases have affected the way these agencies can use their existing questioning powers. These cases include X7 and the Australian Crime Commission, Lee and the NSW Crime Commission, Lee against the Queen and The Queen against Seller and McCarthy.


These decisions have had a significant negative impact on the operations of the Crime Commission and the Integrity Commissioner.


For example, following the decision in X7, the Crime Commission has stopped examining anyone who had been charged with an offence where the questioning might touch on the subject matter of the charges. This has already prevented the Crime Commission from obtaining valuable intelligence about the methodologies and activities of those involved in serious criminal activity, including recruiters and facilitators of foreign fighters and their links with other individuals. 




Measures in the 
bill



The bill I am introducing today will respond to X7 and other relevant cases, by amending the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 and the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 to place the Crime Commission and Integrity Commissioner's powers on a stronger footing.


The bill will make a number of changes to these Acts to clarify the nature and use of these powers, which I will go through in turn.


The bill will expressly authorise the Crime Commission and Integrity Commissioner to question a person who has been charged with an offence, which was the original intention behind those Acts. 


This has been a very important power in the past. It has been used to question arrested paedophiles and child pornographers about the identities and locations of their victims. It has allowed law enforcement agencies to obtain a detailed understanding of contemporary drug trafficking techniques and to identify the individuals involved in those illicit activities. It has been used to weed out the insidious influence of corruption in our law enforcement agencies and make them more resilient.


The bill will also expressly authorise the use of derivative material obtained from an examination or hearing, and set out the circumstances in which examination, hearing and derivative material may be provided to a prosecutor.


These amendments are necessary to ensure that the Crime Commission, the Integrity Commissioner and their partners have clear authority to continue to take action based on material obtained from examinations and hearings. The bill will also expressly allow this material to be disclosed to investigators and others, so that it can be used to gather additional evidence (that is, derivative material) to support the prosecution of the person. 


This bill will also more clearly authorise the Crime Commission to conduct examinations in the context of ongoing confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and set out when that material may be used in those proceedings. These changes respond to Recommendations 3 and 4 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's 2012 inquiry into unexplained wealth. This delivers on the Government's election commitment to implement the outstanding recommendations of the Committee's report.


The bill will make the same changes to the Integrity Commissioner's powers, and bolster the ability of Australia's law enforcement and integrity agencies to target criminals where it hurts most – their illicit wealth. 


While these amendments will more clearly set out the ways in which examination, hearing and derivative material may be disclosed and used, these measures contain a number of important safeguards. 


They will ensure that any use or disclosure of examination, hearing and derivative material will not prejudice a person's safety or their fair trial – one of the fundamental tenets of our criminal justice system.


The amendments to both the Crime Commission Act and the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act will more clearly set out the circumstances in which examination and hearing material can and cannot be disclosed.


The bill will place specific limits on the circumstances when examination material, hearing material and derivative material can be provided to the prosecution. In some cases, an investigator will have to seek a court's permission to disclose this material to the prosecution. The court will decide whether disclosure would be in the interests of justice.


The bill also makes it clear that courts retain their powers to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.


The amendments will protect the right to a fair trial of a person questioned by the Crime Commission or Integrity Commissioner. They will ensure that law enforcement agencies can carry on their important role of fighting organised crime and corrupt elements within our law enforcement agencies without unfairly impacting upon the fundamental rights of the accused.


The amendments will also confirm that the Crime Commission's and Integrity Commissioner's coercive questioning powers can only be used for the specific purposes set out in legislation. That is, for the purposes of a Crime Commission special intelligence operation or special investigation, or for an investigation into a law enforcement corruption issue. For example, the amendments to the Crime Commission Act will more clearly identify that an examination always occurs in support of a special operation or special investigation. In some instances, material from an examination may assist in a prosecution or confiscation proceeding. However, the primary purpose of an examination is not to bolster the case against the examinee, but rather to gather information for the purpose of understanding, disrupting or preventing serious and organised crime.


Finally, the bill will also increase the penalties for breaching non-disclosure obligations relating to examinations and hearings so that they are consistent with similar Commonwealth offences.




Conclusion



The powers of the Crime Commission and Integrity Commissioner are significant. But so too are the challenges posed by serious and organised crime and its enabler, corruption. Serious and organised criminals exploit every advantage they can. The questioning powers of the Crime Commission and Integrity Commissioner go some way to levelling the playing field.


This bill will ensure that those agencies have the questioning powers they need, and that the information they gather can be put to maximum use to protect the community. It will do so in a way that upholds fundamental principles of our criminal justice system about the right to a fair trial.


Without these amendments, the Crime Commission and the Integrity Commission will struggle to fulfil their mandates and protect the community. They are vital to law enforcement's ability to understand, disrupt and prevent some of the most serious criminal activity.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:22):  I thought I was coming in here to briefly speak on the animal protection bill, but of course I am delighted to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. Indeed, I make the point that all of us in public life, and certainly those of us in the Australian parliament are no exception, do aim to do good. But more than anything else, we certainly have an obligation to ensure that we do no harm. I fear there are elements within the context of what we are discussing this afternoon and that is that they are doing harm or they have the potential to be doing harm. I speak of adverse health effects of industrial wind turbines.


I do refer through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Walters, who spoke before me on this matter—



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I am terribly sorry; I do apologise, Senator Waters. I apologise for not mentioning your name correctly. I now do correct that. But I particularly refer to the dismissal by Senator Waters of any possible adverse health effects on people affected by industrial wind turbines. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines is currently underway on this very matter and, to me, it is disappointing that the Greens Party elected not to have a person participating in this inquiry. 


I am also pleased to acknowledge to the Senate a commitment by the coalition coming into government now being honoured, with which I had some association—that is, a commitment to the expenditure of some $2.5 million to undertake independent medical research to establish whether there are adverse health effects from wind turbines. This is the first time, anywhere in the world, that that research will be undertaken. The NHMRC have responsibility for advertising for parties competent to undertake the medical research and they have done that. They have closed applications. I eagerly look forward to the appointment of an independent panel. 


Again, if I could just draw attention to the comments of others who have asserted that NHMRC have already undertaken research and have reported that there are no adverse health effects. That indeed is not the case. There have been a couple of literature reviews, the most recent of which included only one acoustician and three epidemiologists but nobody with actual expertise in this field. So therefore one would be hard put to actually claim that no adverse health effects could be stated.


In fact, the CEO of NHMRC himself has indeed said that the outcome of that literature review was not to come up with that conclusion. I have been critical on a number of counts, particularly as to the number of papers that were rejected as part of the literature review.  They are in fact not in the English language, including Japanese and Polish. Others were also excluded. 


Indeed, whilst it is not my position to comment at all on outcomes of the Senate select committee and I do not intend to do so, I certainly can make my own observations about medical doctors who have agreed—acousticians on both sides of this argument—only in the last few days, in hearings in Melbourne and Adelaide, and have actually stated quite strongly that there are, at least, stress and annoyances. The chief medical officer of South Australia concurred with me the other day: if stress and annoyance lead to sleeplessness, which leads to depression, indeed that of itself is an aetiological cause of adverse health. People of course speak of whether it is audible sound or subaudible infrasound. In a sense, as the point was made the other day: noise is just unwanted sound. I hope that the independent medical research will in fact undertake research and come up with some results in that space.


I was very interested in the comments only last week of a well-regarded neuroscientist Professor Simon Carlile, from the University of Sydney. He said, 'There is a growing body of evidence, pointing to low-frequency infrasound directly affecting the human nervous system.' Carlile is internationally regarded in this space. He of course speaks in terms of physiology—the fact that the nervous system responds to low frequency. As to noise, the evidence, he says, is 'Yes, the nervous system can be activated at these frequencies.' But he said, 'Not in the traditional way of one interpreting hearing, but in fact the vestibular system within the ear involving itself in balance.'


We quite often hear the analogy used whereby if a group of people go out onto the ocean, two or three get seasick and the rest of them do not. It is not all that conducive to good relations for those who did not get seasick to turn around and say to the others, 'You're actually not suffering seasickness; there is nothing wrong with you.' It is what some people facetiously refer to as a 'nocebo' effect—in other words, you think you are going to get seasick, therefore you get seasick and therefore you were not seasick. In fact, Carlile does not speak of it as an analogy at all; Carlile actually says, 'Physiologically, they may be very, very similar.' That is, the vestibular system being affected, suffering seasickness. 'They get seasick,' he said, 'because of the stimulation of the vestibular system and there seem to be quite significant variations of susceptibility to vestibular-induced nausea.' So I think, again, it is not helpful for people to make those comments.


I speak also of the impact of this bill. When it comes to renewable energy, there are many sources. We know that small-scale solar power will be unaffected by this legislation, and I think there is unanimous support within Parliament House for that. We know that the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will be protected by this legislation. But my concern, as we move to the target of 33,000 gigawatt hours, is that other forms of renewables—and, I hasten to add, other forms of renewables that have no, and can have no, adverse health effects—are largely being ignored in this debate. One is large-scale solar power. I would have pleaded for some allocation, within the decrease to 33,000 gigawatt hours, for large-scale solar power. The other one, of course, is hydroelectricity. I hasten to add as a Western Australian that this is an area in which WA have no interest because we have no hydro in the south; we do, of course, in the Ord River near Kununurra in the north. People say, 'There is no capacity for an increase in the construction of dams et cetera.' But I am not talking about that; I am talking about using new software, new technologies, to upgrade existing hydroelectricity schemes, including the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme in New South Wales and Hydro Tasmania—




Senator Polley:
  And a great system it is, too.




Senator BACK:
  It is, as Senator Polley says, a great system. In my view, this legislation would have been enriched if there had been carve-outs allowed for the encouragement of hydroelectricity power, with existing technologies and existing assets, and large-scale solar power. There is also a wonderful project being undertaken by Carnegie at Garden Island, off the Western Australian coast. Carnegie, using wave motion energy, are providing a significant proportion of the power to HMAS Stirling at Garden Island, as well as providing them with water desalinated through the heat of the generation sets.


So I think this is an opportunity missed, and ministers and others are well aware of my views that we could have had and should have had an allocation for the development of those opportunities. 


The commentary in this area has been interesting. The other day, I spoke on radio in Perth, and some fellow rang in and said that he was used to windmills on farms and they did not make him sick. Someone else said they were aware of very, very small turbines on people's roofs in the Canary Islands, and those people were not reporting illness; and, therefore, what I was talking about was a load of nonsense. 


It may not be known, but it became patently obvious to the committee through our inquiry, that the modern industrial wind turbine has a pillar of some 100 metres in height, and the blades themselves are 100 metres long. So we are looking at the height equivalent of a 60-floor CBD high-rise building and, with the size of the blades, an area greater than an Australian Rules football oval—just the one turbine. They are enormous.


The Mayor of the Goyder Regional Council in South Australia, when he appeared before the committee the other day—and the region for which he has local government responsibility has a very heavy concentration of industrial wind turbines—made the observation, probably the plea, that when this technology was first developed years ago the opportunity was there for governments, Commonwealth and state, to sit down and discuss where these turbines might be placed so they were unlikely to have any impact at all on humans.


In the context of my own state, there are four major wind farm developments. There are two outside of Esperance, on the south-east coast, where it blows like a dog off a chain, but they are placed at nine and 10 miles away. It will come as no surprise to learn that the names of these wind farms are Nine Mile Beach and Ten Mile Lagoon—because they are nine and 10 miles from town. In Albany, those who saw the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac would have seen the wind turbines in the distance. As the Mayor of Albany said the other day, nobody lives near them; they are about 20 kilometres from town. Walkaway wind farm is about 30 kilometres from either Dongara or Geraldton. The Collgar Wind Farm is about 35 kilometres from Merredin—probably a good distance if you are worried, as I am, about wind farms' possible adverse effects on people.


One of the other comments that are often made with regard to wind turbines, and I think it is one that needs to be stated, is that they will be able to immediately reduce carbon dioxide emissions. If you actually sit down and do the mathematics, you come to the realisation that the manufacturing itself of each turbine requires more than 250 tonnes of coal to produce the steel; and, when you do the carbon dioxide analysis, the payback is not for about 15 to 20 years. In other words, if a turbine operates as expected, for maybe eight hours a day—that would be optimistic—it will have to generate electricity for up to 15 to 20 years before it pays back the carbon emissions that were used in its construction or, indeed, in its being put into place. And you would understand, Mr Deputy President, that any structure which is 100 metres in height and of the width I mentioned a moment ago needs massive amounts of concrete and steel to support it. Those are points that very much need to be made.


The economics are of great interest. Why are we focusing on industrial wind turbines? It is because, in the time we have to achieve the objective of 33,000 gigawatt hours, it is industrial wind turbines, in the main, that are going to contribute to that renewable energy source. Conservatively, it is going to require somewhere around about 1,000 new wind turbines, possibly even more, depending on their size. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to examine the economics of these circumstances. The arguments go backwards and forwards. We were told in Adelaide and in Melbourne that in fact greater use of wind turbines and renewable energy, particularly through turbines, were driving the price of electricity down for the residents. I recall asking someone, 'Which state of Australia has the greatest number of turbines?' The answer is South Australia. Which is the state that has the highest cost of electricity to residences? Of course, it is South Australia. If you go to Europe, which country has the highest number of industrial wind turbines? It is Denmark. Which country has the highest cost of domestic electricity? And yes, you guessed it. Of course, it is the same place: it is Denmark.


You can also ask the question: if in fact wind turbines are driving the price of power down, why do they need any sort of financial support from the federal government? From this point of view, if they are so successful, surely it is not required. Only then do we come to learn that, in fact, the claims made about the price of power going down as the amount of renewables increases come about as a result of the very generous Renewable Energy Certificates. As we all know, under the Constitution, land management, under which these sorts of planning decisions are made, is quite rightly the role of the states, not of the Commonwealth government. But people need to be aware that, on average, depending on how much electricity they generate, besides being paid for the electricity that the turbines generate there is also a system of Renewable Energy Certificates. It is the Clean Energy Regulator who oversees the allocation of certificates, and it is true to say that these certificates actually do not cost the taxpayer anything, because the certificates find their way through to the retail price of electricity. Therefore, that cost is met by consumers. But the last time I had a look there would not be too many taxpayers who themselves are not consumers. So I think it is a very moot point to say that these costs are not borne by taxpayers. Indeed, they are.


The Clean Energy Regulator and I had had some spirited discussions in Senate estimates, and she continues to tell me that whilst the act seems to require the Clean Energy Regulator to be satisfied as to the compliance of industrial wind turbines, and indeed other forms of clean energy, in fact it does not. At the moment, the only requirement under legislation that the Clean Energy Regulator has is to be satisfied on the economics. In other words, if the wind turbine operator said, 'We generated X amount of electricity last year,' so long as the Clean Energy Regulator is satisfied with that part of the audit process the certificates flow. I would plead very strongly that there is a greater role, and based on the Clean Energy Regulator's submission and appearance before the committee, I think she is also of that view. In other words, that greater role should be that the Clean Energy Regulator needs to be satisfied with compliance.


This afternoon's discussion does not allow me to go into any detail at all about compliance, except to say there is a long and sad history of lack of compliance: of turbines being wrongly placed and of approvals being given in arrears or backdated. This does not do very much for their credibility or for the levels of confidence within the wider community, particularly the community of affected people. Therefore, I think we need a lot more discussion on the overall economics. I plead that we need to widen the argument.


One of the other areas is biomass. I know that will be discussed in the committee process, and I look forward to contributing in that area, because I firmly believe that if we can use wood waste, particularly from the plantation industry, and if we can use the waste from the sugarcane industry in those areas on the east coast where the sugar is grown, then that will be of tremendous benefit.


In the last few seconds I want to pose this question to the sceptics: why is it that a family who have been in the same farmhouse for five generations would all of a sudden pretend to have some adverse health effect? Why would somebody who has made a lifestyle choice to shift to the Barossa Valley and found their life destroyed lay these claims? Consider a turbine host who has been receiving multiples of the $10,000 per annum that most get for having turbines on their properties. Why would they put their hands up and say, 'I'm sorry, I can't accept the funds any more'? Consider the farmer who cannot spray his crop anymore because of the turbines, and consider the retirees who leave their communities with no value in their land. There are questions to be asked.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  I am pleased to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 because it gives me an opportunity to talk about the enormous opportunities for Australia in renewable energy, and about how Labor believes in, and has supported, a strong renewable energy industry. It also gives me a chance to talk about how the Abbott government has carelessly sabotaged the industry, which has led us to the situation we are in today and to this bill now before the Senate.


Australia should be a world leader in renewable energy. With a huge land mass surrounded by water, we have access to an abundance of wind, wave, hydro, solar and geothermal energy. We also have world-leading expertise in renewable energy, and during Labor's time in government jobs in the renewable energy sector tripled. More than $18 billion was invested in the sector, and the number of homes with rooftop solar grew from 7,000 to over 1.2 million. There is no doubt that Labor has a strong commitment to renewable energy. Renewable energy, inevitably, must play a strong part of our future. It is an interesting fact that the amount of energy delivered by the sun to the earth in one hour is almost enough to meet the world's energy consumption needs for one year. The energy from sunlight is then transferred to other natural sources such as wind. I think this fact demonstrates the enormous potential there is to harness this energy, rather than rely on the finite energy source that fossil fuels provide.


If our planet is going to survive and be habitable, the world has no choice but to reduce carbon pollution. Climate science tells us that the current worldwide pledges to reduce carbon emissions may not be enough to prevent two degrees of warming, which is considered the threshold for catastrophic climate change. Renewable energy is undoubtedly the way of the future. Even if Australia does not aggressively pursue renewable energy, circumstances will eventually force the entire world to adapt to relying mostly, if not entirely, on renewable sources for our energy needs. Those countries that invest heavily in renewable energy will be the ones that are able to take advantage of the economic opportunities of selling their skills, experience and technology to others. This critically important industry employs more than 21,000 Australians, including almost 1,000 people in my home state of Tasmania.


I am particularly excited about the opportunities a strong investment in renewable energy has for Tasmania, because Tasmania has long been at the forefront of renewable energy in Australia. Our hydro-electricity scheme was established as early as 1914, and the company once known as the Hydro-Electric Commission—now Hydro Tasmania—is one of the oldest power companies in Australia, having celebrated its centenary only last year. The Tasmanian hydro-electric scheme is ingrained in our state's history. It goes back to 1895, with the opening of the Duck Reach Power Station only seven years after the first power station was built in the Southern Hemisphere. A post-Second World War boom in dam construction led to thousands of migrants, mostly European, coming to Tasmania. This has had a permanent positive impact on the social fabric of the state. There are generations of Tasmanians descended from migrant Hydro workers of English, German, Polish, and Italian origins. My home state has also been at the forefront of wind energy in Australia. The first Tasmanian wind farm, Huxley Hill, was built on King Island in Bass Strait in 1988, and was the second commercial wind farm in Australia. Tasmania has since developed the Woolnorth and Musselroe Wind Farms with a generating capacity of 140 and 168 megawatts respectively. These wind farms were developed by a joint venture between Hydro Tasmania and the Chinese company, Shenhua Clean Energy, an entity known as Woolnorth Wind Farm Holdings.


Hydro Tasmania has now become a leader in the research and development of other forms of renewable energy, such as geothermal, tide and wave energy. Tasmanian sources an average of 87 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources every year, and Tasmania has the potential to become the first state in Australia that sources 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable resources. Renewable energy is vital to the economy of my home state, especially as we export electricity from renewable sources via Basslink. So not only does renewable energy policy have an impact on the economy of my home state; it also impacts on public services, since Hydro Tasmania returns dividends to the Tasmanian government. To illustrate the impact this has, the Abbott government's decision to abolish Labor's clean energy future legislation impacts on the Tasmanian government's budget by $70 million per year. I support renewable energy, not just for the sake of Australian jobs and the economy but because of the unique implications it has for the state I represent.


The future of renewables in Australia is a risk because we now have a government that does not believe in renewable energy. It is of little surprise that we get this kind of approach from a government whose treasurer describes wind farms as 'utterly offensive' and whose Prime Minister who says they are 'visually awful'. Mr Abbott also said last week that he wished the Howard government—in which he was a minister—had never implemented the Renewable Energy Target policy. Bizarrely, in an interview with Alan Jones Mr Abbott claimed that changes to the RET—the changes we are debating right now—were designed to reduce the number of wind farms in Australia. Mr Abbott also said that he would have liked to have reduced them a lot further. When Mr Jones raised the potential health impacts of wind farms on people living nearby, Mr Abbott responded, 'I do take your point'. Yet the link has been examined by the National Health and Medical Research Council, who have found that there is no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects. Coming from a former health minister, Mr Abbott's denial of medical research is breathtaking. The Prime Minister also nailed his colours to the mast in 2013 by proclaiming that the Renewable Energy Target is driving up power prices. Yet his own hand-picked review panel found that not only is the RET putting downward pressure on electricity prices, it is also driving investment in renewable energy, creating jobs and cutting carbon pollution. It is utterly bizarre that the review could find that the RET is playing such a positive role in Australia's economy and environment—and yet go on to recommend that the RET be either significantly cut or abolished. At the same time, it is hardly surprising, given that a known climate change sceptic was appointed to the review panel. This is exactly the recommendation the government wanted—because they do not really believe in renewable energy anyway.


The Abbott government's record speaks for itself. They slashed the budget and reduced a $600 million commitment to the solar roofs and towns and schools programs to just $2 million. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency had its budget severely cut in the 2013 MYEFO, and it was then targeted for abolition in the 2014 budget. And this government has adamantly refused to either accept an emissions trading scheme or implement one of its own, despite most economic and environmental experts agreeing that it is the most efficient and effective way to cut carbon emissions—and despite the fact that an emissions trading scheme was bipartisan policy until Mr Abbott rolled Mr Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party. The government's broken promise on the Renewable Energy Target is the latest in a series of policy backflips that reflect the climate change denial and lack of commitment to renewable energy by those opposite.


The Abbott government has overturned over a decade of bipartisanship on renewable energy by breaking its promise to retain Labor's Renewable Energy Target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. In fact, the government proposed to cut the RET by over 40 per cent. Since the government announced this backflip, investment in renewable energy has fallen by 88 per cent, while it has increased by 16 per cent in the rest of the world. Over that same period, China's investment in renewable energy has increased by 33 per cent. In 2013, Australia was ranked in the top four most attractive places to invest in renewable energy, along with Germany, China and the United States. Now we have fallen to tenth place on the list. Despite the fact that the government cannot universally cut the RET, they have effectively hobbled the industry anyway.


Those of us who have been in business understand that you cannot make long-term investments in an uncertain investment environment. That is what this government has done with their departure from a decade of bipartisanship on the RET. Either the government do not understand the importance of certainty to the renewable energy industry, or they do understand it but simply do not care. I am assuming they either do not understand or do not care, because the only possibility—one which is almost too shocking to contemplate—is that the government's backflip on the RET was a deliberate attempt to sabotage the industry. What makes the government's attitude especially perplexing is that renewable energy and the RET are quite popular with the Australian public. Australians overwhelmingly support renewable energy because they recognise the incredible economic and environmental benefits it delivers.


While Labor was keen to support the previous bipartisan commitment to a RET of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020, we have had to negotiate a reduced RET with the government in order to return certainty to the industry. This brings us to the bill we are debating today. It is clear that this is not the bill that the government would rather be introducing. They would rather be introducing legislation that would further substantially reduce the renewable energy target. If we consider the words of the Prime Minister last week, he would probably rather be introducing legislation to completely abolish the RET. 


Labor has had to negotiate a compromise to make sure that we can give certainty to the renewable energy industry. The elements of the agreement include a large-scale renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatt hours by 2020; no change to the small-scale solar scheme; a full exemption for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries; and removal of the two-yearly reviews of the RET. I am pleased that the following outcomes have been achieved through the negotiations: no change to the small-scale solar scheme, which includes rooftop solar and solar panels for small businesses such as nursing homes; full exemption for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries, which relieves some pressure on those industries that are enduring downturns and job cuts; and the removal of two-yearly reviews, which provides the long-term certainty the industry needs. 


Throughout the negotiations, Labor has listened to advice from the industry on what its needs are. The revised renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatt hours will see 25 percent of Australia's energy generated from renewable sources by 2020. The Clean Energy Council, which proposed the compromise target, predicts that it will drive over $40 billion in investment and create more than 15,000 jobs. This bill reflects the outcome of our negotiations with the government. By passing this bill, we can look forward to a strong and certain future for Australia's renewable energy industry. But it is a great shame that the Prime Minister, in the interview with Alan Jones I mentioned earlier, said he was disappointed with the deal the government struck with Labor and that he would prefer to cut the RET further. In other words, this Prime Minister, who promised to create a million jobs in five years and two million jobs in 10 years, was actually expressing a desire to do more damage to an industry which creates thousands of jobs and drives billions of dollars in investment.


I am pleased, though, that through this bill the renewable energy industry can continue to move forward with certainty, attracting billions of dollars in investment and creating thousands of jobs. Labor will use the revised target as a floor to build on. We will work with the sector to increase the renewable energy target out to 2020 to bolster investment, specifically in large-scale solar. Before the next election, we will be making announcements about our genuine goals for the industry beyond 2020. In the meantime, we will be consulting with industry and the experts about the detail of those announcements.


There is doubt that the renewable energy industry has a bright future under Labor. As I said earlier in my contribution, it makes sense for Australia, with our skills, knowledge and natural resources, to have a thriving renewable energy industry. Labor wants to see Australia return to its previous position as a global leader in renewable energy generation, research and development. We can only hope that, for the sake of the industry, jobs and the environment, the Abbott government will abandon its attacks on the industry and we can return to the bipartisanship on the renewable energy target that we previously enjoyed. However, I fear that, if the recent comments of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are anything to go by, it will probably be a long, long time before the coalition is dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. I am in no doubt that, despite the intransigence of those opposite, a strong renewable energy target continues to enjoy the overwhelming support of the public. Renewable energy is the way of the future, and Labor believes it has a big part to play in Australia's future.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (17:57):  I rise this evening to totally oppose this legislation, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015, that has appeared before the Senate. It is an absolute disgrace that at a time of climate emergency, when around the world countries are scrambling to increase the amount of renewable energy in their systems and to decrease the amount of fossil fuel, here in Australia we are the first developed country to formally reduce our renewable energy target, on top of being the first developed country to abolish a carbon price. We are global pariahs when it comes to climate action leading into Paris.


I want to put to bed immediately this notion that there had to be some sort of compromise to deliver certainty. That fails absolutely to understand that the government has no intention of delivering certainty. Anyone who thinks that 33,000 gigawatt hours now provides certainty for investment is kidding themselves absolutely. I want to explain how this happened. Let's go to the Tea Party Republicans in the US. They do not believe in compromise. They go after everything that they can get, pocket whatever they can and then go after the rest. They have no intention of stopping where they are. That is clearly the modus operandi of the Abbott government when it comes to renewable energy, because the Abbott government is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the coal industry in Australia. Anyone who doubts that only has to see what this government has done. The fact of the matter is that renewable energy in Australia is undermining the business case for coal. That is it, pure and simple.


On top of the reduced demand that has been occurring and the rollout of rooftop solar, we had the coal generators in Australia in trouble—9,000 megawatts too much of energy in the system—and we had a choice. We could shut down coal fired power now without in any way jeopardising energy security in Australia and actually bringing down prices to consumers, because renewable energy is bringing down the wholesale price of power; or we could try and kill renewable energy and increase the price of energy to consumers, and that is exactly what this legislation is doing. I am afraid it shows a level of naivety beyond all measure to hear the Labor Party stand up here saying that they had to compromise to deliver certainty. 


There is no certainty, and if anyone needs any proof of that, just have a look at what the Prime Minister had to say last week. He said: 'The Renewable Energy Target as currently agreed, mandating that 33,000 gigawatt hours of electricity be produced from renewable sources including wind, was merely the lowest number the government could achieve within the current parliament.' They have no intention of stopping here. They want this abolished altogether. If they could have gone down further, they would have, and they would have gone as low as to the point of abolishing the RET altogether. That is their agenda. Anyone who thinks that they are stopping at 33,000 gigawatt hours has not listened to how they are intending to prop up fossil fuels. 


Let me go to something else the Prime Minister said: 'What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, reduce: capital R-E-D-U-C-E the number of these things that we are going to get in the future'—that is, wind turbines; that is what he was referring to. He said, 'I frankly would have liked to have reduced the number a lot more, but we got the best deal we could.' What does that tell you? It tells you it is the best deal they can get at the moment to get it down to 33,000 gigawatt hours, but it is not over. They have put that in their back pockets and they are going to abolish the Renewable Energy Target at the first possible opportunity that they think they will get the numbers to do it. So I cannot believe anyone is running around suggesting there is any certainty or that there will be certainty delivered to the renewable energy industry if and when this absolutely flawed legislation—contrary to what the world needs, let alone what this country needs—actually passes.


I want to go to the reasons why the small target was not changed. It had nothing to do with compromises made in here; it had everything to do with the campaign that the Solar Council ran in marginal seats around the country, where they stood up and made it very clear, with contributions from people who are selling solar panels, students who are studying in the new renewable energy field, people working in retail in the renewable energy sector, people standing up and saying, 'This will cost us jobs, and what is more you hold this seat by one or two per cent, and if all the people with solar PV on their roof change their vote, we can take this seat from you.' It was the marginal seats campaign that protected small-scale solar, not any so-called compromise that has happened between Liberal and Labor. It was Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, who stood with me on the platform in Barton and said that Labor was not for turning on this issue. Well, Labor has turned. 


At what point did this occur? The people who gave cover to everybody to start this downward process that got them as low as Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, could get them to go—and he will continue his attack on renewable energy—were of course the Clean Energy Council. They were the ones who gave cover to this happening, and then out came the AWU, saying that they wanted exemptions for aluminium smelters, but that was not enough for the Clean Energy Council. They said, 'Why don't we give exemptions to all the trade exposed industries? Why would you do that? Why would you go down that path, especially seeing that aluminium smelters have been subsidised by the community forever? With bulk power contracts, they have never paid the wholesale price for power ever anywhere in the country. Because of the currency exchange rate, they have had the biggest windfall gain that they could have expected in recent times. They have had a massive windfall gain with that change to the exchange rates. 


We have a situation where the AWU came out wanting aluminium and the Clean Energy Council said: 'Let's go further. Let's give all the energy-intensive trade-exposed a 100 per cent exemption.' What does that mean? I have not heard the Prime Minister out there talking about power bills. Why? Because every trade exposed industry you let off paying for their renewable energy certificates means that the community has to pay. The community has to pay more now because the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries have gotten off the hook. I will be very interested in the definition of what constitutes energy-intensive trade-exposed as to whether the petroleum and gas industries get their way and have an expanded definition of the level of exemption they can get not only for their LNG facilities but also for the gas fields and what power goes on in those sectors. It will be very interesting to see where that ends up.


We have a situation now where the Clean Energy Council is facilitating a race to the bottom. The Prime Minister is saying, 'We want as low as we can go, as we can possibly secure in this parliament,' and the Labor Party have facilitated that to get down to 33,000 gigawatt hours and a total exemption for all the energy-intensive trade-exposed, increasing the price to the community and squeezing out large-scale solar. 


The fact of the matter is that renewable energy has won the energy race this century. Solar has won. What is happening in this country though is that we are missing out on large-scale solar thermal, the sort of thing that gives hope and excitement for new jobs and new investment, for careers for young people. They are all offshore now. They are going offshore, where they are building a fantastic facilities in the United States, in Spain, in China. All over the world large-scale solar is being built, but not in this country, because of the attitude of the government and the AWU going along with the exemption for the trade exposed.


Now let me get to the decision by the government to include forest furnaces. This is a ludicrous proposition: the logging of native forests in order to burn them to generate energy which is then called 'renewable'. We know that the best thing you can do for the climate is to save the carbon-dense native forests, which are carbon stores. If you were interested in looking after biodiversity in the face of the extinction crisis we are now suffering and interested in securing carbon in the landscape, you would not log native forests. As a result of the world deciding it does not want to log native forests, the bottom has dropped out of the market for native forest woodchips. That is why Forestry Tasmania has made such a mess of it and is in so much debt. Forestry Victoria and all around the country want to be propped up by a subsidy because they have no market for native forest woodchips. So along comes the government, no doubt with the support of the CMFEU, to give renewable energy certificates to native forest loggers.


Let me tell you about Forestry Tasmania. It is so far in debt that they should be trading insolvent if it were not for the Tasmanian government giving them a letter of comfort. Whilst the Labor Party federally says that it opposes the logging of native forests for forest furnaces, Bryan Green, who is the leader of the Labor Party in the Tasmanian parliament, has been urging Bill Shorten to support this particular legislation. The Labor Party in Tasmania want forest furnaces; they have always wanted them and they want them now. It is bad enough that the Tasmanian government took $30 million out of Networks Tasmania, a GBE, and transferred it to Forestry Tasmania, but now in the budget they have extended their line of credit by another $10 million to $41 million. The logging of native forests is an ideological debt disaster. Now the federal government wants to prop them up by logging native forests. Anyone who suggests that this is about waste fails to remember the past; if you fail to remember the past then you are condemned to repeat it. What we are seeing here is 90 per cent of any coupe that is logged going to woodchips—90 per cent. We are talking about burning 90 per cent of what comes off a coupe in a forest furnace, if this legislation goes through. Any suggestion of 'Oh, it's only twigs and leaves and bark' is nonsense. It is 90 per cent of a coupe that will go into a forest furnace; and it is wrong. 


We have run big consumer campaigns and we will run another big consumer campaign. People might remember burnt koala certificates. Perhaps the Clean Energy Council might like to think for a moment about the reputational damage to renewable energy that they are dishing out by failing to force the government on this issue. Again, I come back to the Labor Party. Even though Bryan Green, the leader of the Tasmanian party, wants it, there were two things that the government included in this: one was the two-year reviews; the other was to log native forests to generate energy. Labor came out and said they would make one a condition of doing this deal, but not the other. If you were serious about not logging native forests, why would you not have made both deal breakers? There is no answer to that, because the reality is that Labor at the state level is very happy to see native forest logging go on and be propped up by trying to include it in getting renewable energy certificates for logging and burning native forests and driving species to extinction. That, indeed, is what this will do if they get away with it.


Before the last election I went to see the Labor government to say: 'We need to get rid of these two-year reviews from the Renewable Energy Target.' The reason it was not possible then is that, had we tried to do that, Rob Oakeshott, an independent member at the time, indicated that he would move for the inclusion of native forest logging in that and he would have had the support for the government to do it. That is why it did not get done before the last election. This has been on the agenda for some time. The Greens have held it out for a long time, and we should be holding it out now, because every certificate that you generate from logging and burning native forests is a certificate that you are using to take from future generations the biodiversity of our forests and the carbon-rich density of our forests. It an absolute act of vandalism if that is allowed to occur. That is why we should be dumping the schedule which they have shoved in this bill that would give renewable energy certificates to forest furnaces which generate energy from the burning of native forests. It is absolute destruction of the world's biodiversity, and it will be yet another indication globally of just how backward Australia is.


I want to return to the bill in a big-picture sense before closing my second reading remarks. Australia has a dig-it-up, cut-it-down, ship-it-away economy. The Greens have argued for a very long time that we need to respond to the global warming emergency; we need serious targets. We have said 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 is achievable in this country. What that would do for jobs and investment is mega. That would give the kind of direction and certainty that you need, especially if it is accompanied by a reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with the science. That is why we have called for net carbon zero by 2040 and 80 per cent reduction by 2030. It is why we have said as far back as 2009: 'Let's go for a 40 per cent reduction by 2020.' If we were in that ballpark now, we would be laughing— Australia would be sitting on a jobs-rich boom. We would be giving so much hope to young people who want to go into universities to study these technologies and who want to make sure that we can convert our cities to a low-carbon future. They want to be supporting more public transport, the rollout of electric vehicles, the rollout of solar at residential and at utility scale with solar-thermal plants. They want to see windfarms; they want to see wave power being generated; they want to see all the new technologies. One young woman stood up in one of these forums and said she was a fifth-year solar engineering student. She had put her whole faith in addressing global warming by using her intelligence and her skills to roll this out. Now she will have no option but to go overseas. That is what we are seeing around the country.


By attacking the renewable energy target like this, destroying certainty, taking away any hope that this country will ever get on track to reducing greenhouse gases to the level they need to be to be consistent with the science, you are taking away hope from the next generation. You are denying rural and regional Australia the massive rollout of jobs that will come with renewable energy. It has already come with renewable energy.


As for this absolute nonsense about wind farm sickness, what a load of garbage. How come wind farm sickness only strikes people in countries where people speak English? How ridiculous is it? It is absolutely ridiculous. The Americans have rolled it out, it is happening in Australia and they have it in the UK. It is just ridiculous.


At the same time, you have the Senate Community Affairs References Committee reporting on the impacts on air quality and human health from small particulate matter, especially from coal fired power stations. What does the government do about that—a genuine health issue with a proven medical effect? The government just say, 'Noted. None of our business.' Where are the increased performance standards for coal fired power stations? Nowhere. There is just this ongoing, ridiculous, concocted attack against renewable energy. It is going on against solar. It is only a matter of time before they come up with a process of charging people to leave the grid. What gives me great hope is the disruptive nature of battery technology as people say, 'We are over the fact that the government in this country have actually worked to destroy renewables.'


I come back to the final and most important point, the one I started with—and that is that this will not deliver certainty. This is just a milestone on the way to destroying the renewable energy target. It is naive in the extreme for anyone to put a dollar into renewable energy on this basis when you have a Prime Minister saying, 'This is as low as we could get in this term of government, but we would have liked to have reduced it further.' Yes, they would and, yes, they will if they get the slightest chance. We have heard the Labor Party say, 'We are considering a higher target.' Where is any kind of rigor around that? We have seen no numbers and no commitment, just talk and a cooperative arrangement that will see renewable energy set back. There was no reason to go below 41,000 gigawatt hours and there is no reason to do it now.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-06-15,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (18:17):  You can tell that the Greens do not have a lot of experience running businesses because their prescription for job creation and greater economic activity is to find the most expensive way of doing something. It is not in dispute that renewable energy is more expensive. Indeed, Senator Milne admitted that in her contribution. She admitted that when she said that, by exempting the aluminium industry, we are going to increase the power bills of consumers around the country. So renewable energy is a more expensive form of energy. According to the Greens and Senator Milne, by doing the same thing in a more expensive way we will somehow have a stronger economy. It is not a prescription that would be commonly formulated. It is certainly not one that they would put in that context. But sometimes in this place we make things so complex when they should be much simpler.


Whilst the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 is a complex piece of legislation, it has a very simple prescription at its heart. The renewable energy target mandates that the producers of cheap electricity in our country must buy each year a set amount of expensive electricity. The simple truth underlying this legislation is that renewable energy is expensive. If it were not expensive then the renewable energy sector would not need this legislation. We do not have a shortage of cheap electricity in Australia. We have ample resources of coal and gas. Traditionally, that has meant we have some of the cheapest power prices in the world. Cheap power means dear wages because cheap power helps improve productivity and provides businesses with the ability to invest in more capital and more highly skilled workers.


But renewable energy is somewhere between double and five times the cost of our fossil based resources. We sometimes hear that solar is now competitive with fossil fuel based electricity, to which I respond, 'Good. We can remove all of these subsidies we currently have to support renewable energy industries if that is the case.' But of course the Greens do not want that.


As the Productivity Commission stated about the renewable energy target in 2011:


The Commission has assumed that the LRMC—


long-run marginal cost—


of wind power is A$110/MWh. This is based on data from Frontier Economics (unpublished data) that suggested that the LRMC of wind power projects in Australia was mostly in the range A$100–A$120/MWh.


The average wholesale price of electricity was assumed to be A$50/MWh (section D.1). This implies that for wind power projects to meet their LRMC, the REC—


renewable energy certificate—


price would need to be around A$60.


That is hard for people to visualise, but let's try to visualise something a bit more tangible. If you have a 3.5-megawatt capacity wind turbine, you can potentially produce around 30,000 megawatt hours a year. You times it by 24 and by 365 and that gives you the potential megawatt hours that that turbine can produce a year. In this case, it is around 30,000. In fact, most wind turbines in Australia produce power only 30 per cent of the time, so you would only produce just over 9,000 megawatt hours a year. If the RET price has to be $60 a megawatt-hour to produce electricity, that means that that wind turbine would get $551,000 from other energy consumers.


When you next drive past wind turbines on your travels, just remember that each one of those turbines is getting something like half a million dollars courtesy of other energy users and customers in this country just to operate. The average life of a turbine is around 20 years. That means that they are getting around $10 million over their lifetime. That is $10 million courtesy of other power users. That is just one turbine. We are told that we are going to have to install more than 1,000 of these things to meet this target that we are going to legislate here.


Some argue, though, that the renewable energy target will deliver cheaper energy over time. That last bit is important—that it will be not now but 'over time'. Whether or not that will actually happen is a gamble. It is a risk. There is no guarantee in our legislation that it will become cheaper. Those who argue that this legislation is good for the economy are effectively taking one big punt that some forms of renewable energy will come down like manna from heaven in the future and be cheaper. That is a huge risk to take with our economy.


We have seen this play out before and it ended in tragedy then, too. For a long time people in Australia argued that we should have high tariffs on cars, clothing and whitegoods to help protect local industries and that, over time, those industries would become more competitive and we could remove the tariffs. Well, that never happened—and I fear the same result will occur with our renewable energy industry, if we maintain as high a renewable energy target as we have had. Worse, at least high tariffs did protect jobs in labour-intensive industries like manufacturing. But renewable energy is not a particularly labour-intensive form of energy provision. Much of the construction of the turbines occurs overseas, and, once the turbines are installed, there are very few people to work out around the turbines. Indeed, some of the management of the turbines that exist in Australia occurs overseas in the home country of their design.


So, if this legislation is not to create jobs, what is it for? One of the objects of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act is 'to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector'. However, renewable energy is a particularly costly way of doing that. According to the Productivity Commission, the implicit abatement cost of the large-scale renewable energy target is between $37 and $111 per tonne. This is a much higher price than the less than $15 per tonne that was recently achieved through the coalition's Direct Action policy. The Productivity Commission's estimate also assumes that renewable energy has no emissions itself, which is not correct, given that wind turbines, for example, are made of steel and need enormous amounts of concrete to hold them in place. Some estimates say that each megawatt of wind power produced takes around 460 tonnes of steel. Each megawatt of wind power also takes around 870 cubic metres of concrete. Now, let us compare that to something else—natural gas. Natural gas takes 27 cubic metres of concrete for each megawatt of power and 3.3 tonnes of steel for each megawatt. I wonder which one is more environmentally sustainable and friendly? The renewable energy target gets less bang for more buck. That is why I think it is a good thing that this bill reduces the target and exempts more industries from having to purchase renewable energy certificates. 


This new law will ensure Australia's emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries will be fully exempt from the increased costs imposed by the renewable energy target. These costs are imposed on industries like the aluminium industry in Central Queensland. There are two major aluminium refineries near Gladstone that employ almost 2,000 people. When Senator Milne talks about jobs and the aluminium industry, she might want to reflect on the 2,000 people in Central Queensland whose full-time jobs rely on cheap power. If we remove cheap power, they will no longer have jobs. Central Queensland is already doing it tough after a slowdown in the coal mining sector. It does not need the double whammy of pressure on its aluminium industry too. I welcome that this legislation will remove this sword of Damocles that has been hanging over the head of the Gladstone economy.


I have been fortunate enough to attend five hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines. Of course, I will not pre-empt the findings of that committee here today. But I have been to some of these people's homes; I have heard their genuine concerns about the impact of wind turbines. These people are normal, everyday Australians. I do not know if Senator Milne has gone and spoken to some of these people before she dismisses their concerns as ludicrous, but I think she probably should have an obligation to do that. You can go and talk to these people—people like Rikki Nicholson from Cape Bridgewater. He has had to move out of his home. He and his wife have moved out of their home because of the impact of turbines. There is Mr David Mortimer from Lake Bonney in South Australia. His wife has suffered so much that he sold his farm so he could live further away from the wind turbines. And Mr Ron Jelbart, from east of the Macarthur wind farm, has badly disrupted sleep, and his son also suffers similar complaints, including tinnitus, when he visits their farm.


The stories go on and on. Last week we had a couple, Clive and Trina Gare, who are hosts of wind turbines. They have been paid around $1 million by the wind turbine industry. But they say they would never have them again, given the problems they have caused them, particularly in terms of their sleeping. I do not know if wind turbines have caused these complaints. I am not a medical professional. But it does seem coincidental that there are so many people willing to go so far and at great financial cost to move from their homes and disrupt their lives because of the impact they feel has been caused by wind turbines. I certainly believe that there are legitimate questions, particularly around the impact of infrasound and low frequency noise that is generated by wind turbines.


What has concerned me more than the concerns of the community, though, is the dismissive and contemptuous attitude of some in the wind industry. Multiple wind turbine operators have said to the committee that because they comply with all regulations they have no further obligations to the residents that claim to be affected. That is not true. Under the long-established tort of negligence, persons engaged in supplying goods and services have a duty of care to take reasonable actions to prevent foreseeable damage occurring. Some in the wind industry are not being reasonable. A representative from one wind company tabled a cartoon belittling the complaints of affected residents to the Senate committee. A cartoon! Another wind industry staffer has tweeted that those complaining are 'nutters'. This is not the behaviour of an industry that is taking their responsibilities to the wider community seriously. 


Given that the wind industry does not seem to be serious about taking their obligations into account, we should be. We should not be giving each wind turbine $500,000 a year through this legislation without then making sure that they are not doing harm to people and causing adverse health impacts. While the wind industry does not seem to believe that it has an obligation to do no harm, I think we do. Until we know more about the impact of wind turbines, particularly the impact of infrasound and low frequency noise, we should have a moratorium on the accreditation of new wind turbines under this legislation. Under division 3 of this legislation, the regulator has the power to accredit new wind turbine operators. That should not occur until we understand the full impact of these things. It should be on our watch that we make sure that we do not do harm to people. We must do more research into this before we go down the path of funding through enormous amounts of government subsidies, or legislation that imposes subsidies, that potentially cause harm.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:28):  I was very interested in the contribution by Senator Canavan. If he does believe what he has been saying about wind turbines, then I suspect we will see an amendment from him to that effect in this debate.




Senator Cameron:
  From the doormat?




Senator LUDWIG:
  I will not go into that. I do call them that myself every so often, but I do not think they will do anything significant in this area. But can I remain on point. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 is a further testament of the Labor Party's commitment to the renewable energy sector and to provide certainty for the industry going into the future. I want to note that this has been a drawn-out process. The Howard government back in 2000 started the process. It was well received then, so it is surprising to me now to hear the contributions the National Party and the Liberals opposite are making.



Sitting suspended from 18:30
 to 
19
:
30





Senator LUDWIG:
  I am led to believe the National Party, if not the Liberal Party, are crabbing away from their policy position on this. The bill will ultimately reduce the large-scale renewable energy target—LRET—from 41,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 to 33,300 gigawatt-hours, with this level to be maintained until 2030. It will allow for a full exemption to be provided for electricity used in prescribed emissions-intensive, trade exposed activities so that they do not need to purchase and surrender large-scale generation certificates. It will remove the requirement for two yearly reviews of the operation of the RET scheme and replace it with annual statements by the Clean Energy Regulator on the progress of the RET towards meeting new targets and the impact it is having on household electricity bills. As I have outlined, and the bill will include native forest waste as an eligible renewable energy source.


When it comes to the renewable energy issue more broadly, Labor has strong record in supporting renewable energy. Labor's renewable energy target has been a success not only for the environment but also for jobs and the economy. Under Labor, we saw jobs in the renewable energy sector triple and a huge investment of $18 billion in hydropower plants, wind farms, solar farms and the development of renewable technologies. This industry employs 21,000 people and had been growing well up until the election of—you guessed it—the Abbott government.


Renewable energy and especially solar energy was a particular focus of the previous Bligh Labor government as well. Together with federal Labor policies, the great state of Queensland now leads the nation with almost 33 per cent of Australia's total solar PV capacity. Queensland is also home to the highest number of renewable energy jobs, with more than 6,500 of the 21,000 jobs I mentioned. Again, it is leading the nation. Unfortunately, we saw the previous Newman government attack the successful take-up of solar energy in Queensland with the cutting of the solar feed-in tariff scheme. Fortunately, now we do not have to worry too much about Mr Newman inflicting any more damage to the renewable sector. He went the same way as many before him who made bad decisions.


During Labor's time in office, we saw a drop in Australia's electricity sector emissions of seven per cent and rooftop solar grew from only 7,000 to around 1.2 million. It is an extraordinary and significant increase, which is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels while saving people money at the same time. Globally, investment in renewable energy grew by 16 per cent last year. In one of the largest economies in the world and in one of our biggest trading partners, China, we saw that investment in renewable energy went up by 33 per cent.


In 2013, at the end of the previous Labor government, we saw Australia ranked as No. 4 in the world for being the most attractive place to invest renewable energy in the world. We are now at the 10th spot. We have dropped. Why? It is because this government talks the talks but does not follow through with any of the actions. The statistics reveal that this government is not serious about renewable energy. You had Senator Canavan's extraordinary contribution this evening. One would think that he was arguing against renewable energy at all, but I will leave it to people to make their own judgement. The RET was an important part of Labor's clean energy package and that is why Labor has been fighting against the Abbott government's attacks on renewable energy for the past 18 months.


On the amendments to this legislation, the original version of this scheme was introduced by the Howard government back in 2001 and expanded by Labor in 2009 and 2010. The renewable energy target has enjoyed bipartisanship for more than a decade. That is, until the climate sceptic Mr Abbott was elected and decided to systematically dismantle climate and renewable energy policy in Australia. We know that in September 2009 Mr Abbott told a Liberal Party dinner in Victoria that he thought the science of human caused climate change was 'crap'. Just a few days ago, on 2GB with Alan Jones, Mr Abbott made these extraordinary remarks. I quote the program:


""Well Alan look, I do take your point about the potential health impact of these things,"" Mr Abbott said.


""When I've been up close to these wind farms, there's no doubt, not only are they visually awful, they make a lot of noise.


""What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E, the number of these things that we are going to get in the future,"" he said.


""Now I would frankly have liked to have reduced the number a lot more.""


The point is that we know the motive of the Prime Minister and his government, because we know they are fundamentally opposed to climate change. They do not believe that they should be doing anything in this area at all, whilst the rest of the world is moving towards the greater use of renewable energy and a greater investment in renewable energy technologies. Why? Because it makes smart business sense. That would mean that this government would also have to make smart business decisions, but I do not think it is capable of doing just that.


Mr Abbott decided to break his promise to the Australian people on the renewable energy target, just like we have seen him break so many other promises since he has been elected. The $600 million commitment for solar roofs in towns and schools was cut down to just $2 million in last year's budget. ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, had its funding severely cut after the government failed to abolish it.


The review of the RET, led by a known climate sceptic, which caused uncertainty in the industry, was a shocker by this government. However, even the PM's own review, and even the climate sceptic himself, found that the current renewable energy target of 41,000 gigawatts will put downward pressure on household prices in the medium to long term. The current RET of 41,000 gigawatts is driving investment in Australia's renewable energy industry. The RET is reducing Australia's carbon pollution, and the renewable energy target is creating jobs in Australia.


The review was a political exercise, which ultimately recommended the abolition of the RET, or severely cutting the target. Despite this, the findings spoke for themselves. He found that he could not change the facts. He changed the ending, but that is not surprising when you look at the record of this government and what they sought the reviewer to find. As to the benefits to the economy and our environment, the facts spoke for themselves. They were clear and unequivocal—they create jobs, investment and opportunity. What we have seen here on display by the Abbott government, once again, is the extremism of the Abbott government's agenda. It is not even a purely neo-con, or a traditional centre-right, agenda. Their party seems to have a very confused agenda to an outsider when it comes to environmental policy.


We see them oppose a market-based mechanism for dealing with carbon pollution—a price on carbon that was to be determined by the free market. Instead, their policy—to the extent that you could call it a policy rather than a collection of actions—is quite Stalinist in style. It is central government controlled, hugely expensive and taxpayer funded—the so called Direct Action policy. Even the Greens do not support such a wasteful government funded program. Let me be kind though. It did take them a couple of times to finally support an emissions trading scheme, but at least they got there in the end. Now, we have a policy mechanism in the target that is obviously working—it is creating jobs; it is encouraging development of new technologies; and it is not a burden to the householders of Australia. Those opposite would argue, and continue to argue, the mistruths that renewable energy costs householders. It flies in the face of the facts found even by their own reviewer, all reasons why the government should support the renewable energy target. But, instead, their twisted agenda sees them being dragged kicking and screaming to this outcome. I would have thought that they might have ignored the National Party in this debate, but it seems they have let the National Party off the leash when it comes to renewable energy, particularly wind farms. I suspect that they have been able to garner a leave pass.


Ultimately, I will remind you once again, the outcome will see almost 25 per cent of Australia's energy generation come from renewable sources by 2020. It is a great outcome for the fight against climate change. The survival of this and the work that will be put into this is worthy of note. It is part of a wider set of policies that need to be implemented to see Australia leading the world on the development and generation of renewable energy. What I worry about is that this government is not committed to funding the science and the work that will need to take us into the future of clean energy. From this side of politics, it shows Labor's willingness to negotiate an outcome that is in the interests of the country—not just opposing the government for the sake of opposition.


The Abbott government walked away from more than a decade of bipartisanship on this issue, which was disappointing. If we are going to make a difference in this field, we need bipartisanship. I would encourage the Liberals to ignore the Nats on this one. We have fought the government's attempts to completely get rid of the renewable energy target, and we have outcomes in this bill that will see RET retained for the future. It will see the extension of exemptions for emission-intensive trade-exposed activities such as the aluminium smelting industry. The Clean Energy Council has predicted the new target of 33 gigawatts will drive close to $40.4 billion in investment and create more than 15,000 jobs. This will provide certainty for the industry so that it can start investing again in jobs and development.


Through Labor's negotiation, we achieved: no change to the small-scale solar scheme, which includes rooftop solar, solar panels for small businesses such as nursing homes and all the other small businesses that have invested in this technology; full exemption for emissions-intensive trade industries, which relieves some pressure on those industries that are enduring a downturn and difficult times; and the removal of two-yearly reviews, which provides the long-term certainty the industry so desperately needs to survive and to thrive.


As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, Labor will oppose the government's proposal in this bill for the burning of native forests as part of the RET. Burning native forests for energy is neither clean nor renewable. The government's definition of waste in this legislation in relation to native trees is not just woodchips but can include large parts of tree as well as entire trees. I would have thought that the Abbott government would have learned from the Howard government and from the Tasmanian experience. If you allow that to occur, you do not have the whole of the tree being used properly; you end up with the whole of the tree being used for wood waste. The experience there needs to be very carefully considered. 


The Abbott government, as in all its dealings with environmental policy, does show its true colours here—just as we saw with its dismantling of Labor's clean energy package, its abolition of the ETS, its attempts at abolishing ARENA, its attempts at abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and its attempt at abolishing the renewable energy target. We now see, in this compromise from the government, that it cannot help but to include the provision which allows for the burning of our native forests. Of course, sneaking in this provision, which vandalises our environment and does not protect it, shows who really sit opposite in this debate—climate changes deniers, environmental vandals and those with only the interest of big business in their mind, and not a balanced view of how you could create new jobs and new technology, and support environmental outcomes. 


Because of the principles which we hold in the Labor Party, the environment and the jobs of the future, in renewable energy generation and development, will be a part of Australia's future—despite this government, I suspect. This government will find that it will not be able to sustain its unsustainable position in the light of significant advancements, because—as people have also spoken about—renewable energy is here to stay.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:46):  I am very relieved to finally rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. It has been a long time coming. Sadly, the government's failure to keep their word means we have landed in a far inferior position than the one that we were in two years ago. The government have held the industry to ransom. While I do not doubt that some on the other side would be happy to watch while the renewables industries die a slow death, Labor cannot accept this. For this reason, we have taken the advice of the industry and agreed to the government's revised target.


The story of the RET under Tony Abbott is an unfortunate one, and one that brings into stark relief the sad reality that we simply cannot trust the government to keep their promises. Before the 2013 election, there was no question about the future of the RET. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and both sides of politics recognised the vital role it could play in transitioning Australia to a low-carbon economy. In fact, before the election the Prime Minister could not have been clearer when he said 'There will be no change to the RET'. There were no disclaimers, no caveats and no mentions of any sort of a 'real 20 per cent'. But, very soon after gaining the keys to the ministerial wing, those opposite had a dramatic about-face. Earnest statements about the importance of renewable energy quickly gave way to mutterings about high electricity prices and possible oversupply. This is despite the fact that these claims simply are not borne out by the evidence or the expert modelling undertaken for the government's own RET review. 


Of course, this was undoubtedly the plan from the beginning. It is a plan we have seen play out again and again in all number of policy areas. Clearly the government's pre-election plan was to say whatever it liked before election day, and do whatever it wanted after it had it won the ballot—never mind the fact that the latter bears no resemblance whatsoever to the former. And that is exactly what happened in the case of the renewable energy target. Within months, the government's rock solid-support for this successful—and previously bipartisan—policy evaporated, and the war on renewable energy began in earnest.


Other speakers here and in the other place have clearly laid out the benefits of the RET to the environment, to the economy, for power prices and for regional economies. They have noted the vital importance of the RET in reducing CO2 emissions and in allowing Australia to transition to a low-carbon economy. They have recognised the enormous benefits in terms of job creation in a sector that employed 20,000 Australians in 2014. They have rightly pointed out that not only does the RET not have any impact on the federal budget but it will actually reduce power bills for consumers within five years. 


I will not go into any more detail in these areas. Instead, I would like to spend a bit of time discussing one of the most recent and, quite frankly, the most astounding comments we have seen on the RET. It came from the Prime Minister himself. Last week, the Prime Minister dropped the mask and revealed once and for all the Jurassic depths of his opposition to renewable energy—in this case, the wind industry. When grilled by the notorious antiwind campaigner Alan Jones, the Prime Minister did not hold back, boasting about government cuts to the RET and his goal to: 


… reduce the growth rate of this particular sector as much as the current Senate would allow us to do.


Not only that, but the leader of this country even went as far as to say that he wished the RET had never been introduced. 


This is absolutely astounding stuff. A sitting Prime Minister boasting about setting policy in order to shut down investment. The very same Prime Minister who, despite telling the world that Australia was open for business under his leadership, has presided over a dramatic 90 per cent fall in investment in renewable energy, and the same Prime Minister who admitted he never supported the very policy he took to the people of Australia before the election. So what justification did the Prime Minister give for his verbal trashing of the wind industry? Nothing beyond his own, very subjective belief that wind farms are 'visually awful' and 'noisy'. 


Over recent months, I have gathered a reasonable amount of knowledge in this area, as Labor's representative on the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines 


While it is undoubtedly true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I think you would be hard-pressed to find too many people who would choose to spend time next to the belching, toxic smoke of a coal power station rather than a wind turbine.


Personally, I actually find them quite graceful, even majestic. And I say that as someone who has stood directly underneath quite a few wind farms. And, despite what the Prime Minister says, in my experience you could easily hold a conversation at normal volume, right at the base of a wind turbine. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that the Prime Minister has only ever been close to one turbine in his life—one turbine, which he used to damn a whole industry and, in so doing, put thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in future investment at risk. It is unbelievable. But the Prime Minister was not content to voice his own coal-addled opinion on aesthetics and sound. He went further. And in so doing he put himself at odds with the medical and scientific community when he asserted that wind farms have 'potential health impacts'. Despite what the Prime Minister and some others in this place would like you to believe, there is simply no credible evidence to support this. There have been 25 reviews across the globe into this issue and not one has found evidence that wind farms are detrimental to human health.


The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, our peak health research body, released a peer-reviewed paper in 2010, which found no robust scientific evidence to link wind turbines with adverse health effects.


Given ongoing concerns from some sections of the community, in 2012 the NHMRC convened a Wind Farms and Human Health Reference Group, released a draft information paper and commissioned Adelaide university to undertake a review of scientific literature on the health effects of wind farms, which came to similar conclusions as those in the 2010 paper. The most recent NHMRC statement entitled 'Evidence on wind farms and human health', states: 


There is no direct evidence that exposure to wind farm noise affects physical or mental health.


Similarly, the Australian Medical Association position paper on the issue, states:


The available Australian and international evidence does not support the view that the infrasound or low frequency sound generated by wind farms, as they are currently regulated in Australia, causes adverse health effects on populations residing in their vicinity. The infrasound and low frequency sound generated by modern wind farms in Australia is well below the level where known health effects occur, and there is no accepted physiological mechanism where sub-audible infrasound could cause health effects.


Last year, Canada's national health body, Health Canada, undertook the largest ever epidemiological study of wind farms. The study incorporated over 1,200 households, living varying distances from wind turbines, some as close as 500 metres away. This $2.1 million study included a peer-reviewed methodology, medical expertise, self-reporting and objective health measures including hair cortisol, blood pressure and heart rates, and 4,000 hours of acoustic data. It, too, found no link between wind farms and human health.


In fact, there is not a peak medical organisation, national health regulator and/or national acoustics body in the world that holds the position that wind farms can damage your health, despite wind farms being in operation for four decades globally. And this is borne out by real-world experience.


During a recent hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines, in Melbourne, the world's largest turbine manufacturer Vestas testified that, of their service and operations workforce of 5,500 people across the globe, not one complaint had been made about the health impacts of wind farms. Despite spending eight hours a day, day in and day out, month after month, working in or around wind turbines, not one person complained of health problems. And yet our Prime Minister seems to think that he knows better. It is truly astounding that the leader of this country would go out in public and spout such unsubstantiated nonsense. It is even more astounding that the Prime Minister was so willing to dispense with the facts in order to further his vicious war on renewable energy.


The Prime Minister's comments are not only ignorant but also extremely reckless. There is a growing body of credible research which shows that exposure to anti-wind-turbine messages can have a significant impact on people's perceptions of the impacts of wind farms on their health. The Prime Minister's words will only serve to increase anxiety in regional communities and will create uncertainty in an industry that offers billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs.


I will finish soon, because we need to salvage the message that this government has made of the renewable energy industry. And we need to do it urgently.


In my home state of Tasmania, in my home region on the north-west and west coast, we could have 200 workers on the ground right now building the proposed wind farm at Granville Harbour. The wind farm has secured all the necessary approvals and even had investor interest, until the government broke its promise that there would be no changes to the RET.


Two hundred jobs might not sound like a lot in the Prime Minister's northern Sydney electorate, but I can guarantee that it will mean a lot to the people of north-west and west Tasmania. I would urge all senators in this place to think of the thousands of regional jobs that will be created only when this legislation is passed and of the thousands of potential jobs that may never come to be if it is not.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:58):  It is with a sense of dismay that I rise tonight to speak on this bill, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015, because this debate did not need to occur. What we are seeing here is the expression of the Abbott government's opinion that Australia is running the risk, out to the year 2020, of having too much renewable energy, too much clean energy on our network and that that is an enormous problem that needs to be dealt with by bringing forward legislation.


We know for an absolute fact, because they told us—they do not even try to hide it any more; for a little while they did, but now they have got so drunk on whatever it is they are up to in their party room that they just say it flat out—that they wanted to completely abolish the renewable energy target, just like they wanted to knock over the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and abolish ARENA and any of the mainstays of this industry in getting it on its feet so that it can employ people, drive down greenhouse gas emissions and set us up for the electricity generation industry of the future. The Abbott government has been absolutely, almost forensically, determined to wipe it out. That is what brings us to this debate tonight. 


Can you imagine people in future times looking back on this debate to discover a government doing everything in its power to prevent us from an oversupply of clean energy when the rest of the world is doing the opposite—albeit in fits and starts because there are people like Prime Minister Tony Abbott in all those other countries as well. In Saudi Arabia, in Canada and in other places; in the United States, various Tea Party operatives in the pay of fossil fuel industries: such people are scattered throughout the industrialised world. But imagine looking back in the Australian context and realising that the government had set out to prevent us from having too much clean energy. It is absolutely unbelievable. Trying to bankrupt clean energy companies and throw people out of work shows not simply indifference but active hostility to renewable energy.


What it amounts to, though, when you try and work out exactly what is going on here, is that the Australian electricity network is dramatically overbuilt. Apparently, we have built 9,000 megawatts or nine gigawatts of capacity that this country does not need. Basically, we have built too many generators, based on uncritical hallucinations about future energy demand—that it was just going to keep growing and growing; that energy efficiency would never play a part; that home solar would never play any kind of part; that, at a household level, people would not start getting serious about doing their bit. But that is all happening. It was thought that we would simply continue to grow forever, so we have this extraordinary overcapacity.


In WA, it amounts to an estimated $1 billion worth of generators that we do not need, with more than $300 million spent on resurrecting the old, polluting Muja coal fired power station just outside of Collie. You might as well have just shovelled 300 million bucks into the boiler and torched it. This is under the same Barnett government that, while it is not entirely responsible—because some of this stuff has a fairly long lead time—has presided over the destruction of the state's finances, with the loss of its triple A credit rating. They are now crying poor. They have abandoned public transport projects and all sorts of other projects because the state's finances are in ruins, having spent more than $1 billion on electricity generators that we do not need. 


This is where we start to get a bit of a hint about what the Abbott government is up to. What exactly do we think is the motivation of the Abbott government in exercising such forensic hostility in trying to wipe out this industry? If you go looking for motive, you could be forgiven for not looking any further than Mr Maurice Newman, who is the Chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. This is not some nut-case blogger ranting on the Infowars website; this is the guy who runs the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. He has said:


This is not about facts or logic. It's about a new world order under the control of the UN.


He thinks it is effectively about some kind of communist de-industrialisation of Western powers as part of some strange, manifest agenda that is never quite spelt out. 'It's about a new world order under the control of the United Nations.' This is somebody whose advice the Prime Minister take seriously. But I think we need to look a bit further than Mr Newman.


I think we could take Mr Abbott's comments to Alan Jones on the radio the other day at face value. For obvious reasons, other senators have also quoted those comments in this debate. He said:


What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E—


I guess he spelt it out. I did not hear the interview myself; I could not bear it—


we reduced the number of these things that we're going to get in the future. Now, I would frankly have liked to have reduced the number a lot more—


he is talking about wind installations. And then Alan pats him on the head, saying:


Good—well, you're the boss.


Mr Abbott continued:


But we got the best deal we could out of the Senate. And if we hadn't had a deal, Alan, we would have been stuck with even more of these things.


The renewable energy industry, trying to negotiate in good faith with these people to get a better outcome, are getting certainty; they are getting certainty—and this is why I think it has been a mistake to try and bargain for a reduction in the renewable energy target—that the government is trying to wipe them out. The government is trying to put them out of business. 


In the Western Australian context, that effectively means the loss of about 1,000 jobs, and I will put some figures to you now about how we arrived at that number. This government has effectively, through their renewable energy policies and in conjunction with their state Liberal and National colleagues, destroyed 1,000 jobs in Western Australia: a slow clap for you all! From a peak of under 1,500 jobs in solar and 360 in wind, we have fallen to around 730 in solar and 50 in wind in 2013-14. You destroyed 1,000 jobs in an industry that we urgently need to get on its feet because of the employment potential of getting the local manufacturing sector up and running. In WA, with the end of the mining-construction boom and the settling into the operations phase, people are leaving northern towns in droves and they are leaving regional areas, and sections of the Western Australian economy are beginning to cave in. You would think that this government that prides itself on its economic credentials would be doing everything that it can to support new industries of the future. I do not know what the national figures are; others senators will speak to those. But you have destroyed 1,000 jobs in Western Australia. Congratulations!


The Climate Council has shown that, over the last year, global employment in renewables grew by 13 per cent and, in Australia, renewable energy jobs fell by roughly the same amount. The International Energy Agency reports that renewable energy continues to rank as 'the fastest growing power source'; yet, in 2014, investment in Australia fell by 35 per cent overall and 88 per cent in large-scale projects. 


So, this is not just rhetoric, a kind of unhinged rhetoric, from people like Mr Maurice Newman. This is actually deadly serious. This is industry policy playing out. This is very large donors in the oil, gas and coal industries who bankrolled the government into office and basically bought the executive of a major political party now carrying out their agenda—and it is sketched out in reasonable detail in the IPA's hit list of 100 things they would like to see done to the country—almost forensically and destroying an industry competitor. This is not because renewable energy is a failure, not because it is too expensive and not because it does not work. It is because it works too well—not just overseas, but right here in Australia. WA is the second highest greenhouse polluter per capita after the Northern Territory, and, thanks to the Barnett government, when we abolished the state-based renewable energy target from 2011-12 greenhouse gas emissions in Western Australia are set to double. This is over a period of time when Mr Hunt thinks he can waive his hand magically and somehow see us be brought into line with out international commitments.


In 2011 the state government also scrapped the feed-in tariff scheme for homeowners who installed solar panels. We just produced, at home, our second annual iteration of the solar postcodes report, which maps something a little bit unusual—something that is a bit counterintuitive—for Western Australia. It is that Western Australian households, with other families from around the country, want to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing for environmental reasons, but, significantly, for cost reasons as well. I guess the myth, at least from the Liberal-National side of the chamber, is that clean energy and home-installed power stations—rooftop PV—is a plaything of the wealthy. But when you look at the numbers for the families and the households in Western Australia that are installing solar PV it is inversely correlated with the median wealth of the postcode. It is low income and outer-metropolitan suburbs that are doing their bit, and it is the government that has actually become the block. It is not simply indifference at work here. It is hostility. And we know why. It is because renewable energy is competing a little bit too well with the people who helped put you into office. We are talking about 1,080 jobs in WA alone.


Around the country the writing is on the wall. It is happening around the world as well, but we have seen some pretty vivid examples here in Australia in the last little while. Coal is on its way out. It is not that it is good for humanity. Go to Morwell in the middle of the fire—you could not breathe the air—and tell people how good coal is for humanity. The Greens have gone to the Victorian, Queensland and New South Wales state elections talking about and proposing a structured, phased closure of coal power that keeps the workforce engaged and employed through staged rehabilitation of mine sites, while you can start training people and working for a transition. There is no reason at all why the sites of the coalmines and the big generators in Australia, whether it be in the Hunter, in the Latrobe or in Collie in Western Australia, cannot be the sites of the clean energy technologies of the future, because no-one in their right mind is going to walk away from billions of dollars worth of sunk costs in transmission infrastructure in each of those three places. This is where we can be generating the renewable jobs of the future. But the government has its back turned, not through—as far as I can tell—any kind of strategic assessment of where energy reform in this country needs to go, but through simple, blind pigheadedness and refusal to admit that the world has changed.


Coalmines are closing anyway. In the last month and a half we have seen Anglesea close in Victoria and Alinta's Leigh Creek plants close in South Australia. Before that, it was Redbank, in New South Wales. Who is it going to be next? Maybe it will be Hazelwood. If you do not have a transition plan for the workforce they are thrown on the discard pile. Why is it that we are the only people talking about a structured transition for these workforces, rather than abandoning them to the inevitability that the industry is on its way out—not because of government policy, but despite it? They are being outcompeted by electricity generators that need no fuel. Once the capital is installed they run for virtually nothing. That is the game changer that you appear to have failed to understand. That is why we stand here tonight debating the destruction or the attempted sabotage of the clean energy sector—not through any kind of mysterious ideology, but, I think, through the hardheaded business pragmatism of the dying industries of coal and those in the gas industry who think they are some kind of viable replacement because they are slightly less bad than coal.


Who gets to be collateral damage along the way? It is the native forest ecosystems of this country. This is a plan that will increase logging in out native forest estate. This is something that I speak about from direct experience in Western Australia, having been involved in the very late stages of the campaign to get the chainsaws, the bulldozers and the scrub rollers out of the old-growth forests in the south-west of Western Australia. Most Western Australians thought that was case closed. And good on the Gallop government, with the support of the Greens at the time in 2001, for actually bringing an end to very large-scale clear-felling in the old-growth forest estate in the karri forest and in the jarrah forest. Most Western Australians figured that was case closed and that the job was done. They walked away and they had a rest. People had been working on that campaign for 30 years, and they went off and did other stuff. In the meantime, the destruction of our native forest continued in smaller pockets and in areas arguably not considered technically old growth, because they might have been logged by a handsaw 60 years ago. The destruction continued of the forest ecosystems that support the wildlife, support the rainfall patterns and ultimately support the biodiversity that supports us and supports our economy. And this area in Western Australia we are speaking of is one of just 31 global biodiversity hot spots. The south-west forests of Western Australia are like nowhere else in the world, and we are seeing localised extinction cascades already. It is predicted that at current rates of habitat loss we will see Carnaby's Cockatoo become extinct by 2020. As it is in Western Australia, the current forest management plan will see the rate of logging increase—not decrease, but increase—into these dying markets in these customer countries that just do not want our woodchips any more, to an area equivalent to 10,000 Subiaco Ovals every year and an impact of around 200 square kilometres of native forest to be hit.


No wonder people are establishing blockade camps. People are mobilising and getting organised again to create some kind of defence against the insanity of industrialised logging. And just as we start to get to the point where we can have an intelligent conversation about a mature transition plan—there is that phrase again—to a plantation logging estate, what comes along but a proposal to feed native forest logs into incinerators. This is a perverse redefinition of renewable energy that has fooled absolutely nobody. This is nothing to do with forest waste, unless you are happy with the concept of 10 per cent of mature, old karri forest being knocked over and sent off for sawlog, and the other 90 per cent of those forest coupes being fed into chip-mills, pulped and burnt. Do you really consider 90 per cent to be waste?


The forest movement and the WA Forest Alliance—and I want to acknowledge their extraordinarily longstanding commitment, and that of their allies, the local people in the South West towns, to the defence of the native forests of the South West of WA—have recorded trees in excess of 300 years old. Trees older than the foundation of the city of Perth are being fed into chip-mills as waste and pulped. That is what we are dealing with. Trees that you cannot get your arms around—trees that five or six or seven people could not encircle—are being classified as waste, chipped and burned. What kind of government brings forward that proposal and perversely describes it as renewable energy? This has nothing to do with waste—at least not in the sense that you mean it; it is certainly wasteful in another sense.


Given that that is the package on the table, who in their right minds would support the Abbott government in this mad endeavour to destroy the clean energy sector just as it is starting to find its feet, and to sign off on the destruction of the native forests—not just those in the South West corner that I am particularly attached to, but the wild forests of East Gippsland, the rainforests of Tasmania, and the tall forests of New South Wales—who would throw the government that lifeline? Who indeed? Enter the Australian Labor Party. After listening to some of the speeches that ALP senators have delivered tonight—heartfelt, and no doubt sincere—you could be forgiven for thinking that the ALP was going to vote against this bill. But you are not; you are going to vote for it. You have thrown Prime Minister Tony Abbott a lifeline.


Having described at some length what is at stake, and the consequences, I can understand that, for a party that did everything it could to prevent the Clean Energy Act from coming into existence, and from a Prime Minister who said he wished that the Renewable Energy Target had never been legislated for, they have put their cards pretty clearly on the table—they are ambiguous and confused and pretty messed up on all sorts of other things, but they are crystal clear on the subject of what they think of the clean energy sector. But what on earth has got into the Labor Party that it would throw the government this lifeline? I have not heard that from any of the Labor senators who have chosen to speak to this bill.


We will be opposing this bill. When it gets to the committee stage, we will see what kinds of amendments are brought forward; I gather there is all sorts of churn, and that the amendments are still being frantically hacked. Why don't you adjourn this debate, take a very deep breath, and think about—not future generations, because it has become very apparent that you could not care less, but what about the present generation of young people—people who are coming through: kids of age five or six. Try and think about how they will feel in the 2050s and 2060s and 2070s, when they are our age—it is not that far away—if they pick up the transcripts from tonight's Hansard and read about the time that the Australian government, with the support of the opposition, legislated against the possibility of installing too much clean energy.


There is still time for a rethink. And I really hope, for the sake of the young people in all of our lives and the young people in the lives of those who might be following this debate from outside, that there is a rethink—that we come to our senses collectively as a legislature, and do what is demanded of us; that we move forward with the transition, that we do not dig our heels in and try and cling to a past that we have well and truly outlived. It is time to move on. Protecting and extending the Renewable Energy Target and guaranteeing the expansion of this industry and the jobs that it can provide—that is our job. That is what we should be doing in here—not clinging onto the technologies of the past that have brought us such risk; such extraordinary present-day and near-future risk.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (20:18):  I rise to make a few remarks on this topic. One of the confounds in all the discussion on this theory is that, somehow, the free energy that comes from renewables is going to make life better for people, in terms of cheaper energy and more jobs. One of the things that interests me is looking at the question around jobs, and I look at the King Juan Carlos University in Spain, who did a study on the job outcomes of their focus on renewable energy—which were that for every job that was created in the renewable space on a sustainable basis, some 2½ jobs of traditional infrastructure and industries were destroyed. And so, whilst there were jobs created during the construction phase, long-term there was a net loss in jobs in Spain.


We also see the other confound in the argument that has just been put forward around the issue of energy pricing. In my home state of South Australia, we have the nation's largest percentage of renewable energy, and yet we also have the nation's highest power prices. One of the reasons that I think we should be concerned about the drive to continuously increase renewable energy is that we need affordable power pricing to keep industries going which employ people. Renewable energy at this stage, whether we are talking wind or solar, cannot provide baseload power and so, even where we see renewable energy providing an increasing percentage of baseload power, we still have to keep in reserve, if you like, the ability to provide baseload power from either coal or gas—in the case of South Australia—which means that as they lose market share to the taxpayer-subsidised renewable sector, their costs—which they have to amortise across the ability to maintain their potential to provide 100 per cent baseload power—increase continuously per unit of power that they are able to sell. And so we get to this perverse situation, where one day we may end up having to subsidise people who are burning fossil fuels in order to enable them to continue to provide that assurance of baseload power, because the renewable sector cannot. And so, whilst it is appealing at one level to hear the debate that endless amounts of sun means endless amounts of free energy, the reality right now is that for South Australia, increasing amounts for renewables—which on the one hand looks very attractive; but on the other hand we also have the highest power costs in the nation—has a detrimental impact on the ability of industry to still function, to compete in a global environment, and to employ Australians, and means that we see increasing pressure on the non-renewable sector, which is still required to provide that backup of the potential of providing 100 per cent of our baseload power.


So whilst over time we have seen governments of both persuasions invest in renewable energy—and I recall the coalition investing in things like solar near Whyalla in South Australia and geothermal in northern South Australia—the reality is that large-scale subsidy of renewable power has not delivered the nirvana that we are hoping for. This decision to look at reducing the target is an appropriate balance of saying: let's continue some investment in renewables, but let's also recognise that an unrestrained increase in those targets could well lead, as we have seen, to increasing pricing, which makes it more difficult for communities to continue to operate industries and to employ people, which sustains the very economy that we are hoping to be the basis of Australia's future in terms of innovation, manufacturing and jobs. For that reason I support the bill brought forward by the government.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (20:23):  I rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. Right across the country a shift is happening. Communities are ditching the old, destructive, polluting industry of the past and embracing the new, clean, innovative ways of the future. For the big polluters the future is bleak. For the rest the future is exciting, but now we are facing a choice: the old way or the new way. This deal, to reduce the renewable energy target and to include the burning of native forests for electricity within the target, is well and truly a backward step. The transition away from logging these centuries-old native forests is well underway. Logging of native forests is not where the jobs of the future are for these communities. 


I came into this parliament with some clear aims: to strive for happiness and health for humanity; to protect our land, water and air; and to work so that the incredible diversity of life that we share this planet with can be protected and can thrive and flourish. Travelling through my home state of Victoria, I have met countless people who share my aims. Among them are community-minded business people who are leading the way in the businesses of the future, employing local people, respecting the environment and giving people from around the world the chance to experience our unique environment. People like Dave Whyte in East Gippsland. Dave runs Wilderness Coast Adventures, which takes people on cycling tours through some of the spectacular natural landscapes of East Gippsland. But his business relies on the lure of cycling routes surrounded by pristine wilderness. Dave says they experience the occasional logging coupe now but would not want to see more. People want to experience the natural beauty of the area and breathe in the fresh air. No-one wants to go for a ride through a freshly logged logging coupe or through the matchsticks of a regrowth forest. 


Then you have farmer and tourist operator Ken Deacon, who has lived in Victoria's Rubicon Valley for over 40 years. Ken runs horse and bike riding tours through the forests in the Royston and Rubicon valleys, but he is struggling to cope with the level of logging. There are fewer and fewer areas of unlogged forest for his rides to travel through, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for his business to survive. 


Dave and Ken's stories reflect the potential for these communities. This potential is lost when we destroy our native forest, which is what this deal seeks to do. The same scenario is playing out around the country. Over the past 40 years native forest logging has failed to protect our environment and failed to protect jobs. We have reached the point where industrial logging in public forests has had its day. The industry is looking for a future, and that future is in plantations. The most backward thing we could do would be to hold up this transition; yet this deal, to include the burning of our native forests for electricity under the renewable energy target, does exactly the opposite. It is holding up an inevitable transition. The delay is at the expense of taxpayers, at the expense of everything that science tells us about the values of our native forests, and at the expense of communities like those of East Gippsland, south-eastern and northern New South Wales, south-west Western Australia and throughout Tasmania. And it does so while doing the opposite of the intention of the renewable energy target. 


Let's be clear: burning wood from native forests for energy is not clean energy. It does not reduce pollution. In fact it releases carbon into the atmosphere, speeding up climate change. This move would prop up and entrench an industry that is destroying our native forests. It is a desperate act from a government that is ignoring climate science in favour of their big business, flat-earther mates. 


Climate change is real. It is happening, and if we do not take serious action to dramatically, drastically and urgently reduce our carbon pollution, the devastation it will cause is unthinkable. Winding back our commitment to clean energy by reducing our renewable energy target completely denies this reality. Arguing that we need a reduction because the target now represents more than 20 per cent of our energy use is a wilful denial of the whole purpose of the target. Achieving a greater proportion of our energy through clean energy sooner rather than later is cause to celebrate. It gives us the ability to take the next step of increasing the target to closer to the aim of 100 per cent renewable energy that we know we must achieve as soon as possible to give humanity and the planet the best chance of a healthy future. 


Of course, by including burning wood from native forests for energy, it is worse than merely reducing the target to 33,000 gigawatt hours. Making the burning of wood from native forests for energy eligible for renewable energy certificates attacks the production of renewable energy on multiple fronts. Firstly, it reduces the number of certificates available for truly clean energy sources like wind and solar. Critically, it destroys the integrity—the clean, green brand—of renewable energy. Who wants to buy renewable energy when it has come from the logging of our precious native forests and has destroyed the homes of animals and birds like koalas, spotted quolls, swift parrots and powerful owls? But it gets worse. Climate scientists and campaigners alike know that when it comes to forests, the critical action to take when it comes to tackling climate change is to protect them—not to log them, but to let them grow old to keep soaking up and storing carbon, cleaning up our polluted atmosphere.


Minister Greg Hunt has a report on his desk that he so far has refused to release that shows that, if the forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria in the Great Forest National Park were protected rather than clear-felled, it would be the equivalent of stopping the pollution of 3.2 million tonnes of carbon every year and it would be worth at least $40 million per year to the Victorian government. You compare that with the massive subsidies, the loss of at least $5 million a year, for continuing to log the forests of East Gippsland. In stark contrast, allowing wood from native forests to be burnt for energy is going to drive the ongoing logging of our precious forests and the destruction of these important carbon stores.


We know that the Abbott government is not happy with this deal on the renewable energy target. The Prime Minister said just last week that he thought it an imperfect deal, and referring to the genuinely clean energy source of wind, he said, 'I frankly would have liked to have reduced the number a lot more.' So what is the government trying to get out of this deal? In addition to reducing the amount of clean energy Australians can benefit from, the government has tried for one big notch on their environment-destroying belt. Like a rundown car, the government wants to jump-start the native forest logging industry so that it can just go a few more kilometres. It might be dirtier and it might cost more to run, and everyone else has moved on to the next model, but the government is determined to stick to its 1950's ideology and prop up the industries of the past.


We have heard time and time again that this is just wood waste, but it takes only a quick look to realise that this is not waste at all. If it were only about sawmill waste then the regulations would only be about sawmill waste. If it were only about lower value wood products that cannot be sold elsewhere, there would not be an entire category in the regulations where 100 per cent of the logging coupe can be fed into the burners. If it were only about cleaning up tree heads and branches, then that would be what the regulations specified as well. If you go up to a logging coupe, you will see truck after truck with whole logs, but you have never and will never see a truck carrying timber offcuts, bark and branches that would otherwise be discarded—never. Why? Because it is simply not worth it to load it onto the truck and to pay the costs involved in transporting bark and branches. Any promises that biomass will be limited to otherwise discarded wood are simply nonsense, and this is the crux of the issue. What the government wants to burn is not wood waste at all. You can bet your bottom dollar that it will result in the destruction of whole logs and logs that could be sawn and that it will increase the logging of our native forests. It will send communities like East Gippsland backwards. So why does the government feel the need to prop up the industry? 


Native forest logging in Australia over the last 40 years has been dominated by the production of large volumes of low-value woodchips. We must be absolutely clear what this means, what industrial-scale clear-felling looks like. We have a situation where one logging coupe is an area of forest the size of Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens, or larger, and it is totally destroyed. A few isolated habitat trees are left, but otherwise it is a moonscape. Only 10 to 20 per cent of the trees felled are cut into timber, cut into logs that are considered suitable as sawlogs. The other 80 to 90 per cent are classified as residual logs and are sent off to the chipper. The area is then burnt and reseeded, mostly with eucalypts, losing the vital diversity that forest animals rely on, and most of the animals that lived in this forest die. Without the woodchipping industry, there would have been much less of our native forests destroyed, and more of the logs removed would have been used efficiently for sawn timber.


The industry is moving past the need for woodchipping. Sawmills are working out that it is actually possible to use smaller logs, younger logs, less perfect logs to create sawn timber. But, ridiculously, that is not the direction the industry has been pushed in. These logs do not even have a chance to be sawn. They have gone straight off to the chipper because of large contracts to export these woodchips overseas. But things have changed. Eucalypt plantations in Australia and overseas now produce better quality woodchips for paper pulp and do not rely on the clear-felling of precious native forests. They are certified under the internationally recognised certification system of the Forest Stewardship Council. 


The market for the low-quality forest-destroying woodchips from Australia has crashed. The inclusion of wood from native forests in the renewable energy target is aiming to find a new market for these 80 to 90 per cent of logs that are removed from native forests, the so-called residual logs now so-called waste. So the industry is looking for a new market to justify the ongoing subsidised logging, and this new market is energy. It is aiming to turn hundreds of thousands of trees every year into pellets to be exported and burnt overseas. It is aiming at supporting the establishment of energy generation here and subsidising the establishment of such energy generation. I repeat: this is not about waste. Let that be absolutely clear. If it were about the tree branches, the bark, the tops of trees, then the legislation would exclude whole logs. It does not.


It is no surprise then that some of our biggest polluters are lining up to cash in on this deal. Indeed, one of our filthiest power stations, Hazelwood, in the Latrobe Valley, already has accreditation to use wood waste under the renewable energy target. The Prime Minister describes wind turbines as 'visually awful'. I would invite him to visit the Hazelwood coalmine, which burned for 45 days and spread ash over the entire region. Why would Hazelwood go to the trouble of getting accreditation if they were not planning to burn wood from native forests? They are waiting to pounce. They know the Abbott government has got their backs. They are ready for rules to change so that all the native forests in Gippsland and East Gippsland become classified as wood waste. 


Across the country, in Western Australia, the proposed Manjimup power station could destroy the karri forest. So not only will genuine clean energy sources like solar lose out from the smaller target, but their biggest rivals—the big, old, hulking coal fired power plants pumping out dirty power—will start getting renewable energy certificates. The age of coal is over. Just as this backwards government is trying to prolong the transition from old growth to plantation logging, this legislation will be holding up the switch from these old dirty, coal plants to the clean energy of the future.


There is a different future for the timber industry, as there is for the renewables industry, and in fact it is much further advanced. We do not need industrial-scale clear-fell logging creating 'waste' in order to produce sawn timber. In fact, we already do not rely on it: 85 per cent of the wood products that we produce in Australia come from plantations, and this percentage is increasing. Plantations are much more efficient in their production of timber and they do not rely on the destruction of our precious native forests. The plantation sector looks on the native forest sector with bemusement. They scratch their heads and wonder why the government keeps on propping it up, subsidising it, when they are getting on with the business of creating high-quality wood products without any fuss, without huge community debate, without the environmental destruction. They do produce genuine renewable energy from their waste, because they are burning genuine waste—sawdust and sawmill offcuts—that they have grown themselves over the past 20 to 30 years. These plantation products are already eligible for renewable energy certificates, and we have absolutely no argument with them.


I want to specifically address the issue of production of sawn timber from eucalypt plantations, because that is what the purported justification for the ongoing logging of our forests comes down to in the end. Whenever the industry talks about logging, they do not show the devastation of clear-fell logging or the massive mountains of woodchips waiting to be exported from Eden or Burnie. They do not even show the pallets and tomato stakes—the low value products that the bulk of sawn timber from our native forests gets turned into. They show lovely polished floorboards, staircases, window frames and dining room tables. I would like to share with people that the largest eucalypt sawmill in the world, producing the largest volumes of desirable sawn timber, destined for high-value products like floorboards, staircases, window frames and dining room tables, is in Uruguay; it is producing wood from plantations of Australian 'flooded gum' that are only 20 years old. This mill and the whole industry have solved the problems of sawing young green wood that our industry has not been interested in solving, whilst they have access to wood from native forest. We can create sawn timber products from local eucalypt plantations; CSIRO researchers have outlined how it can be done. If and when we decide to stop the devastation of our native forests, the sawn timber industry will change and work out how it can be done here too, and we will be able to enjoy the beauty of wood products without the beast of forest devastation. But this happy outcome is not going to occur under this deal. 


This deal comes down to a choice: who do we want to prosper? Is it the big polluters who are set in their old ways of destroying our most precious natural assets at the taxpayers' expense? Or is it the hard-working small business owners like Dave Whyte and Ken Deacon? Is it the magnificent forests that provide us with so many benefits? Is it the clean energy innovators who are facilitating the shift to the economy of the future? I know who I side with. We must side with the community; we must not let the Renewable Energy Target to be tainted with the burning of our community's precious native forests.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (20:41):  This bill, known by many as the 'dead koala power bill', should not pass. What the government calls the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill is shameful. This is a saga that highlights how far the Abbot government will go to deliver for its corporate constituency. In this case, the Liberal-National corporate constituency is the fossil fuel industry and those companies that want to continue logging native forests. 


This bill trashes two things Australians love dearly: renewable energy and native forests, home to so much of our unique wildlife. The locals of south-east New South Wales tell me that they are not feeling much love at the moment. They are not feeling much love because of their deep concern about what this bill, if passed, will do to the forests and their pleasure at seeing more solar panels go up on homes and businesses in their area. The apt title of 'dead koala power bill' comes from south-east New South Wales and it resonates very deeply with them, as this bill would breathe new life into the now near-defunct Eden woodchip mill. This mill was just about to close; South East Fibre Exports had announced that its mill would no longer purchase timber from East Gippsland state forests. The general manager nominated international market pressures as the reasons. What he is referring to—and it is what Senator Rice has just gone into great detail about—is the poor woodchip prices and the contracting markets for native forest woodchips. 


There is a huge change going on in the industry. As Senator Rice also set out, the shift is to plantations. That is where the transition should be taking the industry. What is happening here tonight is a push to open up the burning of our native forests. South East Fibre and its Japanese owners, Nippon, would be cheering because their hope of revival looks like being delivered, and that is an enormous setback. Burning native forests in the name of RET opens the door to new and more destructive ways to make a profit from Australia's native forests. It is an issue of great concern. The Eden woodchip mill is owned by Japan's biggest paper manufacturer, and they could well be the first cab off the rank with a 5.5megawatt wood fired power station. The destruction that will then roll on in south-east New South Wales and north-east Victoria will be immense—the loss of precious habitat for the powerful owl, for koalas, for quolls should not be tolerated 


But it needs to be recognised that that destruction goes hand in hand with this legislation that is before us.


We can clearly see abuse of the RET system with this wood fired power station at Eden because it can only be viable with renewable energy subsidies. Again, as other speakers from the Greens have set out, the whole concept is founded on this misleading idea of so-called waste from the forest, misunderstanding the complexity of forest ecosystems and how much of that waste is actually part of the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle and how the forest seeds itself and feeds animals. A living tree growing in a forest in New South Wales, sadly, can now be classified as waste.


I warmly congratulate the many activists, campaigners and local residents who have taken up this issue because they know what it will mean not just for their local area but for all of us. To lose these forests, for them to be damaged, as they surely will be, should not be tolerated. I extend special congratulations to the South East Region Conservation Alliance, which brings together CHIPSTOP, the Bega Environment Network, ChipBusters, the Coastwatchers Association, the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, Friends of Durras, the Gulaga (Mt Dromedary) Protection Group, the far south coast branch of the National Parks Association of New South Wales and South East Forest Rescue. These organisations have put decades into this and have been able to protect much of the forest. Again, they can see what a setback this would be.


I will share with you some of the comments from these people that are most relevant to our debate tonight. Harriett Swift, a spokesperson for CHIPSTOP said:


We know that burning trees for power production is far from renewable and that in many cases emissions from burning trees are more intensive than burning coal … Biomass power will also produce a toxic cocktail of emissions that are harmful to the health of nearby communities.


Ms Swift said that:


… big old trees that would provide habitat for many native species are already scarce. Species of trees that are currently not logged will now be permitted for burning, including trees supporting koalas, black cockatoos and a multitude of threatened and endangered wildlife species.


I have been fortunate to have toured many of these forests with Ms Swift and many of the other people working in this area. I have been fortunate to see these species. These are beautiful forests. They need to regenerate in many areas. Many of them are stunning as they are. But none of them should be touched. None of them should be under threat from this bill.


Ms Heather Kenway, a spokesperson for SERCA, has said:


This government has no interest in preserving the precious little left of our intact native forests for wildlife, water, tourism and future generations … Will they wake up, like the Easter Islanders, only when the last tree falls? We need to leave NSW native forests in the ground to regrow and recover, switch to plantations for our timber needs, and formulate an energy plan for NSW that does not include 'Dead Koala Power'.


Noel Plumb from ChipBusters and Frances Pike from Nativesrule have said: 'Certification as clean energy under the RET will give the industry a public taxpayer subsidy while reducing funding support for genuine clean energy like wind and solar, a triple whammy as taxpayers subsidise forest destruction and the extinction of koalas and undermine renewable energy supplies.' They are important comments that I urge senators to consider and reflect on carefully.


I have just a few comments to make about the renewable energy target. As should be clear, wood waste from native forests should have no part in the RET. It was, in fact, removed as an eligible energy source in 2011. For four years the door was closed on burning forests in the name of renewable energy, and the RET went from strength to strength. As we know, it has been very successful in reducing emissions. I draw people's attention to the speeches of Senator Christine Milne and Senator Larissa Waters, as they have set this out in detail.


The federal government, however, have tried to blame rising electricity prices on the RET. This is where we start to get an insight into the corporate constituency of the government and what is going on here. Electricity prices doubled in the last six years, but the RET played very little part in that. The resulting array of interests stacked against the RET are considerable. We see this with electricity utilities, coal companies and forestry interests. What is going on here? Electricity prices have gone up. We have these companies complaining and obviously intensely lobbying the government. The Liberals and Nationals are getting an earful from these companies that are concerned about how this is all playing out.


So what do we see from the Prime Minister? He has become a crusader for coal, talking up the interests of corporate coal. What do we see from coal companies? We see a considerable and increasing level of generosity in the form of political donations. It was in October 2014 that the Prime Minister announced:


Coal is good for humanity …


These were his words at a time when the world is turning its back on coal. Yes, for many decades coal was critical to powering our country, but we now know the dangers involved. We now know that there is another way. But here there is a Prime Minister who goes to such lengths, using such loaded language, to try to paint coal as a great saviour. The Prime Minister went on to say that coal will be the world's main energy source for years to come. This does give us an insight into why he is waging war on the RET, because effectively that is what is happening with the legislation before us. He is out there really representing the interests of coal companies.


This is where it becomes relevant to look at the political donations from the resource industry to the government. I will go through what some of those contributions are. I am not suggesting some deals have been done; we do not know what discussions go on behind closed doors. But there certainly is a public perception that this money is not handed over for no reason. These are just some of the resource companies that have put in hefty donations to the coalition parties. Adani, the company trying to build Queensland's largest coalmine, donated $49,500 to the Liberal Party of Australia. Gina Rinehart donated $25,000 to one campaign alone. That was the foreign minister Julie Bishop's campaign. That money came through Hancock Coal Infrastructure Pty Ltd. The figures all come from the Australian Electoral Commission. Some of them are collated on the Greens 'Democracy for Sale' website. 


There is also a very useful reference from Australian Mining on the 7 April this year. They detail a whole range of resource companies that have been very generous to the Liberal and National parties. They have identified that the bulk of small donations from mining companies went solely to the Liberal and National parties. These companies each donated $20,000 to the Liberal Party: Silver Lake Resources, Northern Star, Whitehaven Coal and BC Iron. The NSW Minerals Council gave $32,250 to the coalition. Santos, infamous with regard to coal seam gas mining, donated a hefty $185,300 to the coalition. There was $500,000 donated—and this was just to the Liberal Party—that came from Nimrod Resources. That is a privately owned exploration company working around Bourke in New South Wales. These are just some of the donations that have gone to the Liberals and Nationals from various resource industries. This again is very relevant to this debate, because the RET has been a very important part of our work in addressing climate change in Australia. We are seeing another aspect of the work that was undertaken a few years back to deal with climate change being unwound—and this is just one more aspect of it that we are seeing tonight. We need to really look at the forces at play here. We do know that the renewable energy target was delivering jobs and investment around Australia. Most importantly, it was bringing down carbon pollution—the carbon pollution that is causing global warming. But this is all under threat now. It is under threat because those corporate interests are so close to this government—and this is a government that very much delivers for its corporate constituency.


We know this bill will allow the burning of native forest wood. We know that the Eden woodchip mill is set to get a new lease of life, as will many new power stations that will come into operation using this so-called new form of energy. Let us remember at this point that this is just a pre-industrial form of energy. We were burning forests hundreds and hundreds of years ago. That was what was happening across parts of Europe. We learnt that that was not necessary. So this is really turning the clock back in terms of how destructive this bill is. We also know that the coal industry, as it loses markets in many countries, is finding a safe haven in Australia under Prime Minister Abbott. That safe haven is about to be extended with these polluting power stations and these woodchip mills. Meanwhile, what will happen to the precious habitat for koalas, quolls, the peaceful owls, the beautiful bower birds, all those array of honeyeaters? I am a keen birdwatcher, so I have had the pleasure of going through many of these forests and seeing many of these unique birds and, periodically, but not so often, seeing the beautiful marsupials. Now so much of this is under threat, because, when you start burning forests, you are losing habitat, and habitat is what is critical for these native species. It will be an extraordinarily backward step if this bill goes through. It is the bill that should be trashed—not our environment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (20:57):  I too rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. First up, I want to place on the record that we need to consider this bill in the context of a government that has a completely irrational antipathy towards renewable energy. How do we know that? Let me count the ways! I will come back to this in more detail later, but I think this is really important for anyone looking at these debates in the future. I am sure they will pore over them and think: what were they thinking at the time with all the evidence that we know now about the direction in which we need to go in Australia? They will say: 'How could this have been?' We have Joe Hockey and his comments about hating wind farms. We have the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and his comments previously about hating wind farms. We have an ostensible review of the renewable energy target. In the face of a promise before the election that the government would not be changing the target, we have a review. The person appointed to run that review is someone who has a history of denying the reality of human-induced climate change and who has worked in the fossil fuel industry.


That said, I know that there are coalition MPs and senators who do not have an antipathy to renewable energy, who do understand the challenge that we are facing in relation to climate change. I would like to think that they are looking on in horror at the stance that is being taken resolutely by their leadership at this time in history. Particularly, if they have kids and grandkids, they know that the decisions that we are making today will inevitably have far-reaching consequences that we will all be held responsible for.


Here we have a bill that will reduce the target for the amount of renewable energy that we will have available to us in 2020 by 8,000 gigawatt hours at a time when countries around the world are doing the opposite. The worldwide investment in renewable power generation in 2014 was almost double that of fossil fuels. In early 2014, 144 other countries had renewable energy targets. I deplore the reduction of the renewable energy target from a target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020 to 33,000 gigawatt hours. I also deplore the fact this legislation extends heavy emitting, trade exposed industry. That will have the effect of shifting more costs onto households and businesses.


It is hard to reconcile when we think about the rhetoric of this government. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. I deplore the changes to regulations associated with this legislation that will allow native forests to be burnt again. Burning wood for energy to keep us warm, and later to heat water to create steam to turn turbines, was something that we did in the past. That was the Industrial Revolution, which saw forests destroyed to feed the fires and to drive the looms and machines. Who would have thought in 2015 that we would be returning to a situation where we would be classifying the burning of trees as renewable energy when we in fact have the technology and we have infinite supplies of sunshine and wind that can feel the energy needs of the future?


Not only that, but we risk burning whole logs in forestry furnaces in an irresponsible and desperate attempt to prop up an industry that is incapable of being economically sustainable without huge government subsidies. The amount of money that goes into propping up the forest industry is there on the public record. This is just one more example of that. The other thing that people need to understand is that this will also have the effect of undermining further the investment in the real clean energy, like solar and wind, because allowing the burning of biomass will actually take up a proportion of the target—about 15 per cent, to use the forestry industry's own figures.


But why is that? Why would a government create in uncertainty in the way that they have done? What evidence is there that they have been deliberately destabilising and undermining the renewable energy sector? Can it just be a matter of anaesthetics? We know that Joe Hockey hates wind farms. He told us in May last year when he was speaking to Macquarie Radio. He was asked about whether the government would target clean energy programs in its quest for massive spending cuts. He was very candid and said:


Well, they say get rid of the Clean Energy Regulator, and we are.


He then mounted an attack on wind farms, specifically the wind turbines operating outside of our national capital here in Canberra. He said:


Well, if I can be a little indulgent, I drive to Canberra to go to Parliament and so on, I drive myself, and I must say I find those wind turbines around Lake George to be utterly offensive and I think they are just a blight on the landscape.


He was not asked his opinion about the look of coal fired power stations or nuclear power stations.


But he is not on his own. It must be something about being on radio that encourages an intimate, sharing tone among members of the cabinet. We had the Prime Minister last week speaking to Alan Jones and confessing that he finds wind farms:


… visually awful … they make a lot of noise.


Our Prime Minister was very frank last week. He said:


What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E, we reduced the number of these things that we're going to get in the future. … I would frankly have liked to reduce the number a lot more but we got the best deal we could out of the Senate. … And if we hadn't had a deal, Alan, we would have been stuck with even more of these things.


Those are the Prime Minister's own words.


Then we have the review of the RET last year, where the hand-picked reviewer, Dick Warburton, had worked as a former Caltex chairman in the fossil fuel industry. He denies the evidence of human induced climate change and he is a pro-nuclear advocate. The cost of that review was over half a million dollars. The review's own RET modelling showed that keeping the renewable energy target at its level or expanding it further will actually push power prices down. Again, I ask this: when we think about the rhetoric of this government that professes to be so concerned about the cost of living for people in Australia, if they were really serious about relieving electricity bills, why would they not be lifting the target instead of reducing it?


We have a RET that is reducing pollution, creating jobs and bringing power bills down. Why would any responsible, thoughtful, orderly or methodical government set about to destabilise it? I think the answer comes back to something the quite a lot of people have explored during this debate; that is, the influence of mates. We have mate Maurice Newman, chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council, who talks about the RET, renewable energy and climate change not being about facts or logic but being concerned about a new world order under the control of the United Nations. We know that the government has many mates in the fossil fuel sector who stand to lose a lot if the push to renewable energy continues unabated.


Indeed, Minister Ian Macfarlane let the cat out of the bag last September when on ABC Radio he told us: 'There are about 9,000 megawatts, around five to nine coal power generators' excess capacity, which would be driven out by clean energy under the existing act.' Of course, this will happen. We are moving inexorably away from fossil fuels to a clean, decarbonised energy future. Trying to prevent it is as ludicrous as trying to turn back the tide. But what we see here is fossil fuel investors, fossil fuel companies and people who stand to make a lot of money out of the industry determined to prolong the carnival as long as possible and make as much money in the meantime. We have a government that is doing everything it can to support that endeavour.


Meanwhile, if we think about the effects on the people that this government purports to govern for—the people of Australia—we will have more landscape destroyed by coal and gas mining; we will have stranded assets; worse climate change; and we are reducing our readiness to transition to clean energy. As we approach the time, and it will happen—I fear, ultimately, without much notice in the end—when other nations de-carbonise and stop taking our coal, our gas and our fossil fuels. That is when we will have a workforce in Australia that will not be transitioned to the clean energy future and will be out of jobs on a mass level. Given the claims of this government to manage the economy, it is grossly irresponsible to jeopardise both existing jobs and the jobs of the future by ignoring every indicator that a transition is needed now. The evidence is there.


We have the clear evidence of the effect of the deliberately induced uncertainty on the part of this government. The uncertainty has shattered investment confidence. Investment in Australia in all renewables fell 35 per cent in 2014. It was the lowest level since 2009—this at a time when the rest of the world is moving ahead. In China there was an increase of 33 percent; in Brazil, an increase of 50 per cent; and Australia fell 35 per cent—it went 35 per cent backwards last year. In the solar industry employment fell 28 per cent—down by 5,000 jobs to 13,000 jobs, and prior to this government being elected there were 23,000 jobs in the solar industry. This is a government that purports to be good economic managers. Thirteen large-scale photovoltaic projects went on hold. Large-scale renewable investments fell 88 per cent to $240 million, back to 2002 levels. Only four wind farms were being built. Australia fell from number 11 worldwide in relation to large-scale renewable investments to number 39—behind Burma, Panama, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica and Honduras.


Now we have this proposal that we are debating—to reduce the RET. Supported by Labor—yes—to reduce the RET to create certainty, and the only certainty that we really have is that the RET will be reduced. There is certainty that any reduction in the 2020 target will reduce the amount of new renewable energy investment over the next decade. That is certain. As well as that, it is certain that this will significantly damage investments that have already been made in good faith, based on the existing legislation—the existing target. There is certainty that reducing the target will have a significant impact on the commercial viability of all current and future projects, because the value of revenue for large-scale projects is based on the value of renewable energy certificates created by the LRET scheme, and that is determined by the demand and supply dynamics of the market. If the 41,000 gigawatt-hour target is reduced, the market dynamics will fundamentally change and the value of RETs will decline. This will correspond to a material reduction in the revenue that a project would receive, and it will result in significant financial impact. This, again, is at the hands of a government that purports to be responsible economic managers.


I want to speak briefly now about the particular perspective of someone coming from South Australia, which I am proud to say is that renewable energy capital of Australia. We have the highest level of energy generated from renewable sources in the nation. If the RET is reduced—




Senator Singh:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. Whilst I acknowledge that South Australia is going ahead in leaps and bounds in renewable energy, Tasmania still remains the renewable capital of Australia.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Dastyari
):  There is no point of order. I will remind the Senator that frivolous points of order are not going to be tolerated in this Senate while I chair.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I must admit, it is a healthy debate to be having. I think that it is really important that we are vying to be the renewable capital of Australia. I have to say that the evidence is there that, indeed, South Australia is the renewable energy capital of Australia, and I will go onto establish why. South Australia has the highest percentage of homes with solar panels, at 23 per cent; the most energy sourced from renewables; and the most investment at risk—$2.9 billion of investments in clean energy, and there is a risk that that will go overseas if there is not enough certainty and if the RET is reduced. There are South Australian projects at risk. There is the Ceres wind farm on the Yorke Peninsula—a $1.5 billion investment, and more than 500 jobs. There is the Infigen Energy Woakwine wind farm in the south-east—150 jobs created. There is the Pacific Hydro Keyneton wind farm in the Riverland—more than 500 jobs created. We have Port Augusta, where recently there has been an announcement that the Alinta power stations—the two coal-fired power stations near Port Augusta—will be closed by 2018, which will, indeed, introduce the possibility that South Australia will become the first totally renewable energy state in Australia.


South Australia has 517 accredited solar installers; 16 wind projects of 561 turbines and 1,205 megawatts of capacity. Today, Tindo Solar, which makes the only Australian produced solar panels, and other solar industry representatives, are saying that there will be damaging job losses in South Australia—which is already experiencing significant job losses in many other areas of manufacturing—if the renewable energy target is changed and reduced. The predictions are that large-scale solar will beat wholesale coal power pricing anywhere in Australia by 2020 in less than five years.


When we come back to the closure of the coal fired power stations near Port Augusta, we also know that there is an extremely strong community push—from the residents, from the council and from many others—for a concentrating solar thermal plant. There has been a lot of work done on the feasibility of that plant, with a potential for baseload power to be created there using molten salt. It is a very exciting initiative. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community and, as I said, from the council, because there has been a long history of damaging health effects from coal fired power stations in Port Augusta. Moving to a solar thermal power station would be an amazing opportunity for South Australia to showcase baseload power. There would be jobs available for the existing power workers to be able to work there and there would also potentially be jobs in manufacturing, in creating the components—the mirrors and the panels—which would be used in any associated wind farms as well. 


There are a lot of good things happening in South Australia. It is absolutely imperative that those things are happening in South Australia, because it is a state where there are significant challenges in terms of other manufacturing. It is a state which the current government are ignoring at this stage. If they are insistent on going ahead and allowing the passage of this legislation to further undermine the renewable energy target, that will only make the situation far worse for South Australia. So I urge my colleagues to think seriously about this legislation, to think about the future and to think about what we are doing. I urge them not to be beholden by short-term interests in maintaining and propping up an energy source that we know has health effects, is contributing to climate change and is more expensive than the alternatives; I urge them to vote against this legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (21:16):  It gives me pleasure to rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. I particularly make some comments in relation to the government's addition to the scheme for the utilisation of biomass as part of the renewable energy sector.




Senator Singh:
  Already!




Senator COLBECK:
  I did say that I would give you something to interject about, Senator Singh. 


I have to say at the outset that it really mystifies me why the Labor Party appears to be so opposed to this. The Labor Party themselves, when in government, and the rural affairs committee in the House of Representatives, chaired by former member for Lyons Dick Adams produced a very good report called Seeing the forest through the trees. One of the recommendations in that report was that native forest should continue to be able to be utilised in the generation of renewable energy, as it was then under the regulations that stood at that point in time. Because of a deal done with the Greens, and because of the Labor Party not having the strength or the courage to stand up to the Greens in the circumstances that they were in in government at the time, the Labor Party brought in regulations to prohibit the use of native forest residue to be utilised and to qualify for renewable energy credits. 


There are claims being trotted around here by organisations such as The Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Environment Tasmania that this will bring devastation to the environment and to native species around the country. Yet that is not what happened when these regulations were in place previously. It is not what happened at all. So the suggestions of devastation from the Greens demonstrate that nothing has really changed about the Greens. 


The Greens will say absolutely anything to justify a particular cause at a particular point in time. We have had plenty of evidence of that. Obviously, they are doing it now; they are trying to demonise this particular initiative that the government has put forward. I recall that in the 1980s the Greens were actually campaigning against renewable energy in Tasmania. Bob Brown, who later became a senator and spent some time in this place, was campaigning against hydro-electric development in Tasmania. What was he suggesting as an alternative? Bob Brown, at that point of time, was actually suggesting the construction of coal fired power stations in Tasmania as an alternative energy source to renewable hydro-electricity. 


Senator Wright and Senator Singh were having a bit of a debate about how much renewable energy is produced in what states. I think that the correct number is that Tasmania produces something like 40 per cent of Australia's renewables through our hydro-electric schemes. As I said, the Greens campaigned against those schemes and proposed the construction of coal fired power stations in Tasmania. I wonder what might happen to someone who proposes that now. But that is what the Greens did, demonstrating that they will say anything in their cause at a particular point in time. It does not have anything to do with fact or science; that is just the way that the Greens work, and so it is with this particular issue. The science is really quite clear in relation to using forest residues as a source of renewable energy, and you do not just have to take my word for it. In Europe, the WWF, along with the European Biomass Association, have a target of 15 per cent of energy from renewables coming from biomass by later this decade. So the WWF is on the program in relation to this. 


I have a document here that was published in Future Science. It is not just one piece of science but a compilation of global science, and it looks at life cycle impacts of forest management and wood utilisation on carbon mitigation. It says: 


Using forest residual biomass as feedstock for utilities produces only 4% of the emissions from coal.


If the Greens are looking for a source of a reduction in emissions when compared to utilising coal, a compilation of science published in Future Science says that you can reduce your emissions by 96 per cent by using residual forest biomass as a feedstock for utilities. 


Now, do the Greens support reducing emissions or don't they? I think that is a very good question, because the IPCC also promotes using biomass as part of the process, using sustainable forest management as the basis of that process. And that is what we are talking about here in Australia. We are not talking about mass entry into the forests, to utilise them for generating energy; we are talking about using materials that come from forest operations that would otherwise occur and using the residues from that process to generate energy. It simply makes sense. In fact, the IPCC states:


In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.


That statement comes from the IPCC. Yet the Greens like to quote the IPCC ad nauseam when criticising the coalition or anyone else who does not agree with their view of the world. But of course it becomes inconvenient for them when they are dealing with this particular matter. The process is also supported by the FAO; it is supported by CSIRO. So there are multiple sources to support the basis of utilising native forest residues, utilising biomass, to generate energy based on sustainable forest management principles. And that is exactly what we are talking about. The regulatory regime that we are proposing under this legislation mirrors the regime that previously existed and that did not lead to wholesale harvesting of the forest for generating energy, using biomass. It did not. Why? Because the principles of sustainable forest management were at the forefront of that regime. We have in our systems a high-value test that says that the primary purpose for harvesting cannot be for generating energy.


The Greens utilise the Dirtier than coal report, out of the UK, which is a critique of the UK bio-energy strategy that allows burning whole trees for energy production. It completely dismisses or, more to the point, does not take into account the strategies that we have here in Australia, which are based on sustainable forest management. We do have good forestry management in this country. The reality is what the Greens are trying to do: their objective is to kill the entire native forest industry in this country. Their objective is to close down the entire native forest industry in Australia, firstly, on public land and then on private land. That is their objective. They want to take away any opportunity that industry has to utilise the residues because they know that if they destroy the utilisation of the residue stream they bring down the entire industry.


So this has got nothing to do with renewable energy; it has to do with an economic attack on the forest industry. They use conservation as an excuse, but they conveniently forget that we come from the premise of utilising residues from sustainable forest management. And I really do not understand why the Labor Party are not on board with this. The report of the committee, chaired by their own Dick Adams—a bipartisan committee and a bipartisan report, supported by both Labor and the coalition—recommended this. Two days later, at the behest of the Greens, the regulations changed. The suggestion that this is a last-minute entry into the negotiations would be one of the biggest furphies perpetrated by the Labor Party in recent times. The Labor Party knows that this has been a part of coalition policy right through the last election. The Labor Party knows that we worked with the then crossbenchers in the House of Representatives to have the regulation that they brought in overturned, at the behest of the Greens. The vote in the House of Representatives was tied; it was lost on the casting vote of the Speaker. So the suggestion by the Labor Party that this is a last-minute entry into the process is quite simply dishonest. But why would you expect anything else from the Labor Party?


This provision quite sensibly provides, based on sustainable forest management, the opportunity for an alternative revenue stream, an alternative use of native forest residues for the Australian forestry sector. It provides a way forward, particularly perhaps in the southern forests of Tasmania where the industry has no outlet for the utilisation of its residues. There are mountains of it piling up in the south—




Senator Lambie:
  A fire hazard!




Senator COLBECK:
  Senator Lambie, I will take your interjection because that is exactly right: it is a fire hazard. In fact, during the tragic bushfires at Dunalley a couple of years ago the residue stacks around that sawmill at Dunalley were one factor in the destruction of that sawmill. Yet the Labor Party sits by and allows this process to continue while hardworking and honest timber workers in the southern forests of Tasmania have their livelihoods threatened by the fact that the Labor Party here in Canberra will not support their livelihoods, despite the fact—




Senator Singh:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. The parliamentary secretary is highlighting livelihoods being threatened, when it is in fact this government that has thrown thousands of livelihoods of Australians—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Singh, with respect—




Senator Singh:
  working in the renewable energy sector for the last 20 months—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Singh, that is a debating point, as you know. Senator Colbeck, please resume.




Senator COLBECK:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Back, Senator Singh is developing a bit of a habit of raising debating points as points of order and was warned by the previous occupant of the chair for this practice.




Senator Singh:
  You encouraged me!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resist the encouragement, Senator Singh!




Senator COLBECK:
  The Labor Party does endanger the livelihoods of forest workers in Tasmania, despite the fact that the Tasmanian division of the Labor Party and Labor opposition leader Bryan Green have come out in support of this measure. He wants Tasmanian Labor senators in this place to support the forest industry in Tasmania. I wonder why they will not do it. There is no rationale for them not doing it.


Senator Singh could perhaps have a chat to Dick Adams, Sid Sidebottom or Geoff Lyons, who all lost their seats at the last election. I can tell you that one of the reasons Dick Adams lost his seat, after a swing of over 13 per cent, was that the forest industry workers in Tasmania found that, when they really needed him, because of the stance of the Labor Party he could not be relied on. He could not be relied on, despite the fact that he had brought out a report supporting the use of native forest residues in the renewable energy target. Two days later, the Labor Party dudded him. The result was a swing of over 13 per cent against the Labor Party. Yet the Labor Party in this place still will not support forest workers in Tasmania, or anywhere else around the country, although there is very clear evidence that, based on sustainable forest management, utilisation of the residues of native forests for the generation of energy can reduce carbon emissions by up to 96 per cent.


You really wonder if the Labor Party are at all genuine in this debate. They cry; they caterwaul; but, when it comes to the real substance of the issue, when it comes to supporting workers in the forest industry, when they are really needed they are not there—and forest industry workers actually know that. I stood around the tailgate of a four-wheel drive in the forest in Northern Tasmania with some workers and they said, 'We've all voted for Dick Adams in the past, but not anymore, because when we really needed him he wasn't there.' You would have thought, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, that the Labor Party would have learnt their lesson.


So, the suggestion that this is a last-minute thing is a complete misrepresentation. It is a falsehood. It is a furphy. It is dishonest. Supporting the forest industry was written into our election policy at the 2013 election, and I am very pleased that we have now put that provision back into legislation so that we do have a genuine opportunity to reduce carbon emissions over the utilisation of coal by using native forest residues, sensibly based on sustainable forest management as supported by the UN's FAO, as supported by the IPCC, as supported by the CSIRO and as supported by so many high-quality, world-renowned forest scientists in this country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:32):  At the outset, I indicate and express my support for the renewable energy target. I believe that it is an instrumental part of Australia's climate change policy and that it has been a driving force behind investment in renewable energy, but there have been a number of issues in respect of it which I will address shortly. I do believe in anthropogenic climate change. I believe that it does happen, that we need to address it and that, to quote Rupert Murdoch, we need to give the planet 'the benefit of the doubt'. I think we need to have a number of effective policies in place.


The nub of the issue is: how do you reduce greenhouse gases as effectively as possible and in the most cost effective way possible? I think that having an efficient emissions trading scheme is the best way. Having a market based mechanism is the best way in the longer term. That is not the policy of this government, but I have worked very hard in the context of the Direct Action legislation on the Emissions Reduction Fund, working constructively with Minister Hunt and his very capable advisers, to drive a number of amendments that I think make the Emissions Reduction Fund much more robust and much more effective, with a safeguard mechanism that has real teeth. The framework is there. The government need to honour their commitment to make sure that a practical effect of the legislation is a safeguard mechanism.


As I said, the issue is: how do you drive the best possible reduction in emissions as efficiently as possible? Back in 2009, when Hon. Malcolm Turnbull was opposition leader, Mr Turnbull and I jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to prepare an alternative emissions trading scheme that was based on energy intensity. It was considered. It was thoughtful. The predictions made by the Managing Director of Frontier Economics at that time, Danny Price, proved to be very much true: having a scheme involving a lot of revenue churn would be economically inefficient and not as effective as it could be in environmental terms. That is why I still maintain that what was proposed by Frontier Economics in the report, study and modelling commissioned by Malcolm Turnbull and me back then would have led to greater reductions in emissions at a more affordable price and that it was a better option. Sadly, politics got in the way. Malcolm Turnbull was no longer opposition leader. He lost his leadership essentially over the issue of the ETS—it has claimed a number of casualties over the years. As a consequence, we ended up with a policy that I thought was clunky and inefficient.


I think Direct Action will work and has worked, but there is more work to be done. What we are facing here in relation to the renewable energy target is a scheme that, in my view, has needed amendment, because when the scheme was designed a number of years ago, with bipartisan support, it was anticipated that renewable energy would make up about 20 per cent of overall energy consumption. There are a number of reasons it has not, including energy efficiency measures that have been effective; but also, sadly and tragically, the demise of the manufacturing industry in this country has meant that a number of major manufacturing facilities have closed down, which has reduced the demand for electricity, particularly amongst energy-intensive industries. It is important, however, that we have some certainty for this industry. Discussions around changes to the RET, the repeal of the carbon tax and the proposed abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, amongst others, have sent a message of uncertainty. I think certainty is important, but it must be with a robust framework that will deliver results in the most effective possible way, both for consumers and for taxpayers. That is why, despite the target being lower than I would like ideally, and despite there being no carve out for technologies that can provide baseload power, I will be supporting this legislation broadly. But I will focus on the issues of wood waste and biomass, and also the issue of wind energy, because I see them as inextricably linked in relation to this.


In relation to the issue of wood waste, an article on 5 June in the RenewEconomy publication gave a summary of some of the arguments. It mentions Ross Hampton, the CEO of the Australian Forest Products Association, who said on 15 May that biomass used for electricity would be a very small amount. He downplayed his own initial estimate to the Warburton review of the 3,000 to 5,000 gigawatts of power a year, admitting that AFTA had put the figure to the review panel, but saying that it was a very theoretical number. I have dealt with Mr Hampton and worked with him constructively in the past, and I hope to continue to work with him constructively in the future. Perhaps it was better that that very theoretical number was not put to the Warburton review, although I do have my serious doubts about the effectiveness of the Warburton review, its robustness and a whole range of other matters. I thought that it was not a very good exercise in having a robust, independent review. I do not think that it was anywhere near as credible as it needed to be. Perhaps some of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber will say that I am being too kind, and maybe I am.


In relation to the issue of biomass, in the pre-2011 regulations, according to the RenewEconomy publication, which I think gives a neat summary, 'there were certainly very few biomass projects to receive Renewable Energy Certificates'. The article goes on to say the:


… post Regional Forest Agreements decade was a period of almost boom conditions for the woodchipping industry. Both prices and export volumes increased to record levels and profits were high. It would have been impossible for the energy industry, with or without Renewable Energy Certificates to compete with the prices the industry was getting for woodchips for fibre.


Some commentators would make the point that things have now changed and that this could loom larger in terms of the issue of biomass, but let us put this into some perspective. Biomass can produce methane, which is 15 times more potent and more damaging to the environment than CO2. It needs to be dealt with. There is also the issue of fire hazards, and I think that is a real issue in terms of appropriate clearing. Mr Acting Deputy President Back, given your role with the Country Fire Association in WA, I think you know about the issues and risks with bushfires, and I hope you do not mind me mentioning that, given your expertise and your history in relation to that. I do not know whether the issue of biomass will be the saviour of the forestry industry, as the industry is saying, and I do not think it will have the uptake that some in the environment movement are fearing. But I think it is important that there must be some adequate safeguards, and that is something that, from my point of view, is still subject to negotiation. I understand there will be some further amendments in respect of this issue, and I am grateful to my colleagues in the Greens—Senator Waters and Senator Rice—who I have had discussions with and will continue to have discussions with about this.


I think it is important that in the committee stage there is a robust debate and discussion about this, and that questions are appropriately answered. I think people know that my view in relation to procedural matters is to bring on a debate. Sometimes it is appropriate to say that we need to have a set time for this, but when it comes to the committee stage of a bill there ought not to be a gag. If we have to spend all week here, if we have to spend the weekend here, or if we are here for the next month debating this, if it is the will of the chamber not to cut off debate then my view is that we need to thoroughly canvass these issues. That is why I say now, as I have previously when it comes to the substantive debate of a bill, that I will not support a gag. In regard to the issues relating to biomass, I think we need to see what further amendments there will be and what undertakings will be made by the government. I think the committee stage is the appropriate stage to deal with those amendments.


I want to refer to Frontier Economics, who, back in September 2014, issued the paper 'Can Australia still meet its emissions target with changes in the RET?' The people at Frontier Economics are pretty dispassionate. They made the point that the RET 'is a relatively high cost approach to reducing emissions because it focusses on specific forms of electricity generation', and that it has contributed to a large surplus of generation capacity. They are simply stating facts about how the national electricity market works. They make the point that:


The RET does not generate an increase in wealth in the economy, but leads to a transfer of wealth among participants in the electricity market.


In that respect, it is being critical not of the RET per se, but of the way that it is operated and particularly of the way that wind energy—and this is also my view and the view of others—has distorted the national electricity market because it is not baseload. It is intermittent and unreliable, and if you have a heavy reliance on wind, as there is in my home state of South Australia, it can, and does, have an impact on the market. Frontier Economics has made some good points about this, and their overall thrust is that there are better and more efficient ways of reducing greenhouse gases than simply using the RET by itself. It needs to be a whole package of measures. I see the advantage of the RET as one of driving technological change, in the sense that it drives efficiencies for solar panels; for solar-thermal generation, which is very exciting in terms of its potential for baseload power; and for other forms of renewables such as landfill gas. Soaking up that methane from landfill not only is essential from an environmental point of view, but does provide baseload power, which is very important. If you want to shut down thermal generators, coal fired generators, you need to have the backup of baseload renewable alternatives, and that is why solar thermal is important.


In that regard, given the announcement made last week by Alinta Energy concerning Port Augusta, in my home state of South Australia, the importance of the Solar Cities project and the importance of finding the funding and the financing for the solar thermal project in Port Augusta take on an added significance. It is something that I have raised with the Minister for the Environment on a number of occasions, it is something that has an added urgency to it and it is something that I have raised with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in broad terms.


In the course of this debate, this cannot be simply seen as a silo about a renewable energy target and the issue of wood waste. It is also worth mentioning, most importantly, the issue of wind generation. I have serious concerns about the proliferation of wind turbines in Australia in terms of both their economic impact and their community impact. I know a position is taken by some, which I consider to be unfair, that there is a nocebo effect—that somehow this is some sort of psychosomatic illness of communities. Just last week, Mr Acting Deputy President Back—and you were there as well—at the hearing of the Select Committee on Wind Turbines we heard from two residents in South Australia who were hosts of wind farms. They are receiving something like $200,000 a year from the proponent for hosting the wind farm. They, basically, had their lives disrupted significantly because of the noise and the vibration of the wind turbines. The power company effectively had to spend a fortune on their home to block the noise as much as possible. Those people were brave enough to speak out that there is a real issue there.


I am calling for a commitment to some independent scientific assessment of this—objective science and objective measuring of the noise and other issues including infrasound. Even the levels of acoustic noise need to be dealt with, and that is why I was very pleased to support Senator John Madigan's bill in respect of wind turbines and excessive noise. That is what we need to revisit. We need to give those communities a sense of empowerment. If the current rules are being breached, they need to be enforced. The current rules need to adequately reflect the science and the genuine concerns of the communities around noise and sleep disturbance—if you do not sleep, it has health effects. These are the issues that need to be dealt with in the course of this debate.


I want to briefly mention, before we go to the adjournment debate, matters that have been raised with me by Susan Jeanes of Jeanes Holland and Associates. Susan Jeanes is a former coalition member for the electorate of Kingston. I think it is fair to say that she would be described as a moderate—Senator Birmingham is chuckling. I do not know what that means, but I have a lot of respect for her. There is a nod there and hopefully the respect is mutual, Senator Birmingham. She is someone who has advocated in this space and is a great proponent of large-scale solar projects and of ensuring that those forms of renewables that are more reliable and do not have the same level of community impact and disruption get a fair go. I am very grateful for a short paper that Susan Jeanes provided to me. Issues were raised around the role of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which I believe has an essential role in climate change to be involved as a guarantor for power-purchasing agreements for smaller retailers, to create a focus on Australian solar projects for the low-cost, very active US bond market, and to have longer than usual debt-financing terms so that you can encourage those more reliable forms of renewable energy, including large-scale solar, landfill gas and genuinely new hydro—because it is a form of baseload renewable. I know there is some controversy about that. My colleagues in the Greens may have a different view, but we need to encourage baseload renewables and those more reliable forms of renewable energy. The problem is that there currently are not enough incentives for those baseload renewables.


I will conclude my remarks in the second reading debate now. I look forward to the Committee of the Whole stage, which I expect will be robust and contentious, but I hope we get to a suitable conclusion.


Debate interrupted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:22):  I thought I was coming in here to briefly speak on the animal protection bill, but of course I am delighted to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. Indeed, I make the point that all of us in public life, and certainly those of us in the Australian parliament are no exception, do aim to do good. But more than anything else, we certainly have an obligation to ensure that we do no harm. I fear there are elements within the context of what we are discussing this afternoon and that is that they are doing harm or they have the potential to be doing harm. I speak of adverse health effects of industrial wind turbines.


I do refer through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Walters, who spoke before me on this matter—



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I am terribly sorry; I do apologise, Senator Waters. I apologise for not mentioning your name correctly. I now do correct that. But I particularly refer to the dismissal by Senator Waters of any possible adverse health effects on people affected by industrial wind turbines. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines is currently underway on this very matter and, to me, it is disappointing that the Greens Party elected not to have a person participating in this inquiry. 


I am also pleased to acknowledge to the Senate a commitment by the coalition coming into government now being honoured, with which I had some association—that is, a commitment to the expenditure of some $2.5 million to undertake independent medical research to establish whether there are adverse health effects from wind turbines. This is the first time, anywhere in the world, that that research will be undertaken. The NHMRC have responsibility for advertising for parties competent to undertake the medical research and they have done that. They have closed applications. I eagerly look forward to the appointment of an independent panel. 


Again, if I could just draw attention to the comments of others who have asserted that NHMRC have already undertaken research and have reported that there are no adverse health effects. That indeed is not the case. There have been a couple of literature reviews, the most recent of which included only one acoustician and three epidemiologists but nobody with actual expertise in this field. So therefore one would be hard put to actually claim that no adverse health effects could be stated.


In fact, the CEO of NHMRC himself has indeed said that the outcome of that literature review was not to come up with that conclusion. I have been critical on a number of counts, particularly as to the number of papers that were rejected as part of the literature review.  They are in fact not in the English language, including Japanese and Polish. Others were also excluded. 


Indeed, whilst it is not my position to comment at all on outcomes of the Senate select committee and I do not intend to do so, I certainly can make my own observations about medical doctors who have agreed—acousticians on both sides of this argument—only in the last few days, in hearings in Melbourne and Adelaide, and have actually stated quite strongly that there are, at least, stress and annoyances. The chief medical officer of South Australia concurred with me the other day: if stress and annoyance lead to sleeplessness, which leads to depression, indeed that of itself is an aetiological cause of adverse health. People of course speak of whether it is audible sound or subaudible infrasound. In a sense, as the point was made the other day: noise is just unwanted sound. I hope that the independent medical research will in fact undertake research and come up with some results in that space.


I was very interested in the comments only last week of a well-regarded neuroscientist Professor Simon Carlile, from the University of Sydney. He said, 'There is a growing body of evidence, pointing to low-frequency infrasound directly affecting the human nervous system.' Carlile is internationally regarded in this space. He of course speaks in terms of physiology—the fact that the nervous system responds to low frequency. As to noise, the evidence, he says, is 'Yes, the nervous system can be activated at these frequencies.' But he said, 'Not in the traditional way of one interpreting hearing, but in fact the vestibular system within the ear involving itself in balance.'


We quite often hear the analogy used whereby if a group of people go out onto the ocean, two or three get seasick and the rest of them do not. It is not all that conducive to good relations for those who did not get seasick to turn around and say to the others, 'You're actually not suffering seasickness; there is nothing wrong with you.' It is what some people facetiously refer to as a 'nocebo' effect—in other words, you think you are going to get seasick, therefore you get seasick and therefore you were not seasick. In fact, Carlile does not speak of it as an analogy at all; Carlile actually says, 'Physiologically, they may be very, very similar.' That is, the vestibular system being affected, suffering seasickness. 'They get seasick,' he said, 'because of the stimulation of the vestibular system and there seem to be quite significant variations of susceptibility to vestibular-induced nausea.' So I think, again, it is not helpful for people to make those comments.


I speak also of the impact of this bill. When it comes to renewable energy, there are many sources. We know that small-scale solar power will be unaffected by this legislation, and I think there is unanimous support within Parliament House for that. We know that the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will be protected by this legislation. But my concern, as we move to the target of 33,000 gigawatt hours, is that other forms of renewables—and, I hasten to add, other forms of renewables that have no, and can have no, adverse health effects—are largely being ignored in this debate. One is large-scale solar power. I would have pleaded for some allocation, within the decrease to 33,000 gigawatt hours, for large-scale solar power. The other one, of course, is hydroelectricity. I hasten to add as a Western Australian that this is an area in which WA have no interest because we have no hydro in the south; we do, of course, in the Ord River near Kununurra in the north. People say, 'There is no capacity for an increase in the construction of dams et cetera.' But I am not talking about that; I am talking about using new software, new technologies, to upgrade existing hydroelectricity schemes, including the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme in New South Wales and Hydro Tasmania—




Senator Polley:
  And a great system it is, too.




Senator BACK:
  It is, as Senator Polley says, a great system. In my view, this legislation would have been enriched if there had been carve-outs allowed for the encouragement of hydroelectricity power, with existing technologies and existing assets, and large-scale solar power. There is also a wonderful project being undertaken by Carnegie at Garden Island, off the Western Australian coast. Carnegie, using wave motion energy, are providing a significant proportion of the power to HMAS Stirling at Garden Island, as well as providing them with water desalinated through the heat of the generation sets.


So I think this is an opportunity missed, and ministers and others are well aware of my views that we could have had and should have had an allocation for the development of those opportunities. 


The commentary in this area has been interesting. The other day, I spoke on radio in Perth, and some fellow rang in and said that he was used to windmills on farms and they did not make him sick. Someone else said they were aware of very, very small turbines on people's roofs in the Canary Islands, and those people were not reporting illness; and, therefore, what I was talking about was a load of nonsense. 


It may not be known, but it became patently obvious to the committee through our inquiry, that the modern industrial wind turbine has a pillar of some 100 metres in height, and the blades themselves are 100 metres long. So we are looking at the height equivalent of a 60-floor CBD high-rise building and, with the size of the blades, an area greater than an Australian Rules football oval—just the one turbine. They are enormous.


The Mayor of the Goyder Regional Council in South Australia, when he appeared before the committee the other day—and the region for which he has local government responsibility has a very heavy concentration of industrial wind turbines—made the observation, probably the plea, that when this technology was first developed years ago the opportunity was there for governments, Commonwealth and state, to sit down and discuss where these turbines might be placed so they were unlikely to have any impact at all on humans.


In the context of my own state, there are four major wind farm developments. There are two outside of Esperance, on the south-east coast, where it blows like a dog off a chain, but they are placed at nine and 10 miles away. It will come as no surprise to learn that the names of these wind farms are Nine Mile Beach and Ten Mile Lagoon—because they are nine and 10 miles from town. In Albany, those who saw the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac would have seen the wind turbines in the distance. As the Mayor of Albany said the other day, nobody lives near them; they are about 20 kilometres from town. Walkaway wind farm is about 30 kilometres from either Dongara or Geraldton. The Collgar Wind Farm is about 35 kilometres from Merredin—probably a good distance if you are worried, as I am, about wind farms' possible adverse effects on people.


One of the other comments that are often made with regard to wind turbines, and I think it is one that needs to be stated, is that they will be able to immediately reduce carbon dioxide emissions. If you actually sit down and do the mathematics, you come to the realisation that the manufacturing itself of each turbine requires more than 250 tonnes of coal to produce the steel; and, when you do the carbon dioxide analysis, the payback is not for about 15 to 20 years. In other words, if a turbine operates as expected, for maybe eight hours a day—that would be optimistic—it will have to generate electricity for up to 15 to 20 years before it pays back the carbon emissions that were used in its construction or, indeed, in its being put into place. And you would understand, Mr Deputy President, that any structure which is 100 metres in height and of the width I mentioned a moment ago needs massive amounts of concrete and steel to support it. Those are points that very much need to be made.


The economics are of great interest. Why are we focusing on industrial wind turbines? It is because, in the time we have to achieve the objective of 33,000 gigawatt hours, it is industrial wind turbines, in the main, that are going to contribute to that renewable energy source. Conservatively, it is going to require somewhere around about 1,000 new wind turbines, possibly even more, depending on their size. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to examine the economics of these circumstances. The arguments go backwards and forwards. We were told in Adelaide and in Melbourne that in fact greater use of wind turbines and renewable energy, particularly through turbines, were driving the price of electricity down for the residents. I recall asking someone, 'Which state of Australia has the greatest number of turbines?' The answer is South Australia. Which is the state that has the highest cost of electricity to residences? Of course, it is South Australia. If you go to Europe, which country has the highest number of industrial wind turbines? It is Denmark. Which country has the highest cost of domestic electricity? And yes, you guessed it. Of course, it is the same place: it is Denmark.


You can also ask the question: if in fact wind turbines are driving the price of power down, why do they need any sort of financial support from the federal government? From this point of view, if they are so successful, surely it is not required. Only then do we come to learn that, in fact, the claims made about the price of power going down as the amount of renewables increases come about as a result of the very generous Renewable Energy Certificates. As we all know, under the Constitution, land management, under which these sorts of planning decisions are made, is quite rightly the role of the states, not of the Commonwealth government. But people need to be aware that, on average, depending on how much electricity they generate, besides being paid for the electricity that the turbines generate there is also a system of Renewable Energy Certificates. It is the Clean Energy Regulator who oversees the allocation of certificates, and it is true to say that these certificates actually do not cost the taxpayer anything, because the certificates find their way through to the retail price of electricity. Therefore, that cost is met by consumers. But the last time I had a look there would not be too many taxpayers who themselves are not consumers. So I think it is a very moot point to say that these costs are not borne by taxpayers. Indeed, they are.


The Clean Energy Regulator and I had had some spirited discussions in Senate estimates, and she continues to tell me that whilst the act seems to require the Clean Energy Regulator to be satisfied as to the compliance of industrial wind turbines, and indeed other forms of clean energy, in fact it does not. At the moment, the only requirement under legislation that the Clean Energy Regulator has is to be satisfied on the economics. In other words, if the wind turbine operator said, 'We generated X amount of electricity last year,' so long as the Clean Energy Regulator is satisfied with that part of the audit process the certificates flow. I would plead very strongly that there is a greater role, and based on the Clean Energy Regulator's submission and appearance before the committee, I think she is also of that view. In other words, that greater role should be that the Clean Energy Regulator needs to be satisfied with compliance.


This afternoon's discussion does not allow me to go into any detail at all about compliance, except to say there is a long and sad history of lack of compliance: of turbines being wrongly placed and of approvals being given in arrears or backdated. This does not do very much for their credibility or for the levels of confidence within the wider community, particularly the community of affected people. Therefore, I think we need a lot more discussion on the overall economics. I plead that we need to widen the argument.


One of the other areas is biomass. I know that will be discussed in the committee process, and I look forward to contributing in that area, because I firmly believe that if we can use wood waste, particularly from the plantation industry, and if we can use the waste from the sugarcane industry in those areas on the east coast where the sugar is grown, then that will be of tremendous benefit.


In the last few seconds I want to pose this question to the sceptics: why is it that a family who have been in the same farmhouse for five generations would all of a sudden pretend to have some adverse health effect? Why would somebody who has made a lifestyle choice to shift to the Barossa Valley and found their life destroyed lay these claims? Consider a turbine host who has been receiving multiples of the $10,000 per annum that most get for having turbines on their properties. Why would they put their hands up and say, 'I'm sorry, I can't accept the funds any more'? Consider the farmer who cannot spray his crop anymore because of the turbines, and consider the retirees who leave their communities with no value in their land. There are questions to be asked.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  I am pleased to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 because it gives me an opportunity to talk about the enormous opportunities for Australia in renewable energy, and about how Labor believes in, and has supported, a strong renewable energy industry. It also gives me a chance to talk about how the Abbott government has carelessly sabotaged the industry, which has led us to the situation we are in today and to this bill now before the Senate.


Australia should be a world leader in renewable energy. With a huge land mass surrounded by water, we have access to an abundance of wind, wave, hydro, solar and geothermal energy. We also have world-leading expertise in renewable energy, and during Labor's time in government jobs in the renewable energy sector tripled. More than $18 billion was invested in the sector, and the number of homes with rooftop solar grew from 7,000 to over 1.2 million. There is no doubt that Labor has a strong commitment to renewable energy. Renewable energy, inevitably, must play a strong part of our future. It is an interesting fact that the amount of energy delivered by the sun to the earth in one hour is almost enough to meet the world's energy consumption needs for one year. The energy from sunlight is then transferred to other natural sources such as wind. I think this fact demonstrates the enormous potential there is to harness this energy, rather than rely on the finite energy source that fossil fuels provide.


If our planet is going to survive and be habitable, the world has no choice but to reduce carbon pollution. Climate science tells us that the current worldwide pledges to reduce carbon emissions may not be enough to prevent two degrees of warming, which is considered the threshold for catastrophic climate change. Renewable energy is undoubtedly the way of the future. Even if Australia does not aggressively pursue renewable energy, circumstances will eventually force the entire world to adapt to relying mostly, if not entirely, on renewable sources for our energy needs. Those countries that invest heavily in renewable energy will be the ones that are able to take advantage of the economic opportunities of selling their skills, experience and technology to others. This critically important industry employs more than 21,000 Australians, including almost 1,000 people in my home state of Tasmania.


I am particularly excited about the opportunities a strong investment in renewable energy has for Tasmania, because Tasmania has long been at the forefront of renewable energy in Australia. Our hydro-electricity scheme was established as early as 1914, and the company once known as the Hydro-Electric Commission—now Hydro Tasmania—is one of the oldest power companies in Australia, having celebrated its centenary only last year. The Tasmanian hydro-electric scheme is ingrained in our state's history. It goes back to 1895, with the opening of the Duck Reach Power Station only seven years after the first power station was built in the Southern Hemisphere. A post-Second World War boom in dam construction led to thousands of migrants, mostly European, coming to Tasmania. This has had a permanent positive impact on the social fabric of the state. There are generations of Tasmanians descended from migrant Hydro workers of English, German, Polish, and Italian origins. My home state has also been at the forefront of wind energy in Australia. The first Tasmanian wind farm, Huxley Hill, was built on King Island in Bass Strait in 1988, and was the second commercial wind farm in Australia. Tasmania has since developed the Woolnorth and Musselroe Wind Farms with a generating capacity of 140 and 168 megawatts respectively. These wind farms were developed by a joint venture between Hydro Tasmania and the Chinese company, Shenhua Clean Energy, an entity known as Woolnorth Wind Farm Holdings.


Hydro Tasmania has now become a leader in the research and development of other forms of renewable energy, such as geothermal, tide and wave energy. Tasmanian sources an average of 87 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources every year, and Tasmania has the potential to become the first state in Australia that sources 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable resources. Renewable energy is vital to the economy of my home state, especially as we export electricity from renewable sources via Basslink. So not only does renewable energy policy have an impact on the economy of my home state; it also impacts on public services, since Hydro Tasmania returns dividends to the Tasmanian government. To illustrate the impact this has, the Abbott government's decision to abolish Labor's clean energy future legislation impacts on the Tasmanian government's budget by $70 million per year. I support renewable energy, not just for the sake of Australian jobs and the economy but because of the unique implications it has for the state I represent.


The future of renewables in Australia is a risk because we now have a government that does not believe in renewable energy. It is of little surprise that we get this kind of approach from a government whose treasurer describes wind farms as 'utterly offensive' and whose Prime Minister who says they are 'visually awful'. Mr Abbott also said last week that he wished the Howard government—in which he was a minister—had never implemented the Renewable Energy Target policy. Bizarrely, in an interview with Alan Jones Mr Abbott claimed that changes to the RET—the changes we are debating right now—were designed to reduce the number of wind farms in Australia. Mr Abbott also said that he would have liked to have reduced them a lot further. When Mr Jones raised the potential health impacts of wind farms on people living nearby, Mr Abbott responded, 'I do take your point'. Yet the link has been examined by the National Health and Medical Research Council, who have found that there is no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects. Coming from a former health minister, Mr Abbott's denial of medical research is breathtaking. The Prime Minister also nailed his colours to the mast in 2013 by proclaiming that the Renewable Energy Target is driving up power prices. Yet his own hand-picked review panel found that not only is the RET putting downward pressure on electricity prices, it is also driving investment in renewable energy, creating jobs and cutting carbon pollution. It is utterly bizarre that the review could find that the RET is playing such a positive role in Australia's economy and environment—and yet go on to recommend that the RET be either significantly cut or abolished. At the same time, it is hardly surprising, given that a known climate change sceptic was appointed to the review panel. This is exactly the recommendation the government wanted—because they do not really believe in renewable energy anyway.


The Abbott government's record speaks for itself. They slashed the budget and reduced a $600 million commitment to the solar roofs and towns and schools programs to just $2 million. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency had its budget severely cut in the 2013 MYEFO, and it was then targeted for abolition in the 2014 budget. And this government has adamantly refused to either accept an emissions trading scheme or implement one of its own, despite most economic and environmental experts agreeing that it is the most efficient and effective way to cut carbon emissions—and despite the fact that an emissions trading scheme was bipartisan policy until Mr Abbott rolled Mr Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party. The government's broken promise on the Renewable Energy Target is the latest in a series of policy backflips that reflect the climate change denial and lack of commitment to renewable energy by those opposite.


The Abbott government has overturned over a decade of bipartisanship on renewable energy by breaking its promise to retain Labor's Renewable Energy Target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020. In fact, the government proposed to cut the RET by over 40 per cent. Since the government announced this backflip, investment in renewable energy has fallen by 88 per cent, while it has increased by 16 per cent in the rest of the world. Over that same period, China's investment in renewable energy has increased by 33 per cent. In 2013, Australia was ranked in the top four most attractive places to invest in renewable energy, along with Germany, China and the United States. Now we have fallen to tenth place on the list. Despite the fact that the government cannot universally cut the RET, they have effectively hobbled the industry anyway.


Those of us who have been in business understand that you cannot make long-term investments in an uncertain investment environment. That is what this government has done with their departure from a decade of bipartisanship on the RET. Either the government do not understand the importance of certainty to the renewable energy industry, or they do understand it but simply do not care. I am assuming they either do not understand or do not care, because the only possibility—one which is almost too shocking to contemplate—is that the government's backflip on the RET was a deliberate attempt to sabotage the industry. What makes the government's attitude especially perplexing is that renewable energy and the RET are quite popular with the Australian public. Australians overwhelmingly support renewable energy because they recognise the incredible economic and environmental benefits it delivers.


While Labor was keen to support the previous bipartisan commitment to a RET of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020, we have had to negotiate a reduced RET with the government in order to return certainty to the industry. This brings us to the bill we are debating today. It is clear that this is not the bill that the government would rather be introducing. They would rather be introducing legislation that would further substantially reduce the renewable energy target. If we consider the words of the Prime Minister last week, he would probably rather be introducing legislation to completely abolish the RET. 


Labor has had to negotiate a compromise to make sure that we can give certainty to the renewable energy industry. The elements of the agreement include a large-scale renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatt hours by 2020; no change to the small-scale solar scheme; a full exemption for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries; and removal of the two-yearly reviews of the RET. I am pleased that the following outcomes have been achieved through the negotiations: no change to the small-scale solar scheme, which includes rooftop solar and solar panels for small businesses such as nursing homes; full exemption for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries, which relieves some pressure on those industries that are enduring downturns and job cuts; and the removal of two-yearly reviews, which provides the long-term certainty the industry needs. 


Throughout the negotiations, Labor has listened to advice from the industry on what its needs are. The revised renewable energy target of 33,000 gigawatt hours will see 25 percent of Australia's energy generated from renewable sources by 2020. The Clean Energy Council, which proposed the compromise target, predicts that it will drive over $40 billion in investment and create more than 15,000 jobs. This bill reflects the outcome of our negotiations with the government. By passing this bill, we can look forward to a strong and certain future for Australia's renewable energy industry. But it is a great shame that the Prime Minister, in the interview with Alan Jones I mentioned earlier, said he was disappointed with the deal the government struck with Labor and that he would prefer to cut the RET further. In other words, this Prime Minister, who promised to create a million jobs in five years and two million jobs in 10 years, was actually expressing a desire to do more damage to an industry which creates thousands of jobs and drives billions of dollars in investment.


I am pleased, though, that through this bill the renewable energy industry can continue to move forward with certainty, attracting billions of dollars in investment and creating thousands of jobs. Labor will use the revised target as a floor to build on. We will work with the sector to increase the renewable energy target out to 2020 to bolster investment, specifically in large-scale solar. Before the next election, we will be making announcements about our genuine goals for the industry beyond 2020. In the meantime, we will be consulting with industry and the experts about the detail of those announcements.


There is doubt that the renewable energy industry has a bright future under Labor. As I said earlier in my contribution, it makes sense for Australia, with our skills, knowledge and natural resources, to have a thriving renewable energy industry. Labor wants to see Australia return to its previous position as a global leader in renewable energy generation, research and development. We can only hope that, for the sake of the industry, jobs and the environment, the Abbott government will abandon its attacks on the industry and we can return to the bipartisanship on the renewable energy target that we previously enjoyed. However, I fear that, if the recent comments of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are anything to go by, it will probably be a long, long time before the coalition is dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. I am in no doubt that, despite the intransigence of those opposite, a strong renewable energy target continues to enjoy the overwhelming support of the public. Renewable energy is the way of the future, and Labor believes it has a big part to play in Australia's future.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (17:57):  I rise this evening to totally oppose this legislation, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015, that has appeared before the Senate. It is an absolute disgrace that at a time of climate emergency, when around the world countries are scrambling to increase the amount of renewable energy in their systems and to decrease the amount of fossil fuel, here in Australia we are the first developed country to formally reduce our renewable energy target, on top of being the first developed country to abolish a carbon price. We are global pariahs when it comes to climate action leading into Paris.


I want to put to bed immediately this notion that there had to be some sort of compromise to deliver certainty. That fails absolutely to understand that the government has no intention of delivering certainty. Anyone who thinks that 33,000 gigawatt hours now provides certainty for investment is kidding themselves absolutely. I want to explain how this happened. Let's go to the Tea Party Republicans in the US. They do not believe in compromise. They go after everything that they can get, pocket whatever they can and then go after the rest. They have no intention of stopping where they are. That is clearly the modus operandi of the Abbott government when it comes to renewable energy, because the Abbott government is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the coal industry in Australia. Anyone who doubts that only has to see what this government has done. The fact of the matter is that renewable energy in Australia is undermining the business case for coal. That is it, pure and simple.


On top of the reduced demand that has been occurring and the rollout of rooftop solar, we had the coal generators in Australia in trouble—9,000 megawatts too much of energy in the system—and we had a choice. We could shut down coal fired power now without in any way jeopardising energy security in Australia and actually bringing down prices to consumers, because renewable energy is bringing down the wholesale price of power; or we could try and kill renewable energy and increase the price of energy to consumers, and that is exactly what this legislation is doing. I am afraid it shows a level of naivety beyond all measure to hear the Labor Party stand up here saying that they had to compromise to deliver certainty. 


There is no certainty, and if anyone needs any proof of that, just have a look at what the Prime Minister had to say last week. He said: 'The Renewable Energy Target as currently agreed, mandating that 33,000 gigawatt hours of electricity be produced from renewable sources including wind, was merely the lowest number the government could achieve within the current parliament.' They have no intention of stopping here. They want this abolished altogether. If they could have gone down further, they would have, and they would have gone as low as to the point of abolishing the RET altogether. That is their agenda. Anyone who thinks that they are stopping at 33,000 gigawatt hours has not listened to how they are intending to prop up fossil fuels. 


Let me go to something else the Prime Minister said: 'What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, reduce: capital R-E-D-U-C-E the number of these things that we are going to get in the future'—that is, wind turbines; that is what he was referring to. He said, 'I frankly would have liked to have reduced the number a lot more, but we got the best deal we could.' What does that tell you? It tells you it is the best deal they can get at the moment to get it down to 33,000 gigawatt hours, but it is not over. They have put that in their back pockets and they are going to abolish the Renewable Energy Target at the first possible opportunity that they think they will get the numbers to do it. So I cannot believe anyone is running around suggesting there is any certainty or that there will be certainty delivered to the renewable energy industry if and when this absolutely flawed legislation—contrary to what the world needs, let alone what this country needs—actually passes.


I want to go to the reasons why the small target was not changed. It had nothing to do with compromises made in here; it had everything to do with the campaign that the Solar Council ran in marginal seats around the country, where they stood up and made it very clear, with contributions from people who are selling solar panels, students who are studying in the new renewable energy field, people working in retail in the renewable energy sector, people standing up and saying, 'This will cost us jobs, and what is more you hold this seat by one or two per cent, and if all the people with solar PV on their roof change their vote, we can take this seat from you.' It was the marginal seats campaign that protected small-scale solar, not any so-called compromise that has happened between Liberal and Labor. It was Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, who stood with me on the platform in Barton and said that Labor was not for turning on this issue. Well, Labor has turned. 


At what point did this occur? The people who gave cover to everybody to start this downward process that got them as low as Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, could get them to go—and he will continue his attack on renewable energy—were of course the Clean Energy Council. They were the ones who gave cover to this happening, and then out came the AWU, saying that they wanted exemptions for aluminium smelters, but that was not enough for the Clean Energy Council. They said, 'Why don't we give exemptions to all the trade exposed industries? Why would you do that? Why would you go down that path, especially seeing that aluminium smelters have been subsidised by the community forever? With bulk power contracts, they have never paid the wholesale price for power ever anywhere in the country. Because of the currency exchange rate, they have had the biggest windfall gain that they could have expected in recent times. They have had a massive windfall gain with that change to the exchange rates. 


We have a situation where the AWU came out wanting aluminium and the Clean Energy Council said: 'Let's go further. Let's give all the energy-intensive trade-exposed a 100 per cent exemption.' What does that mean? I have not heard the Prime Minister out there talking about power bills. Why? Because every trade exposed industry you let off paying for their renewable energy certificates means that the community has to pay. The community has to pay more now because the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries have gotten off the hook. I will be very interested in the definition of what constitutes energy-intensive trade-exposed as to whether the petroleum and gas industries get their way and have an expanded definition of the level of exemption they can get not only for their LNG facilities but also for the gas fields and what power goes on in those sectors. It will be very interesting to see where that ends up.


We have a situation now where the Clean Energy Council is facilitating a race to the bottom. The Prime Minister is saying, 'We want as low as we can go, as we can possibly secure in this parliament,' and the Labor Party have facilitated that to get down to 33,000 gigawatt hours and a total exemption for all the energy-intensive trade-exposed, increasing the price to the community and squeezing out large-scale solar. 


The fact of the matter is that renewable energy has won the energy race this century. Solar has won. What is happening in this country though is that we are missing out on large-scale solar thermal, the sort of thing that gives hope and excitement for new jobs and new investment, for careers for young people. They are all offshore now. They are going offshore, where they are building a fantastic facilities in the United States, in Spain, in China. All over the world large-scale solar is being built, but not in this country, because of the attitude of the government and the AWU going along with the exemption for the trade exposed.


Now let me get to the decision by the government to include forest furnaces. This is a ludicrous proposition: the logging of native forests in order to burn them to generate energy which is then called 'renewable'. We know that the best thing you can do for the climate is to save the carbon-dense native forests, which are carbon stores. If you were interested in looking after biodiversity in the face of the extinction crisis we are now suffering and interested in securing carbon in the landscape, you would not log native forests. As a result of the world deciding it does not want to log native forests, the bottom has dropped out of the market for native forest woodchips. That is why Forestry Tasmania has made such a mess of it and is in so much debt. Forestry Victoria and all around the country want to be propped up by a subsidy because they have no market for native forest woodchips. So along comes the government, no doubt with the support of the CMFEU, to give renewable energy certificates to native forest loggers.


Let me tell you about Forestry Tasmania. It is so far in debt that they should be trading insolvent if it were not for the Tasmanian government giving them a letter of comfort. Whilst the Labor Party federally says that it opposes the logging of native forests for forest furnaces, Bryan Green, who is the leader of the Labor Party in the Tasmanian parliament, has been urging Bill Shorten to support this particular legislation. The Labor Party in Tasmania want forest furnaces; they have always wanted them and they want them now. It is bad enough that the Tasmanian government took $30 million out of Networks Tasmania, a GBE, and transferred it to Forestry Tasmania, but now in the budget they have extended their line of credit by another $10 million to $41 million. The logging of native forests is an ideological debt disaster. Now the federal government wants to prop them up by logging native forests. Anyone who suggests that this is about waste fails to remember the past; if you fail to remember the past then you are condemned to repeat it. What we are seeing here is 90 per cent of any coupe that is logged going to woodchips—90 per cent. We are talking about burning 90 per cent of what comes off a coupe in a forest furnace, if this legislation goes through. Any suggestion of 'Oh, it's only twigs and leaves and bark' is nonsense. It is 90 per cent of a coupe that will go into a forest furnace; and it is wrong. 


We have run big consumer campaigns and we will run another big consumer campaign. People might remember burnt koala certificates. Perhaps the Clean Energy Council might like to think for a moment about the reputational damage to renewable energy that they are dishing out by failing to force the government on this issue. Again, I come back to the Labor Party. Even though Bryan Green, the leader of the Tasmanian party, wants it, there were two things that the government included in this: one was the two-year reviews; the other was to log native forests to generate energy. Labor came out and said they would make one a condition of doing this deal, but not the other. If you were serious about not logging native forests, why would you not have made both deal breakers? There is no answer to that, because the reality is that Labor at the state level is very happy to see native forest logging go on and be propped up by trying to include it in getting renewable energy certificates for logging and burning native forests and driving species to extinction. That, indeed, is what this will do if they get away with it.


Before the last election I went to see the Labor government to say: 'We need to get rid of these two-year reviews from the Renewable Energy Target.' The reason it was not possible then is that, had we tried to do that, Rob Oakeshott, an independent member at the time, indicated that he would move for the inclusion of native forest logging in that and he would have had the support for the government to do it. That is why it did not get done before the last election. This has been on the agenda for some time. The Greens have held it out for a long time, and we should be holding it out now, because every certificate that you generate from logging and burning native forests is a certificate that you are using to take from future generations the biodiversity of our forests and the carbon-rich density of our forests. It an absolute act of vandalism if that is allowed to occur. That is why we should be dumping the schedule which they have shoved in this bill that would give renewable energy certificates to forest furnaces which generate energy from the burning of native forests. It is absolute destruction of the world's biodiversity, and it will be yet another indication globally of just how backward Australia is.


I want to return to the bill in a big-picture sense before closing my second reading remarks. Australia has a dig-it-up, cut-it-down, ship-it-away economy. The Greens have argued for a very long time that we need to respond to the global warming emergency; we need serious targets. We have said 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 is achievable in this country. What that would do for jobs and investment is mega. That would give the kind of direction and certainty that you need, especially if it is accompanied by a reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with the science. That is why we have called for net carbon zero by 2040 and 80 per cent reduction by 2030. It is why we have said as far back as 2009: 'Let's go for a 40 per cent reduction by 2020.' If we were in that ballpark now, we would be laughing— Australia would be sitting on a jobs-rich boom. We would be giving so much hope to young people who want to go into universities to study these technologies and who want to make sure that we can convert our cities to a low-carbon future. They want to be supporting more public transport, the rollout of electric vehicles, the rollout of solar at residential and at utility scale with solar-thermal plants. They want to see windfarms; they want to see wave power being generated; they want to see all the new technologies. One young woman stood up in one of these forums and said she was a fifth-year solar engineering student. She had put her whole faith in addressing global warming by using her intelligence and her skills to roll this out. Now she will have no option but to go overseas. That is what we are seeing around the country.


By attacking the renewable energy target like this, destroying certainty, taking away any hope that this country will ever get on track to reducing greenhouse gases to the level they need to be to be consistent with the science, you are taking away hope from the next generation. You are denying rural and regional Australia the massive rollout of jobs that will come with renewable energy. It has already come with renewable energy.


As for this absolute nonsense about wind farm sickness, what a load of garbage. How come wind farm sickness only strikes people in countries where people speak English? How ridiculous is it? It is absolutely ridiculous. The Americans have rolled it out, it is happening in Australia and they have it in the UK. It is just ridiculous.


At the same time, you have the Senate Community Affairs References Committee reporting on the impacts on air quality and human health from small particulate matter, especially from coal fired power stations. What does the government do about that—a genuine health issue with a proven medical effect? The government just say, 'Noted. None of our business.' Where are the increased performance standards for coal fired power stations? Nowhere. There is just this ongoing, ridiculous, concocted attack against renewable energy. It is going on against solar. It is only a matter of time before they come up with a process of charging people to leave the grid. What gives me great hope is the disruptive nature of battery technology as people say, 'We are over the fact that the government in this country have actually worked to destroy renewables.'


I come back to the final and most important point, the one I started with—and that is that this will not deliver certainty. This is just a milestone on the way to destroying the renewable energy target. It is naive in the extreme for anyone to put a dollar into renewable energy on this basis when you have a Prime Minister saying, 'This is as low as we could get in this term of government, but we would have liked to have reduced it further.' Yes, they would and, yes, they will if they get the slightest chance. We have heard the Labor Party say, 'We are considering a higher target.' Where is any kind of rigor around that? We have seen no numbers and no commitment, just talk and a cooperative arrangement that will see renewable energy set back. There was no reason to go below 41,000 gigawatt hours and there is no reason to do it now.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-06-15,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (18:17):  You can tell that the Greens do not have a lot of experience running businesses because their prescription for job creation and greater economic activity is to find the most expensive way of doing something. It is not in dispute that renewable energy is more expensive. Indeed, Senator Milne admitted that in her contribution. She admitted that when she said that, by exempting the aluminium industry, we are going to increase the power bills of consumers around the country. So renewable energy is a more expensive form of energy. According to the Greens and Senator Milne, by doing the same thing in a more expensive way we will somehow have a stronger economy. It is not a prescription that would be commonly formulated. It is certainly not one that they would put in that context. But sometimes in this place we make things so complex when they should be much simpler.


Whilst the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 is a complex piece of legislation, it has a very simple prescription at its heart. The renewable energy target mandates that the producers of cheap electricity in our country must buy each year a set amount of expensive electricity. The simple truth underlying this legislation is that renewable energy is expensive. If it were not expensive then the renewable energy sector would not need this legislation. We do not have a shortage of cheap electricity in Australia. We have ample resources of coal and gas. Traditionally, that has meant we have some of the cheapest power prices in the world. Cheap power means dear wages because cheap power helps improve productivity and provides businesses with the ability to invest in more capital and more highly skilled workers.


But renewable energy is somewhere between double and five times the cost of our fossil based resources. We sometimes hear that solar is now competitive with fossil fuel based electricity, to which I respond, 'Good. We can remove all of these subsidies we currently have to support renewable energy industries if that is the case.' But of course the Greens do not want that.


As the Productivity Commission stated about the renewable energy target in 2011:


The Commission has assumed that the LRMC—


long-run marginal cost—


of wind power is A$110/MWh. This is based on data from Frontier Economics (unpublished data) that suggested that the LRMC of wind power projects in Australia was mostly in the range A$100–A$120/MWh.


The average wholesale price of electricity was assumed to be A$50/MWh (section D.1). This implies that for wind power projects to meet their LRMC, the REC—


renewable energy certificate—


price would need to be around A$60.


That is hard for people to visualise, but let's try to visualise something a bit more tangible. If you have a 3.5-megawatt capacity wind turbine, you can potentially produce around 30,000 megawatt hours a year. You times it by 24 and by 365 and that gives you the potential megawatt hours that that turbine can produce a year. In this case, it is around 30,000. In fact, most wind turbines in Australia produce power only 30 per cent of the time, so you would only produce just over 9,000 megawatt hours a year. If the RET price has to be $60 a megawatt-hour to produce electricity, that means that that wind turbine would get $551,000 from other energy consumers.


When you next drive past wind turbines on your travels, just remember that each one of those turbines is getting something like half a million dollars courtesy of other energy users and customers in this country just to operate. The average life of a turbine is around 20 years. That means that they are getting around $10 million over their lifetime. That is $10 million courtesy of other power users. That is just one turbine. We are told that we are going to have to install more than 1,000 of these things to meet this target that we are going to legislate here.


Some argue, though, that the renewable energy target will deliver cheaper energy over time. That last bit is important—that it will be not now but 'over time'. Whether or not that will actually happen is a gamble. It is a risk. There is no guarantee in our legislation that it will become cheaper. Those who argue that this legislation is good for the economy are effectively taking one big punt that some forms of renewable energy will come down like manna from heaven in the future and be cheaper. That is a huge risk to take with our economy.


We have seen this play out before and it ended in tragedy then, too. For a long time people in Australia argued that we should have high tariffs on cars, clothing and whitegoods to help protect local industries and that, over time, those industries would become more competitive and we could remove the tariffs. Well, that never happened—and I fear the same result will occur with our renewable energy industry, if we maintain as high a renewable energy target as we have had. Worse, at least high tariffs did protect jobs in labour-intensive industries like manufacturing. But renewable energy is not a particularly labour-intensive form of energy provision. Much of the construction of the turbines occurs overseas, and, once the turbines are installed, there are very few people to work out around the turbines. Indeed, some of the management of the turbines that exist in Australia occurs overseas in the home country of their design.


So, if this legislation is not to create jobs, what is it for? One of the objects of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act is 'to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector'. However, renewable energy is a particularly costly way of doing that. According to the Productivity Commission, the implicit abatement cost of the large-scale renewable energy target is between $37 and $111 per tonne. This is a much higher price than the less than $15 per tonne that was recently achieved through the coalition's Direct Action policy. The Productivity Commission's estimate also assumes that renewable energy has no emissions itself, which is not correct, given that wind turbines, for example, are made of steel and need enormous amounts of concrete to hold them in place. Some estimates say that each megawatt of wind power produced takes around 460 tonnes of steel. Each megawatt of wind power also takes around 870 cubic metres of concrete. Now, let us compare that to something else—natural gas. Natural gas takes 27 cubic metres of concrete for each megawatt of power and 3.3 tonnes of steel for each megawatt. I wonder which one is more environmentally sustainable and friendly? The renewable energy target gets less bang for more buck. That is why I think it is a good thing that this bill reduces the target and exempts more industries from having to purchase renewable energy certificates. 


This new law will ensure Australia's emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries will be fully exempt from the increased costs imposed by the renewable energy target. These costs are imposed on industries like the aluminium industry in Central Queensland. There are two major aluminium refineries near Gladstone that employ almost 2,000 people. When Senator Milne talks about jobs and the aluminium industry, she might want to reflect on the 2,000 people in Central Queensland whose full-time jobs rely on cheap power. If we remove cheap power, they will no longer have jobs. Central Queensland is already doing it tough after a slowdown in the coal mining sector. It does not need the double whammy of pressure on its aluminium industry too. I welcome that this legislation will remove this sword of Damocles that has been hanging over the head of the Gladstone economy.


I have been fortunate enough to attend five hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines. Of course, I will not pre-empt the findings of that committee here today. But I have been to some of these people's homes; I have heard their genuine concerns about the impact of wind turbines. These people are normal, everyday Australians. I do not know if Senator Milne has gone and spoken to some of these people before she dismisses their concerns as ludicrous, but I think she probably should have an obligation to do that. You can go and talk to these people—people like Rikki Nicholson from Cape Bridgewater. He has had to move out of his home. He and his wife have moved out of their home because of the impact of turbines. There is Mr David Mortimer from Lake Bonney in South Australia. His wife has suffered so much that he sold his farm so he could live further away from the wind turbines. And Mr Ron Jelbart, from east of the Macarthur wind farm, has badly disrupted sleep, and his son also suffers similar complaints, including tinnitus, when he visits their farm.


The stories go on and on. Last week we had a couple, Clive and Trina Gare, who are hosts of wind turbines. They have been paid around $1 million by the wind turbine industry. But they say they would never have them again, given the problems they have caused them, particularly in terms of their sleeping. I do not know if wind turbines have caused these complaints. I am not a medical professional. But it does seem coincidental that there are so many people willing to go so far and at great financial cost to move from their homes and disrupt their lives because of the impact they feel has been caused by wind turbines. I certainly believe that there are legitimate questions, particularly around the impact of infrasound and low frequency noise that is generated by wind turbines.


What has concerned me more than the concerns of the community, though, is the dismissive and contemptuous attitude of some in the wind industry. Multiple wind turbine operators have said to the committee that because they comply with all regulations they have no further obligations to the residents that claim to be affected. That is not true. Under the long-established tort of negligence, persons engaged in supplying goods and services have a duty of care to take reasonable actions to prevent foreseeable damage occurring. Some in the wind industry are not being reasonable. A representative from one wind company tabled a cartoon belittling the complaints of affected residents to the Senate committee. A cartoon! Another wind industry staffer has tweeted that those complaining are 'nutters'. This is not the behaviour of an industry that is taking their responsibilities to the wider community seriously. 


Given that the wind industry does not seem to be serious about taking their obligations into account, we should be. We should not be giving each wind turbine $500,000 a year through this legislation without then making sure that they are not doing harm to people and causing adverse health impacts. While the wind industry does not seem to believe that it has an obligation to do no harm, I think we do. Until we know more about the impact of wind turbines, particularly the impact of infrasound and low frequency noise, we should have a moratorium on the accreditation of new wind turbines under this legislation. Under division 3 of this legislation, the regulator has the power to accredit new wind turbine operators. That should not occur until we understand the full impact of these things. It should be on our watch that we make sure that we do not do harm to people. We must do more research into this before we go down the path of funding through enormous amounts of government subsidies, or legislation that imposes subsidies, that potentially cause harm.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:28):  I was very interested in the contribution by Senator Canavan. If he does believe what he has been saying about wind turbines, then I suspect we will see an amendment from him to that effect in this debate.




Senator Cameron:
  From the doormat?




Senator LUDWIG:
  I will not go into that. I do call them that myself every so often, but I do not think they will do anything significant in this area. But can I remain on point. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 is a further testament of the Labor Party's commitment to the renewable energy sector and to provide certainty for the industry going into the future. I want to note that this has been a drawn-out process. The Howard government back in 2000 started the process. It was well received then, so it is surprising to me now to hear the contributions the National Party and the Liberals opposite are making.



Sitting suspended from 18:30
 to 
19
:
30





Senator LUDWIG:
  I am led to believe the National Party, if not the Liberal Party, are crabbing away from their policy position on this. The bill will ultimately reduce the large-scale renewable energy target—LRET—from 41,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 to 33,300 gigawatt-hours, with this level to be maintained until 2030. It will allow for a full exemption to be provided for electricity used in prescribed emissions-intensive, trade exposed activities so that they do not need to purchase and surrender large-scale generation certificates. It will remove the requirement for two yearly reviews of the operation of the RET scheme and replace it with annual statements by the Clean Energy Regulator on the progress of the RET towards meeting new targets and the impact it is having on household electricity bills. As I have outlined, and the bill will include native forest waste as an eligible renewable energy source.


When it comes to the renewable energy issue more broadly, Labor has strong record in supporting renewable energy. Labor's renewable energy target has been a success not only for the environment but also for jobs and the economy. Under Labor, we saw jobs in the renewable energy sector triple and a huge investment of $18 billion in hydropower plants, wind farms, solar farms and the development of renewable technologies. This industry employs 21,000 people and had been growing well up until the election of—you guessed it—the Abbott government.


Renewable energy and especially solar energy was a particular focus of the previous Bligh Labor government as well. Together with federal Labor policies, the great state of Queensland now leads the nation with almost 33 per cent of Australia's total solar PV capacity. Queensland is also home to the highest number of renewable energy jobs, with more than 6,500 of the 21,000 jobs I mentioned. Again, it is leading the nation. Unfortunately, we saw the previous Newman government attack the successful take-up of solar energy in Queensland with the cutting of the solar feed-in tariff scheme. Fortunately, now we do not have to worry too much about Mr Newman inflicting any more damage to the renewable sector. He went the same way as many before him who made bad decisions.


During Labor's time in office, we saw a drop in Australia's electricity sector emissions of seven per cent and rooftop solar grew from only 7,000 to around 1.2 million. It is an extraordinary and significant increase, which is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels while saving people money at the same time. Globally, investment in renewable energy grew by 16 per cent last year. In one of the largest economies in the world and in one of our biggest trading partners, China, we saw that investment in renewable energy went up by 33 per cent.


In 2013, at the end of the previous Labor government, we saw Australia ranked as No. 4 in the world for being the most attractive place to invest renewable energy in the world. We are now at the 10th spot. We have dropped. Why? It is because this government talks the talks but does not follow through with any of the actions. The statistics reveal that this government is not serious about renewable energy. You had Senator Canavan's extraordinary contribution this evening. One would think that he was arguing against renewable energy at all, but I will leave it to people to make their own judgement. The RET was an important part of Labor's clean energy package and that is why Labor has been fighting against the Abbott government's attacks on renewable energy for the past 18 months.


On the amendments to this legislation, the original version of this scheme was introduced by the Howard government back in 2001 and expanded by Labor in 2009 and 2010. The renewable energy target has enjoyed bipartisanship for more than a decade. That is, until the climate sceptic Mr Abbott was elected and decided to systematically dismantle climate and renewable energy policy in Australia. We know that in September 2009 Mr Abbott told a Liberal Party dinner in Victoria that he thought the science of human caused climate change was 'crap'. Just a few days ago, on 2GB with Alan Jones, Mr Abbott made these extraordinary remarks. I quote the program:


""Well Alan look, I do take your point about the potential health impact of these things,"" Mr Abbott said.


""When I've been up close to these wind farms, there's no doubt, not only are they visually awful, they make a lot of noise.


""What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E, the number of these things that we are going to get in the future,"" he said.


""Now I would frankly have liked to have reduced the number a lot more.""


The point is that we know the motive of the Prime Minister and his government, because we know they are fundamentally opposed to climate change. They do not believe that they should be doing anything in this area at all, whilst the rest of the world is moving towards the greater use of renewable energy and a greater investment in renewable energy technologies. Why? Because it makes smart business sense. That would mean that this government would also have to make smart business decisions, but I do not think it is capable of doing just that.


Mr Abbott decided to break his promise to the Australian people on the renewable energy target, just like we have seen him break so many other promises since he has been elected. The $600 million commitment for solar roofs in towns and schools was cut down to just $2 million in last year's budget. ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, had its funding severely cut after the government failed to abolish it.


The review of the RET, led by a known climate sceptic, which caused uncertainty in the industry, was a shocker by this government. However, even the PM's own review, and even the climate sceptic himself, found that the current renewable energy target of 41,000 gigawatts will put downward pressure on household prices in the medium to long term. The current RET of 41,000 gigawatts is driving investment in Australia's renewable energy industry. The RET is reducing Australia's carbon pollution, and the renewable energy target is creating jobs in Australia.


The review was a political exercise, which ultimately recommended the abolition of the RET, or severely cutting the target. Despite this, the findings spoke for themselves. He found that he could not change the facts. He changed the ending, but that is not surprising when you look at the record of this government and what they sought the reviewer to find. As to the benefits to the economy and our environment, the facts spoke for themselves. They were clear and unequivocal—they create jobs, investment and opportunity. What we have seen here on display by the Abbott government, once again, is the extremism of the Abbott government's agenda. It is not even a purely neo-con, or a traditional centre-right, agenda. Their party seems to have a very confused agenda to an outsider when it comes to environmental policy.


We see them oppose a market-based mechanism for dealing with carbon pollution—a price on carbon that was to be determined by the free market. Instead, their policy—to the extent that you could call it a policy rather than a collection of actions—is quite Stalinist in style. It is central government controlled, hugely expensive and taxpayer funded—the so called Direct Action policy. Even the Greens do not support such a wasteful government funded program. Let me be kind though. It did take them a couple of times to finally support an emissions trading scheme, but at least they got there in the end. Now, we have a policy mechanism in the target that is obviously working—it is creating jobs; it is encouraging development of new technologies; and it is not a burden to the householders of Australia. Those opposite would argue, and continue to argue, the mistruths that renewable energy costs householders. It flies in the face of the facts found even by their own reviewer, all reasons why the government should support the renewable energy target. But, instead, their twisted agenda sees them being dragged kicking and screaming to this outcome. I would have thought that they might have ignored the National Party in this debate, but it seems they have let the National Party off the leash when it comes to renewable energy, particularly wind farms. I suspect that they have been able to garner a leave pass.


Ultimately, I will remind you once again, the outcome will see almost 25 per cent of Australia's energy generation come from renewable sources by 2020. It is a great outcome for the fight against climate change. The survival of this and the work that will be put into this is worthy of note. It is part of a wider set of policies that need to be implemented to see Australia leading the world on the development and generation of renewable energy. What I worry about is that this government is not committed to funding the science and the work that will need to take us into the future of clean energy. From this side of politics, it shows Labor's willingness to negotiate an outcome that is in the interests of the country—not just opposing the government for the sake of opposition.


The Abbott government walked away from more than a decade of bipartisanship on this issue, which was disappointing. If we are going to make a difference in this field, we need bipartisanship. I would encourage the Liberals to ignore the Nats on this one. We have fought the government's attempts to completely get rid of the renewable energy target, and we have outcomes in this bill that will see RET retained for the future. It will see the extension of exemptions for emission-intensive trade-exposed activities such as the aluminium smelting industry. The Clean Energy Council has predicted the new target of 33 gigawatts will drive close to $40.4 billion in investment and create more than 15,000 jobs. This will provide certainty for the industry so that it can start investing again in jobs and development.


Through Labor's negotiation, we achieved: no change to the small-scale solar scheme, which includes rooftop solar, solar panels for small businesses such as nursing homes and all the other small businesses that have invested in this technology; full exemption for emissions-intensive trade industries, which relieves some pressure on those industries that are enduring a downturn and difficult times; and the removal of two-yearly reviews, which provides the long-term certainty the industry so desperately needs to survive and to thrive.


As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, Labor will oppose the government's proposal in this bill for the burning of native forests as part of the RET. Burning native forests for energy is neither clean nor renewable. The government's definition of waste in this legislation in relation to native trees is not just woodchips but can include large parts of tree as well as entire trees. I would have thought that the Abbott government would have learned from the Howard government and from the Tasmanian experience. If you allow that to occur, you do not have the whole of the tree being used properly; you end up with the whole of the tree being used for wood waste. The experience there needs to be very carefully considered. 


The Abbott government, as in all its dealings with environmental policy, does show its true colours here—just as we saw with its dismantling of Labor's clean energy package, its abolition of the ETS, its attempts at abolishing ARENA, its attempts at abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and its attempt at abolishing the renewable energy target. We now see, in this compromise from the government, that it cannot help but to include the provision which allows for the burning of our native forests. Of course, sneaking in this provision, which vandalises our environment and does not protect it, shows who really sit opposite in this debate—climate changes deniers, environmental vandals and those with only the interest of big business in their mind, and not a balanced view of how you could create new jobs and new technology, and support environmental outcomes. 


Because of the principles which we hold in the Labor Party, the environment and the jobs of the future, in renewable energy generation and development, will be a part of Australia's future—despite this government, I suspect. This government will find that it will not be able to sustain its unsustainable position in the light of significant advancements, because—as people have also spoken about—renewable energy is here to stay.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-06-15,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:46):  I am very relieved to finally rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. It has been a long time coming. Sadly, the government's failure to keep their word means we have landed in a far inferior position than the one that we were in two years ago. The government have held the industry to ransom. While I do not doubt that some on the other side would be happy to watch while the renewables industries die a slow death, Labor cannot accept this. For this reason, we have taken the advice of the industry and agreed to the government's revised target.


The story of the RET under Tony Abbott is an unfortunate one, and one that brings into stark relief the sad reality that we simply cannot trust the government to keep their promises. Before the 2013 election, there was no question about the future of the RET. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and both sides of politics recognised the vital role it could play in transitioning Australia to a low-carbon economy. In fact, before the election the Prime Minister could not have been clearer when he said 'There will be no change to the RET'. There were no disclaimers, no caveats and no mentions of any sort of a 'real 20 per cent'. But, very soon after gaining the keys to the ministerial wing, those opposite had a dramatic about-face. Earnest statements about the importance of renewable energy quickly gave way to mutterings about high electricity prices and possible oversupply. This is despite the fact that these claims simply are not borne out by the evidence or the expert modelling undertaken for the government's own RET review. 


Of course, this was undoubtedly the plan from the beginning. It is a plan we have seen play out again and again in all number of policy areas. Clearly the government's pre-election plan was to say whatever it liked before election day, and do whatever it wanted after it had it won the ballot—never mind the fact that the latter bears no resemblance whatsoever to the former. And that is exactly what happened in the case of the renewable energy target. Within months, the government's rock solid-support for this successful—and previously bipartisan—policy evaporated, and the war on renewable energy began in earnest.


Other speakers here and in the other place have clearly laid out the benefits of the RET to the environment, to the economy, for power prices and for regional economies. They have noted the vital importance of the RET in reducing CO2 emissions and in allowing Australia to transition to a low-carbon economy. They have recognised the enormous benefits in terms of job creation in a sector that employed 20,000 Australians in 2014. They have rightly pointed out that not only does the RET not have any impact on the federal budget but it will actually reduce power bills for consumers within five years. 


I will not go into any more detail in these areas. Instead, I would like to spend a bit of time discussing one of the most recent and, quite frankly, the most astounding comments we have seen on the RET. It came from the Prime Minister himself. Last week, the Prime Minister dropped the mask and revealed once and for all the Jurassic depths of his opposition to renewable energy—in this case, the wind industry. When grilled by the notorious antiwind campaigner Alan Jones, the Prime Minister did not hold back, boasting about government cuts to the RET and his goal to: 


… reduce the growth rate of this particular sector as much as the current Senate would allow us to do.


Not only that, but the leader of this country even went as far as to say that he wished the RET had never been introduced. 


This is absolutely astounding stuff. A sitting Prime Minister boasting about setting policy in order to shut down investment. The very same Prime Minister who, despite telling the world that Australia was open for business under his leadership, has presided over a dramatic 90 per cent fall in investment in renewable energy, and the same Prime Minister who admitted he never supported the very policy he took to the people of Australia before the election. So what justification did the Prime Minister give for his verbal trashing of the wind industry? Nothing beyond his own, very subjective belief that wind farms are 'visually awful' and 'noisy'. 


Over recent months, I have gathered a reasonable amount of knowledge in this area, as Labor's representative on the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines 


While it is undoubtedly true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I think you would be hard-pressed to find too many people who would choose to spend time next to the belching, toxic smoke of a coal power station rather than a wind turbine.


Personally, I actually find them quite graceful, even majestic. And I say that as someone who has stood directly underneath quite a few wind farms. And, despite what the Prime Minister says, in my experience you could easily hold a conversation at normal volume, right at the base of a wind turbine. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that the Prime Minister has only ever been close to one turbine in his life—one turbine, which he used to damn a whole industry and, in so doing, put thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in future investment at risk. It is unbelievable. But the Prime Minister was not content to voice his own coal-addled opinion on aesthetics and sound. He went further. And in so doing he put himself at odds with the medical and scientific community when he asserted that wind farms have 'potential health impacts'. Despite what the Prime Minister and some others in this place would like you to believe, there is simply no credible evidence to support this. There have been 25 reviews across the globe into this issue and not one has found evidence that wind farms are detrimental to human health.


The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, our peak health research body, released a peer-reviewed paper in 2010, which found no robust scientific evidence to link wind turbines with adverse health effects.


Given ongoing concerns from some sections of the community, in 2012 the NHMRC convened a Wind Farms and Human Health Reference Group, released a draft information paper and commissioned Adelaide university to undertake a review of scientific literature on the health effects of wind farms, which came to similar conclusions as those in the 2010 paper. The most recent NHMRC statement entitled 'Evidence on wind farms and human health', states: 


There is no direct evidence that exposure to wind farm noise affects physical or mental health.


Similarly, the Australian Medical Association position paper on the issue, states:


The available Australian and international evidence does not support the view that the infrasound or low frequency sound generated by wind farms, as they are currently regulated in Australia, causes adverse health effects on populations residing in their vicinity. The infrasound and low frequency sound generated by modern wind farms in Australia is well below the level where known health effects occur, and there is no accepted physiological mechanism where sub-audible infrasound could cause health effects.


Last year, Canada's national health body, Health Canada, undertook the largest ever epidemiological study of wind farms. The study incorporated over 1,200 households, living varying distances from wind turbines, some as close as 500 metres away. This $2.1 million study included a peer-reviewed methodology, medical expertise, self-reporting and objective health measures including hair cortisol, blood pressure and heart rates, and 4,000 hours of acoustic data. It, too, found no link between wind farms and human health.


In fact, there is not a peak medical organisation, national health regulator and/or national acoustics body in the world that holds the position that wind farms can damage your health, despite wind farms being in operation for four decades globally. And this is borne out by real-world experience.


During a recent hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines, in Melbourne, the world's largest turbine manufacturer Vestas testified that, of their service and operations workforce of 5,500 people across the globe, not one complaint had been made about the health impacts of wind farms. Despite spending eight hours a day, day in and day out, month after month, working in or around wind turbines, not one person complained of health problems. And yet our Prime Minister seems to think that he knows better. It is truly astounding that the leader of this country would go out in public and spout such unsubstantiated nonsense. It is even more astounding that the Prime Minister was so willing to dispense with the facts in order to further his vicious war on renewable energy.


The Prime Minister's comments are not only ignorant but also extremely reckless. There is a growing body of credible research which shows that exposure to anti-wind-turbine messages can have a significant impact on people's perceptions of the impacts of wind farms on their health. The Prime Minister's words will only serve to increase anxiety in regional communities and will create uncertainty in an industry that offers billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs.


I will finish soon, because we need to salvage the message that this government has made of the renewable energy industry. And we need to do it urgently.


In my home state of Tasmania, in my home region on the north-west and west coast, we could have 200 workers on the ground right now building the proposed wind farm at Granville Harbour. The wind farm has secured all the necessary approvals and even had investor interest, until the government broke its promise that there would be no changes to the RET.


Two hundred jobs might not sound like a lot in the Prime Minister's northern Sydney electorate, but I can guarantee that it will mean a lot to the people of north-west and west Tasmania. I would urge all senators in this place to think of the thousands of regional jobs that will be created only when this legislation is passed and of the thousands of potential jobs that may never come to be if it is not.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:58):  It is with a sense of dismay that I rise tonight to speak on this bill, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015, because this debate did not need to occur. What we are seeing here is the expression of the Abbott government's opinion that Australia is running the risk, out to the year 2020, of having too much renewable energy, too much clean energy on our network and that that is an enormous problem that needs to be dealt with by bringing forward legislation.


We know for an absolute fact, because they told us—they do not even try to hide it any more; for a little while they did, but now they have got so drunk on whatever it is they are up to in their party room that they just say it flat out—that they wanted to completely abolish the renewable energy target, just like they wanted to knock over the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and abolish ARENA and any of the mainstays of this industry in getting it on its feet so that it can employ people, drive down greenhouse gas emissions and set us up for the electricity generation industry of the future. The Abbott government has been absolutely, almost forensically, determined to wipe it out. That is what brings us to this debate tonight. 


Can you imagine people in future times looking back on this debate to discover a government doing everything in its power to prevent us from an oversupply of clean energy when the rest of the world is doing the opposite—albeit in fits and starts because there are people like Prime Minister Tony Abbott in all those other countries as well. In Saudi Arabia, in Canada and in other places; in the United States, various Tea Party operatives in the pay of fossil fuel industries: such people are scattered throughout the industrialised world. But imagine looking back in the Australian context and realising that the government had set out to prevent us from having too much clean energy. It is absolutely unbelievable. Trying to bankrupt clean energy companies and throw people out of work shows not simply indifference but active hostility to renewable energy.


What it amounts to, though, when you try and work out exactly what is going on here, is that the Australian electricity network is dramatically overbuilt. Apparently, we have built 9,000 megawatts or nine gigawatts of capacity that this country does not need. Basically, we have built too many generators, based on uncritical hallucinations about future energy demand—that it was just going to keep growing and growing; that energy efficiency would never play a part; that home solar would never play any kind of part; that, at a household level, people would not start getting serious about doing their bit. But that is all happening. It was thought that we would simply continue to grow forever, so we have this extraordinary overcapacity.


In WA, it amounts to an estimated $1 billion worth of generators that we do not need, with more than $300 million spent on resurrecting the old, polluting Muja coal fired power station just outside of Collie. You might as well have just shovelled 300 million bucks into the boiler and torched it. This is under the same Barnett government that, while it is not entirely responsible—because some of this stuff has a fairly long lead time—has presided over the destruction of the state's finances, with the loss of its triple A credit rating. They are now crying poor. They have abandoned public transport projects and all sorts of other projects because the state's finances are in ruins, having spent more than $1 billion on electricity generators that we do not need. 


This is where we start to get a bit of a hint about what the Abbott government is up to. What exactly do we think is the motivation of the Abbott government in exercising such forensic hostility in trying to wipe out this industry? If you go looking for motive, you could be forgiven for not looking any further than Mr Maurice Newman, who is the Chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. This is not some nut-case blogger ranting on the Infowars website; this is the guy who runs the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. He has said:


This is not about facts or logic. It's about a new world order under the control of the UN.


He thinks it is effectively about some kind of communist de-industrialisation of Western powers as part of some strange, manifest agenda that is never quite spelt out. 'It's about a new world order under the control of the United Nations.' This is somebody whose advice the Prime Minister take seriously. But I think we need to look a bit further than Mr Newman.


I think we could take Mr Abbott's comments to Alan Jones on the radio the other day at face value. For obvious reasons, other senators have also quoted those comments in this debate. He said:


What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E—


I guess he spelt it out. I did not hear the interview myself; I could not bear it—


we reduced the number of these things that we're going to get in the future. Now, I would frankly have liked to have reduced the number a lot more—


he is talking about wind installations. And then Alan pats him on the head, saying:


Good—well, you're the boss.


Mr Abbott continued:


But we got the best deal we could out of the Senate. And if we hadn't had a deal, Alan, we would have been stuck with even more of these things.


The renewable energy industry, trying to negotiate in good faith with these people to get a better outcome, are getting certainty; they are getting certainty—and this is why I think it has been a mistake to try and bargain for a reduction in the renewable energy target—that the government is trying to wipe them out. The government is trying to put them out of business. 


In the Western Australian context, that effectively means the loss of about 1,000 jobs, and I will put some figures to you now about how we arrived at that number. This government has effectively, through their renewable energy policies and in conjunction with their state Liberal and National colleagues, destroyed 1,000 jobs in Western Australia: a slow clap for you all! From a peak of under 1,500 jobs in solar and 360 in wind, we have fallen to around 730 in solar and 50 in wind in 2013-14. You destroyed 1,000 jobs in an industry that we urgently need to get on its feet because of the employment potential of getting the local manufacturing sector up and running. In WA, with the end of the mining-construction boom and the settling into the operations phase, people are leaving northern towns in droves and they are leaving regional areas, and sections of the Western Australian economy are beginning to cave in. You would think that this government that prides itself on its economic credentials would be doing everything that it can to support new industries of the future. I do not know what the national figures are; others senators will speak to those. But you have destroyed 1,000 jobs in Western Australia. Congratulations!


The Climate Council has shown that, over the last year, global employment in renewables grew by 13 per cent and, in Australia, renewable energy jobs fell by roughly the same amount. The International Energy Agency reports that renewable energy continues to rank as 'the fastest growing power source'; yet, in 2014, investment in Australia fell by 35 per cent overall and 88 per cent in large-scale projects. 


So, this is not just rhetoric, a kind of unhinged rhetoric, from people like Mr Maurice Newman. This is actually deadly serious. This is industry policy playing out. This is very large donors in the oil, gas and coal industries who bankrolled the government into office and basically bought the executive of a major political party now carrying out their agenda—and it is sketched out in reasonable detail in the IPA's hit list of 100 things they would like to see done to the country—almost forensically and destroying an industry competitor. This is not because renewable energy is a failure, not because it is too expensive and not because it does not work. It is because it works too well—not just overseas, but right here in Australia. WA is the second highest greenhouse polluter per capita after the Northern Territory, and, thanks to the Barnett government, when we abolished the state-based renewable energy target from 2011-12 greenhouse gas emissions in Western Australia are set to double. This is over a period of time when Mr Hunt thinks he can waive his hand magically and somehow see us be brought into line with out international commitments.


In 2011 the state government also scrapped the feed-in tariff scheme for homeowners who installed solar panels. We just produced, at home, our second annual iteration of the solar postcodes report, which maps something a little bit unusual—something that is a bit counterintuitive—for Western Australia. It is that Western Australian households, with other families from around the country, want to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing for environmental reasons, but, significantly, for cost reasons as well. I guess the myth, at least from the Liberal-National side of the chamber, is that clean energy and home-installed power stations—rooftop PV—is a plaything of the wealthy. But when you look at the numbers for the families and the households in Western Australia that are installing solar PV it is inversely correlated with the median wealth of the postcode. It is low income and outer-metropolitan suburbs that are doing their bit, and it is the government that has actually become the block. It is not simply indifference at work here. It is hostility. And we know why. It is because renewable energy is competing a little bit too well with the people who helped put you into office. We are talking about 1,080 jobs in WA alone.


Around the country the writing is on the wall. It is happening around the world as well, but we have seen some pretty vivid examples here in Australia in the last little while. Coal is on its way out. It is not that it is good for humanity. Go to Morwell in the middle of the fire—you could not breathe the air—and tell people how good coal is for humanity. The Greens have gone to the Victorian, Queensland and New South Wales state elections talking about and proposing a structured, phased closure of coal power that keeps the workforce engaged and employed through staged rehabilitation of mine sites, while you can start training people and working for a transition. There is no reason at all why the sites of the coalmines and the big generators in Australia, whether it be in the Hunter, in the Latrobe or in Collie in Western Australia, cannot be the sites of the clean energy technologies of the future, because no-one in their right mind is going to walk away from billions of dollars worth of sunk costs in transmission infrastructure in each of those three places. This is where we can be generating the renewable jobs of the future. But the government has its back turned, not through—as far as I can tell—any kind of strategic assessment of where energy reform in this country needs to go, but through simple, blind pigheadedness and refusal to admit that the world has changed.


Coalmines are closing anyway. In the last month and a half we have seen Anglesea close in Victoria and Alinta's Leigh Creek plants close in South Australia. Before that, it was Redbank, in New South Wales. Who is it going to be next? Maybe it will be Hazelwood. If you do not have a transition plan for the workforce they are thrown on the discard pile. Why is it that we are the only people talking about a structured transition for these workforces, rather than abandoning them to the inevitability that the industry is on its way out—not because of government policy, but despite it? They are being outcompeted by electricity generators that need no fuel. Once the capital is installed they run for virtually nothing. That is the game changer that you appear to have failed to understand. That is why we stand here tonight debating the destruction or the attempted sabotage of the clean energy sector—not through any kind of mysterious ideology, but, I think, through the hardheaded business pragmatism of the dying industries of coal and those in the gas industry who think they are some kind of viable replacement because they are slightly less bad than coal.


Who gets to be collateral damage along the way? It is the native forest ecosystems of this country. This is a plan that will increase logging in out native forest estate. This is something that I speak about from direct experience in Western Australia, having been involved in the very late stages of the campaign to get the chainsaws, the bulldozers and the scrub rollers out of the old-growth forests in the south-west of Western Australia. Most Western Australians thought that was case closed. And good on the Gallop government, with the support of the Greens at the time in 2001, for actually bringing an end to very large-scale clear-felling in the old-growth forest estate in the karri forest and in the jarrah forest. Most Western Australians figured that was case closed and that the job was done. They walked away and they had a rest. People had been working on that campaign for 30 years, and they went off and did other stuff. In the meantime, the destruction of our native forest continued in smaller pockets and in areas arguably not considered technically old growth, because they might have been logged by a handsaw 60 years ago. The destruction continued of the forest ecosystems that support the wildlife, support the rainfall patterns and ultimately support the biodiversity that supports us and supports our economy. And this area in Western Australia we are speaking of is one of just 31 global biodiversity hot spots. The south-west forests of Western Australia are like nowhere else in the world, and we are seeing localised extinction cascades already. It is predicted that at current rates of habitat loss we will see Carnaby's Cockatoo become extinct by 2020. As it is in Western Australia, the current forest management plan will see the rate of logging increase—not decrease, but increase—into these dying markets in these customer countries that just do not want our woodchips any more, to an area equivalent to 10,000 Subiaco Ovals every year and an impact of around 200 square kilometres of native forest to be hit.


No wonder people are establishing blockade camps. People are mobilising and getting organised again to create some kind of defence against the insanity of industrialised logging. And just as we start to get to the point where we can have an intelligent conversation about a mature transition plan—there is that phrase again—to a plantation logging estate, what comes along but a proposal to feed native forest logs into incinerators. This is a perverse redefinition of renewable energy that has fooled absolutely nobody. This is nothing to do with forest waste, unless you are happy with the concept of 10 per cent of mature, old karri forest being knocked over and sent off for sawlog, and the other 90 per cent of those forest coupes being fed into chip-mills, pulped and burnt. Do you really consider 90 per cent to be waste?


The forest movement and the WA Forest Alliance—and I want to acknowledge their extraordinarily longstanding commitment, and that of their allies, the local people in the South West towns, to the defence of the native forests of the South West of WA—have recorded trees in excess of 300 years old. Trees older than the foundation of the city of Perth are being fed into chip-mills as waste and pulped. That is what we are dealing with. Trees that you cannot get your arms around—trees that five or six or seven people could not encircle—are being classified as waste, chipped and burned. What kind of government brings forward that proposal and perversely describes it as renewable energy? This has nothing to do with waste—at least not in the sense that you mean it; it is certainly wasteful in another sense.


Given that that is the package on the table, who in their right minds would support the Abbott government in this mad endeavour to destroy the clean energy sector just as it is starting to find its feet, and to sign off on the destruction of the native forests—not just those in the South West corner that I am particularly attached to, but the wild forests of East Gippsland, the rainforests of Tasmania, and the tall forests of New South Wales—who would throw the government that lifeline? Who indeed? Enter the Australian Labor Party. After listening to some of the speeches that ALP senators have delivered tonight—heartfelt, and no doubt sincere—you could be forgiven for thinking that the ALP was going to vote against this bill. But you are not; you are going to vote for it. You have thrown Prime Minister Tony Abbott a lifeline.


Having described at some length what is at stake, and the consequences, I can understand that, for a party that did everything it could to prevent the Clean Energy Act from coming into existence, and from a Prime Minister who said he wished that the Renewable Energy Target had never been legislated for, they have put their cards pretty clearly on the table—they are ambiguous and confused and pretty messed up on all sorts of other things, but they are crystal clear on the subject of what they think of the clean energy sector. But what on earth has got into the Labor Party that it would throw the government this lifeline? I have not heard that from any of the Labor senators who have chosen to speak to this bill.


We will be opposing this bill. When it gets to the committee stage, we will see what kinds of amendments are brought forward; I gather there is all sorts of churn, and that the amendments are still being frantically hacked. Why don't you adjourn this debate, take a very deep breath, and think about—not future generations, because it has become very apparent that you could not care less, but what about the present generation of young people—people who are coming through: kids of age five or six. Try and think about how they will feel in the 2050s and 2060s and 2070s, when they are our age—it is not that far away—if they pick up the transcripts from tonight's Hansard and read about the time that the Australian government, with the support of the opposition, legislated against the possibility of installing too much clean energy.


There is still time for a rethink. And I really hope, for the sake of the young people in all of our lives and the young people in the lives of those who might be following this debate from outside, that there is a rethink—that we come to our senses collectively as a legislature, and do what is demanded of us; that we move forward with the transition, that we do not dig our heels in and try and cling to a past that we have well and truly outlived. It is time to move on. Protecting and extending the Renewable Energy Target and guaranteeing the expansion of this industry and the jobs that it can provide—that is our job. That is what we should be doing in here—not clinging onto the technologies of the past that have brought us such risk; such extraordinary present-day and near-future risk.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (20:18):  I rise to make a few remarks on this topic. One of the confounds in all the discussion on this theory is that, somehow, the free energy that comes from renewables is going to make life better for people, in terms of cheaper energy and more jobs. One of the things that interests me is looking at the question around jobs, and I look at the King Juan Carlos University in Spain, who did a study on the job outcomes of their focus on renewable energy—which were that for every job that was created in the renewable space on a sustainable basis, some 2½ jobs of traditional infrastructure and industries were destroyed. And so, whilst there were jobs created during the construction phase, long-term there was a net loss in jobs in Spain.


We also see the other confound in the argument that has just been put forward around the issue of energy pricing. In my home state of South Australia, we have the nation's largest percentage of renewable energy, and yet we also have the nation's highest power prices. One of the reasons that I think we should be concerned about the drive to continuously increase renewable energy is that we need affordable power pricing to keep industries going which employ people. Renewable energy at this stage, whether we are talking wind or solar, cannot provide baseload power and so, even where we see renewable energy providing an increasing percentage of baseload power, we still have to keep in reserve, if you like, the ability to provide baseload power from either coal or gas—in the case of South Australia—which means that as they lose market share to the taxpayer-subsidised renewable sector, their costs—which they have to amortise across the ability to maintain their potential to provide 100 per cent baseload power—increase continuously per unit of power that they are able to sell. And so we get to this perverse situation, where one day we may end up having to subsidise people who are burning fossil fuels in order to enable them to continue to provide that assurance of baseload power, because the renewable sector cannot. And so, whilst it is appealing at one level to hear the debate that endless amounts of sun means endless amounts of free energy, the reality right now is that for South Australia, increasing amounts for renewables—which on the one hand looks very attractive; but on the other hand we also have the highest power costs in the nation—has a detrimental impact on the ability of industry to still function, to compete in a global environment, and to employ Australians, and means that we see increasing pressure on the non-renewable sector, which is still required to provide that backup of the potential of providing 100 per cent of our baseload power.


So whilst over time we have seen governments of both persuasions invest in renewable energy—and I recall the coalition investing in things like solar near Whyalla in South Australia and geothermal in northern South Australia—the reality is that large-scale subsidy of renewable power has not delivered the nirvana that we are hoping for. This decision to look at reducing the target is an appropriate balance of saying: let's continue some investment in renewables, but let's also recognise that an unrestrained increase in those targets could well lead, as we have seen, to increasing pricing, which makes it more difficult for communities to continue to operate industries and to employ people, which sustains the very economy that we are hoping to be the basis of Australia's future in terms of innovation, manufacturing and jobs. For that reason I support the bill brought forward by the government.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (20:23):  I rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. Right across the country a shift is happening. Communities are ditching the old, destructive, polluting industry of the past and embracing the new, clean, innovative ways of the future. For the big polluters the future is bleak. For the rest the future is exciting, but now we are facing a choice: the old way or the new way. This deal, to reduce the renewable energy target and to include the burning of native forests for electricity within the target, is well and truly a backward step. The transition away from logging these centuries-old native forests is well underway. Logging of native forests is not where the jobs of the future are for these communities. 


I came into this parliament with some clear aims: to strive for happiness and health for humanity; to protect our land, water and air; and to work so that the incredible diversity of life that we share this planet with can be protected and can thrive and flourish. Travelling through my home state of Victoria, I have met countless people who share my aims. Among them are community-minded business people who are leading the way in the businesses of the future, employing local people, respecting the environment and giving people from around the world the chance to experience our unique environment. People like Dave Whyte in East Gippsland. Dave runs Wilderness Coast Adventures, which takes people on cycling tours through some of the spectacular natural landscapes of East Gippsland. But his business relies on the lure of cycling routes surrounded by pristine wilderness. Dave says they experience the occasional logging coupe now but would not want to see more. People want to experience the natural beauty of the area and breathe in the fresh air. No-one wants to go for a ride through a freshly logged logging coupe or through the matchsticks of a regrowth forest. 


Then you have farmer and tourist operator Ken Deacon, who has lived in Victoria's Rubicon Valley for over 40 years. Ken runs horse and bike riding tours through the forests in the Royston and Rubicon valleys, but he is struggling to cope with the level of logging. There are fewer and fewer areas of unlogged forest for his rides to travel through, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for his business to survive. 


Dave and Ken's stories reflect the potential for these communities. This potential is lost when we destroy our native forest, which is what this deal seeks to do. The same scenario is playing out around the country. Over the past 40 years native forest logging has failed to protect our environment and failed to protect jobs. We have reached the point where industrial logging in public forests has had its day. The industry is looking for a future, and that future is in plantations. The most backward thing we could do would be to hold up this transition; yet this deal, to include the burning of our native forests for electricity under the renewable energy target, does exactly the opposite. It is holding up an inevitable transition. The delay is at the expense of taxpayers, at the expense of everything that science tells us about the values of our native forests, and at the expense of communities like those of East Gippsland, south-eastern and northern New South Wales, south-west Western Australia and throughout Tasmania. And it does so while doing the opposite of the intention of the renewable energy target. 


Let's be clear: burning wood from native forests for energy is not clean energy. It does not reduce pollution. In fact it releases carbon into the atmosphere, speeding up climate change. This move would prop up and entrench an industry that is destroying our native forests. It is a desperate act from a government that is ignoring climate science in favour of their big business, flat-earther mates. 


Climate change is real. It is happening, and if we do not take serious action to dramatically, drastically and urgently reduce our carbon pollution, the devastation it will cause is unthinkable. Winding back our commitment to clean energy by reducing our renewable energy target completely denies this reality. Arguing that we need a reduction because the target now represents more than 20 per cent of our energy use is a wilful denial of the whole purpose of the target. Achieving a greater proportion of our energy through clean energy sooner rather than later is cause to celebrate. It gives us the ability to take the next step of increasing the target to closer to the aim of 100 per cent renewable energy that we know we must achieve as soon as possible to give humanity and the planet the best chance of a healthy future. 


Of course, by including burning wood from native forests for energy, it is worse than merely reducing the target to 33,000 gigawatt hours. Making the burning of wood from native forests for energy eligible for renewable energy certificates attacks the production of renewable energy on multiple fronts. Firstly, it reduces the number of certificates available for truly clean energy sources like wind and solar. Critically, it destroys the integrity—the clean, green brand—of renewable energy. Who wants to buy renewable energy when it has come from the logging of our precious native forests and has destroyed the homes of animals and birds like koalas, spotted quolls, swift parrots and powerful owls? But it gets worse. Climate scientists and campaigners alike know that when it comes to forests, the critical action to take when it comes to tackling climate change is to protect them—not to log them, but to let them grow old to keep soaking up and storing carbon, cleaning up our polluted atmosphere.


Minister Greg Hunt has a report on his desk that he so far has refused to release that shows that, if the forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria in the Great Forest National Park were protected rather than clear-felled, it would be the equivalent of stopping the pollution of 3.2 million tonnes of carbon every year and it would be worth at least $40 million per year to the Victorian government. You compare that with the massive subsidies, the loss of at least $5 million a year, for continuing to log the forests of East Gippsland. In stark contrast, allowing wood from native forests to be burnt for energy is going to drive the ongoing logging of our precious forests and the destruction of these important carbon stores.


We know that the Abbott government is not happy with this deal on the renewable energy target. The Prime Minister said just last week that he thought it an imperfect deal, and referring to the genuinely clean energy source of wind, he said, 'I frankly would have liked to have reduced the number a lot more.' So what is the government trying to get out of this deal? In addition to reducing the amount of clean energy Australians can benefit from, the government has tried for one big notch on their environment-destroying belt. Like a rundown car, the government wants to jump-start the native forest logging industry so that it can just go a few more kilometres. It might be dirtier and it might cost more to run, and everyone else has moved on to the next model, but the government is determined to stick to its 1950's ideology and prop up the industries of the past.


We have heard time and time again that this is just wood waste, but it takes only a quick look to realise that this is not waste at all. If it were only about sawmill waste then the regulations would only be about sawmill waste. If it were only about lower value wood products that cannot be sold elsewhere, there would not be an entire category in the regulations where 100 per cent of the logging coupe can be fed into the burners. If it were only about cleaning up tree heads and branches, then that would be what the regulations specified as well. If you go up to a logging coupe, you will see truck after truck with whole logs, but you have never and will never see a truck carrying timber offcuts, bark and branches that would otherwise be discarded—never. Why? Because it is simply not worth it to load it onto the truck and to pay the costs involved in transporting bark and branches. Any promises that biomass will be limited to otherwise discarded wood are simply nonsense, and this is the crux of the issue. What the government wants to burn is not wood waste at all. You can bet your bottom dollar that it will result in the destruction of whole logs and logs that could be sawn and that it will increase the logging of our native forests. It will send communities like East Gippsland backwards. So why does the government feel the need to prop up the industry? 


Native forest logging in Australia over the last 40 years has been dominated by the production of large volumes of low-value woodchips. We must be absolutely clear what this means, what industrial-scale clear-felling looks like. We have a situation where one logging coupe is an area of forest the size of Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens, or larger, and it is totally destroyed. A few isolated habitat trees are left, but otherwise it is a moonscape. Only 10 to 20 per cent of the trees felled are cut into timber, cut into logs that are considered suitable as sawlogs. The other 80 to 90 per cent are classified as residual logs and are sent off to the chipper. The area is then burnt and reseeded, mostly with eucalypts, losing the vital diversity that forest animals rely on, and most of the animals that lived in this forest die. Without the woodchipping industry, there would have been much less of our native forests destroyed, and more of the logs removed would have been used efficiently for sawn timber.


The industry is moving past the need for woodchipping. Sawmills are working out that it is actually possible to use smaller logs, younger logs, less perfect logs to create sawn timber. But, ridiculously, that is not the direction the industry has been pushed in. These logs do not even have a chance to be sawn. They have gone straight off to the chipper because of large contracts to export these woodchips overseas. But things have changed. Eucalypt plantations in Australia and overseas now produce better quality woodchips for paper pulp and do not rely on the clear-felling of precious native forests. They are certified under the internationally recognised certification system of the Forest Stewardship Council. 


The market for the low-quality forest-destroying woodchips from Australia has crashed. The inclusion of wood from native forests in the renewable energy target is aiming to find a new market for these 80 to 90 per cent of logs that are removed from native forests, the so-called residual logs now so-called waste. So the industry is looking for a new market to justify the ongoing subsidised logging, and this new market is energy. It is aiming to turn hundreds of thousands of trees every year into pellets to be exported and burnt overseas. It is aiming at supporting the establishment of energy generation here and subsidising the establishment of such energy generation. I repeat: this is not about waste. Let that be absolutely clear. If it were about the tree branches, the bark, the tops of trees, then the legislation would exclude whole logs. It does not.


It is no surprise then that some of our biggest polluters are lining up to cash in on this deal. Indeed, one of our filthiest power stations, Hazelwood, in the Latrobe Valley, already has accreditation to use wood waste under the renewable energy target. The Prime Minister describes wind turbines as 'visually awful'. I would invite him to visit the Hazelwood coalmine, which burned for 45 days and spread ash over the entire region. Why would Hazelwood go to the trouble of getting accreditation if they were not planning to burn wood from native forests? They are waiting to pounce. They know the Abbott government has got their backs. They are ready for rules to change so that all the native forests in Gippsland and East Gippsland become classified as wood waste. 


Across the country, in Western Australia, the proposed Manjimup power station could destroy the karri forest. So not only will genuine clean energy sources like solar lose out from the smaller target, but their biggest rivals—the big, old, hulking coal fired power plants pumping out dirty power—will start getting renewable energy certificates. The age of coal is over. Just as this backwards government is trying to prolong the transition from old growth to plantation logging, this legislation will be holding up the switch from these old dirty, coal plants to the clean energy of the future.


There is a different future for the timber industry, as there is for the renewables industry, and in fact it is much further advanced. We do not need industrial-scale clear-fell logging creating 'waste' in order to produce sawn timber. In fact, we already do not rely on it: 85 per cent of the wood products that we produce in Australia come from plantations, and this percentage is increasing. Plantations are much more efficient in their production of timber and they do not rely on the destruction of our precious native forests. The plantation sector looks on the native forest sector with bemusement. They scratch their heads and wonder why the government keeps on propping it up, subsidising it, when they are getting on with the business of creating high-quality wood products without any fuss, without huge community debate, without the environmental destruction. They do produce genuine renewable energy from their waste, because they are burning genuine waste—sawdust and sawmill offcuts—that they have grown themselves over the past 20 to 30 years. These plantation products are already eligible for renewable energy certificates, and we have absolutely no argument with them.


I want to specifically address the issue of production of sawn timber from eucalypt plantations, because that is what the purported justification for the ongoing logging of our forests comes down to in the end. Whenever the industry talks about logging, they do not show the devastation of clear-fell logging or the massive mountains of woodchips waiting to be exported from Eden or Burnie. They do not even show the pallets and tomato stakes—the low value products that the bulk of sawn timber from our native forests gets turned into. They show lovely polished floorboards, staircases, window frames and dining room tables. I would like to share with people that the largest eucalypt sawmill in the world, producing the largest volumes of desirable sawn timber, destined for high-value products like floorboards, staircases, window frames and dining room tables, is in Uruguay; it is producing wood from plantations of Australian 'flooded gum' that are only 20 years old. This mill and the whole industry have solved the problems of sawing young green wood that our industry has not been interested in solving, whilst they have access to wood from native forest. We can create sawn timber products from local eucalypt plantations; CSIRO researchers have outlined how it can be done. If and when we decide to stop the devastation of our native forests, the sawn timber industry will change and work out how it can be done here too, and we will be able to enjoy the beauty of wood products without the beast of forest devastation. But this happy outcome is not going to occur under this deal. 


This deal comes down to a choice: who do we want to prosper? Is it the big polluters who are set in their old ways of destroying our most precious natural assets at the taxpayers' expense? Or is it the hard-working small business owners like Dave Whyte and Ken Deacon? Is it the magnificent forests that provide us with so many benefits? Is it the clean energy innovators who are facilitating the shift to the economy of the future? I know who I side with. We must side with the community; we must not let the Renewable Energy Target to be tainted with the burning of our community's precious native forests.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (20:41):  This bill, known by many as the 'dead koala power bill', should not pass. What the government calls the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill is shameful. This is a saga that highlights how far the Abbot government will go to deliver for its corporate constituency. In this case, the Liberal-National corporate constituency is the fossil fuel industry and those companies that want to continue logging native forests. 


This bill trashes two things Australians love dearly: renewable energy and native forests, home to so much of our unique wildlife. The locals of south-east New South Wales tell me that they are not feeling much love at the moment. They are not feeling much love because of their deep concern about what this bill, if passed, will do to the forests and their pleasure at seeing more solar panels go up on homes and businesses in their area. The apt title of 'dead koala power bill' comes from south-east New South Wales and it resonates very deeply with them, as this bill would breathe new life into the now near-defunct Eden woodchip mill. This mill was just about to close; South East Fibre Exports had announced that its mill would no longer purchase timber from East Gippsland state forests. The general manager nominated international market pressures as the reasons. What he is referring to—and it is what Senator Rice has just gone into great detail about—is the poor woodchip prices and the contracting markets for native forest woodchips. 


There is a huge change going on in the industry. As Senator Rice also set out, the shift is to plantations. That is where the transition should be taking the industry. What is happening here tonight is a push to open up the burning of our native forests. South East Fibre and its Japanese owners, Nippon, would be cheering because their hope of revival looks like being delivered, and that is an enormous setback. Burning native forests in the name of RET opens the door to new and more destructive ways to make a profit from Australia's native forests. It is an issue of great concern. The Eden woodchip mill is owned by Japan's biggest paper manufacturer, and they could well be the first cab off the rank with a 5.5megawatt wood fired power station. The destruction that will then roll on in south-east New South Wales and north-east Victoria will be immense—the loss of precious habitat for the powerful owl, for koalas, for quolls should not be tolerated 


But it needs to be recognised that that destruction goes hand in hand with this legislation that is before us.


We can clearly see abuse of the RET system with this wood fired power station at Eden because it can only be viable with renewable energy subsidies. Again, as other speakers from the Greens have set out, the whole concept is founded on this misleading idea of so-called waste from the forest, misunderstanding the complexity of forest ecosystems and how much of that waste is actually part of the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle and how the forest seeds itself and feeds animals. A living tree growing in a forest in New South Wales, sadly, can now be classified as waste.


I warmly congratulate the many activists, campaigners and local residents who have taken up this issue because they know what it will mean not just for their local area but for all of us. To lose these forests, for them to be damaged, as they surely will be, should not be tolerated. I extend special congratulations to the South East Region Conservation Alliance, which brings together CHIPSTOP, the Bega Environment Network, ChipBusters, the Coastwatchers Association, the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, Friends of Durras, the Gulaga (Mt Dromedary) Protection Group, the far south coast branch of the National Parks Association of New South Wales and South East Forest Rescue. These organisations have put decades into this and have been able to protect much of the forest. Again, they can see what a setback this would be.


I will share with you some of the comments from these people that are most relevant to our debate tonight. Harriett Swift, a spokesperson for CHIPSTOP said:


We know that burning trees for power production is far from renewable and that in many cases emissions from burning trees are more intensive than burning coal … Biomass power will also produce a toxic cocktail of emissions that are harmful to the health of nearby communities.


Ms Swift said that:


… big old trees that would provide habitat for many native species are already scarce. Species of trees that are currently not logged will now be permitted for burning, including trees supporting koalas, black cockatoos and a multitude of threatened and endangered wildlife species.


I have been fortunate to have toured many of these forests with Ms Swift and many of the other people working in this area. I have been fortunate to see these species. These are beautiful forests. They need to regenerate in many areas. Many of them are stunning as they are. But none of them should be touched. None of them should be under threat from this bill.


Ms Heather Kenway, a spokesperson for SERCA, has said:


This government has no interest in preserving the precious little left of our intact native forests for wildlife, water, tourism and future generations … Will they wake up, like the Easter Islanders, only when the last tree falls? We need to leave NSW native forests in the ground to regrow and recover, switch to plantations for our timber needs, and formulate an energy plan for NSW that does not include 'Dead Koala Power'.


Noel Plumb from ChipBusters and Frances Pike from Nativesrule have said: 'Certification as clean energy under the RET will give the industry a public taxpayer subsidy while reducing funding support for genuine clean energy like wind and solar, a triple whammy as taxpayers subsidise forest destruction and the extinction of koalas and undermine renewable energy supplies.' They are important comments that I urge senators to consider and reflect on carefully.


I have just a few comments to make about the renewable energy target. As should be clear, wood waste from native forests should have no part in the RET. It was, in fact, removed as an eligible energy source in 2011. For four years the door was closed on burning forests in the name of renewable energy, and the RET went from strength to strength. As we know, it has been very successful in reducing emissions. I draw people's attention to the speeches of Senator Christine Milne and Senator Larissa Waters, as they have set this out in detail.


The federal government, however, have tried to blame rising electricity prices on the RET. This is where we start to get an insight into the corporate constituency of the government and what is going on here. Electricity prices doubled in the last six years, but the RET played very little part in that. The resulting array of interests stacked against the RET are considerable. We see this with electricity utilities, coal companies and forestry interests. What is going on here? Electricity prices have gone up. We have these companies complaining and obviously intensely lobbying the government. The Liberals and Nationals are getting an earful from these companies that are concerned about how this is all playing out.


So what do we see from the Prime Minister? He has become a crusader for coal, talking up the interests of corporate coal. What do we see from coal companies? We see a considerable and increasing level of generosity in the form of political donations. It was in October 2014 that the Prime Minister announced:


Coal is good for humanity …


These were his words at a time when the world is turning its back on coal. Yes, for many decades coal was critical to powering our country, but we now know the dangers involved. We now know that there is another way. But here there is a Prime Minister who goes to such lengths, using such loaded language, to try to paint coal as a great saviour. The Prime Minister went on to say that coal will be the world's main energy source for years to come. This does give us an insight into why he is waging war on the RET, because effectively that is what is happening with the legislation before us. He is out there really representing the interests of coal companies.


This is where it becomes relevant to look at the political donations from the resource industry to the government. I will go through what some of those contributions are. I am not suggesting some deals have been done; we do not know what discussions go on behind closed doors. But there certainly is a public perception that this money is not handed over for no reason. These are just some of the resource companies that have put in hefty donations to the coalition parties. Adani, the company trying to build Queensland's largest coalmine, donated $49,500 to the Liberal Party of Australia. Gina Rinehart donated $25,000 to one campaign alone. That was the foreign minister Julie Bishop's campaign. That money came through Hancock Coal Infrastructure Pty Ltd. The figures all come from the Australian Electoral Commission. Some of them are collated on the Greens 'Democracy for Sale' website. 


There is also a very useful reference from Australian Mining on the 7 April this year. They detail a whole range of resource companies that have been very generous to the Liberal and National parties. They have identified that the bulk of small donations from mining companies went solely to the Liberal and National parties. These companies each donated $20,000 to the Liberal Party: Silver Lake Resources, Northern Star, Whitehaven Coal and BC Iron. The NSW Minerals Council gave $32,250 to the coalition. Santos, infamous with regard to coal seam gas mining, donated a hefty $185,300 to the coalition. There was $500,000 donated—and this was just to the Liberal Party—that came from Nimrod Resources. That is a privately owned exploration company working around Bourke in New South Wales. These are just some of the donations that have gone to the Liberals and Nationals from various resource industries. This again is very relevant to this debate, because the RET has been a very important part of our work in addressing climate change in Australia. We are seeing another aspect of the work that was undertaken a few years back to deal with climate change being unwound—and this is just one more aspect of it that we are seeing tonight. We need to really look at the forces at play here. We do know that the renewable energy target was delivering jobs and investment around Australia. Most importantly, it was bringing down carbon pollution—the carbon pollution that is causing global warming. But this is all under threat now. It is under threat because those corporate interests are so close to this government—and this is a government that very much delivers for its corporate constituency.


We know this bill will allow the burning of native forest wood. We know that the Eden woodchip mill is set to get a new lease of life, as will many new power stations that will come into operation using this so-called new form of energy. Let us remember at this point that this is just a pre-industrial form of energy. We were burning forests hundreds and hundreds of years ago. That was what was happening across parts of Europe. We learnt that that was not necessary. So this is really turning the clock back in terms of how destructive this bill is. We also know that the coal industry, as it loses markets in many countries, is finding a safe haven in Australia under Prime Minister Abbott. That safe haven is about to be extended with these polluting power stations and these woodchip mills. Meanwhile, what will happen to the precious habitat for koalas, quolls, the peaceful owls, the beautiful bower birds, all those array of honeyeaters? I am a keen birdwatcher, so I have had the pleasure of going through many of these forests and seeing many of these unique birds and, periodically, but not so often, seeing the beautiful marsupials. Now so much of this is under threat, because, when you start burning forests, you are losing habitat, and habitat is what is critical for these native species. It will be an extraordinarily backward step if this bill goes through. It is the bill that should be trashed—not our environment.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-06-15,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (20:57):  I too rise to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. First up, I want to place on the record that we need to consider this bill in the context of a government that has a completely irrational antipathy towards renewable energy. How do we know that? Let me count the ways! I will come back to this in more detail later, but I think this is really important for anyone looking at these debates in the future. I am sure they will pore over them and think: what were they thinking at the time with all the evidence that we know now about the direction in which we need to go in Australia? They will say: 'How could this have been?' We have Joe Hockey and his comments about hating wind farms. We have the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and his comments previously about hating wind farms. We have an ostensible review of the renewable energy target. In the face of a promise before the election that the government would not be changing the target, we have a review. The person appointed to run that review is someone who has a history of denying the reality of human-induced climate change and who has worked in the fossil fuel industry.


That said, I know that there are coalition MPs and senators who do not have an antipathy to renewable energy, who do understand the challenge that we are facing in relation to climate change. I would like to think that they are looking on in horror at the stance that is being taken resolutely by their leadership at this time in history. Particularly, if they have kids and grandkids, they know that the decisions that we are making today will inevitably have far-reaching consequences that we will all be held responsible for.


Here we have a bill that will reduce the target for the amount of renewable energy that we will have available to us in 2020 by 8,000 gigawatt hours at a time when countries around the world are doing the opposite. The worldwide investment in renewable power generation in 2014 was almost double that of fossil fuels. In early 2014, 144 other countries had renewable energy targets. I deplore the reduction of the renewable energy target from a target of 41,000 gigawatt hours by 2020 to 33,000 gigawatt hours. I also deplore the fact this legislation extends heavy emitting, trade exposed industry. That will have the effect of shifting more costs onto households and businesses.


It is hard to reconcile when we think about the rhetoric of this government. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. I deplore the changes to regulations associated with this legislation that will allow native forests to be burnt again. Burning wood for energy to keep us warm, and later to heat water to create steam to turn turbines, was something that we did in the past. That was the Industrial Revolution, which saw forests destroyed to feed the fires and to drive the looms and machines. Who would have thought in 2015 that we would be returning to a situation where we would be classifying the burning of trees as renewable energy when we in fact have the technology and we have infinite supplies of sunshine and wind that can feel the energy needs of the future?


Not only that, but we risk burning whole logs in forestry furnaces in an irresponsible and desperate attempt to prop up an industry that is incapable of being economically sustainable without huge government subsidies. The amount of money that goes into propping up the forest industry is there on the public record. This is just one more example of that. The other thing that people need to understand is that this will also have the effect of undermining further the investment in the real clean energy, like solar and wind, because allowing the burning of biomass will actually take up a proportion of the target—about 15 per cent, to use the forestry industry's own figures.


But why is that? Why would a government create in uncertainty in the way that they have done? What evidence is there that they have been deliberately destabilising and undermining the renewable energy sector? Can it just be a matter of anaesthetics? We know that Joe Hockey hates wind farms. He told us in May last year when he was speaking to Macquarie Radio. He was asked about whether the government would target clean energy programs in its quest for massive spending cuts. He was very candid and said:


Well, they say get rid of the Clean Energy Regulator, and we are.


He then mounted an attack on wind farms, specifically the wind turbines operating outside of our national capital here in Canberra. He said:


Well, if I can be a little indulgent, I drive to Canberra to go to Parliament and so on, I drive myself, and I must say I find those wind turbines around Lake George to be utterly offensive and I think they are just a blight on the landscape.


He was not asked his opinion about the look of coal fired power stations or nuclear power stations.


But he is not on his own. It must be something about being on radio that encourages an intimate, sharing tone among members of the cabinet. We had the Prime Minister last week speaking to Alan Jones and confessing that he finds wind farms:


… visually awful … they make a lot of noise.


Our Prime Minister was very frank last week. He said:


What we did recently in the Senate was reduce, Alan, reduce, capital R-E-D-U-C-E, we reduced the number of these things that we're going to get in the future. … I would frankly have liked to reduce the number a lot more but we got the best deal we could out of the Senate. … And if we hadn't had a deal, Alan, we would have been stuck with even more of these things.


Those are the Prime Minister's own words.


Then we have the review of the RET last year, where the hand-picked reviewer, Dick Warburton, had worked as a former Caltex chairman in the fossil fuel industry. He denies the evidence of human induced climate change and he is a pro-nuclear advocate. The cost of that review was over half a million dollars. The review's own RET modelling showed that keeping the renewable energy target at its level or expanding it further will actually push power prices down. Again, I ask this: when we think about the rhetoric of this government that professes to be so concerned about the cost of living for people in Australia, if they were really serious about relieving electricity bills, why would they not be lifting the target instead of reducing it?


We have a RET that is reducing pollution, creating jobs and bringing power bills down. Why would any responsible, thoughtful, orderly or methodical government set about to destabilise it? I think the answer comes back to something the quite a lot of people have explored during this debate; that is, the influence of mates. We have mate Maurice Newman, chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council, who talks about the RET, renewable energy and climate change not being about facts or logic but being concerned about a new world order under the control of the United Nations. We know that the government has many mates in the fossil fuel sector who stand to lose a lot if the push to renewable energy continues unabated.


Indeed, Minister Ian Macfarlane let the cat out of the bag last September when on ABC Radio he told us: 'There are about 9,000 megawatts, around five to nine coal power generators' excess capacity, which would be driven out by clean energy under the existing act.' Of course, this will happen. We are moving inexorably away from fossil fuels to a clean, decarbonised energy future. Trying to prevent it is as ludicrous as trying to turn back the tide. But what we see here is fossil fuel investors, fossil fuel companies and people who stand to make a lot of money out of the industry determined to prolong the carnival as long as possible and make as much money in the meantime. We have a government that is doing everything it can to support that endeavour.


Meanwhile, if we think about the effects on the people that this government purports to govern for—the people of Australia—we will have more landscape destroyed by coal and gas mining; we will have stranded assets; worse climate change; and we are reducing our readiness to transition to clean energy. As we approach the time, and it will happen—I fear, ultimately, without much notice in the end—when other nations de-carbonise and stop taking our coal, our gas and our fossil fuels. That is when we will have a workforce in Australia that will not be transitioned to the clean energy future and will be out of jobs on a mass level. Given the claims of this government to manage the economy, it is grossly irresponsible to jeopardise both existing jobs and the jobs of the future by ignoring every indicator that a transition is needed now. The evidence is there.


We have the clear evidence of the effect of the deliberately induced uncertainty on the part of this government. The uncertainty has shattered investment confidence. Investment in Australia in all renewables fell 35 per cent in 2014. It was the lowest level since 2009—this at a time when the rest of the world is moving ahead. In China there was an increase of 33 percent; in Brazil, an increase of 50 per cent; and Australia fell 35 per cent—it went 35 per cent backwards last year. In the solar industry employment fell 28 per cent—down by 5,000 jobs to 13,000 jobs, and prior to this government being elected there were 23,000 jobs in the solar industry. This is a government that purports to be good economic managers. Thirteen large-scale photovoltaic projects went on hold. Large-scale renewable investments fell 88 per cent to $240 million, back to 2002 levels. Only four wind farms were being built. Australia fell from number 11 worldwide in relation to large-scale renewable investments to number 39—behind Burma, Panama, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica and Honduras.


Now we have this proposal that we are debating—to reduce the RET. Supported by Labor—yes—to reduce the RET to create certainty, and the only certainty that we really have is that the RET will be reduced. There is certainty that any reduction in the 2020 target will reduce the amount of new renewable energy investment over the next decade. That is certain. As well as that, it is certain that this will significantly damage investments that have already been made in good faith, based on the existing legislation—the existing target. There is certainty that reducing the target will have a significant impact on the commercial viability of all current and future projects, because the value of revenue for large-scale projects is based on the value of renewable energy certificates created by the LRET scheme, and that is determined by the demand and supply dynamics of the market. If the 41,000 gigawatt-hour target is reduced, the market dynamics will fundamentally change and the value of RETs will decline. This will correspond to a material reduction in the revenue that a project would receive, and it will result in significant financial impact. This, again, is at the hands of a government that purports to be responsible economic managers.


I want to speak briefly now about the particular perspective of someone coming from South Australia, which I am proud to say is that renewable energy capital of Australia. We have the highest level of energy generated from renewable sources in the nation. If the RET is reduced—




Senator Singh:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. Whilst I acknowledge that South Australia is going ahead in leaps and bounds in renewable energy, Tasmania still remains the renewable capital of Australia.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Dastyari
):  There is no point of order. I will remind the Senator that frivolous points of order are not going to be tolerated in this Senate while I chair.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I must admit, it is a healthy debate to be having. I think that it is really important that we are vying to be the renewable capital of Australia. I have to say that the evidence is there that, indeed, South Australia is the renewable energy capital of Australia, and I will go onto establish why. South Australia has the highest percentage of homes with solar panels, at 23 per cent; the most energy sourced from renewables; and the most investment at risk—$2.9 billion of investments in clean energy, and there is a risk that that will go overseas if there is not enough certainty and if the RET is reduced. There are South Australian projects at risk. There is the Ceres wind farm on the Yorke Peninsula—a $1.5 billion investment, and more than 500 jobs. There is the Infigen Energy Woakwine wind farm in the south-east—150 jobs created. There is the Pacific Hydro Keyneton wind farm in the Riverland—more than 500 jobs created. We have Port Augusta, where recently there has been an announcement that the Alinta power stations—the two coal-fired power stations near Port Augusta—will be closed by 2018, which will, indeed, introduce the possibility that South Australia will become the first totally renewable energy state in Australia.


South Australia has 517 accredited solar installers; 16 wind projects of 561 turbines and 1,205 megawatts of capacity. Today, Tindo Solar, which makes the only Australian produced solar panels, and other solar industry representatives, are saying that there will be damaging job losses in South Australia—which is already experiencing significant job losses in many other areas of manufacturing—if the renewable energy target is changed and reduced. The predictions are that large-scale solar will beat wholesale coal power pricing anywhere in Australia by 2020 in less than five years.


When we come back to the closure of the coal fired power stations near Port Augusta, we also know that there is an extremely strong community push—from the residents, from the council and from many others—for a concentrating solar thermal plant. There has been a lot of work done on the feasibility of that plant, with a potential for baseload power to be created there using molten salt. It is a very exciting initiative. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community and, as I said, from the council, because there has been a long history of damaging health effects from coal fired power stations in Port Augusta. Moving to a solar thermal power station would be an amazing opportunity for South Australia to showcase baseload power. There would be jobs available for the existing power workers to be able to work there and there would also potentially be jobs in manufacturing, in creating the components—the mirrors and the panels—which would be used in any associated wind farms as well. 


There are a lot of good things happening in South Australia. It is absolutely imperative that those things are happening in South Australia, because it is a state where there are significant challenges in terms of other manufacturing. It is a state which the current government are ignoring at this stage. If they are insistent on going ahead and allowing the passage of this legislation to further undermine the renewable energy target, that will only make the situation far worse for South Australia. So I urge my colleagues to think seriously about this legislation, to think about the future and to think about what we are doing. I urge them not to be beholden by short-term interests in maintaining and propping up an energy source that we know has health effects, is contributing to climate change and is more expensive than the alternatives; I urge them to vote against this legislation.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (21:16):  It gives me pleasure to rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. I particularly make some comments in relation to the government's addition to the scheme for the utilisation of biomass as part of the renewable energy sector.




Senator Singh:
  Already!




Senator COLBECK:
  I did say that I would give you something to interject about, Senator Singh. 


I have to say at the outset that it really mystifies me why the Labor Party appears to be so opposed to this. The Labor Party themselves, when in government, and the rural affairs committee in the House of Representatives, chaired by former member for Lyons Dick Adams produced a very good report called Seeing the forest through the trees. One of the recommendations in that report was that native forest should continue to be able to be utilised in the generation of renewable energy, as it was then under the regulations that stood at that point in time. Because of a deal done with the Greens, and because of the Labor Party not having the strength or the courage to stand up to the Greens in the circumstances that they were in in government at the time, the Labor Party brought in regulations to prohibit the use of native forest residue to be utilised and to qualify for renewable energy credits. 


There are claims being trotted around here by organisations such as The Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Environment Tasmania that this will bring devastation to the environment and to native species around the country. Yet that is not what happened when these regulations were in place previously. It is not what happened at all. So the suggestions of devastation from the Greens demonstrate that nothing has really changed about the Greens. 


The Greens will say absolutely anything to justify a particular cause at a particular point in time. We have had plenty of evidence of that. Obviously, they are doing it now; they are trying to demonise this particular initiative that the government has put forward. I recall that in the 1980s the Greens were actually campaigning against renewable energy in Tasmania. Bob Brown, who later became a senator and spent some time in this place, was campaigning against hydro-electric development in Tasmania. What was he suggesting as an alternative? Bob Brown, at that point of time, was actually suggesting the construction of coal fired power stations in Tasmania as an alternative energy source to renewable hydro-electricity. 


Senator Wright and Senator Singh were having a bit of a debate about how much renewable energy is produced in what states. I think that the correct number is that Tasmania produces something like 40 per cent of Australia's renewables through our hydro-electric schemes. As I said, the Greens campaigned against those schemes and proposed the construction of coal fired power stations in Tasmania. I wonder what might happen to someone who proposes that now. But that is what the Greens did, demonstrating that they will say anything in their cause at a particular point in time. It does not have anything to do with fact or science; that is just the way that the Greens work, and so it is with this particular issue. The science is really quite clear in relation to using forest residues as a source of renewable energy, and you do not just have to take my word for it. In Europe, the WWF, along with the European Biomass Association, have a target of 15 per cent of energy from renewables coming from biomass by later this decade. So the WWF is on the program in relation to this. 


I have a document here that was published in Future Science. It is not just one piece of science but a compilation of global science, and it looks at life cycle impacts of forest management and wood utilisation on carbon mitigation. It says: 


Using forest residual biomass as feedstock for utilities produces only 4% of the emissions from coal.


If the Greens are looking for a source of a reduction in emissions when compared to utilising coal, a compilation of science published in Future Science says that you can reduce your emissions by 96 per cent by using residual forest biomass as a feedstock for utilities. 


Now, do the Greens support reducing emissions or don't they? I think that is a very good question, because the IPCC also promotes using biomass as part of the process, using sustainable forest management as the basis of that process. And that is what we are talking about here in Australia. We are not talking about mass entry into the forests, to utilise them for generating energy; we are talking about using materials that come from forest operations that would otherwise occur and using the residues from that process to generate energy. It simply makes sense. In fact, the IPCC states:


In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.


That statement comes from the IPCC. Yet the Greens like to quote the IPCC ad nauseam when criticising the coalition or anyone else who does not agree with their view of the world. But of course it becomes inconvenient for them when they are dealing with this particular matter. The process is also supported by the FAO; it is supported by CSIRO. So there are multiple sources to support the basis of utilising native forest residues, utilising biomass, to generate energy based on sustainable forest management principles. And that is exactly what we are talking about. The regulatory regime that we are proposing under this legislation mirrors the regime that previously existed and that did not lead to wholesale harvesting of the forest for generating energy, using biomass. It did not. Why? Because the principles of sustainable forest management were at the forefront of that regime. We have in our systems a high-value test that says that the primary purpose for harvesting cannot be for generating energy.


The Greens utilise the Dirtier than coal report, out of the UK, which is a critique of the UK bio-energy strategy that allows burning whole trees for energy production. It completely dismisses or, more to the point, does not take into account the strategies that we have here in Australia, which are based on sustainable forest management. We do have good forestry management in this country. The reality is what the Greens are trying to do: their objective is to kill the entire native forest industry in this country. Their objective is to close down the entire native forest industry in Australia, firstly, on public land and then on private land. That is their objective. They want to take away any opportunity that industry has to utilise the residues because they know that if they destroy the utilisation of the residue stream they bring down the entire industry.


So this has got nothing to do with renewable energy; it has to do with an economic attack on the forest industry. They use conservation as an excuse, but they conveniently forget that we come from the premise of utilising residues from sustainable forest management. And I really do not understand why the Labor Party are not on board with this. The report of the committee, chaired by their own Dick Adams—a bipartisan committee and a bipartisan report, supported by both Labor and the coalition—recommended this. Two days later, at the behest of the Greens, the regulations changed. The suggestion that this is a last-minute entry into the negotiations would be one of the biggest furphies perpetrated by the Labor Party in recent times. The Labor Party knows that this has been a part of coalition policy right through the last election. The Labor Party knows that we worked with the then crossbenchers in the House of Representatives to have the regulation that they brought in overturned, at the behest of the Greens. The vote in the House of Representatives was tied; it was lost on the casting vote of the Speaker. So the suggestion by the Labor Party that this is a last-minute entry into the process is quite simply dishonest. But why would you expect anything else from the Labor Party?


This provision quite sensibly provides, based on sustainable forest management, the opportunity for an alternative revenue stream, an alternative use of native forest residues for the Australian forestry sector. It provides a way forward, particularly perhaps in the southern forests of Tasmania where the industry has no outlet for the utilisation of its residues. There are mountains of it piling up in the south—




Senator Lambie:
  A fire hazard!




Senator COLBECK:
  Senator Lambie, I will take your interjection because that is exactly right: it is a fire hazard. In fact, during the tragic bushfires at Dunalley a couple of years ago the residue stacks around that sawmill at Dunalley were one factor in the destruction of that sawmill. Yet the Labor Party sits by and allows this process to continue while hardworking and honest timber workers in the southern forests of Tasmania have their livelihoods threatened by the fact that the Labor Party here in Canberra will not support their livelihoods, despite the fact—




Senator Singh:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. The parliamentary secretary is highlighting livelihoods being threatened, when it is in fact this government that has thrown thousands of livelihoods of Australians—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Singh, with respect—




Senator Singh:
  working in the renewable energy sector for the last 20 months—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Singh, that is a debating point, as you know. Senator Colbeck, please resume.




Senator COLBECK:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Back, Senator Singh is developing a bit of a habit of raising debating points as points of order and was warned by the previous occupant of the chair for this practice.




Senator Singh:
  You encouraged me!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resist the encouragement, Senator Singh!




Senator COLBECK:
  The Labor Party does endanger the livelihoods of forest workers in Tasmania, despite the fact that the Tasmanian division of the Labor Party and Labor opposition leader Bryan Green have come out in support of this measure. He wants Tasmanian Labor senators in this place to support the forest industry in Tasmania. I wonder why they will not do it. There is no rationale for them not doing it.


Senator Singh could perhaps have a chat to Dick Adams, Sid Sidebottom or Geoff Lyons, who all lost their seats at the last election. I can tell you that one of the reasons Dick Adams lost his seat, after a swing of over 13 per cent, was that the forest industry workers in Tasmania found that, when they really needed him, because of the stance of the Labor Party he could not be relied on. He could not be relied on, despite the fact that he had brought out a report supporting the use of native forest residues in the renewable energy target. Two days later, the Labor Party dudded him. The result was a swing of over 13 per cent against the Labor Party. Yet the Labor Party in this place still will not support forest workers in Tasmania, or anywhere else around the country, although there is very clear evidence that, based on sustainable forest management, utilisation of the residues of native forests for the generation of energy can reduce carbon emissions by up to 96 per cent.


You really wonder if the Labor Party are at all genuine in this debate. They cry; they caterwaul; but, when it comes to the real substance of the issue, when it comes to supporting workers in the forest industry, when they are really needed they are not there—and forest industry workers actually know that. I stood around the tailgate of a four-wheel drive in the forest in Northern Tasmania with some workers and they said, 'We've all voted for Dick Adams in the past, but not anymore, because when we really needed him he wasn't there.' You would have thought, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, that the Labor Party would have learnt their lesson.


So, the suggestion that this is a last-minute thing is a complete misrepresentation. It is a falsehood. It is a furphy. It is dishonest. Supporting the forest industry was written into our election policy at the 2013 election, and I am very pleased that we have now put that provision back into legislation so that we do have a genuine opportunity to reduce carbon emissions over the utilisation of coal by using native forest residues, sensibly based on sustainable forest management as supported by the UN's FAO, as supported by the IPCC, as supported by the CSIRO and as supported by so many high-quality, world-renowned forest scientists in this country.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-15,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:32):  At the outset, I indicate and express my support for the renewable energy target. I believe that it is an instrumental part of Australia's climate change policy and that it has been a driving force behind investment in renewable energy, but there have been a number of issues in respect of it which I will address shortly. I do believe in anthropogenic climate change. I believe that it does happen, that we need to address it and that, to quote Rupert Murdoch, we need to give the planet 'the benefit of the doubt'. I think we need to have a number of effective policies in place.


The nub of the issue is: how do you reduce greenhouse gases as effectively as possible and in the most cost effective way possible? I think that having an efficient emissions trading scheme is the best way. Having a market based mechanism is the best way in the longer term. That is not the policy of this government, but I have worked very hard in the context of the Direct Action legislation on the Emissions Reduction Fund, working constructively with Minister Hunt and his very capable advisers, to drive a number of amendments that I think make the Emissions Reduction Fund much more robust and much more effective, with a safeguard mechanism that has real teeth. The framework is there. The government need to honour their commitment to make sure that a practical effect of the legislation is a safeguard mechanism.


As I said, the issue is: how do you drive the best possible reduction in emissions as efficiently as possible? Back in 2009, when Hon. Malcolm Turnbull was opposition leader, Mr Turnbull and I jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to prepare an alternative emissions trading scheme that was based on energy intensity. It was considered. It was thoughtful. The predictions made by the Managing Director of Frontier Economics at that time, Danny Price, proved to be very much true: having a scheme involving a lot of revenue churn would be economically inefficient and not as effective as it could be in environmental terms. That is why I still maintain that what was proposed by Frontier Economics in the report, study and modelling commissioned by Malcolm Turnbull and me back then would have led to greater reductions in emissions at a more affordable price and that it was a better option. Sadly, politics got in the way. Malcolm Turnbull was no longer opposition leader. He lost his leadership essentially over the issue of the ETS—it has claimed a number of casualties over the years. As a consequence, we ended up with a policy that I thought was clunky and inefficient.


I think Direct Action will work and has worked, but there is more work to be done. What we are facing here in relation to the renewable energy target is a scheme that, in my view, has needed amendment, because when the scheme was designed a number of years ago, with bipartisan support, it was anticipated that renewable energy would make up about 20 per cent of overall energy consumption. There are a number of reasons it has not, including energy efficiency measures that have been effective; but also, sadly and tragically, the demise of the manufacturing industry in this country has meant that a number of major manufacturing facilities have closed down, which has reduced the demand for electricity, particularly amongst energy-intensive industries. It is important, however, that we have some certainty for this industry. Discussions around changes to the RET, the repeal of the carbon tax and the proposed abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, amongst others, have sent a message of uncertainty. I think certainty is important, but it must be with a robust framework that will deliver results in the most effective possible way, both for consumers and for taxpayers. That is why, despite the target being lower than I would like ideally, and despite there being no carve out for technologies that can provide baseload power, I will be supporting this legislation broadly. But I will focus on the issues of wood waste and biomass, and also the issue of wind energy, because I see them as inextricably linked in relation to this.


In relation to the issue of wood waste, an article on 5 June in the RenewEconomy publication gave a summary of some of the arguments. It mentions Ross Hampton, the CEO of the Australian Forest Products Association, who said on 15 May that biomass used for electricity would be a very small amount. He downplayed his own initial estimate to the Warburton review of the 3,000 to 5,000 gigawatts of power a year, admitting that AFTA had put the figure to the review panel, but saying that it was a very theoretical number. I have dealt with Mr Hampton and worked with him constructively in the past, and I hope to continue to work with him constructively in the future. Perhaps it was better that that very theoretical number was not put to the Warburton review, although I do have my serious doubts about the effectiveness of the Warburton review, its robustness and a whole range of other matters. I thought that it was not a very good exercise in having a robust, independent review. I do not think that it was anywhere near as credible as it needed to be. Perhaps some of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber will say that I am being too kind, and maybe I am.


In relation to the issue of biomass, in the pre-2011 regulations, according to the RenewEconomy publication, which I think gives a neat summary, 'there were certainly very few biomass projects to receive Renewable Energy Certificates'. The article goes on to say the:


… post Regional Forest Agreements decade was a period of almost boom conditions for the woodchipping industry. Both prices and export volumes increased to record levels and profits were high. It would have been impossible for the energy industry, with or without Renewable Energy Certificates to compete with the prices the industry was getting for woodchips for fibre.


Some commentators would make the point that things have now changed and that this could loom larger in terms of the issue of biomass, but let us put this into some perspective. Biomass can produce methane, which is 15 times more potent and more damaging to the environment than CO2. It needs to be dealt with. There is also the issue of fire hazards, and I think that is a real issue in terms of appropriate clearing. Mr Acting Deputy President Back, given your role with the Country Fire Association in WA, I think you know about the issues and risks with bushfires, and I hope you do not mind me mentioning that, given your expertise and your history in relation to that. I do not know whether the issue of biomass will be the saviour of the forestry industry, as the industry is saying, and I do not think it will have the uptake that some in the environment movement are fearing. But I think it is important that there must be some adequate safeguards, and that is something that, from my point of view, is still subject to negotiation. I understand there will be some further amendments in respect of this issue, and I am grateful to my colleagues in the Greens—Senator Waters and Senator Rice—who I have had discussions with and will continue to have discussions with about this.


I think it is important that in the committee stage there is a robust debate and discussion about this, and that questions are appropriately answered. I think people know that my view in relation to procedural matters is to bring on a debate. Sometimes it is appropriate to say that we need to have a set time for this, but when it comes to the committee stage of a bill there ought not to be a gag. If we have to spend all week here, if we have to spend the weekend here, or if we are here for the next month debating this, if it is the will of the chamber not to cut off debate then my view is that we need to thoroughly canvass these issues. That is why I say now, as I have previously when it comes to the substantive debate of a bill, that I will not support a gag. In regard to the issues relating to biomass, I think we need to see what further amendments there will be and what undertakings will be made by the government. I think the committee stage is the appropriate stage to deal with those amendments.


I want to refer to Frontier Economics, who, back in September 2014, issued the paper 'Can Australia still meet its emissions target with changes in the RET?' The people at Frontier Economics are pretty dispassionate. They made the point that the RET 'is a relatively high cost approach to reducing emissions because it focusses on specific forms of electricity generation', and that it has contributed to a large surplus of generation capacity. They are simply stating facts about how the national electricity market works. They make the point that:


The RET does not generate an increase in wealth in the economy, but leads to a transfer of wealth among participants in the electricity market.


In that respect, it is being critical not of the RET per se, but of the way that it is operated and particularly of the way that wind energy—and this is also my view and the view of others—has distorted the national electricity market because it is not baseload. It is intermittent and unreliable, and if you have a heavy reliance on wind, as there is in my home state of South Australia, it can, and does, have an impact on the market. Frontier Economics has made some good points about this, and their overall thrust is that there are better and more efficient ways of reducing greenhouse gases than simply using the RET by itself. It needs to be a whole package of measures. I see the advantage of the RET as one of driving technological change, in the sense that it drives efficiencies for solar panels; for solar-thermal generation, which is very exciting in terms of its potential for baseload power; and for other forms of renewables such as landfill gas. Soaking up that methane from landfill not only is essential from an environmental point of view, but does provide baseload power, which is very important. If you want to shut down thermal generators, coal fired generators, you need to have the backup of baseload renewable alternatives, and that is why solar thermal is important.


In that regard, given the announcement made last week by Alinta Energy concerning Port Augusta, in my home state of South Australia, the importance of the Solar Cities project and the importance of finding the funding and the financing for the solar thermal project in Port Augusta take on an added significance. It is something that I have raised with the Minister for the Environment on a number of occasions, it is something that has an added urgency to it and it is something that I have raised with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in broad terms.


In the course of this debate, this cannot be simply seen as a silo about a renewable energy target and the issue of wood waste. It is also worth mentioning, most importantly, the issue of wind generation. I have serious concerns about the proliferation of wind turbines in Australia in terms of both their economic impact and their community impact. I know a position is taken by some, which I consider to be unfair, that there is a nocebo effect—that somehow this is some sort of psychosomatic illness of communities. Just last week, Mr Acting Deputy President Back—and you were there as well—at the hearing of the Select Committee on Wind Turbines we heard from two residents in South Australia who were hosts of wind farms. They are receiving something like $200,000 a year from the proponent for hosting the wind farm. They, basically, had their lives disrupted significantly because of the noise and the vibration of the wind turbines. The power company effectively had to spend a fortune on their home to block the noise as much as possible. Those people were brave enough to speak out that there is a real issue there.


I am calling for a commitment to some independent scientific assessment of this—objective science and objective measuring of the noise and other issues including infrasound. Even the levels of acoustic noise need to be dealt with, and that is why I was very pleased to support Senator John Madigan's bill in respect of wind turbines and excessive noise. That is what we need to revisit. We need to give those communities a sense of empowerment. If the current rules are being breached, they need to be enforced. The current rules need to adequately reflect the science and the genuine concerns of the communities around noise and sleep disturbance—if you do not sleep, it has health effects. These are the issues that need to be dealt with in the course of this debate.


I want to briefly mention, before we go to the adjournment debate, matters that have been raised with me by Susan Jeanes of Jeanes Holland and Associates. Susan Jeanes is a former coalition member for the electorate of Kingston. I think it is fair to say that she would be described as a moderate—Senator Birmingham is chuckling. I do not know what that means, but I have a lot of respect for her. There is a nod there and hopefully the respect is mutual, Senator Birmingham. She is someone who has advocated in this space and is a great proponent of large-scale solar projects and of ensuring that those forms of renewables that are more reliable and do not have the same level of community impact and disruption get a fair go. I am very grateful for a short paper that Susan Jeanes provided to me. Issues were raised around the role of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which I believe has an essential role in climate change to be involved as a guarantor for power-purchasing agreements for smaller retailers, to create a focus on Australian solar projects for the low-cost, very active US bond market, and to have longer than usual debt-financing terms so that you can encourage those more reliable forms of renewable energy, including large-scale solar, landfill gas and genuinely new hydro—because it is a form of baseload renewable. I know there is some controversy about that. My colleagues in the Greens may have a different view, but we need to encourage baseload renewables and those more reliable forms of renewable energy. The problem is that there currently are not enough incentives for those baseload renewables.


I will conclude my remarks in the second reading debate now. I look forward to the Committee of the Whole stage, which I expect will be robust and contentious, but I hope we get to a suitable conclusion.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-06-15,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (21:50):  As I speak, Her Majesty the Queen is leaving a meadow within sight of Windsor Castle at a place called Runnymede. From ancient times, through the Middle Ages and to the modern era, whenever people have been oppressed by conquerors, rulers and unjust governments, they have fought to live free from the undue interference of the state. However, there is one act that has done more to advance the cause of democracy, freedom and liberty throughout the world than any other.


Eight hundred years ago today, a despotic king affixed his wax seal to a large sheepskin parchment in that meadow by the River Thames, striking a peace bargain with restless, cranky feudal lords. Magna Carta, the great charter, is the wellspring of the fundamental democratic principles that have come to define the polity of Australia and all free nations: limited constitutional government, the rule of law, the primacy of individual liberty and taxation with the consent of the governed. In times of darkness, it has been this axis of enlightenment underpinning Magna Carta that has been heralded by freedom fighters and revolutionaries in their pursuit of liberty. Yet no-one could have foreseen that the events at Runnymede would precipitate legal, cultural and political consequences that would, over the centuries, resonate to the far-flung corners of the old world and the new.


The Magna Carta—more precisely, the 1215 issue, as there were modified versions in 1216, 1217, 1225, 1297 and 1300—was almost entirely a product of the peculiar disputes that had arisen between King John of England and his barons. King John, by all accounts, was a terrible king, a terrible man—numero uno in the bad king stakes, a villainous man who inspired some of the tales of Robin Hood. John had inherited one of the largest territories in the world at the time, comprising England, much of the British Isles and the western parts of France. But through a series of disastrous military campaigns, which severely drained the royal coffers, John lost most of his French territories to King Philip II of France. To finance his war efforts and to maintain his rule against internal dissent, he levied burdensome taxes, stripped lands and property in satisfaction of unpaid debts and imposed harsh penalties. Barons across England and church leaders, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, had become increasingly frustrated with John's rule. They appealed to the king to end his tyrannical ways and honour the traditional liberties owed to them. Naturally, the king stalled, obfuscated and flat-out refused. However, through clever rhetoric from Langton and tactical manoeuvring by the barons, including the capture of the royal capital, London, John's opponents amassed the political momentum needed to force the king to make terms reluctantly in that meadow at Runnymede.


The 1215 Magna Carta's 63 clauses dealt with all manner of topics. They included famous clauses that echo the notions of justice according to the law of the land, due process and trial by jury that exists as the cornerstones of our modern legal system. Clause 38:


No bailiff shall in future put anyone to trial upon his own bare word, without reliable witnesses produced for this purpose.


Clause 39:


No free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way victimised, neither will we attack him or send anyone to attack him except by the lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.


And clause 40:


To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.


Clauses 12, 14 and 15 stated that 'No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless by common counsel of our kingdom' and established a method for seeking that common counsel from the clergy, barons and free landholders.


You can hear the early whispers of parliamentary democracy and the rallying cry of the American revolutionaries 5½ centuries later: no taxation without representation. However, the 1215 Magna Carta largely dealt with issues specific to life in a feudal England: the rights of the church, marriage and inheritance, property and debt disputes, knights' fees, bridges, forests, and fisheries on the Thames. But to oversee John's compliance, it also established a powerful council of 25 barons who were empowered to inflict military retribution upon the king—indeed, a revolutionary concept in the time when kings ruled by divine right. This meant that even the king himself would be made subject to law. However, the 1215 Magna Carta was an abysmal failure in reconstructing English government. It did not itself become law. King John successfully sought recourse from Pope Innocent III, who declared it null and void of all validity forever. The result was war between the king on one hand and the barons and the invading Prince Louis of France on the other hand, a conflict that did not subside until after John's death and his son's, Henry III's, accession to the throne.


Why, then, has Magna Carta—a list of obscure baronial demands written in mediaeval Latin, with limited references to matters of modern relevance—become such a celebrated symbol of liberty? It was not the first such charter granted by an English king agreeing to limit their absolute royal power. For example, the Charter of Liberties granted by Henry I upon his coronation in 1100, a forerunner of Magna Carter, had sought to guarantee certain rights to the church, nobles and other subjects that was almost entirely ignored by the crown. And the 1215 Magna Carta almost became a historical footnote as the war raged across England. Perhaps it is because the story of Magna Carta is the story of humanity's struggle for freedom. It is a story of countless challenges against the oppression of the state and incremental renewal.


For the legacy of Magna Carta is not just about the barons and King John or the documents sealed at Runnymede. It is about what happened next. When that boy king Henry III, through his regent, William Marshal, the Earl of Pembroke, and the papacy reissued the Magna Carta in 1216, many of the contentious provisions relating to the dispute were deleted. So too were the provisions relating to taxation by consent. But those regarding the rule of law remained. The reissue in 1217, in concert with the Charter of the Forest, again tempered the terms of the charter. But slowly, by the time Henry became of age, the notions underpinning Magna Carta were becoming politically entrenched. The 1297 charter was the first one to be enrolled on the statute books—that is, to become law itself. The reissue in 1300 confirmed the charter's status in the foundations of English common law which would over time be exported across the globe with the rise of the British Empire—imperialism that allowed the principles of enlightenment to be spread to the new world. Just as Magna Carta was refined over time, so too have the principles of liberty for which it was sought. When British monarchs later flouted the law, their subjects' appeal was to Magna Carta and the rights it imbued in all English men and women, even against the crown. When American colonies felt oppression from King George III, not as independence fighters but as British subjects, the appeal was to Magna Carta, equality before the law and a guarantee of life, liberty and property free from state interference. And when the framers of our own Constitution sought to build the Australian nation, the fundamental appeal to constitutional government, democratic liberties and justice were paramount.


A few hundred metres from where I am speaking tonight, Australia has one of the four remaining copies of the 1297 charter displayed for the public here in Parliament House. Australia's charter was originally sent to the county of Surrey, which contains Runnymede. It is hard to imagine a more fitting representation of the heritage of common law liberties that we possess in Australia than this. The challenge for all of us, 800 years after Queen Elizabeth II's ancestor in title sealed that great charter, is not to seek a new charter or fabricate a new declaration of rights but the opposite. We do not need or seek or desire a Magna Carta for the 21st century. Our parliamentary system works very well, thank you very much.


Our challenge is King John—the cornucopia of King John, which in Quisling-like fashion, are a demented anathema to liberty; the new King John who imposed new taxes without mandates, like the Labor Party; the new King John who imposed separate laws for special classes of interest groups, like those who want to bring in sharia law; the new King John who imprisoned individuals and thoughts within politically correct ideological prisons, like those in certain media organisations and Leftists; the new King John who wished to restrict access to resources and limit wealth to a cabal, like those in the Greens. The battle for freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is a continuous struggle that weaves its way through the course of human history. (Time expired)
