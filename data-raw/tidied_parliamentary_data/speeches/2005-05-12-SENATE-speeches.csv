"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-05-12,"—At the outset, I need to indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments for Carers) Bill 2005. This bill gives effect to a measure announced in Tuesday’s budget to provide extra assistance to carers. In view of the proposed timing of payments under the bill, Labor, of course, is happy to expedite the passage of this legislation through the chamber today. The bill will provide three one-off payments that will generally be paid in June 2005: a one-off payment of $1,000 to recipients of carer payment on budget night 2005; a one-off payment of $1,000 to recipients of carer service pension on budget night; and a one-off payment to recipients of carer allowance, generally payable as an amount of $600 for each person being cared for who attracts a carer allowance.
In broad terms, the bill introduces a series of new one-off payments which would each be paid as a lump sum, generally before 30 June 2005; hence the need for us to debate this today. There is no claim process attached to the payments. A person who receives an instalment of carer payment for a period that includes budget night will be entitled to the one-off payment of $1,000. Similarly, a person who receives an instalment of carer service pension for a period that includes budget night will be entitled to the one-off payment of $1,000. Subject to certain qualifications, a person will be entitled to $600 in respect of each care receiver for whom the person receives an instalment of carer allowance for a period that includes budget night. Where the care of that care receiver is shared, the $600 payment will also be shared. Where qualification for carer allowance depends on the person providing care for two children with a disability, the payment will also be $600.
As I said, Labor supports these one-off payments as a welcome financial relief for Australia’s carers. But I do want to take this opportunity to make some other comments about carers and the payment system that they have. First of all, we should acknowledge the nature of those who provide care in Australia. Most of us recognise that persons caring for their partner or an older relative are classified as carers, and they are the largest identifiable group of carers in our community. But we also should remember that there are people in this community who are caring for a child with a disability. Most carers, of course, are women, and those caring for a child with a disability are primarily women. There are also carers who are caring for friends. But there is another group of carers, and that is younger people in our community who are often providing care for a parent or family member. Some of these carers are as young as six years old, and I will come back to those people later.
The financial circumstances of those people who provide care in our community are variable. I have to say that most families who are in a care situation face financial pressure. Budgeting for those families is very tight. Planning the weekly budget is something that much attention is paid to. Of course, everyone has welcomed the one-off payments for carers. Money for assistance in the provision of care is always welcomed. But I want to take this opportunity to suggest to the government that, whilst of course carers welcome this payment, there may be other ways in which to support people who are providing care in our community.
As I said, they are working on very tight budgets. They are often working on a weekly budget cycle. A $600 or $1,000 payment is of course very welcome, but there are other ways to deliver support to people who provide care. What most people who are carers and what most carer representative organisations talk to me about is access to respite from care. Often the respite for those who care for older people is provided through residential aged care services. There are other daily respite services which are also very well used and welcomed. The care of older people with dementia, though, provides a challenge and residential aged care is not always the right option. For those people, finding an appropriate respite situation can be very difficult. Regarding the care of young people with disabilities, people who are being cared for in their own homes—often by a parent; usually a mother—it is difficult to find a respite alternative.
For many people the only alternative is residential aged care, and for many—I would suggest most—of those individuals residential aged care is certainly not an option. I met people recently who suggested that residential aged care for a young person with a disability would in fact exacerbate that disability, especially if it was an intellectual disability of any sort. I have to point out that this one-off payment is the second one-off payment, which is an interesting concept. I suggest to the government that, whilst it is welcomed, the need for respite care in a range of settings is something that the government needs to look to. Residential aged care is not the option for most people who require respite, especially from a high-care situation.
As I said, I want to talk about younger people who are providing care in our community. This is a group that is very much overlooked and often forgotten in the public perception of who provides care. I think as a community we think of care providers as being predominantly women in their middle age providing care for someone older. But 388,800 young people under 26 years of age in Australia, six per cent of the young population, are providing care for family members or friends with a disability, mental illness or chronic condition or who are frail aged. That is a lot of people that are hidden in our community. In Australia 17 per cent of all carers are under 26 years of age and 18,800 young people, five per cent of those carers, are the main source of unpaid informal support for the person they support. A total of 181,100 carers are under 18 years of age. They are a hidden group of people who are not in our consciousness, and we need to remember they are part of the army of carers in our society. Ten per cent of all people in Australia aged between 15 and 25 are carers.
The reason I raise this issue is the reality faced by carers aged under 16. These carers have a lot of difficulty traversing the carer payment situation. One of the regulations about access to carer payment means that, if you are outside of the home for 25 hours or more a week, you do not have the opportunity to access that payment. That means that for those young people school is not an option. I am aware that some discretion is allowed in the application of the regulations, and I would encourage that discretion to be used where at all possible to support these families, many of whom are in crisis. The assessment processes are difficult. For many of us the notion of a young person under 16 caring for an older relative is hard to contemplate. But we as a community have to support those families who are in crisis and facing particularly difficult circumstances so that they do not fall through the cracks and are not missed out in the provision of support and carer pensions.
As I said, Labor will support the passage of this legislation. It is an important recognition of the work that carers provide in the community. I note, though, that the government needs to look at the broader levels of support that families require. Yes, money is important and will be used very well to support the care arrangements of those families, but we also have to look at other care requirements. In particular, I point to the variety of respite care that is required to support those families—the care recipients and, as a consequence, their carers.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONE-OFF PAYMENTS FOR CARERS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-05-12,"—I too rise to speak to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments for Carers) Bill 2005. It was with quite remarkable rapidity that the bill was introduced into the other place yesterday afternoon, giving the Senate fewer than 24 hours to consider its content. This is another example of the government rushing legislation through with insufficient time for the Senate, in its proper role as the house of review, to accord it the deliberate and reasoned consideration that all legislation deserves. That we are told that the bill contains one-off bonuses for carers in the very appealing form of a lump sum payment does not automatically make it infallible, as was clearly demonstrated last year when a whole group of older carers were short-changed in their lump sum payment.
We Democrats strongly assert that the government’s insistence that this bill be given less than cursory attention by the Senate is an abuse of parliamentary process. You cannot get a more important issue to many Australian people than help for carers. There is an opportunity for us to get better results for the Australian people. If that can be done then we Democrats will do it. We are not inclined to be bullied by the government into abrogating our role in the Senate.
The bill before us provides for one-off bonuses to carers in three categories: $1,000 to carer payment recipients, $1,000 to recipients of carer service pension and $600 to carer allowance recipients. We do not dispute that repeat payments of bonuses to carers just one year later is a positive move. For too long now, carers of elderly Australians or those with disabilities have been overlooked. Carers are sometimes known as the silent army. There are more than 2.5 million of them in the Australian community. They do an extraordinary, difficult and largely unrewarded job. Carers provide by far the major proportion of both health and community care for people with special and particular needs. Most do so willingly for members of the family or friends, for love or duty, often with a substantial sacrifice of their own life and commitments.
However, caring often causes stress in financial, practical and emotional terms. For too long, carers have been calling upon the government to recognise their role and to identify key areas of action such as health and social care, access to respite, information support, young carers and employment. We Democrats know that it is no exaggeration to say that carers are the backbone of our whole community care system. We simply could not manage without them and the vital work that they do.
The bill before us, while paying carers a $1,000 bonus, does nothing to recognise the crucial role of carers as partners in providing care, nor does it give them any more rights and recognition than they have had in the past. The bonus does not compensate carers for their work. I recall the remarks, on last year’s bonus, of an elderly carer who was caring for her two severely disabled adult children. She said she had no time to herself and was simply too weary to go out and spend the money. Last year, we Democrats pointed out the glaring oversight in the payment of the $1,000 up-front bonus to carers. Certainly the carer payment is made to people who provide constant care in the home of the person under care—adults and children with a severe disability or medical condition which requires such care. But there are many people who have a primary entitlement to another social security income support—such as the age pension, disability support pension or parenting payment—who are providing the same level of care. Because the carer payment is paid at the same rate and using the same income test, there had been no advantage to them swapping to carer payment, and Centrelink have advised people of that. To make it worse, social security income support recipients who were on carer payment would have been automatically transferred over to the age pension when they reached the age of 65.
Last year’s budget changed the ‘no real advantage’ rule because the bonus of $1,000 was going to be paid to people on only the carer payment and not other pensions, notwithstanding that those people may provide equal amounts of care. The end result is that the number of people on the carer payment is significantly less than the number of people who are providing full-time care to disabled and highly dependent family members or friends, because they receive other social security income support. As we pointed out last year, this created the anomaly whereby the many carers who receive income support payments other than the carer payment from Centrelink missed out on the full $1,000 bonus—receiving instead only $600 or nothing at all. It was we Democrats who last year recognised that those carers who would miss out on the bonus of $1,000 were the ones who could least afford not to receive it. So we moved amendments to ensure that people could transfer from their present payment to the carer payment and be entitled to receive the bonus. They would not have been double-dipping and would rightfully qualify for the bonus.
Amazingly, Labor did not support our amendments last year. Senator Collins said at that time that she thought that the government should offer these families this payment and that they should not recognise some carers and not others. But, despite paying lip-service to the anomaly, Labor would not support the amendment to redress this. As a consequence, carers missed out. Those who missed out were predominantly older Australians whose own failing health was made worse by caring responsibilities.
The government have now had a full year to fix that anomaly—one full year in which to ensure that all Australians who valiantly provide full-time care for family members or friends are treated equally. But they have not fixed that anomaly. We therefore assert that it is not an oversight that thousands of carers will miss out on the full $1,000 but a deliberate, intended outcome of government policy. It is an intended outcome which I think is mean. The government seem to be more than happy to have Australians bearing the cost of caring for the frail, elderly or disabled—saving the government millions of dollars in residential and personal care costs—but are too mean to pay them a $1,000 one-off bonus.
The government’s trickiness does not stop there. Just two days ago, hidden away in the budget papers, the government announced that they were going to reduce the backdating period for carer allowance, which would save the government $107 million. This is just a case of the government milking carers to fund tax cuts for higher income earners. Carers often unexpectedly find themselves in a caring role. It is a new experience for many of them, and almost always it is an exhausting and time-consuming one. Their lives are significantly changed and they must learn to deal with the needs of the person for whom they are providing care, with the consequence that their own needs are often put last. They are the group least likely to have time to sit down and ponder their government entitlements, and they are likely to have not even heard of the carer allowance. They are even less likely to have the necessary time to fill in the forms, get the medical information completed and then get the application to Centrelink—all within 12 weeks of assuming care. Presently they have six months, but the government have decided to cut that back to 12 weeks.
Returning to the bill, we Democrats will support it because we recognise the worth of carers. We do note, though, that we will not be supporting the backdating provisions when they come before the Senate. My office receives, as I am sure many others do, many heartfelt pleas from carers of people with severe disabilities who write out of sheer desperation—weary with fatigue, in many cases, but with a resolute commitment to continue caring. We know we cannot rely on the government to ensure they are treated equally, and Labor’s record in supporting our amendments in this area is a negative one. But I can assure the Senate that we Democrats will continue to voice these concerns. As part of that process, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion add:
“but the Senate:
       a)         condemns the Government for failing to take this opportunity to ensure that all persons who receive a social security or veterans income support payment, other than youth allowance, Newstart allowance or Austudy payment and who are providing constant care to a person who has a physical, intellectual or psychological impairment and where that care is needed permanently or for an extended period, qualify for the full carer payment bonus of $1,000; and
      (b)         notes the Government’s failure to rectify this situation which was first brought to the notice of the Senate in May 2004; and
      (c)         calls upon the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to recognise this inappropriate result and to use her powers under Item 1 of Schedule 2 to make a special payment to make up the shortfall”.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONE-OFF PAYMENTS FOR CARERS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I note that Senator Greig talked about the speed with which the Social Security Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments for Carers) Bill 2005 has been introduced into the chamber. Like him, Labor have had very little time to deal with the legislation but, like the Democrats, we will be supporting it. As a consequence of the speed with which the legislation has been introduced into the chamber, we have seen the second reading amendment only in the last 20 minutes. I recognise that the Democrats have raised this issue in the chamber before, but that was when I did not have this responsibility. Labor cannot support the amendment at this point, simply because we have not had the time to look at the implications of such an amendment, but the point that Senator Greig has made will be the subject of some research by my office and we will continue to be in discussion about the issues that have been raised. At this point in time, simply because of the speed with which we have had to deal with this matter, we cannot commit to supporting that amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONE-OFF PAYMENTS FOR CARERS) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-05-12,"—I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments for Carers) Bill 2005. Carers make a vital contribution not only to the wellbeing of people they care for but also to society generally, facing extra costs as they do so. The Howard government, through this bill, builds on the substantial support provided in the 2004-05 budget package to extend bonus payments to carers receiving carer payment and/or carer allowance. The bonus payments have been made possible because of this government’s prudent economic management. Surplus budgets have given the capacity to pay these social dividends.
The measure addressed in this bill specifically recognises carers receiving carer payments and/or carer allowance. Carer payment is a means based income support payment paid to a person with limited income who provides constant care for someone with a disability or for the frail aged. Carer payment customers will receive a one-off bonus payment of $1,000. Carer allowance is not means tested. It is an income supplement paid to a person who provides daily care and attention at home for a person with a disability or for the frail aged. Carer allowance customers will receive a one-off bonus payment of $600 for each eligible care receiver in their care.
Carers who claim carer allowance after 10 May 2005 but whose payment is backdated under the carer allowance backdating provisions will not be eligible for the bonus payment, even if the backdated period includes 10 May 2005. These bonus payments to carers are non taxable and do not count as income for social security or family assistance purposes. The majority of eligible customers will be paid their bonus automatically by 30 June 2005. A small number of customers will receive the one-off bonus in 2005‑06. These will be people who claimed their payment on or before 10 May 2005 but who are assessable as eligible after 1 July 2005 and have their eligibility backdated to the date of the claim.
I would like to address some points raised regarding respite care for younger and older carers. The Howard government recognises that young carers require particular services, including respite services and age-appropriate information to help them stay in education while also providing care. At least 500 young carers each year will benefit from the almost $27 million which has been allocated to establish respite and information services for young carers. Young carers at risk of leaving education prematurely and not completing secondary education will be able to access up to five hours respite per week during the school term to attend education or training. In addition, young carers at risk will have access to two-week blocks of respite time to undertake activities such as study for exams, training or recreation. Delivery of the respite services has been negotiated with the Commonwealth carer respite centres. Carers Australia has been contracted to deliver a range of initiatives including information referral services that will support young carers in the many challenges they face as part of their caring role. All young carers will benefit from the new information and referral services network, including a telephone hotline available through the existing Commonwealth carer resource centres, online advice and an age-appropriate information package.
In its 2004-05 budget the Howard government offered to provide state and territory governments with an additional $72.5 million over four years to improve the availability of respite care for older carers. Funds were made available to provide up to four weeks respite a year for parent carers aged 70 years of age and over and up to two weeks respite a year for parent carers who are aged between 65 and 69 years of age and who need to go into hospital. This offer was conditional on state and territory governments matching the Australian government’s offer and managing the combined funds so that they directly assisted older Australians who have devoted most of their lives to a caring role. So far, five state and territory governments—Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory—have made a formal offer to provide extra funds.
Respite care is primarily a state and territory government responsibility. The state and territory governments know that additional Australian government funding is available right now. They agree that there are urgent unmet needs for respite care for people being supported by older carers. With additional Australian government funding available, it is up to the rest of the state and territory governments to act. It is this government, Senator McLucas, that has delivered measures to address concerns of younger carers and it is this government that is putting pressure on the states to match Commonwealth funding for respite care for older carers. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question negatived.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I would like to say a few words about the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005. This bill effects a series of amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003—the new legislative regime that was introduced by the government in December 2003. The main aspects of the new arrangement did not come into effect until 2005. Many of the amendments contained in this bill are described by the government, in the explanatory memorandum, as mere housekeeping measures, nothing more than minor adjustments needed to tidy up the new regime. I was somewhat astonished to discover this description, because the sections of the act—which was only passed, as I say, in December 2003, some 18 months ago—have already been subjected to 137 amendments and changes since then. Bills before the parliament, including this one, would make a further 80 amendments to the act. This comes on top of the 100 amendments that the government itself made at the very last minute back in 2003. There are now in total some 300 amendments to this government’s ‘perfect’ package of measures introduced some 18 months ago.
We said at the time, and I remember arguing long and hard in this chamber, that the legislation was poorly conceived from the very beginning. We were told of course that it was well-nigh perfect and that none of the amendments that the Labor Party—or any of the other parties on this side of the chamber—had proposed should be given the time of day. In fact all of them were unilaterally rejected without consideration. That was the nature of the deal done late at night with sections of this chamber, a deal which was found to be grossly in error in that it produced an act which could be referred to now, I think, as nothing more than a dog’s breakfast.
We have a situation where we have an unsustainable funding and regulatory regime for Australia’s universities which has been brought about as a result of an act of parliament which was poorly conceived to begin with, has been extraordinarily ineptly exercised and contains, in my judgment, the seeds of the financial destruction of some of Australia’s universities. Dr Nelson and the government have been left with a piece of crippled legislation that constantly reveals problems that need to be patched up. Frankly it is a terribly embarrassing situation for the government.
We have this legislation presented to us now with these so-called minor housekeeping matters. The amendments in this bill would allow institutions listed on table B of the HESA to have access to Commonwealth funding through the Capital Development Pool, known as the CDP. The institutions in question are two private universities—the Notre Dame and Bond universities—and a private college, the Melbourne College of Divinity. Table B exists to allow these institutions access to certain limited types of research funding. It recognises these institutions have a significant emphasis on postgraduate training.
It is somewhat strange to read that the government now wants to amend the act to allow table B providers access to funding under the Capital Development Pool program, which is a small program of only $42 million per annum, which of course is allocated on the basis of a competitive process. It has to be competitive because there is so precious little to go round. It could well be argued that the capital needs of our Australian universities would be in excess of half a billion dollars just to catch up with the normal maintenance arrangements, but there is $42 million offered annually by this pool. It is a grossly inadequate sum of money. The government has described the two types of projects to be supported by this money as ‘electronic delivery infrastructure’ and ‘new campus developments that involve collaborations with TAFE’. Neither of these are research related activities; they are teaching related activities, especially undergraduate teaching related activities. The extension of the CDP funding to table B institutions runs against the very clear purpose for which table B exists.
This is a proposition that again highlights the intellectual paucity of this government when it comes to policy development for higher education. The government puts up propositions time and time again which are fundamentally inconsistent with the policy objectives that it establishes in other quarters. Furthermore, to extend eligibility for the limited funding pool to the extra three universities potentially spreads the funding available even more thinly. It actually makes worse an already appalling situation. I say the whole thing makes no sense.
The Senate inquiry that we conducted into this legislation was intended to provide an opportunity for the government to explain its position. It has failed to do so. We have from the Department of Education, Science and Training a proposition that says that the government wants to give the three providers—all three of them—permanent access to the CDP because they say a couple of years ago the government promised Notre Dame University $2 million in capital funds for a new medical school. When the newer legislation came into effect the revised classification of Notre Dame, which was previously on table A of the old HEFA act, to table B of the new HESA act meant that, technically speaking, it was no longer eligible for this sort of capital funding.
So what does the government do to fix up this problem? It does not adopt what would be a sensible approach—namely, to make a one-off special grant of $2 million to Notre Dame, which the Minister for Education, Science and Training has the power to do. What it seeks to do instead is to provide permanent access to this very limited funding pool. The government has moved to make an unnecessary change to table B because it has failed to have the political gumption to do what it ought to do—fix the mistake of its own creation. The government has yet to explain why it has not adopted that approach. What we have here is the government’s policy objective in higher education of seeking to fundamentally shift the balance between public and private funding and between public and private provision. It is seeking to do that incrementally and in an ad hoc manner, and this is one of those further measures that does that.
This move is not insignificant. It is just another step along the path of the destruction of the public education system in higher education. We have seen this government open up new fee-paying regimes for undergraduate students in our public universities. We have also seen a new student loan scheme, the FEE-HELP program, designed specifically to encourage students into fee-paying places and fee-paying private institutions. Dr Nelson and the government want to change the primary emphasis in Australia on public higher education provision to one based on private provision and private financing of that provision, which is a polite way of saying ‘slugging students for the full cost of their education through full fees’. This little move, widening access to the Capital Development Pool, takes us one step further down that track.
There is another bill coming into the Senate shortly, a bill to add a fourth private provider to table B—another private institution that will enjoy the same access to the public subsidies. Perhaps the word ‘institution’ is too generous a term to use in this context, because here I speak of Melbourne University Private. I will have a fair bit to say when that measure is brought into the chamber. But it will not be the last of these operations that will be given access to the public purse. There will be many more. I make this predication on the basis that there are already 28 private higher education providers enjoying indirect Commonwealth subsidies through the FEE-HELP student loan scheme. What we have seen is, again, in the dead of night, quietly and without fanfare, the minister has exercised his approval power to add 28 providers to the list of those whose students—both undergraduate and postgraduate—are eligible for FEE-HELP.
All these providers offer state accredited courses at the higher education level. There are probably as many as 50 such providers waiting in the wings and already operating in Australia that have yet to be approved by the minister. We also have many others, I am told, that want to come in from overseas to do exactly the same thing. I have no doubt that down the track the minister will decide to extend more direct forms of public subsidy to those providers as well. We are seeing the privatisation of the higher education system in this country, and it is being done by stealth.
The financial health of our universities is something that more public attention ought to be directed upon. Nothing could illustrate more clearly the slide in the health of our public institutions since the Howard Government came to office than the recent announcements of Newcastle and other universities that have highlighted that their deficits have gone further into the red. The Productivity Commission has calculated that, just between 1995 and 2001, the Commonwealth funding cut per student has amounted to seven per cent. Since then, according to one estimate, the funding decline has grown to as much as 13 per cent per student. That means, in stark terms, a diminution in the quality of the environment in which students are asked to undertake higher education in this country. Staff to student ratios under this government have moved from 1 to 14 to 1 to 22. I would suggest to anyone who was to tell me that that would not do anything other than reduce the quality of education that they have another good think about it.
University revenues have grown but only a small fraction of the growth has been in Commonwealth funding. Only 40 per cent of university income now flows from the Commonwealth. Most of the balance comes from local and overseas students in the form of fees. Fourteen per cent of all university revenue is generated by international student fees alone. This amounted to $1.7 billion in 2004. Public higher education institutions are now heavily reliant upon fee income, including that from overseas students. The government knows this well, and I say that this is a policy of deliberate intent—a policy to radically shift the balance in university funding away from reliance on the public purse to that of private sources. The government has shown time and again that it takes no responsibility in terms of the defence of public education and it takes no responsibility for the decline in quality that inevitably follows such a policy direction.
Universities have overestimated their future income projections from international students, and we have seen time and again through Senate estimates that the Commonwealth sits on its hands and allows this to happen. Even though senior officers have had detailed discussions with every university on an annual basis, nothing is done to seriously investigate the financial implications or the planning assumptions that allow that to develop and to occur. Some universities have an undue reliance on international students. At Central Queensland University, for example, 49.8 per cent of its student load is now international students. That is according to the latest figures, the 2004 figures that I have. The previous assumption that 40 per cent of its income would now be generated by international students seems inadequate in view of that. Overseas students now make up 49.8 per cent of the student load. That is an extraordinary proposition for an Australian university.
This is a volatile and changing market. It is heavily dependent on the prosperity of the Asian economy. Rapid growth in higher education systems in some of our traditional rival countries in terms of international students, such as Malaysia and other places, may well put in question the market’s long-term sustainability. Frankly, you cannot maintain a position where 49.8 per cent of enrolments in a university are from international students and say that that is going to produce continuing prosperity for that particular university.
We are increasingly seeing countries in our region providing greater access and higher quality programs, and they are now serious competitors against Australia’s international higher education system. We are in a situation where the Commonwealth cannot rely upon the presumption that the market will determine good quality outcomes for Australian universities, nor can we take the precarious position that the financial state of our universities is not a matter for the Commonwealth of Australia—that it is not a matter of public interest or Commonwealth responsibility. We have a vital national resource that has to be managed. It has to be protected. We cannot have a situation where the Commonwealth cuts back funding and says to these universities, ‘You go out and find replacement funding. When you get it from the international student market, whatever you do is okay.’ Clearly, that is not a sustainable position. The proposition that a university has nearly half its student load coming from international students is just not sustainable.
 We have seen in recent times universities posting large losses. RMIT posted a loss of $24 million. The University of Newcastle announced a loss of $28 million. The University of Western Sydney posted a negative result of $26 million. These are huge losses. These are huge changes that are occurring in our higher education system. We probably have a record number of universities in deficit this year.
The University of Newcastle is now moving to address this situation by sacking 20 per cent of its staff. In 2005 there was a drop in the international student load of nine per cent in one year. It has been hit very hard by these changes. As a consequence, the university has now moved to sack 470 staff. Of course, that means the abolition of entire courses and reduced subject offerings in others. It will mean that degrees in economics, science, fine arts and health will not be provided. The vice-chancellor’s report has recommended that the courses available in business, finance, economics, commerce and management be reduced from five to just two within two years. For the students in the New South Wales Hunter region and for their families, and for the economy of that region, these are very serious issues.
In apportioning responsibility for the failure of the education system in this regard, the buck cannot be passed on to local management of universities; the Commonwealth has to face up to its share of the blame when things go wrong. We cannot have a situation where the universities are reliant upon private income and the Commonwealth washes its hands of it.
On top of that, we now have a situation where the universities are being told that they cannot rely upon the Commonwealth to get proper indexation arrangements in place. The review of higher education indexation completed by the Department of Education, Science and Training has, not surprisingly, produced a result where, despite all the promises made before the last election, universities will not see any improvement in their operating margins. This is as a result of the Commonwealth funding universities on the basis of meeting inflationary needs, because the indexation propositions that the government has pursued have clearly been grossly inadequate to meet the cost pressures facing universities. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
         “but the Senate notes with concern:
              (a)    that the Government has failed to provide a clear or adequate rationale for amending the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to allow the institutions listed on Table B access to funding from the Capital Development Pool, and that this gives rise to concerns that the Government is attempting to expand subsidies to private higher education providers by stealth; and
              (b)    that the Government is proceeding to expand public subsidies to private higher education providers in the absence of the stringent quality requirements, as well as the public reporting and other accountability requirements, placed on public universities”.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-05-12,"—I will begin with the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the Labor Party and indicate to the chamber that I agree entirely with the sentiments of the amendment, as do the Democrats as a whole, and I agree with Senator Carr’s comments in the chamber during his speech in the second reading debate. But I am a little confused about the Labor Party’s position on the relevant section in relation to so-called privatisation by stealth—that is, the issue of table B providers. Item 2 in schedule 1 of this bill deals with that issue. I am going to think about whether or not the Democrats support the Labor Party second reading amendment, because I think it is all words and no action. If they are going to oppose the relevant provision in the bill then, sure, I am happy to support their second reading amendment. But there is no point in moving a second reading amendment that talks about how much you hate privatisation of higher education and then voting for the legislation in toto. If that is the position of the Labor Party, I am afraid that is not really good enough. Having said that, though, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Carr. I just hope that his vote reflects his contribution in the chamber today.
This is yet another bill designed to fix up some of the problems that were in the original higher education legislation changes that went through in 2003. As honourable senators would recall, that bill went through after a deal among four Independents and the government. Obviously, the legislation that we have passed since then has not addressed the issues—and we have had numerous amendments, let us face it, to fix up some of the problems, some housekeeping and some of the administrative changes. The list goes on. We have had three amendment bills to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and now we have got some more. We welcome the amendments; we are just wondering at what point the act that was passed is going to be fixed up. Nonetheless, we welcome the particular amendments before us that ensure there is an automatic recrediting of a person’s student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balance when a private provider is no longer able to provide a particular unit of study.
The question again to the government is: what was so wrong with the original drafting of the legislation and why have we continued to need to ameliorate some of the problems through legislation? Perhaps this reflects on the fact that the government was so keen to introduce that legislation so quickly in 2003 after that deal that they left too many mistakes in the original legislation. Let us hope we only need five amendment bills and we do not have to be confronted with more to fix up the shambles created during that process.
I also want to reflect on some comments made in a second reading speech by the minister in the other place. He made a comment on leading scientists who attend the Prime Minister’s science prizes. He stated, I think, in his speech:
They come to the nation’s capital annually to see the Prime Minister award the most prestigious award for science in the country ...
That is true—however, not last year. Let us not forget that the Prime Minister was not able to make it to the award ceremony last year in September. I admit: I was not there either. I had a few pressing health reasons that made it difficult for me fly and get to that event, but I am not sure how missed I was. There was a much more conspicuous absence, and that was the Prime Minister. That is okay. We all have other obligations, but when I turned on the television and saw our Prime Minister with Miss Universe at the rugby awards, I felt a little sorry for the scientists because they obviously missed out to an event that was clearly evident of our Prime Minister in campaign mode.
—I am sure they would understand his choice.
—Maybe, Senator McGauran, it is because—I should not have acknowledged that interjection. I am going to presume it was a comment on sport. As a South Australian with not the greatest rugby knowledge, I will leave it at that and not proceed too much further. I thank the minister for raising the issue of that prestigious and very important science dinner and prize. It is an important prize, but I do want to put on record that the absence of the Prime Minister was noted and I think the minister should be wary in making those comments in relation to the dinner that was held on 7 September 2004.
The indexation review was one aspect of the deal that was cobbled together in 2003 during those late night sittings to get that legislation through. As honourable senators would know, and more importantly as the sector now knows, they were duped. The indexation review has taken place. The announcement was made in April that the government were not going to do anything. They are not going to stop the rot on indexation as they indicated they were going to do. I wonder why it was announced in April. I guess I now know why: it was one less thing that people could criticise about the budget. So indexation was not in this year’s budget—what a surprise! I wonder if those four Independent senators were truly shocked, or maybe they just felt better committing to a review that promised vice-chancellors and students absolutely nothing. Weren’t they suckers!
The explanatory memorandum for this bill tells us that the bill will increase the overall appropriation under the Higher Education Support Act by $48.726 million for the years 2005 to 2008. Again, what an insult that is to universities. Just compare these election commitments to the amount of funding the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee believe this government have short-changed them by. The AVCC estimates are that inadequate indexation has cost them $586 million since 1997. That is a lot of money. Sadly, though, a lot of people will not necessarily understand the importance of adequately indexing university grants, but of course that does not make the impact of this decision any less severe.
On 20 April this year, the Australian newspaper reported the AVCC warning the government that its decision would:
... place pressure on the present cap of 25 per cent for HECS increases.
In the same article, AVCC’s vice-president, Professor Gerard Sutton, stated something that the Democrats knew or suspected back in 2003—that is:
Most universities have increased their HECS fees because of the shortage of funding ...
Professor Sutton indicated that without adequate indexation the ‘natural direction’—his words, not mine—for universities to go in now would be to seek further increases in HECS fees from the government. So you got it folks: we have had the 25 per cent increase taken up by most universities, unfortunately; but, because they have had inadequate funding, they felt they have had no choice. We all know what the access and equity implications are, particularly for disadvantaged students and various groups in our communities.
The universities and the vice-chancellors are now flagging that they are going to come cap in hand again to the government with a request to increase the amount that they can charge through HECS and, I have no doubt, through upfront fees as well—postgraduates and undergraduates. This is not news. I am sick of being surprised by this. I have been almost ten years in this place and every time we debate a higher education bill—I am used to it now—if it is not a CPI increase on HECS it is something else: up-front full-cost fees or whatever. For those senators who did the deal, I hope you are feeling a little embarrassed today. HECS fees are up by 25 per cent, and that is your doing, Independent senators. Well done! I am not wanting to take that away from the government, of course, but they had a choice. They had a choice as to whether or not students faced additional fees and charges and they blew it, and now fees and charges are set to go up.
As for university vice-chancellors, I know them well. I have just been meeting with vice-chancellors briefly today and they are stunned by the indexation result and they still name it as their No. 1 priority. I think their No. 2 priority is student income support but I will not get onto that tangent today as we have a very important Senate committee looking into that issue too. So inadequate indexation—the writing is on the wall—will mean increased fees and charges. We are not investing in the future of this nation at all when it comes to human capital through higher education and education generally.
The review findings relating to indexation openly state that income from HECS hikes and increases in full fee paying places are two mechanisms through which the sector can continue to achieve strong revenue growth. Clearly, it is a recommendation as to how universities can get more funds. We know that around 70 per cent of commencing students will be paying HECS rates higher than the pre-2005 rates. In my home state of South Australia, that involves all students other than nursing and teaching students. DEST has estimated that, as a result, students will be paying an additional $828 million in HECS over the period 2005 to 2008. This amount is similar to the $821 million that South Australians currently owe in HECS. They are huge debts. We have budgets with huge surpluses and ministers going out and saying that they do not want to burden the next generation. Who are they kidding? The debts that students owe to this government are going to be crippling and they are going to have generational impacts—but we all know that.
HECS increases have already had an impact on students. This year, applications dropped by 12,123. That is after years of increases in applications. For only the second time in the last 50 years, the number of HECS places in Australian universities declined by 8,354 places in 2004. In his second reading speech, Dr Nelson said:
... this year there are 180,000 Australians who owe the taxpayer HECS repayments for the 25 per cent of their university education that recipients pay for and who will pay no HECS at all because the repayment threshold has gone up to $36,000.
We know that is a joke. Students are contributing much more than 25 per cent of the cost of their education. We know that estimates from groups such as the National Tertiary Education Union show that students at a university that has increased its HECS fees by 25 per cent will be paying on average more than half the cost of the education that they are obtaining. The minister seems to be forgetting that his policies are contributing to lifelong debts for some students. Each year that students do not repay their debts means another year with that debt hanging over their heads, and we all know the consequences of that.
For many years the No. 1 priority of the higher education sector has been to secure a realistic indexation formula for their grants. The so-called compromise in the Higher Education Support Act for an indexation review was never going to deliver what they wanted or what they needed. I think it was perhaps the most significant failure of that legislation. What we saw from the government in its review process was a sign of the growing arrogance brought on by their knowledge of a Senate majority. Having said that, they got that majority not through the coalition ranks but through four Independent senators who had a choice, but chose to increase fees and charges.
I do not think the review of indexation was serious and I never thought it was intended to be. It was a sop to those Independent senators and, I might suggest, to vice-chancellors as well. They fell for it. The review was not public. It was not an independently run review; rather, it was undertaken by the department—and, no reflection on the department, but it should have been an independent review. It was done in cooperation with the Department of Finance and Administration and in consultation with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Treasury. The fact that the review took only one submission, from the AVCC, is evidence enough of the quality and thoroughness of that review process.
Another issue that arose this year was the approval of private higher education providers. The Democrats share concerns that have been expressed publicly and in this place—in particular in a mooted disallowance motion from Senator Nettle—about the minister approving numerous private providers before we had actually had the public debate on the national protocols. Those protocols will decide the future composition of the higher education sector, particularly in relation to the mix of public and private institutions.
On page 31 of the Australian Financial Review of 14 March 2005, Sophie Morris stated that Senator Nettle’s actions ‘would have delayed students who had already been promised the loans from accessing them this semester’. The article went on to say that ACPET had emailed its members saying that the effect of this disallowance would be a ‘disaster for students and private higher education providers’, who had enrolled students on the basis that they would get the loans. I would also like to quote from ACPET’s National Monday Update, edition 129 of 14 March 2005, article 2. It is entitled ‘ACPET pressure on Greens forces withdrawal of Senate motion—FEE-HELP goes ahead’. The article says:
With Senator Nettle’s motion, students who had already commenced the academic year and made financial commitments based on the assumption that they would be able to access FEE-HELP, would have been severely affected.
The Democrats are very concerned that there were students who would have assumed that they were able to access FEE-HELP and had commenced their study based on that assumption, because it was a false assumption. The most likely way that the students could have reached that assumption was if they received incorrect advice from the higher education provider, who in turn may have relied on advice from either the department or the minister’s office. Either way, it seems that both students and providers failed to fully understand the provisions of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, for whatever reason.
The information pack for bodies seeking approval as higher education providers under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 published by DEST in May 2004 clearly states that provider status takes effect only after the disallowance period has passed. I am sure that the Minister for Education, Science and Training understands this procedure—and I am sure that Senator Eric Abetz also understands this procedure. The minister would also know that once notice to disallow his approval is made, the parliament has a further 15 days before the motion is debated. DEST should also be aware of this procedure. But it appears to have come as a surprise to the private providers, who were expecting a smooth transition into their new ministerially approved status. The information pack states:
However, it is the responsibilities of bodies seeking and achieving HEP status to become familiar with the provisions of the HESA and all relevant Guidelines ...
If all providers had followed this instruction and passed on this information to their students, no students would have been fooled, no students would have been taking it for granted that they would be able to access FEE-HELP in the first semester of 2005, and any anger that resulted from Senator Nettle’s motion would have been totally baseless. Interestingly, KvB Institute of Technology is one private provider that acted responsibly in its approach to gaining higher education provider status. On their web site they actually warned students and said:
... students will only be entitled to FEE-HELP for a unit of study which has a census date after the date on which the Institution becomes a HEP ...
Thus KvB was acknowledging that their application to become a higher education provider was subject to a disallowance by the Australian parliament.
If all private providers had operated in this way, yes, students may have experienced a delay possibly by one semester in their study. No student, though, would have been able to complain as a result of that disallowance. Again we have the government proceeding with the privatisation of higher education without explanation and without transparency of the approval process. This is another flaw of the legislation which we are amending today.
The Democrats understand that most of the provisions of this bill before us are non-controversial and technical in nature. However, the Democrats do have an issue with item 2 of schedule 1 of this bill. That is why we supported the committee reference for that provision of the bill. The Democrats did not agree with the majority report on the bill but we wholeheartedly support the majority of the content and conclusion of the opposition senators’ report. Unfortunately, though, despite all their concerns, all 6½ pages of them, they are not going to oppose that part of the bill today. Or maybe I am wrong. After the strong language in this chamber earlier by Senator Carr, maybe they will. The significant decline in Commonwealth funding of education relative to other government portfolios over the past 30 years is of particular concern to the Democrats, as are the recent HECS and other fee increases. We believe that government policy should work to reverse universities’ reliance on private sources of income—not exacerbate it, not increase it.
The evidence presented to the committee—I will not go into it here because we are all familiar with it, or at least it is all in the report if people choose to read it—and many of the arguments raised in the opposition senators’ report warrant much stronger recommendations. That is what the Democrats recommended in our supplementary report; that is what I put in my report. So it is important to get on record the position of all parties in this place. Indeed, it is probably good to get on record in this place the Independent senators’ views on privatisation of higher education. As the ALP indicate in their report, they do not support further privatisation of higher education by stealth. That is in the second reading amendment. So I expect the Labor Party to support today my amendment, which will delete the relevant section of the legislation in relation to item 2 of schedule 1 of the bill. I do not expect the government to support it, obviously. Senator Abetz and I were talking earlier. I do not like the position of Senator Abetz or the government but I have to grant you consistency. What I am a little confused about is the inconsistency in the chamber today in relation to privatisation of higher education and particularly the report that came from Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition senators.
To ensure that everyone inside and outside this place is clear about our position and that of other senators, I will move an amendment to this bill during the committee stage that is in line with our recommendation contained in the committee report. The amendment seeks to remove the controversial and unnecessary provision that would provide access to Commonwealth funding through the Capital Development Pool to table B institutions. I look forward to hearing the explanation of all parties in this place for their position on this particular provision in the bill.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-05-12,"—I want to thank all senators who took part in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005, although it will not come as a surprise that I did not necessarily agree with those contributions.
—You didn’t hear it. How would you know?
—Senator Carr says that I did not hear it. Little does he know that we have got a TV monitor and, sick as it may seem to honourable senators, I actually did tune in for a while to listen to what Senator Carr said; I might call it a speech but I think it was more of a rant. Nevertheless, I will not be too unkind to him after the bollocking he has just received from Senator Stott Despoja. The inconsistency that she highlighted has saved me from having to make mention of that. I think Senator Stott Despoja put it very eloquently, so to those aspects of the speech can I simply say ditto.
I want to reiterate a few points on this particular bill. The legislation is necessary to update appropriation amounts in the Higher Education Support Act 2003 for the years 2004-08 to provide for commitments made during the election. These important funding measures include 100 new radiation therapy places as part of the Strengthening Cancer Care package, $2 million in infrastructure funding for improved information technology at Charles Darwin University and $12 million in infrastructure funding for a new veterinary science and agriculture school at James Cook University. This bill also contains some additional funding measures, including 40 additional aged care nursing places, extra funding for the additional 12 medical places at James Cook University announced in the 2004-05 budget, $16.5 million in increased national institute funding for the Australian National University and a transfer of funds related to the establishment of the Australian Maritime College’s Point Nepean campus.
The Australian government is also taking this opportunity to make a number of technical amendments to enhance its effective implementation and to give certainty to higher education providers. These include: enabling table B higher education providers to apply for capital infrastructure funding; clarifying the way tuition assurance requirements interact with certain provisions in the act; adjusting the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to make it consistent with the new act in terms of the administration of student assistance; and amending the Maritime College Act 1978 to ensure that the Australian Maritime College complies with the national governance protocols.
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee recently conducted an inquiry into the amendment in this bill to allow table B providers to apply for capital infrastructure funding. The committee released their final report yesterday in time for the debate, and I thank the majority and opposition members of the committee for recommending that the bill be passed without amendment. I would like to take this opportunity to comment on some of the issues raised in the opposition senators’ report on the particular amendment in question. That is also referred to in the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr. Firstly, they seek a rationale for not providing a one-off payment to the University of Notre Dame Australia for the allocation of capital infrastructure funds granted under the previous framework. As I am sure all honourable senators are aware, the University of Notre Dame was listed as a table A provider under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, making it eligible for capital infrastructure funding prior to the introduction of the Higher Education Support Act 2003.
Under the Higher Education Funding Act, the university was granted funds under the Capital Development Pool for payment in 2006. This would provide $2 million in funding for UNDA’s medical school in 2006. UNDA, which is the acronym for the University of Notre Dame Australia, is now listed as a table B provider under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, meaning a change to the legislation is required to allow the university to receive these Capital Development Pool funds that were previously committed.
It is in the interests of fairness and consistency that the Higher Education Support Act is being amended to extend the eligibility for Capital Development Pool funding to all other table B providers—currently Bond University and the Melbourne College of Divinity—so that all such providers are afforded the same treatment which the University of Notre Dame Australia has previously enjoyed. A one-off payment to the University of Notre Dame Australia for already committed funds would be inequitable to the other providers on table B. I must emphasise that this amendment does not guarantee that table B providers will receive capital infrastructure funding in future rounds; it only ensures that, like institutions in table A, they will now be able to apply for a share of funding.
Secondly, opposition senators query the future direction of government policy in relation to all private higher education providers in light of this amendment. This amendment applies only to table B providers and only relates to eligibility for the Capital Development Pool. This amendment does not relate in any way to other non-listed approved higher education providers. I am aware that the Senate will have an opportunity to debate the inclusion of Melbourne University Private in table B at a later date. Any additions to table B will need to come through the parliament and will be transparent to the Australian community. I urge all honourable senators to support the bill to ensure that these benefits can be delivered smoothly and in the most efficient way possible.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-05-12,"—by leave—I understand that Senator Carr wants to call a division if there is disagreement on the motion before the chamber. I want to place on record that the Democrats will be supporting the second reading amendment because we agree with the content. That is why we will move an amendment in the committee stage to bring into effect the words and the substance of the amendment, but there will be no need to divide on it unless it is suggested by the government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 [2005], which the opposition believes is a worthy bill. It is my pleasure to speak on it today. There is an obvious need for this bill because it is primarily about the protection of the vulnerable. The bill is colloquially known as a device against sex trafficking of women and children. This may reflect the interest of the many organisations who have made comment on the exposure draft or to the Senate inquiry or both.
Trafficking of persons for use as sex slaves may not be an entirely new crime, but it is becoming more prevalent as the world increasingly opens up its borders for freer movement of goods and people. The trouble is that, as we globalise, so do the criminals—in fact, in many cases, even before us. Sex trafficking is becoming more prevalent worldwide. It presents a major problem in the European Union, for example, where unscrupulous gangs are preying on vulnerable women from eastern Europe and Russia for use as sex slaves. In the UK, for example, the Solicitor-General stated that an estimated 80 per cent of prostitutes in London are foreign. The idea that these are women who have chosen to sell sex is clearly wrong. Recently, too, the US State Department identified the possible emergence of the sex-trafficking problem in Singapore.
It is not clear how widespread the problem is here in Australia. Women who are trafficked as sex slaves often work illegally, possibly with the wrong type of visa or even with none at all. To that extent, they are difficult to locate, and I am sure that the criminals who control these women make full use of this fact. Estimates have varied as to the numbers of women involved from between 30 to 1,000. Clearly, even at the maximum level, that is probably nowhere near the scale of the problem in some parts of Europe. But, in a sense, the numbers do not matter. If this bill were only to stop one woman or child from enduring the horrors of being trafficked as a sex slave it would still be a worthwhile exercise from Labor’s point of view. The provisions relating to the trafficking in persons offences are not limited exclusively to trafficking for the purpose of sexual services. They also relate to trafficking in instances where someone is using force, or threats of force, to facilitate the entry or receipt of a person into Australia.
This bill will also, for example, make deceptive conduct in recruiting a person to work in the sex industry illegal and punishable by seven years imprisonment, or nine years for an aggravated offence. The offence of debt bondage is also introduced as a most welcome measure. The debt bondage measures will cover all workers, no matter what industry they are in. Perhaps it is best if we call debt bondage by its real name—serfdom. Serfdom is not entirely unknown, even in modern times in Australia, as the living experience of many Indigenous Australians bears witness. We have, thankfully, stopped this form of exploitation, but the struggle against serfdom continues around the world. Now this insidious action of traffickers, people smugglers and unscrupulous employers has brought the problem back to Australia, taking advantage of vulnerable citizens from some of South-East Asia’s poorest countries. Labor will support the debt bondage measures because we are philosophically opposed to the notion of debt bondage or serfdom. In fact, for these reasons alone, the bill represents a significant improvement on what is available to our law enforcement agencies in dealing with some of these transnational scourges.
There are already a number of people-smuggling offences in the Migration Act 1958 and in the Criminal Code. For example, the Migration Act includes offences of bringing an unlawful noncitizen or a group of such persons into Australia. These measures alone are not enough to deal with all circumstances of sex trafficking and exploitation. Further offences were added to the Criminal Code with the passage of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearm Trafficking and Other Measures) Act in 2002. These offences apply to what might be called international smuggling—for example, the smuggling of people in a foreign country, whether or not via or through Australia.
The new people-smuggling offences are, in general, based on the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the smuggling protocol. I will talk about the origins of this UN protocol. To combat the growing phenomena of transnational crime in 2000, the UN adopted a convention against transnational organised crime, which was supplemented by the UN trafficking protocol. Australia signed the UN convention in late 2000, and it entered into force generally in 2003. After a national interest analysis had been performed on the UN trafficking protocol, Australia signed up to that as well, in late 2002. The government has indicated its intention to ratify the UN trafficking protocol once legislation is in place to meet the protocol. Before it can do that, it has to ensure that our laws against trafficking in persons meet the requirements of the protocol. This is what this bill is about. It is aimed at meeting Australia’s obligations under the protocol.
The bill was derived from the transnational response to organised crime some years ago. The United Nations adopted a convention against transnational organised crime. As I said, we signed up to that in 2000. Out of this convention, a protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking of persons, especially women and children, was established, and Australia signed the protocol in 2002—again, after a national interest analysis was performed. Perhaps it is worth while explaining that a national interest analysis is where the Australian government make a decision about whether it is in Australia’s national interests to sign something. So, in other words, they examined it in that context and decided that it was a worthy protocol to sign.
However, this is not the sole source of law impetus for the changes in this area. As I acknowledged in my speech on the committee’s report, the current laws reflect, and indeed are, an updated version of the old imperial anti-slavery legislation, one of Britain’s legal legacies to Australia and an heir to a statutory tradition that goes back to the time of Wilberforce and other anti-slavers from over 200 years ago. It was in examining the inadequacy of this current regime that the report into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission—which has a watching brief and, indeed, a statutory responsibility to examine trends and changes in the methods and practices of criminal activities—made nine very good recommendations for government. Recommendations 4, 5 and 6 relate to the need for improved legislation, speedy implementation of the legislative review and the introduction of the measures into parliament in early 2005.
The second origin of the measures contained in this bill is the issue of trafficking in persons for sexual servitude purposes that was investigated by the parliamentary joint committee in June 2003. The PJC reported the following year and recommended that the government ratify the UN trafficking protocol as soon as possible. Among other things, they recommended a review of the adequacy of existing provisions in the Criminal Code dealing with the recruitment, transportation and transfer of women for the purposes of trafficking. They recommended an amendment to section 270.7 of the Criminal Code dealing with deceptive recruiting for sexual services ‘to broaden the offence to include deception regarding not only the type of work to be done but expressly the kinds of services to be provided, whether of a sexual nature or not’. They also recommended that all trafficked women accepted onto the victim support program or receiving the criminal justice stay visa be exempt from compulsory return to their country of origin.
However, the government did not pick up the baton all that well. They demonstrated the need for the bill—and all sides of politics are clear on that—but I think the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Attorney-General let us down in the process. Ordinary bills of this type—that is, bills that create or amend federal crimes—are usually referred to the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. You would expect them to be referred there, or to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General—or SCAG, as it is referred to—if they might have an impact upon state law as well.
This is not done for the health of those involved. The aim of SCAG and the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee is to develop uniform national criminal laws. These committees address other matters, but that is one of their briefs. If something the Commonwealth does impacts or has the potential to impact on the criminal law of the states then you would imagine it would also be a very good idea to consult with the states. This did not happen with this bill. Even though the bill is primarily directed towards preventing the trafficking of women and children for the purposes of prostitution, the government chose not to consult with the very level of government that regulates prostitution. It is extraordinary that this could be so.
This was just the beginning of the non-consultation process, if we can call it that, overseen by Minister Ruddock and Minister Ellison. The next major stakeholders the Attorney-General left off the consultation list were many of his own agencies. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is under the Attorney-General’s portfolio, was not contacted by the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice and Customs to comment on either the exposure draft or the bill. To be fair, they put it on the web site and put out a draft. But that is where it was left. Also to be fair, there was an election in the middle of the process. You would expect that post that they would have picked up the ball and ran with it, but they did not. It sounds extraordinary until you consider Minister Ruddock’s record in immigration, where his ticking time bomb of what can only be described as maladministration is beginning to blow up in Senator Vanstone’s face.
It has fallen to Labor and the committee to ensure adequate public consultation on this bill. Labor has in effect taken on part of the role of ensuring proper consultation on this legislation. The bill should have been dealt with some time ago but, following the committee’s report on the bill’s inadequacies, the government elected to rework it very significantly, with some 20 or more amendments.
Turning to the Senate committee report, the legal and constitutional committee made 13 substantive recommendations in relation to this bill. Seven of the recommendations have now been incorporated in the bill and Labor welcomes these additional measures. A further two measures were partially adopted by the government, while three measures were rejected. Let us examine the rejected measures first. Recommendations 11 and 12 relate to the inadequate consultation by government on this bill. Labor’s efforts to alert interested advocacy groups in the community and action to ensure the bill went to committee represented the only meaningful consultation, in our view, that occurred. I earlier outlined the failings of the government in its consultations, and perhaps enough has been said on that issue. Now that Labor and the committee have shouldered this burden, the measures are possibly redundant and it is frankly a little late in the piece for the government to start taking consultation in respect of this matter seriously.
Recommendation 8 relates to the inclusion of servile marriage in the bill. However, it was recognised that this may have been beyond the scope of the bill as its effect in relation to the Marriage Act was unclear. Labor also accept that this recommendation is a large one in its effect to be accommodated in this bill, but we reserve the right to investigate the matter further to determine whether an offence should be created for this type of conduct and, if so, by what methods and what means.
We now turn to the recommendations that were partially rejected. Recommendation 6 called for adoption of the actual wording in the definition of ‘exploitation’ and ‘trafficking in persons’ contained in the UN protocol on trafficking. The Attorney-General’s Department has offered advice that it is more appropriate to use terms and words in the definition that are already defined and clearly understood in Australian statutes and court-made law. Labor accedes to this advice.
The other recommendation that was partially rejected was the inclusion of non-commercial exploitation of adults. It has been put by the government that, while it may be undesirable, it is a question of whether this conduct should be made illegal or an offence should be created in relation to it. Labor think that this matter should be looked at a little further, but we do not want to hold up the bill due to the other important measures that this legislation will bring. For that recommendation, we think that more work can be done, given that non-commercial exploitation, particularly of children, will be criminalised with the adoption of this bill.
Let us now move to the recommendations of the committee that we support. I would like to run through some of those for the record: the removal of reference to consent under sections 271.2 and 271.5; the inclusion of elements of purpose of exploitation in sections 271.2 and 271.5; the removal of doubt that sections 271.2 and 271.5 contain; each means of trafficking to be listed, consistent with the definition of ‘trafficking in persons’ contained in article 3(a) of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the inclusion in section 270.7 of reference to deception in the quantum of any debt or purported debt owed or to be owed by the person; the inclusion of various express references to deception in sections 271.2 and 271.5; the inclusion of the element of a purpose of exploitation; the inclusion of non-commercial exploitation of children; the inclusion of offences of debt bondage; the definition of debt bondage in division 270; and the extension of part 1AD of the Crimes Act 1914 to offences against division 271.
These new measures all came from the committee process. In addition, the government has added new offences to cover instances of trafficking from Australia to other countries. This is a commonsense measure. The government has also increased the maximum sentence for trafficking in children from 20 to 25 years to bring it into line with slavery offences, and that is a worthy aim.
You can see from the outset that there has been significant movement concerning this bill and significant amendment has come from predominantly one source. The committee had the ability to look closely at the legislation and make significant recommendations which were then acted upon, accepted and reworked by the government to improve the outcome of this bill. Therefore, most of the concerns Labor had with the bill are now addressed.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today relating to the deportation of Ms Vivian Alvarez.
I think all of Australia was shocked and disturbed in February this year when we learnt of the case of Cornelia Rau, a woman who had been imprisoned and held without her family’s knowledge despite the fact she was an Australian permanent resident. She was treated as an illegal immigrant. She had serious mental health issues but she was held as a prisoner by her own government. I think we are even more concerned now that we have heard the story of Vivian Alvarez, an Australian citizen in poor health who was deported from her own country and dumped in a hospice in the Philippines. That is how her government sought to treat her.
These two cases are among a group of over 30 that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has agreed are cases where people—Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents—have been illegally detained. We have known of these cases since February. The concern of the community has been growing since that time. We have known of the case of Vivian Alvarez since 1 May. We also now know that the minister’s department knew of the case of this woman, knew of their illegal deportation of this Australian citizen, some two years ago and did nothing. There can be no more horrific story than the story of Vivian Alvarez. It comes on top of the horrific story of the treatment of Cornelia Rau.
All Australians, whatever their personal, political and religious views, are extremely disturbed that Australian residents and Australian citizens can be treated by their own government in this way. If you have a mental health issue, if you are unwell, if you do not speak English properly or if you are going through some sort of period of crisis in your life, any Australian citizen, it seems, could find themselves deported and dumped in a foreign country merely because it suited the policies of the minister’s department. I think we all accept that is not good enough. But we have known about this since the beginning of May—the minister has known about these issues since the beginning of May. She has done nothing to explain to the Australian public, to reassure the Australian public, that she is on top of this problem.
The Senate yesterday took the most serious step it could and moved to censure the minister. Minister Vanstone was censured by the Senate in its frustration at its inability to get the minister to front up to her responsibilities and explain to the Australian Senate, explain to the Australian people, how an Australian citizen could be treated in this most shocking way. But the minister refuses to come into this parliament and say how this could happen. She refuses to explain what happened, how it happened and what she has done to fix it. What else is the minister responsible for if she is not responsible for explaining to the Australian parliament what has occurred on her watch with her officers? We know that they illegally deported an Australian citizen and dumped her in a hospice. Surely that sort of serious issue deserves a full ministerial explanation from the minister responsible. But the minister, again, has left the Senate and refused to provide any explanation. She has had occasion after occasion in the parliament to explain herself and she refuses to do it.
She has not debated the issues that have been raised by all the other parties around this place. She refuses to give us a full explanation because it seems she wants to hide behind the excuse that the Palmer inquiry is looking into it. The minister has appointed Mr Palmer and therefore we need not worry because he is looking into it. Mr Palmer’s job is growing. The list of cases he has to inquire into grows by the day. And the seriousness of the cases grows by the day. But that does not excuse Senator Vanstone from providing an explanation of her responsibilities. It does not remove her accountability to this parliament and to the people of Australia. If this is what passes for accountability in the Howard government, then I think all Australian citizens will be very concerned. It is this sort of arrogance that is beginning to creep into this government. It sees it has no obligation to explain why and how it treated an Australian citizen in this way. I think we all have a real reason to be most concerned about our rights and how Australian citizens can be treated. We pay the minister $210,000 per year to take responsibility. The buck stops with her. She has given Mr Palmer a job, but her job is to explain to the Senate, to explain to the Australian people, what went wrong and what she has done to fix it. She will not have a royal commission but she also will not take responsibility herself. She must come into the parliament and explain. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-05-12,"—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is acting with great responsibility and accountability to the parliament. These cases have occurred. They have come to light. The minister is not pre-empting the outcome of any investigation. She has set up mechanisms to investigate the circumstances of both the cases Senator Evans has referred to. In due course, when the report of the Palmer inquiry is provided, the minister will be able to give specific details in answer to questions about how and why both these cases occurred. For Senator Evans and the ALP to claim that this minister, of all people, is acting in an irresponsible way is simply not sustainable. This minister has acted with great responsibility in recognising that there has been some sort of slip-up, a failure in the system, and having these cases investigated.
—Slip-up!
—It is surely not the wish of Senator Conroy, who is feigning great surprise at the word ‘slip-up’ and that a system has failed, to criticise this minister for setting up an investigation into how, where and why that systematic failure occurred. I wonder what Senator Conroy would do if he were the minister. Would he rush in here and come out with a whole range of shallow explanations without having first investigated the matters and obtained the facts about these cases? Surely, Senator Conroy, you cannot complain about a minister who, faced with a difficult situation, is not jumping in, making statements that she cannot sustain or offering explanations which are not based on fact but is setting up a mechanism to investigate the situations. In my view that is a very reasonable and proper course of action for a minister to take, and I think Senator Vanstone deserves to be recognised accordingly as a responsible minister.
Let us look at both of these cases. We can go back to the Rau case, where a woman with a psychotic illness deliberately absconded from a mental hospital, concealed her identity and claimed to be a citizen of another country. There was no reason to know who she was or that she was an Australian citizen. She had a reason to conceal her identity: she did not want to go back to the mental hospital that she had come from. We have to recall that she was probably on a medication which ameliorated her symptoms, so it was not obvious that she had a psychiatric problem when she was seen by the Queensland police and referred to a psychiatric institution in Brisbane. Under specialist examination there she was not found to have a psychiatric problem but it was considered she had a rather odd personality.
Being a psychiatric patient, Cornelia Rau was probably well aware of all of the kinds of questions doctors ask and she was very clever in not providing answers which would have alerted them to the fact that she had a psychotic illness. It was only much later down the track, when the medications she was on, I suspect, had worn off, that she began to exhibit frankly psychotic behaviour. I do not make any apology for the fact that she seems to have been in the Baxter detention centre exhibiting psychotic behaviour for quite a while before it was picked up. I do not apologise for that and I am sure the minister does not either. The minister is having it investigated and, when there is a full and proper report, the minister will report to the parliament—as she should as a minister of the Crown accountable to the people of Australia through the parliament. I am sure that process will also apply in the case of the more recent individual. This minister is responsible, she is discharging her duties well and she is accountable to this parliament.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,26,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Vanstone in relation to this shameful and humiliating case involving the deportation of Ms Vivian Young. This Australian government has kidnapped one of its own citizens and deported her overseas. Days, if not weeks, later, when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is aware of it, she will not come into this chamber, face the Australian public and give a detailed explanation of the facts. She does not mind going on radio and TV, where she can dodge and weave and not give the answers. She will drip a little bit out here and a little bit out there, but she will not come into this chamber and do her job, which is to face up to the fact that this is her department and her responsibility is to tell the truth to the Australian public in here.
You might have thought it was not so bad, except that this is not the first time Australian citizens or permanent residents have been detained by this government illegally. This latest disgraceful episode follows on from the distressing Cornelia Rau case and the government’s admission that it has wrongfully detained at least 33 people. That is right: 33 people have been wrongfully detained—one kidnapped and deported—under this government. Enough is enough. It is time for this minister to stand up and accept responsibility, deal with her department and make the changes that are necessary in this shocking state of affairs.
Ms Young, an Australian citizen born in the Philippines, was deported by the department in 2001, leaving behind a five-year-old son. On top of the 33 people being wrongfully detained and the case of Ms Young, a five-year-old was abandoned because the Australian government had kidnapped the mother—and the child has been in foster care ever since. He has spent four years in foster care because this government is so incompetent it does not know what its own department is doing.
Following a car accident, Ms Young gave officials her maiden name of Alvarez. Without making satisfactory inquiries, the department concluded that she was an illegal immigrant and pushed her onto a plane. It has been reported that, at the time of deportation, Australian immigration officials had to light her cigarettes for her as she could not use her hands because of the car accident. The deportation of an Australian citizen with a mental illness is bad enough, but this case gets worse. Since August 2003, the department has had reason to believe that it made a mistake.
—When?
—Since August 2003. But what steps did they take to find her? That is what we want to know. According to the Australian today—which broke the story, and it does deserve congratulations—this is what happened:
Due to the differing surnames, it was not until an immigration official saw the name Vivian Alvarez-Solon flash on the Nine Network’s Without A Trace two years later that the alarm was raised.
An Australian government department noticed the mistake because an official happened to be watching Without a Trace. This department is without a clue, and this minister is without shame.
Yesterday, following the public outcry over this case, it was revealed that Ms Young had been found living in a Philippines hospice for the destitute and dying. This appalling episode exposes a number of issues. What happened when Ms Young was approached and had it explained to her that she was the subject of an international search? What was her reaction? When Father Duffin—the priest looking after her—informed Ms Young on Sunday that Australian authorities were looking for her, she reacted by asking, ‘Will I go to prison?’ What have we reached when an Australian citizen is so terrified of government officials that she asks, ‘Will I go to prison?’ when we are trying to bring her back to the country—if she wants to come? Why is it apparently so easy for an Australian citizen to be detained and then deported by the department of immigration? In this case there was clearly a failure by the department to properly identify a missing person. The Rau case and all of these other cases being investigated by a secret inquiry—(Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-05-12,"—What we are hearing and seeing here today is a repeat of yesterday’s disgraceful behaviour by senators opposite with another diversionary tactic. This is another example of cheap politicking and political point scoring by senators opposite. It is the sort of disgraceful politicking and posturing that is occurring day after day in this place, in the other place across the way and in other, more open, public forums. There is a reason for this. The major reason is that senators opposite are trying to camouflage an abysmal lack of policy and an abysmal lack of any major contribution to public debate in the area of economic policy. In particular, they are trying to camouflage a lack of any reasonable response to the 2005-06 federal budget. More importantly, they are trying to take attention away from the decision announced by their leader, Kim Beazley, that they will not be supporting the tax cuts for low-income earners which are contained in the Howard-Costello 10th budget. That is what this sort of cheap politicking, day after day, is about. Yesterday it was Anzac Cove, today it is this case and I predict that when we debate the tax cuts in this place—after they are introduced in the lower house today—it will be the tax cuts. We will see just how relevant they are prepared to be in terms of what they are really trying to camouflage.
Let us get to the nub of this particular point. The contribution of Senator Conroy—who has now left the chamber—was forceful, but it was not valid. He kept talking not about the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs but about the department—that the department had slipped up. He kept talking about Ms Alvarez being worried about what departmental people would do. So it is not the minister that we are talking about here; we are talking about the department. A tragic mistake has been made in this case, and the minister said today—I heard her myself—‘It was a tragic mistake. We are sorry that it happened.’ It happened 21 months ago. It was a departmental lapse, and she acknowledges that. The opposition are demanding answers, so what do we do? As Senator Eggleston asked: ‘What do we do? Do we come in here and just give an answer without knowing the facts?’
What did the minister do? She referred the matter to the Palmer inquiry, and that is proper. What is wrong with referring the matter to the Palmer inquiry? It is an inquiry that is already established, so there is no expense or administration to go through. The inquiry is there; it is a timely referral. It is an expert inquiry. Nobody could doubt the integrity and the expertise that Mr Palmer brings to the table as the chair of that inquiry. Despite what members opposite say, it is an independent inquiry, and public pressure will make sure that the independence of that inquiry is sustained through the actions of Mr Palmer. So the matter has been referred to an expert committee. We on this side of the House are saying, ‘Let’s take the politics out of this issue. Let’s establish the facts. Let’s stop the point scoring and let the facts be established.’ At that point in time, the minister will come into the House and give the answers—assisted by the findings of the inquiry.
We have been hearing today another personal attack on one of this government’s most effective ministers. This minister is picked on in this place day after day, month after month and year after year. One of the reasons she is picked on is that she does have the answers. How often do members complain about her directness? How often do they complain about how explicit she is? How often do they complain about how up front and totally frank she is? Yet Senator Conroy comes in today and says that this is all about the department. Everything that Senator Conroy and other senators opposite have said about this issue clearly indicates some failure in terms of process at a departmental level. It is not Senator Vanstone who wanted to see the person in question deported to the Philippines and ending up in a hospice. We all thank God that she has been found alive and, hopefully, capable of recuperating totally and being resettled with her children. It is not Senator Vanstone’s fault that the children have been separated from their parents—specifically from the father, in this case. We have here another example of cheap point scoring. This side of the house have tried to depoliticise the issue. We have done the right thing by referring the issue to an expert, independent inquiry, and we are going to stick to that particular course of action. When we come into this place, we want to give proper, informed and truthful answers, and that is how it is going to stand until the Palmer inquiry concludes its business.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,26,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2005-05-12,"—As a former immigration minister, if I had deported an Australian citizen when I was minister, does anyone in this chamber believe that Senator Santoro would have remained silent? Absolutely not. His contribution today reminds me that he is almost a reincarnated Senator David Vigor. This particular individual was deported on Mr Ruddock’s watch—he was minister at the time. One of the things I want is to hear an explanation from Mr Ruddock as to why this happened on his watch. He was not too busy to do press on children overboard. He was not too busy to engage in dog-whistle politics. If he had been concentrating on the administration of his department rather than appealing to the lowest nature in the electorate during 2001, this event may never have happened.
The fact is we had 21 months of silence on this issue. The message comes in about kids overboard and you have a press conference within 44 minutes, and press statements. Within two days you have fake photos pulled out. There was big action then, but it takes 21 months for this news to get out that an Australian citizen has been deported. And within a couple of weeks of that occurring, guess what? She gets found not by the Federal Police, not by the immigration department and not by consular officials but by the very publicity. Thank heavens the Catholic priest was watching the television at that time or she still may not have been found. And if that publicity had occurred 21 months ago, that would have been 21 months less that she would have had to spend in a hospice for the dying—an Australian citizen!
Thirty-three people have been illegally detained! I lived months of my life over the ASIO legislation that allows ASIO to detain people for 168 hours. We put all those safeguards in, and in fact no-one has been detained yet. Yet we and this government ignore the fact that 33 people have been illegally detained. Why would we do that? Senator Santoro says: ‘We’ll leave it all to the Palmer inquiry.’ I am glad there is an inquiry going into all this, but we do not just leave it to an inquiry. We are elected to pursue these things. Scrutiny of government is an integral part of the Senate, which is not understood by the blowhards opposite. It is our duty as an opposition to pursue these matters.
I heard all the explanation on AM this morning; I do not hear it in here. I hear of the fake attack on the ABC this morning; I do not hear the facts being put down here. Why not? Because they are too unpalatable. I raised the question today: one of the real problems is the developing culture in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I do concede extenuating circumstances. They do have to put up with a lot of false information and false claims. But it is their duty to be able to discern the truth from the false claims—do not just dismiss every lawyer that contacts them as sleazy; do not just dismiss every social worker as marshmallow hearted.
—But they don’t do that.
—They do indeed, Senator Santoro. Of course they do! They were told about Ms Rau well before they acted upon it. They were told about these people and failed to act. And guess what? It does not matter what the result of the Palmer inquiry is; all of them will get their performance pay. That is the history of this government, every time in the past.
—How do you know?
—Because the major architect of children overboard in the Public Service got a Public Service Medal and then got promoted to department secretary—the great Anastasia of the Public Service, who, in giving evidence in the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, on 57 occasions had to answer: ‘I don’t know,’ ‘I don’t recall,’ et cetera. And what happens? You get promoted by being loyal to the government and covering up. Senator Santoro does not care about the deportation of an Australian citizen. The rest of us do. We do care, and we demand answers to it. We are not coming in here to cover it up. We are not coming in here because we have verbal diarrhoea like the senator opposite—he is known as ‘Santo the silent’ in this place—and putting outrageous claims in. The fact is the minister has to take responsibility and has never taken responsibility in the whole time she has been the minister.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,26,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-05-12,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
the need for a full judicial inquiry or a Royal Commission into the operation of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement under the Migration Act, given the wide range of reports and incidents which demonstrate major problems with the administration and operation of the immigration regime.
This is an urgent matter. It is a matter of great concern to many Australians, as we have just heard put forward quite forcefully and incisively by Senator Ray. I am not one who likes to jump out and call for royal commissions left, right and centre every time some controversy happens, but this is not just a matter of one or two extraordinary cases that somehow or other have slipped through the net; this is a matter of widespread problems in a key area of government administration.
Of real concern, as highlighted by Senator Ray, who speaks with some authority as a former immigration minister himself, is a culture within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs—fed and influenced very strongly, I might say, by this government’s attitude—which is leading to serious breakdowns in basic, decent administration; in proper decision making; in transparency; in accountability; in auditing; in due process; in duty of care, as we found last week with a court ruling in Adelaide; and in a basic fair go. All of that is being pushed remorselessly to one side because of the total obsession with enforcement, compliance, control and so-called border protection.
Now we have a case that, honestly, you could not make up. This case of the Australian citizen who was deported to the Philippines is so bizarre that it is hard to know what to say in response to it. It is just extraordinary. This case is not in the area of controversy that we have had so much of lately, to do with asylum seekers or refugees; it is a case of compliance and enforcement in the overall migration regime.
The motion that I have moved calls for an urgent royal commission, or judicial inquiry if people prefer—I think a royal commission in this context is the better way to go—and it justifies that on the basis of:
… the wide range of reports and incidents which demonstrate major problems with the administration and operation of the immigration regime.
When I talk about reports, I do not mean media reports, although there are certainly plenty of those. I am talking about comprehensive reports: parliamentary reports; Senate committee reports; Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reports; Ombudsman reports; independent community reports, such as the one released by the Edmund Rice Centre into people who have been deported to situations of danger; and reports by UN committees.
Reports have been done in detail that consistently identify major flaws at the heart of our migration system. Many of those flaws are built into the laws, I have to say, that this parliament and this Senate, to its shame, have passed. That is coupled with a mindset from this government that shuns openness, shuns any transparency and shuns any honesty about the whole process. That will inevitably, over a period of time, lead to major miscarriages of justice. ‘Miscarriage of justice’ is not just a quaint term; it means that people’s lives are being damaged, and damaged big time. Can you imagine what damage has been done to this woman who was deported to the Philippines and has been living for four years in a hospice for the dying, when the evidence is that she already had health issues to deal with? It hardly sounds conducive to positive health outcomes.
We do not need to imagine the damage that is being done to the children that are still in detention. There have been reports in recent times of the three-year-old girl who has spent virtually all her life in Villawood detention centre, banging her head against walls. People will remember the horrific Four Corners report from about two or three years ago featuring a young boy who had become incapable of speaking and had regressed because of the trauma of the detention experience.
And yet this government says, ‘Let’s wait and see what the facts are.’ The facts are there. The minister in question time today had the gall to complain about other people not telling the truth about this matter and giving false reports. This is a government that, as I said yesterday, sent a report to the UN committee that oversees the convention against torture, and in that report it acknowledged the human rights commission report into children in detention and it acknowledged its major findings: that children in immigration detention for long periods of time are at high risk of serious mental harm and that the Commonwealth has failed to implement the repeated recommendations of mental health professionals—these have been repeated time and time again; this is not out of nowhere; this is not stuff we do not know—that certain children be removed from the detention environment.
The failure to acknowledge and to implement those recommendations is a basic indication of the government’s obsession to put border control compliance over and above every other thing, including basic human decency. The human rights commission was of the opinion that the detention of children breached the Convention on the Rights of the Child. What did the government say? ‘No, it doesn’t. We disagree. We disagree with this comprehensive 500-page report with expert opinions from all sorts of people qualified in the area of child development.’ The government’s response was, ‘We disagree. We don’t believe that it causes serious mental harm.’ How much more evidence can you get of wilful blindness?
They use the excuse that placing children in immigration detention only occurs in conformity with the law. That could well be true. It probably is true, although there are certainly issues about whether they are breaching their legal obligation of duty of care, as they did according to the courts that ruled in Adelaide last week. But there is quite a high probability that Cornelia Rau was detained in conformity with the law. That can be challenged, but there is certainly an argument that can be made—and has been made already by the department, at Senate estimates—that it was in conformity with the law. Maybe this deportation of the Australian citizen was in conformity with the law because there was a reasonable suspicion under the act. What does that say? It says that the law is stupid and that the law should be changed. If people can simply say, ‘We’re following the law,’ and think that is an excuse for the blatant, disgraceful treatment of human beings, that shows that the law is wrong. But there is no acknowledgment of that.
As I mentioned yesterday, this government was also prepared to blatantly mislead the UN committee by giving the impression that there is only one child in mainland detention centres in Australia. It ignored the many other children who are in detention offshore, in places like Nauru and Christmas Island, and ignored children in detention who are not children of asylum seekers or boat arrivals. Currently there are 69 children in immigration detention, according to the ChilOut web site.
The reports are comprehensive. The incidents are extremely serious and extremely concerning. Mandatory detention has had a lot of focus. The reports and recommendations by members of all parties in this parliament seeking significant change have continually been ignored. The reports about deportation go well beyond just this individual case that has got coverage in the last few days. The problems with enforcement, including incredibly overzealous enforcement in relation to people who are suspected of illegally working, are also growing. I strongly support the detection of people working illegally or breaching the terms of their visas in Australia, but you do not do it by just sweeping up people on the basis of suspicion, locking them up and asking questions afterwards. That is the situation that is starting to develop because of this total obsession with compliance over and above all else.
I think the case for a royal commission is stronger in this area than in most others I can think of. That is not a criticism of Mr Palmer. His inquiry may well still be quite useful, but his inquiry is very narrow and it is very limited in its powers. These problems go much deeper and much wider than anything Mr Palmer can realistically touch. I look forward to the contribution Mr Palmer may still be able to make, but there is no way anybody can kid themselves that that inquiry is going to be sufficient to identify all the problems in such a fundamental area of government administration as the immigration department.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Detention</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,27,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-05-12,"—Senator Bartlett has just provided the Senate with an argument that is eloquent, as usual. I acknowledge his longstanding sincerity and, in this case, eloquent exposition in making the point that we do not need a royal commission to conduct an inquiry into mandatory detention. The policy of mandatory detention is bipartisan. It should not be forgotten that it was introduced by the Labor Party, with the support of the Liberal and the National parties in this parliament at that time, and it has been continued by this side of politics over the nine years in which the coalition has held office. There is, therefore, no issue that seems to require examination by the full weight of the law such as would be brought to bear by a royal commission.
The Democrats seek such an inquiry in much the same way, I suspect, as they seek political relevance in the post October 2004 electoral environment. I would respectfully suggest to the Senate that that is what this is, in fact, all about. It is about the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivien Alvarez. Neither of these cases is relevant to the policy of mandatory detention, I am sure both sides of this chamber would agree. Senator Bartlett’s motivation was clear from the text of the motion we are debating today—in particular, the bit that reads:
... given the wide range of reports and incidents which demonstrate major problems with the administration and operation of the immigration regime.
Senator Bartlett’s motion, as I am sure is clear to all senators, focuses on mandatory detention. But the real issues which are the concern of the Palmer inquiry relate to issues of compliance of Australia’s immigration laws, including detention but not, I stress, mandatory detention.
Despite the Democrats trying to make mandatory detention an issue, there are some matters of concern that the government has referred to the Palmer inquiry. The focus of the Palmer inquiry is on some cases that are not typical but that are, nevertheless, a cause for concern. The Cornelia Rau case was the first to raise these concerns. Then there was the case of Vivien Alvarez, which appears to raise similar issues. In addition, there are a number of other cases of people who have been in immigration detention and who have subsequently been found to be lawful and released from detention. These cases could also involve similar issues to those of the Rau and Alvarez cases. We need to understand what went wrong and how it can be fixed. To do that, of course, we must first establish the facts. That is indeed what Mr Palmer is doing, and he is doing it with the forensic skills he can bring to an investigation as a former police chief and also as a lawyer. We do need to put the cases he is investigating into perspective, however.
The fact is that the vast majority of detention cases are handled properly and correctly by DIMIA. That, again, cannot be denied. The cases in question represent a very small proportion, just 0.2 per cent, of the cases of suspected unlawful noncitizens that came to DIMIA’s attention in the close to three-year period between July 2002 and February 2005 that is the focus of attention. I repeat: the vast majority of these cases, in fact 99.8 per cent, were properly managed by DIMIA. It is true that, in a small number of cases, some individuals who were suspected unlawful noncitizens have subsequently been found to be lawfully in Australia and have therefore been released from detention. But this does not necessarily mean that they were mishandled by the department. The Palmer inquiry will determine whether these are causes for concern similar to the cases of Rau and Alvarez.
We must bear in mind that there are a number of reasons that could lead to lawful individuals being properly detained and properly released. These include people who held a visa and who were held for very short periods of time, often not even being transferred to a detention centre while their status was confirmed, and others whose status changed to ‘lawful’ due to court rulings or the operation of the law some time after they were detained. In some other cases, false information appears to have been provided because the person was involved in criminal proceedings or was attempting to frustrate removal efforts. In a small number of cases, for a variety of complex factors, including—and I stress this—mental health issues, the individual concerned identified themselves as a person other than who they actually are.
The Palmer inquiry is getting to the bottom of these cases. That is the proper way, as the minister has repeatedly said, including on ABC Radio National this morning, and as I mentioned during the previous debate earlier in this place. You leave it to the investigators, to the people professionally qualified to undertake administrative investigations. With great respect to the fourth estate, you very rarely find that you are assisting in getting to the bottom of something already being inquired into by having journalists, commentators and everyone else climbing over the issue, bit by bit. Mr Palmer is very well equipped to get to the bottom of the issues he is examining, and the result of his inquiries will be made public.
Let us give the professional people a chance to do their jobs. That is what this side of the Senate is saying. People can make a decision about whether they have confidence in the conclusions when they see them. It is fairly difficult to say you do not have confidence at a point where you have not seen what has been done. Calls for a judicial inquiry or a royal commission are based on two wrong arguments. One argument is that Mr Palmer cannot get to the facts about DIMIA. But the minister spoke to Mr Palmer on this point as recently as the day before yesterday. Senator Vanstone sought advice from him as to whether he was getting 100 per cent cooperation from the department. He assured her that he is. The other argument is that there is a wide range of incidents. As the minister quite properly has said publicly, even one incident is of great concern, and members on this side of the Senate have clearly stated that.
The minister has also said that it is important to keep the matter in perspective. That perspective is that, in the period of almost three years past, between nine and 10 million people arrived in Australia each year by air, about half of whom were temporary visa holders. That is about 26 million people in that period and about 13 million visa holders. The vast majority of these visa holders abide by the conditions of their visas, but some clearly do not. In the same period there were thousands of people who came to DIMIA’s attention as suspected unlawful noncitizens and, of those, only about 25 per cent spent any time in a detention centre. Of course there is a problem. We know that. We have seen the Rau and the Alvarez cases, which demonstrate very clearly that there is a problem.
One of the problems in this particular case—if I can become a little bit parochial—is the Queensland government. It may indeed be no coincidence that both of the cases Mr Palmer is investigating originated in Queensland where, as we know only too well, the Beattie Labor government is adept at party tricks but no good at delivering efficient services. The Beattie government is also very good at suggesting that the blame for any transgression lies elsewhere than within its own ranks.
Last Friday Mr Beattie called for a reinvention of the wheel in the matter of immigration controls and strayed into territory he should have stayed out of. The Alvarez family member who drew this issue to the minister’s attention said he was concerned that Mr Beattie was putting details of the case into the public arena unnecessarily. He was concerned that this would lead to a media frenzy which would impact on the family’s privacy. The minister’s office contacted Mr Beattie’s office. Mr Beattie’s office replied that details released would not allow further identification and lead to ongoing media coverage. Unfortunately and indeed inevitably this did not prove to be the case.
It is important to consider the background to these cases. While detention is mandatory for unlawful noncitizens, in 75 per cent of the cases that came to DIMIA’s attention in the July 2002 to February 2005 period, people were granted bridging visas and never entered detention. In relation to women and children, less than 20 per cent of women and only nine per cent of children who are unlawful noncitizens are detained. Unauthorised air and boat arrivals cannot be granted bridging visas. But it is this government which has introduced residential housing arrangements for women and children, and made considerable use of a range of alternative detention arrangements. It is this government which is introducing a new type of bridging visa, the removal pending bridging visa, to provide a mechanism to assist those people available for removal but whose removal cannot be arranged at this stage.
The management of immigration detention has been subject to multiple reviews and inquiries in the past few years. The Ombudsman and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have statutory roles of investigation and inquiry which they have used. DIMIA’s performance in this area has also been regularly scrutinised by the parliament, in particular by committees of the Senate. In addition, as honourable senators know very well, when cases of particular concern and complexity have arisen the government has set up independent inquiries. There was the Flood inquiry in 2000 and now there is the Palmer inquiry. I would respectfully suggest, Mr Deputy President, that Senator Bartlett and the Democrats have their own reasons for trying to stir up a political storm, but they are not very good reasons and they are completely unjustified.
Before concluding, I want to take the opportunity to make a few more remarks on the remarks made by Senator Ray during his contribution to this debate earlier this afternoon. He made two points that I particularly want to reply to. The first was that Phil Ruddock somehow let this incident go through on his watch. Senator Ludwig opposite, who I suspect will be speaking very shortly after me, heard evidence upon evidence at a recent inquiry that Senator Ludwig chaired that Phillip Ruddock was one of the hardest working ministers—particularly immigration ministers—in the history of this nation and that Minister Ruddock was hands on and nobody but absolutely nobody could accuse of him not being utterly meticulous in terms of attention to detail in his area of portfolio responsibility. So I do not think that we should lay any administrative blame on Minister Ruddock for this incident. The second point that Senator Ray made was that somehow I do not care about the case that we have been debating and are debating. I totally refute that. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-12,"—The interesting thing that Senator Santoro has raised is that we did not get the files under that committee; the government would not provide them. You know that and I know that, Mr Deputy President. The government would not provide the files, just like they are doing here, just like they are keeping all the files behind closed doors and just like Senator Vanstone, as we heard today, says, ‘I don’t have the files.’ Who has them? The Palmer inquiry seems to have them. I will have to go and get them from Mr Palmer. He must by this time have a truckload of files sitting on his table. That is the point: the way we are going to get to the bottom of this is through a royal commission. You know that, Senator Santoro; you know very well that that is the only way it is going to happen.
What we have before us, of course, is an urgency motion by Senator Bartlett. Let me be frank about this: it has been four years that this person, Ms Alvarez, has been an Australian citizen not on our shores—four years. The government left this person out in the cold. There is no doubt about that—left her out in the cold. Minister Vanstone has left in the Philippines a woman who is an Australian citizen. That is the simple fact of the matter. Whether Mr Ruddock was hardworking or whether, in this instance, on his watch, a mistake was made, it is now a matter of being accountable to the parliament. The way to do that is for Minister Vanstone to come down today with the files or a full explanation or both, and say, ‘This is what happened in relation to this matter.’ There is no other way except a royal commission.
What we can say about the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, is that, unlike Minister Vanstone and unlike this government, when it was reported, he threw open his doors and said, ‘I’ll have a royal commission. They can look at what they need to look at. I’ve got nothing to hide. I’ll keep my doors open and allow them the files and anything else that they require,’ because he realises the gravity of the situation. He understands the gravity of the circumstances faced by this poor woman.
We have heard for a long time now—since February this year—about Cornelia Rau, a mentally ill patient who was locked up in both gaol and the Baxter detention centre. When that scandal first broke, the government and the minister in particular gave this parliament the assurance that a full investigation would take place. Within days, as I have said before and as Senator Santoro knows, this full investigation turned into a session behind closed doors, where witnesses cannot be compelled to testify and where you have witnesses who are perhaps unable to give evidence under oath. There will be no ability to compel the production of documents and other items, video footage or anything else that might be able to assist. There is no protection of witnesses or their testimony and, of course, there is no protection from any legal action, such as defamation, that might arise. How public is that going to be at the end of the day?
We have heard the minister indicate that the recommendations of the Palmer inquiry will be made public, but what should be made public, through a royal commission, are the files and the witnesses being questioned, being examined, in detail about the circumstances of this matter. We are not going to get to the bottom of it any other way.
The opposition has little faith that the minister will ensure that all of the issues are fully canvassed and put forward. In keeping with the Westminster system, it is important to go back to that and say that in this instance the minister is required to be responsible for ensuring that all of these matters are kept accountable. The only way to do that is to ensure that the minister provides that information to parliament and is accountable to it.
In terms of the Palmer inquiry, I understand that an interim report was going to be put forward and advised in March. Nothing like that has turned up. No interim report has been received. The committee’s findings, whatever they might be, are to assist in understanding this issue. All we get are some additional terms of reference cobbled together by Mr McGauran, through I suspect Senator Vanstone, because some other cases—33 other cases—have come forward. There are no details of the terms of the inquiry other than those which were cobbled together and put out. That is clearly inadequate, because with any examination of this you would expect that more could come out or you would want to be assured that there was no more. That was the case at the last Senate estimates. The impression I was left with was that Rau was a rare and exceptional circumstance. It does not look like that anymore, I must say. The circumstances and events since then have convinced me that this is not as rare as they would like to say.
They use a statistic. I am ashamed that they use a 0.2 per cent statistic to try to justify their position. I think it is a shame that they would use a statistic in that manner to try and hide behind what is otherwise a pretty awful circumstance. What upsets me even more in this circumstance is the AAP media report entitled ‘Discussions with Alvarez underway: PM’, which says:
Clearly the circumstances of this case on the available information appear very sad and it would be a matter of sorrow and regret—
it goes on—
... that this lady—
it further goes on—
who appears to be an Australian citizen—has been deported.
It is a quote Mr Howard told parliament. I do not know why you would not say the name of this person is Ms Alvarez. I would not know why you would then say ‘who appears to be an Australian citizen’.
We have used the term ‘an Australian citizen’ in here. That is what she is, that is what she continues to be and she can come home if she wants. But it is language like that that makes you stop and think that this government is not particularly serious or warm-hearted at the end of the day about these matters. When you look at the terms of reference for the Rau matter and how they have been cobbled together for the other matters, it appears to me that justice is not being done.
We are appalled to hear that an Australian resident, Ms Alvarez, Mrs Alvarez, Ms Young or Ms Solon, has been illegally detained in the first instance—Senator Conroy calls it kidnapped—and then deported. How devastating would it be for anyone to find that they were being deported from the country they call home?
—What did they do with the children?
—The young children? They are sitting in foster care. They are paying the price for these ministers’ ineptitude. Their mother, an Australian citizen, was deported to the Philippines four years ago, as I have said, and we only heard last night—I heard it this morning—that the story had broken that at least she had been found.
The Herald Sun journalist, Michael McKenna, yesterday spoke to Vivian Alvarez, also known as Vivian Young or Vivian Solon, from the remote convent in Manila where we learned today she was placed by DIMIA representatives four years ago. Mr McKenna spoke to Mrs Alvarez before the government gave any indication that they had located her or, more to the point, that Australian media outlets had let the government know they had found her.
Ms Alvarez told Mr McKenna how she had been taken into custody after a car accident in northern New South Wales in 2001. She stated that she was afraid of being imprisoned if she returned to Australia. For the last four years she would have been unaware of the fate of her two young children. Isn’t that enough? You would expect it to be enough for this government to do more than what it is currently doing. She thought the children were being cared for in this instance by her former husband but, instead, she was upset to hear that they had been placed in foster care. She was also surprised to learn of the hunt by the government because she said it was in fact Australian authorities that had organised for her to stay at the Missionaries of Charity convent after her deportation.
We have heard some answers from Senator Vanstone in relation to some of those points, and I will go back and have a look at the transcript of what Senator Vanstone has said. What is more interesting sometimes, after you look at the transcript of what Senator Vanstone has said in here, is to also read the media comments about what she has said to Lateline or on radio. Although it appears that she will not provide any of the information here, the way we can piece some of this information together is not by the comments and the information she provides here but by the snippets that fall out of her during a radio interview, on Lateline or somewhere else, and it is not appropriate. If she has information that she can put together in a cogent, clear and concise way, it should be tabled here for the parliament to understand. I think it reflects badly on this government that they have not acted and that they have kept supporting Senator Vanstone in this way.
Yet what we find is the minister’s constant refusal to properly answer questions on this matter. It is really a case in which, in this instance, the government should ensure that Senator Vanstone does provide the answers. It appears of course that the Philippines office of Interpol some time ago said that it was asked by the department of immigration in 2004 to search for Ms Alvarez. Previously the government had said that it had only become aware that she had been deported a few weeks ago.
There are enough inconsistencies floating in the ether for the minister to correct the record and put the full account in place so that we know what the relationship with Interpol was and what actions were taken there, what the department of immigration did and did not do, whether they had any consular arrangements in place when they deported her and what the arrangements were, who escorted her to what plane and where that plane went, what arrangements were made after Ms Alvarez landed in the Philippines, whether they had any ongoing contact or whether anything went on that could have brought to their attention the fact that she was an Australian citizen. There is a report that the department knew some time ago that she was an Australian citizen. What actions were taken? What did the department’s officials do, and where did the issue go after that? There is a range of unanswered questions that should be answered today by the minister.
What we find, however, is that according to the reports that you can piece together it is a matter that I—and I think Labor—think has gone beyond the Palmer inquiry stage. A royal commission is now really necessary, because all those matters could have been brought forward, could have been discussed and could have been used in parliament to keep the minister and the government accountable, but the government has refused. The government should not continue to hide behind the smokescreen of the Palmer inquiry.
If you go through the media commentary in relation to Ms Alvarez, you find that it paints a very sad story. Mike Duffin, the friar across the road from the convent, commented that he did not want to call the department—and this is my word—misleading. But look at the phrase he used. He said:
If the Government says they don’t know where she is, it’s a bit hard to believe.
He went on:
Who says they’re actually trying to track her down?
He was ‘highly sceptical’ about the government’s efforts to find Ms Young, as he knew her. If you put those in context, you come to the conclusion that it is a department that had the resources to do what it could, but instead it detained Ms Young— (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-05-12,"—I think we have to get all this into perspective. In the debate to take note of answers, the point was made that an inquiry—the Palmer inquiry—is being held into these matters. The minister is acting responsibly and with proper accountability to the parliament. This motion calling for a royal commission grossly overstates the level of inquiry necessary into this matter. A royal commission is not needed—there is an inquiry going on into what is happening in terms of detention—
—How do you know? Have you seen the evidence?
—Let us wait and see what the Palmer inquiry comes up with. That is the process. Let us give the process an opportunity to work before we jump on the bandwagon of demanding bigger inquiries such as royal commissions. Let us let the Palmer inquiry complete its task and let us find out what the facts are. If indeed at the end of the Palmer inquiry people are not satisfied with the findings or think there are problems then certainly perhaps a further inquiry can be considered. But I think the ALP is being somewhat histrionic today, as are the Democrats, in demanding a royal commission into this matter when in fact there will be a perfectly reasonable process in train to look into the questions associated with mandatory detention.
The motion before the Senate says that, in the opinion of the Senate, there is a need for a full judicial inquiry or royal commission into the operation of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement under the Migration Act. Why do we have mandatory detention? As it happens, I was a member of the Port Hedland Town Council in 1992 when the then ALP Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Gerry Hand, came to the council with a proposal that the Cooke Point single persons quarters, which were quarters for single people working for the Mount Newman iron ore operation, should be used as a reception centre for Cambodian boat people. In other words, it was the ALP which established this policy of detaining people who arrived on our shores without going through the usual procedures of coming as refugees or going through the vetting which we apply to people coming through the migration stream.
A reception centre was set up in Port Hedland. It was set up because the Cambodian boat people, who were the focus of its purpose at that time, had not been through the usual vetting processes that we use for people coming to Australia. People coming into Australia are vetted for health issues as well as other issues such as criminal records or association with terrorist organisations or other undesirable groups like that. In fact, many of the Cambodian people who came to Australia and the Port Hedland detention centre were found to have TB, which is a disease which had long been eradicated in Australia. Bringing them into the reception centre and putting them through the process of assessment was quite justified because, as I have said, a public health problem of considerable magnitude was identified—that is, that many of them had TB. Of course, we could also look into the other aspects of their records which needed to be assessed, such as criminal records, political associations and so on and so forth.
From 1992, the volume of people coming in boats to Australia—off the north-west coast in particular—grew substantially. The role of the Port Hedland detention centre grew as well, because they were mostly taken there. But the nature and origin of the people changed. Instead of Cambodian boat people, they were people from the Middle East—and one has to bear in mind that in the Middle East politics is often decided not by debate but by violent methods and who has more guns. It was possible that these people coming in from the Middle East had records of political violence or criminal records and it was quite important that they be checked out.
So there are valid reasons for our system of mandatory detention, and I must say it is the envy of other countries. I remember going through Florida airport once, and talking to the immigration service there. They thought our system was brilliant because it meant that people could be held and assessed. In Canada, for example, refugees were brought into Canada and not held at all but let go into the community. Most of them, the Americans told me, disappeared over the border and into the United States—never to be found again. They said at that time, which was prior to 9-11, that they could represent a risk to the United States. We found out through 9-11 that they could indeed. There are good, valid reasons for having a system of detention centres, and many other countries, including Britain, are now considering adopting a system such as ours.
This motion refers to the question of deportation and enforcement. People are only deported if they fail the system of assessment. It has to be said that almost all of the people coming in who are genuine refugees are processed in six to 12 weeks. That means that anybody who is a genuine refugee is through these centres, at the outside, in 12 weeks. The people who remain are either people who are appealing a failed assessment against the UN criteria—and Australia is alone in the world in providing these people with five levels of appeal and funding their legal representation at all of these appeals, to the extent that the High Court is now clogged with immigration cases—or people who have destroyed their documents. There is always a good reason for people concealing their identity: they are criminals, they are not who they say they are or they come from some other place than where they claim to have come from.
In general terms—having inspected all these detention centres as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration—I found the conditions in the centres were not Hilton hotel standards, as a report we put out said, but they were adequate, especially in Port Hedland. Considering that the SPQ was designed for the good unionists of the Pilbara, the conditions were pretty good. I do not think we have anything to be ashamed about. Occasionally, obviously, there have been problems—but I do not think we should throw out the baby with the bathwater. I am sure the Palmer inquiry will give a fair and accurate assessment of this issue. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-05-12,"—The Australian Greens support this motion to set up a royal commission into mandatory detention. The scandalous and inhumane treatment of Cornelia Rau, and other constant stories of cruelty behind the razor wires of this government’s detention centres, should have been enough to instigate a royal commission. Indeed, the Greens called for one on 7 February this year. Now we have the case of Vivian Solon, an Australian citizen who has been deported to the Philippines and left living for four years in a hospice for the dying, while her children were in foster care in Australia, wondering why their mother had disappeared. This is an appalling and tragic story of utter incompetence by the government and the department of immigration. But it is more than just incompetence; it is an abuse of the power vested in the minister and the department that is damaging innocent people and ruining their lives. The facts of Miss Solon’s case, which the minister tries to pass off to the Palmer inquiry and deny, demand a royal commission be established to investigate how such abuse and incompetence could happen, and to ensure that it does not happen again.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs today tried to defend Minister Vanstone’s handling of the scandal by saying that Senator Vanstone is ‘a good and feisty woman doing a good job and defending her corner’. The government clearly does not get it. This is not a boxing match; it is not about defending the government’s corner—or the department; and it is not about political spin. Lives are being ruined by this government’s actions. A public, judicial inquiry with the powers to compel and protect witness, and that can gain access to all relevant documents, is needed. Everyone but the government now realises that a royal commission is needed. If the department of immigration can deport an Australian citizen, discover their mistake two years later and do nothing about it, what kind of confidence can we have in the operations of the department? How can we allow such an incompetent department to have the power to detain people, sometimes for years, without judicial review? How can we be confident that they can accurately determine who is a refugee and who is not? And how can we be confident that they are not deporting other people to danger?
There must be a royal commission if the public is to have confidence in the department of immigration and this government. Last night, the Senate supported the Greens’ censure motion against Minister Vanstone. The minister and the government should heed this censure as a warning that the Australian public will not tolerate any more excuses. The Australian Greens support the establishment of a royal commission and an end to the policy of mandatory detention.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Detention</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,27,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I also rise to speak on this urgency motion, presented to the Senate by Senator Bartlett, calling for a full judicial inquiry or a royal commission into the operation of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement under the Migration Act, given the wide range of reports and incidents which demonstrate major problems with the administration and operation of the immigration regime. In the past few weeks—and certainly last time when we were here in the Senate—we have had before us the disgraceful circumstances that surrounded the treatment of Ms Cornelia Rau. As we return to the Senate this week, we have before us yet another tragic case of a woman who, as an Australian citizen, was wrongfully deported to the Philippines. This growing number of cases of Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been wrongfully detained by DIMIA is nothing short of disgraceful. So far, the government has admitted that at least 33 people have been wrongfully detained over a seven-month period. If you were to extend that seven-month time frame to the last three years, the number could be in excess of 100. This is one of the disturbing parts of this—we just do not know how many people are involved, and to date we only know the identities of two people who have been so disgracefully treated by this government. Despite this, Senator Vanstone and the government have dug in and refused to alter the closed door inquiry into the Cornelia Rau affair—that is, the Palmer inquiry that was established a few months ago.
We are not the only ones calling for a royal commission. A large number of people have joined that call, including refugee advocates and the human rights watchdog, Sev Ozdowski. Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has also weighed into this debate and lent his support to the calls for a royal commission. The government’s response to this growing number of cases was simply to announce an extension to the closed door Palmer inquiry. A few days ago our immigration spokesperson, Mr Ferguson, said that there is now clearly a need for a full judicial public inquiry—and this of course is the subject matter of the motion before us today.
At the time when Ms Rau’s tragic circumstances were revealed it was said that this was an exceptional case, a rare case, and therefore it justified the setting up of the Palmer inquiry to look into this one matter. As we said at the time, the terms of the inquiry are inadequate—it is a closed door inquiry, it is being conducted away from public scrutiny and it does not have the powers required to get all of the facts surrounding this case. The inquiry was originally due to report on 24 March but, as we have now seen, the inquiry has been extended for some months. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction surrounding this inquiry, not only for the reasons that we highlighted a few months ago but also because of the number of cases that are now apparently going to be dealt with by Mr Palmer in the course of the inquiry. One must ask: just how long is it going to take to consider all of these cases that appear to be coming to light? How long will this inquiry drag on behind closed doors? How will we have any way of independently scrutinising the work of the inquiry or assessing the evidence that will be before it?
On this point it becomes apparent that Mr Palmer’s role itself is now on shaky ground, because it seems that everybody except the government recognises that the job before him now requires powers to investigate—the sorts of powers that really can be only exercised by a royal commission. A few months ago, the minister, Senator Vanstone, threw together the terms of reference for a closed inquiry just in an effort to try to protect the government at a very embarrassing time for them. Now I think it is time that they realise that this Palmer inquiry is inadequate to deal with the latest revelations. It is for this reason that we and the Democrats and others are calling for a royal commission.
On a broader note, this disgraceful set of circumstances really raises the question of ministerial responsibility in the context of Senator Vanstone’s behaviour surrounding these matters. As we heard in the Senate today, and have heard for the last few days, the minister simply fails to provide any sort of explanation as to how the circumstances surrounding Ms Alvarez could possibly have come about. We have had no explanation as to why the minister’s department could not recall what it had done and when in relation to Ms Alvarez. There are many questions that remained unanswered, and the minister just says to us that we have to wait for the Palmer inquiry to investigate these matters and then all the facts will come to light. This is simply inadequate.
I would have thought that the sorts of questions that have been raised in the Senate today are questions that should be answered by a minister—if she has control of her portfolio and the activities of her department. This is an exceptional case. We are not talking here about a refugee or a person who came into this country illegally. We are talking about an Australian citizen with two children who was illegally separated from her children, processed by DIMIA and then deported from Australia to a foreign country—the Philippines. And what response have we had from the minister? All we have had from her is silence. We have not had any explanations. No reasons have been provided. There has been no attempt to inform Australians about what happened to one of our own. All we have had from the minister is silence. This silence is, of course, intended to stifle any debate, to deflect any responsibility from her and to delay and defer the matter.
In the chamber yesterday the government twice attempted to block debate on these matters, and the minister refused to even enter into the debate. We have to ask ourselves: what is being hidden here? What is the government trying to cover up? What is it worried about? All we have from the government and the minister is silence. All we are told is that the secret Palmer inquiry will investigate the circumstances surrounding the illegal deportation of Ms Alvarez, or Ms Solon, an Australian citizen. In these circumstances, how can we possibly have any confidence in what the minister and her department have been doing? If this is an example of the way they operate when these sorts of tragic circumstances are revealed then we have to ask ourselves: what is happening the rest of the time? What else is being covered up? Why is the minister not giving a full and frank account to the Senate as to what occurred in these circumstances? Where is ministerial responsibility? Why has the minister not taken full responsibility for the actions of her department in this case?
All we have had from the minister are silence and inaction. All she has done is set up the secret inquiry. All she is doing is continuing to refer cases that are too hard to the Palmer inquiry. That is just not good enough. It is the minister who is responsible, not Mr Palmer. Senator Vanstone has effectively reneged on her ministerial responsibilities. She has failed to restore public confidence in the actions of her department. She is just sitting there, waiting for the report of the Palmer inquiry, which of course could be months and months away. This does not restore any confidence at all in our immigration process. What we see is a minister who is out of her depth. Waiting and hoping will not change what is going wrong with her department. The time has come for there to be a royal commission into this matter. There needs to be a full inquiry into the two matters, the Rau case and the Alvarez case, and into mandatory detention this country. (Time expired)

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2005-05-12,"—I rise to speak on the urgency motion on mandatory detention moved by Senator Andrew Bartlett. I shall pose a question to those people who support this urgency motion for a full judicial inquiry or royal commission into the operation of mandatory sentencing. As I recall, the mandatory sentencing bill was introduced into the Senate in 1992 and passed with bipartisan support—definitely with the support of the then opposition, the coalition government of today. It was introduced and became operational in 1994.
It became very apparent to all health organisations, and particularly the World Health Organisation, under the umbrella of the United Nations, that some kind of mandatory sentencing of illegal immigrants was needed for several reasons but particularly for health reasons. One wonders what would happen if governments did not have the power to hold in detention those people who are or could be suffering from HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or the Ebola virus. What might happen if governments did not have the power to detain those people who might have a criminal record or those people whose documents clearly suggest they are not from the country of origin that they say they are from? Imagine the chaos, just in the health area, if there were no mandatory sentencing.
What does Senator Bartlett want to do? Does he want to abolish mandatory sentencing? It appears he does. I admit that tragic mistakes have been made with Ms Alvarez, who is currently in the Philippines and was wrongly deported, and Ms Rau, who was imprisoned originally in Queensland for some time before she was assessed, wrongly, as being an illegal immigrant. What of the report coming down from the highly respected former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mr Palmer, who is to investigate those problems? Why is it that Senator Bartlett, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, wants to pre-empt the investigation by former AFP Commissioner Palmer? There are 27 million refugees in the world today, most of whom would like to come to Australia. There are seven million more refugees in the world than the entire population of Australia. If we did not have an obligatory detention program in Australia there would be chaos, not just in health but also in trying to find people in Australia illegally. That is not only difficult—
 (Senator Watson)—Order! The time for the debate has expired.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-05-12,"—I seek leave to incorporate the speech by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Kim Beazley.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

Our great country is about to enter the second decade of conservative rule. History will mark 1996 to 2006 as the Liberal/National Government’s decade of deception. Year after year of lowering the ‘truth’ bar then deliberately crawling under it.
With one common theme—the Government deceives, and Australians pay. But this year we’ve learned why this Government has been so deceitful. We uncover their motive with each new economic indicator: With one of the highest foreign debt levels in the world; with a record current account deficit; with household debt rising and rising.
And with the tragedy of a Government that turns away tens of thousands of Australians from TAFE colleges whilst the Treasurer makes a virtue in his Budget speech of importing skills from overseas to make up for the difference.
Sadly we’re learning the truth. They’ve squandered this chance to make Australia secure for our children and grandchildren. They have surfed a wave of prosperity but left the tough decisions to future generations.
When we hoped they’d get better, they got worse. Tuesday’s budget centrepiece is an injustice of the highest order. Instead of leading Australia through reforms the OECD and Reserve Bank tell us we have to have.
Instead of preparing Australia for the next phase of growth by investing in training Australians and in infrastructure like roads, rail, water and ports—and in tax reform which encourages people into the Australian workforce. Instead the budget savaged the weakest in our society.
And contemptuously dismissed those nurses, teachers, tradesmen, labourers—the people raising our families—the 80 per cent of our taxpayers—the engine room of Australia. They received no tax cuts last year or this year. And in the next three, they get a derisory $6 a week. Nothing to encourage those out of the workforce into it—but for a minority, a tax cut which for the first time in my memory takes those of us in this: Parliament out of the top tax bracket with 10 times the reward of our fellow Australians. If you think anyone here of Labor principle would vote ourselves a $65 weekly tax cut when the people who put us here get $6—you’ve got another thing coming.
Its not leadership to cheer this through.
Leadership means you stand up and fight. That’s what we’ll do. I do so in the context of a budget of lost opportunity. It comes at a time when Australia is enjoying its highest export prices since Don Bradman retired from captaining Australia half a century ago. The minerals boom that underpins our economy has nothing to do with the policies of this government. Good fortune has added $40 billion per year to our national income. That’s equivalent to a $7,000 bonus for every Australian family, every year. But a responsible leader looks out to the horizon, sizes up future threats to the nation, and prepares it for risks.
Before the Budget, the question for Australia was, what would we do with this singular opportunity? Would we invest it in something that lasts? Would we take this extraordinary opportunity to repair what is broken in our nation? This is a question of our values. What and who would come first in our Australia?
This Budget has failed the Australian people because it fails to act upon urgent challenges facing the nation:
It does nothing new to ease our chronic skill shortage
It does nothing new to fix our roads and ports
It does nothing new to support research and development
It does nothing new to support our universities
It does nothing new to solve the water crisis
It does nothing new to lift our exports

Fairer tax reforms

But before I get on to those matters I want to deal with the first order of business: taxation. Tonight I am drawing a line in the sand with John Howard: on Australian values and the sort of country we want to be. A line between John Howard’s Government—which says someone earning $500,000 a year deserves ten times the tax cut of an Australian earning $50,000 a year.
A lot of Australians think John Howard’s tax plan is terribly unfair.
I will expose it for what it is, and oppose it for what it is.
I will not accept criticism from a greedy government—for standing up for the 7 million Australian taxpayers who were tossed the tax cut scraps from the tax cut feast enjoyed by so few Australians.
The Labor Party will be the last line of defence between John Howard and his desire to divide the Australian community.
The Treasurer got a big cheer from the Liberal Party backbench on Tuesday night when he announced a whopping big tax cut on their super. And he got a huge cheer when he announced that these same politicians would be exempt from the top income tax rate. He was offering them a massive tax cut. Here was the Treasurer using the nation’s public finances to gain the support of his colleagues for a tilt at the leadership.
It makes no sense to skew tax cuts towards those who have already enjoyed the greatest gains from our recent prosperity.
Tonight, I will set out a tax plan that takes the Government’s proposed tax changes, and turns them into genuine reform of the tax system, that delivers benefits across the income tax scales with fairness.
The Government should raise the threshold where the 30c rate cuts in from $21,600 to $26,400. It should implement a welfare to work bonus that would provide an effective $10,000 tax free threshold for people earning up to $20,000 per year.
It should avoid delivering any fiscal stimulus while the economy stays in the red zone of a potential interest rate rise in the second half of 2005. There is simply no benefit in giving families a $6 a week tax cut if that tips the Reserve Bank over the edge into raising interest rates. After all, one interest rate increase will raise monthly mortgage repayments for a $300,000 mortgage by $48—almost twice the size of the $6 weekly tax cut.
These changes should take effect from 1 January 2006.
In addition, from 1 July 2006 the Government should:
Raise the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000, and
Raise the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000.
This package would deliver a tax cut of up to $9 for those earning up to $25,000—double what the Government is offering.
It would deliver a $12 tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $70,000—double what the Government is offering.
It would preserve the Government’s tax cut for people earning from $70,000 up to $105,000. We recognise that people on around $80,000 aren’t rich, but politicians on $105,000 and over are doing alright. This package would deliver $40 to people who earn $105,000 and above—one third less than what the Government is offering, a much fairer outcome.
A worker or single income family on average weekly earnings will over the next four years gain $1248 in tax cuts from the Government.
How much from Labor’s plan?—$2,184 in tax cuts. About $936 dollars more under Labor for middle Australia.
A dual income family on $85,000 will over the next four years gain $2,496 from the Government.
How much from Labor’s plan? $4368 in tax cuts. About $1872 under Labor for middle Australian families.
Now I say to those in Government: You have a choice. Make yourselves richer, or make 7 million Australians who put you here richer. This whole proposal could be delivered for around the same cost as the $24.1 billion cost of the Government’s changes over the budget period.

Welfare reform

This Budget’s welfare changes were touted as a significant reform that would raise workforce participation rates and assist people to transfer from welfare to work. But the Government’s approach to welfare reform does little to increase welfare recipients’ capacity to work, and nothing to encourage employers to take them on.
Instead of seizing the opportunity to bring these Australians into the productive economy, it shifts them from one welfare payment to another. Let’s put this in perspective. We are actually talking about people who, typically, live with poor vision or hearing; possibly suffer from episodic mental illness or endure chronic physical pain.
These are some of the most disadvantaged Australians. They are not a breed apart, a separate species. They are our neighbours, our sisters, our parents and our friends. A genuine effort to help get them into paid work involves taking practical steps to make it easier for employers to hire people with disabilities.
Welfare recipients often require training, and are not job ready. The lack of affordable childcare is also a major barrier to them working. The Government is offering only small childcare and training measures in this Budget that don’t do enough to address the real challenges of getting these Australians into lasting work.
In practical terms, the main impact of the package is to shift disability support pensioners and sole parents onto the dole, where the Government will save up to $77 per fortnight.
Once again, the Government has taken the low road, the easy path.

The 2005 Budget: A squandered opportunity

I have dealt with disincentive to work in our tax and welfare systems, by proposing a genuine tax reform plan. But to secure our prosperity we need to lift Australia’s capacity for the next phase of growth.
Commentators agree this Budget fails to do that work. The ANZ Bank has said “it could not be said that this is a great reforming budget”. It is “light on spending to relieve infrastructure constraints”, and “there is now an increased risk that rates will be lifted again”.
The Budget should have seized an historic opportunity to invest in Australia’s future, and confront the long term threats to the economy. What Australia’s economic commentators are urging from this government is national leadership on infrastructure.
That means investing in our economy’s growth capacity—building a highly-skilled workforce and an advanced, competitive economy. Australia’s greatest asset is not in its mines, its stockmarkets or its buildings. It’s our people: hardworking Australians. And nothing gives us better prospects for long term productivity and prosperity than investing in working Australians.
We also need to keep the nation’s infrastructure in good repair. Our transport and communications networks must be up to scratch so that Australian businesses can seize opportunities for growth and investment.
We must also address enormous challenges in other parts of the national infrastructure: the crisis in our inland rivers; rising salinity problems in our soil, and gaps in our energy infrastructure. And we need a modern industry agenda that embraces the potential for innovation, business investment and growth from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, encouraging clean energy and cutting greenhouse emissions.
We also need a broad program of reform to rebuild our international competitiveness. We need to strengthen our national competition laws. We need, once and for all, to resolve the bickering between Commonwealth and State governments, to improve efficiency and reduce duplication. We need to relieve the burden of regulation on small business and we need to simplify the mind-numbing complexity of our tax system.
Australia needs a government that is up to the reform challenge: that can lift the hood on the economy, get stuck in and fix things up. Just as the reformist Hawke and Keating governments did in the 1980s and 1990s—after inheriting a weak, uncompetitive economy from the Fraser/Howard Government in 1983.

The Howard Government: Tinkering, not delivering

The Howard Government has talked for nine long years about reform, and it’s held scores of inquiries and published dozens of reports about reform.
But its record of action has never matched up to its rhetoric.
It’s a government that tinkers on the edges of reform. It walks around and kicks the tyres, but it doesn’t lift the hood and get its hands dirty with real reform.
Look at the record.
Who remembers now the great savings rebate of the 1997 Budget? Mr Costello said that it would increase savings, reduce our reliance on foreign debt and raise the speed limits to growth. Six weeks after it commenced they scrapped it! And since then, the household savings ratio has plummeted to below zero, and foreign debt is astronomical. And this week’s Budget quietly announced a permanent downgrade to Australia’s future growth prospects.
Who remembers the great crackdown on top end tax avoidance that was promised alongside the GST in 1999? Mr Costello claimed that it would clean out the rorts. Labor supported the cuts in corporate tax and capital gains tax, on the basis of Mr Costello’s undertakings to deliver those reforms in full.
Mr Costello even signed a piece of paper saying he’d deliver them in full.
But his signature on that paper was worth nothing. Who remembers Mr Howard’s flamboyant promise in 1996 to “cut red tape for small businesses by 50 per cent”?
There was a review. A report. A big launch. A blaze of publicity.
But instead of getting relief from compliance burdens, small businesses found they had to become tax collectors for the government when the GST and the Business Activity Statement were introduced.
And this year small businesses are burdened with another heavy load: the red tape nightmare of superannuation choice. Once again the government decided that all the paperwork would land on the desk of the small business owner. Worse still, the government’s legislation actually imposes a jail term of up to 2 years on small business owners who answer an employee’s question about the super funds they might choose.
This Treasurer has form. He brings in the brass band to trumpet his big solutions. But when you look back on his legacy, you realise he’s little more than a clanging cymbal; a hollow drum; a loud percussive nothing.

The Government is not up to the reform challenge

The problem for Liberal Party politicians is that the actions most needed to address our economic challenges don’t fit their ideological prejudices. Instead of questioning their own prejudices, and putting them to one side, they deny the problems.
They cannot accept that there are substantive economic reforms that require real leadership from the public sector. But the big wave of economic reforms that shifted Australia from an over-regulated, insulated economy to an open market economy are already in place.
We do not have to relive the 1980s and 1990s.
The next wave of productivity growth is not going to come from the kinds of one-off reforms made in the 1980s and 1990s. The next wave of productivity growth will come from our long term investments—in our workforce and in our infrastructure.
Today’s challenges therefore call for active public sector involvement.
Just as Labor abandoned its prejudices in pursuit of reforms like tax and labour market reforms in the 1980s, now the Liberal Party needs to break out of its ideological straitjacket and start putting Australia first.
In those days, the nation’s economy required a historic shift to integrate Australia with the world economy, phase out protectionism, overhaul the tax system, create a modern productivity-based system of workplace agreements, and scale back regulation.
We put those reforms in place.
They weren’t popular, and the Liberal Party opposed many of them. They opposed intergenerational reforms like introducing an assets test on pensions. They opposed compulsory national superannuation, the greatest single step to build retirement income security for all Australians. They opposed tax reforms that restored fairness and equity, even our efforts to end those long boozy business lunches that executives enjoyed at taxpayers’ expense.
They were lazy on reform then, and they are lazy on reform now.
In place of dispassionate reform that develops far-sighted solutions to our economic problems, what we get is silly ideological indulgences, like Brendan Nelson’s Voluntary Student Unionism.
In the long term, Australia won’t be able to escape the effects of this Government’s wilful neglect. We need a government that gives priority to the long term over the short term. It means the government putting the nation’s interest ahead of its own political interest.
Now I believe that government has a responsibility to invest in the wealth-generating machinery of the economy. We need specific, immediate action to address the long term erosion of workforce skills and infrastructure.

Skills

Rebuilding the nation’s skills is an immediate and urgent need for our economy.
The Government’s only initiative on skills this year is an increase in skilled migration—an extra 20,000 skilled migrants in this Budget. Meanwhile, the Government is turning away almost 40,000 Australians from TAFE each year.
Since 1997, the Government has turned 270,000 people away from TAFE colleges, while bringing in 180,000 skilled workers.
Labor’s priority is different: train Australians first and train Australians now.

Trade Completion Bonus

The Government should move immediately to address the national skills crisis.
I would start with the appalling dropout rate in apprenticeships.
Currently, 40 per cent of people in New Apprenticeships drop out before completing their training.
We need more tradesmen and women, and less apprentice dropouts. The Government should move immediately to introduce a $2,000 Trade Completion Bonus for traditional apprentices who complete their training.
The first $1,000 would be paid half way through their apprenticeship, and the second at its end. This would immediately encourage more Australians to complete their training in areas of critical skill shortages—instead of forcing businesses to wait until 2010 for the first qualified apprentice to emerge from the Howard Government’s technical colleges.

Trade Apprenticeship School Incentive Scheme

The second step the Government should take immediately is to dramatically increase the number of school based apprenticeships in traditional trades. Last year, just 11,400 school students commenced apprenticeships—70 per cent of these were not even in areas of skill shortage.
We could make a real dent in the skills crisis by allocating an additional 4,000 training places in our schools for Year 11 and 12 students—that’s 2,000 at each level. We also need to give schools extra support to participate in this scheme.
I would provide a 50 per cent ‘skill shortage loading’ for school based trade apprenticeships. This additional funding of $1,750 per student apprentice would help schools build their capacity to offer the school based apprenticeships, such as by creating links with local employers.
This approach reflects a difference in values between the Prime Minister and me. I think it’s irresponsible for the Prime Minister to tell young Australians to drop out of school. Unlike the Prime Minister, I understand the difference between low paid, casual, and part-time work, and a real skill and a real career.
Young people who leave school early are twice as likely to become unemployed as people who finish Year 12. And employers want their apprentices to finish school so they have broad-based skills to make them better equipped for working life.

Infrastructure

The third major reform challenge that requires immediate action is the repair of our nation’s infrastructure. Organisations like the OECD and the Reserve Bank have called for national leadership and have identified this as the missing factor in the development of Australia’s public and private infrastructure.
If I was Prime Minister tonight, I would provide clear national leadership on infrastructure planning. I would marshal the expert advice on the extent of infrastructure problems, how to fix them, and how we plan for the roads, railways, ports, and communications networks of the future.
Mr Howard behaves as though we don’t need action, just talk. In the past year alone, the Government has commissioned eight separate and sporadic and ad hoc infrastructure inquiries.
That is why Labor would set up a national infrastructure council to be known as Infrastructure Australia.
With input and representation from the private and public sectors, Infrastructure Australia would provide ongoing advice to all Australian governments—Commonwealth, State and territory—on the adequacy of what infrastructure we have and to develop a blueprint for the future.
Infrastructure Australia would be a standing item on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments, and would bring provide regular reports to that body. I can’t understand why the Government remains deaf to the calls from business for such a body.
If we get the policy settings right—through the establishment Infrastructure Australia—we can unlock investment in roads, rail, ports, communications, and energy networks. This will lift the speed limit of the economy and be a strong foundation for Australia’s future prosperity.

Future Fund

I believe that the private sector has a major role to play in the financing and building of infrastructure. But some parts of our infrastructure cannot operate commercially and must be provided by the public sector.
The Treasurer has indicated that the proceeds of asset sales and budget surpluses will be moved into a Future Fund. I support this measure, but I have a different set of priorities as to the use of its dividends. The Treasurer asserts that the assets will be in a locked box for 15 years. But let’s just see how long before John Anderson’s Nationals crow bar that box open. The Treasurer says the Future Fund will offset the pressure on the budget from the costs associated with population ageing.
What he is really talking about is paying superannuation to retired Canberra public servants. But the best safeguard against the intergenerational risks to the economy is to put the economy on a path of higher productivity and faster growth.
Labor has a different and better plan for a fund for the future, a fund to help rebuild Australia. Instead of the Government’s Future Fund, Labor would establish its Building Australia Fund, and allow the income streams from that fund to be applied for infrastructure purposes.
This would lay our foundation for higher growth rates. Higher productivity and higher growth are the best and only ways to lay a strong foundation for the future.

Conclusion

A Budget exposes a government’s priorities. It determines the way ahead for the nation. It is an open window on a government’s soul. So with this Budget, who comes first in John Howard’s Australia? The members of parliament in this place who get a windfall gain of $65 per week, or the men and women who clean their offices and get just $6 per week?
Of course, the Prime Minister will instantly dismiss Labor’s stand for the 7 million forgotten Australian taxpayers and say that it is populist, opportunistic, and Labor Party class warfare. But I say it’s just that we have different priorities and different values.
If this was the Budget Speech and not the reply, the rebuilding of the Australian economy would commence tonight. The engines of reform would hum again. We would begin again to lay the foundations for a better Australian future, one that depends not on the good luck of a mining boom, but on the skills of working Australians and the strength of the nation’s infrastructure.
Labor stands for a better deal for working Australian men and women. And tonight one thing is clear. If ever this country needed a Labor Government, it is now.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,BUDGET,33,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-05-12,"—Treasurer Costello told the parliament on Tuesday night that his 10th budget was framed for the future. Tonight I advise that this is not a future that the Australian Democrats can endorse. Our vision is very different from Treasurer Costello’s. The Democrats believe in fairness, equality and compassion, and we do not subscribe to the politics of shame and blame.
The 2005-06 federal budget was, as expected, one of carrots and sticks: lots of blame and not a lot of fairness. The biggest carrots have gone to the high-income earners; the sticks are being used to beat up sole parent families and people with disabilities. It is the best of times if you are well paid and the worst of times if you are struggling. It is shameful, too, that the first two measures the government will pass, using its new Senate majority, attack the disabled, the widowed, the separated and single parents of young children. The Democrats say the government has no mandate for this.
This version of welfare reform cashes in on the populist myth that welfare recipients are bludgers and shirkers. It seriously devalues the work of certain parents: the ones who do not fit this government’s conservative, white-picket-fence ideal of family. At the same time that the Treasurer was announcing his hard line for parents on welfare he was announcing that there would be a $300 tax-free bonus paid to wealthy two-parent families where one parent stays at home to care for the children up to 18 years of age. The double standard is breathtaking. This measure pushes people onto dole queues for jobs that do not exist. The economics of the government’s welfare reform simply do not add up. Why would you expand Work for the Dole when only 15 per cent of participants end up with full-time work? The only area of jobs growth in this budget is in the Job Network and Centrelink, with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding being provided for job police and job agency programs.
Australia has 540,000 officially unemployed people and 1.2 million who want to work but fall outside the definition of unemployed. Last month there were just 22,600 job vacancies—that is, 77 jobless people for every vacancy—and the budget forecast predicts that jobs growth will slow from 2.75 per cent this year to just 1.5 per cent by June 2006. Yet the government says that 180,000 parents of school-age children—parenting payment recipients—and another 60,000 people with a disability should be off welfare and into the work force. There are of course people with disabilities in the work force just as there are 120,000 sole parents in work. I suggest that no-one would willingly remain on the paltry parenting payment if having a better paid job were a real prospect.
The fact is that there are still many barriers to people moving from welfare to work and if more training and Job Network assistance gets them ahead in the queue of the long-term unemployed they will not necessarily benefit and their children are unlikely to be better cared for. How easy will it be for a widowed, separated or divorced parent to find a job close to home during school hours that provides time off for children as young as six? How easy will it be for sole parents who have children with chronic illness, difficult behaviour or a disability, or sole parents with more than one child with such problems? Their search for a job that will not result in them leaving their children home alone or wandering the streets at night and during school holidays will mean they are likely to be breached and have their income support stopped without any questions being asked. The Breaching Review Taskforce, still kept under wraps by the government after six months, is apparently damning about the government’s harsh penalties. It calls on the government to cut the duration of current penalties for those who breach job search rules from 26 to eight weeks, but there is no mention of this in the budget.
Workers in this country do not have the right to flexible work hours or to paid family leave to care for sick children. The government says that over four years it will fund out-of-school care for 84,300 children, most of which, however, will not be available until 2008. But right now, in 2005, there is a shortfall of 50,000 such places. Add to that the demand driven by 120,000 parents forced into work, and it is obvious that more than twice that number will be needed.
Last budget the Treasurer told Australians to get procreating. A year later, the poorest parents were punished—child care is still unaffordable and unavailable to many families. How good it would have been for Mr Costello to have announced last Tuesday that child care of up to 30 hours a week, for instance, would be publicly funded for the families that required it, and that the higher costs of child care for children up to two years of age would be addressed. The Democrats estimate that it would cost $2.5 billion to do so, including the much needed increase in child-care worker wages. How good it would have been to hear that preschool would be provided free of charge to families, at a further cost to government of $430 million. It would mean that around 40,000 children would not continue to miss out and that every child-care centre could provide formal preschool for four-year-olds. Instead, this government misled people at the last election when they promised an uncapped 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket child-care expenses from January 2005. Another broken non-core promise means that those expenses cannot be claimed now until mid-2006 and that there will now be a cap of $4,000 on expenses for every child.
The Democrats believe that high-quality child care and early childhood education lay the foundation for effective learning and improved educational achievement and for social, cognitive and emotional development. These are the keys to eliminating child poverty. The way we see it, children are a shared responsibility. They are our future, and the government dollars invested in care for young children are a more valuable investment than any other spending—certainly more important than tax cuts for the well-off.
The new welfare system will be more complicated, with two kinds of disability pensions and two kinds of parenting payments. We ask: where is the simplification of the welfare system that was recommended by the McClure report four years ago? Where is the disability support pension supplement that acknowledges the additional cost of many disabilities? The budget’s so-called ‘new places’ in disability employment programs largely replace those abolished since 1996. Most of these are going to the Job Network, which is far less successful at getting the disabled into work than other programs. Where are the supports for disabled people in the work force? Where are the incentives for businesses or even government departments to employ people with impairments?
The Democrats think people with disabilities should be given every possible opportunity to participate in the work force. But the budget goes nowhere near to providing the level of employment support that they need, particularly given the harsh treatment that will be dished out for noncompliance. New applicants will face a cut to their income of around $60 a fortnight, as well as the loss of concessions and other benefits. The increased mobility allowance for those who qualify is twice consumed by the drop in income. In 2002, the Democrats, holding the balance of power in the Senate, stopped these attacks on people with disabilities; these measures will not pass this time without the Democrats trying to amend them and to ensure the views of those most affected are heard.
The centrepiece of this budget—and the one government no doubt hopes will be popular with most coalition voters—is the tax cuts. But forget it if you are one of the Howard battlers. High-income earners have done very well, but those on the lowest incomes must be satisfied with the crumbs. A person on only $10,000 a year will receive a tax cut of $80 a year, while a person on $125,000 a year gets a tax cut of $4,500 a year plus a superannuation tax cut of around $1,500 a year. Of course, the vast majority of those on high incomes are men. According to the ABS, only 1.8 per cent of female employees earn more than $80,000 a year. And let us not forget too that high-income earners have had the benefit of a range of other measures, such as negative gearing, capital gains tax cuts, salary packaging, company cars, personal trusts not being taxed as companies and the private health insurance rebate, all of which are overwhelmingly beneficial to the wealthy. The Democrats will not support tax cuts for high-income earners while Australians in poverty pay income tax. Our priority is tax cuts for low-income earners. The Democrats have often spoken here in the Senate about the importance of reforming the tax system to prevent poverty traps and to encourage people off welfare and into work. The Democrats are not opposed to tax cuts per se, but we have a better alternative—a much fairer proposal.
Instead of $4,500 for just the privileged few, for the same budget outlay we would give every taxpayer, including those on the lowest incomes, $680 a year. The Democrats have been campaigning for some time to lift the tax free threshold to $10,000. We do not believe that people in poverty should be paying income tax, and we certainly do not think that those currently earning as little as $6,000 a year should be doing so. On our web site—www.democrats.org.au—taxpay-ers can calculate the different effects on their incomes of the Costello and the Democrats’ tax proposals, and it does not cost anything. A taxpayer earning $28,000 a year will see that they would be $7 a week better off under our plan than they would be under this budget. This is in stark contrast to the Costello tax plan, where someone earning $125,000 a year is $52 a week better off.
The Democrats support indexation to address bracket creep. People should not end up paying more income tax just because their wages are keeping pace with inflation. Bracket creep and, indeed, creep in a whole lot of other thresholds, give governments the ability to splurge on the eve of an election, giving back money which they gained only because of that bracket creep. This was the case in the 2004 budget, when tax cuts were provided exclusively for those on more than $52,000 a year. The government had choices in this budget. It could have given fair tax cuts and invested in services rather than deciding to accumulate surpluses of $34 billion over the next four years. In the 2005 budget there were many areas where the government failed: health, environment protection, education and infrastructure—all critical to Australia’s future.
Federal budgets for some years now have failed massively on the environment. Tax cuts will provide little consolation for the real costs of not protecting our air, oceans, forests and native wildlife. This budget, like many since 1996, has tried to pass off under the environment portfolio a host of programs that should have been funded from other portfolio budgets. The Antarctic air link is not likely to benefit the environment. Undoubtedly, the greatest omission was climate change. There is no sign of a national cap on greenhouse gas emissions or a greenhouse gas trigger in the environment laws. Greenhouse gas abatement programs have been stretched out over more than a decade and the government doggedly refuses to mandate renewable fuels or increase the renewable energy target from what will be less than one per cent of total electricity generated by 2010. The energy white paper takes us backwards on transport, still favouring road over rail and ignoring public transport.
With so much of the current focus on on-the-ground community based initiatives, the federal government has put the burden of environmental management squarely onto the community. At the same time, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has virtually gutted funding to support voluntary environment and heritage organisations. The government is finally making some progress on water management, and at the time of the pre-election announcement we welcomed the National Water Initiative. We are pleased with continued work on Democrat initiatives, including water efficiency, recycling and reuse of grey water, better management of sewage and improved irrigation and storage systems—all recommendations that came out of the Senate committee inquiry initiated by the Democrats. Similarly, we welcome funding to fight weeds and invasive species. However, to ensure it is money well spent the government must address significant problems in policing the spread of recognised weeds—something also unearthed by the Democrat initiated and chaired Senate inquiry into invasive species.
The coalition government have never cared too much about the environment but we were shocked to see that they have also cut health funding. Despite an $8.9 billion surplus, total health funding has been cut by $275 million over four years. That happened with the lifting of the safety net thresholds and the arbitrary cut to new generic pharmaceuticals. We welcome a few small initiatives, such as the cancer program. The government has, however, failed to deliver in a number of key areas such as mental health and dental health and has failed to offer long-range solutions to the looming crises facing Medicare and to health work force shortages. Instead, it continues to pass the costs on to the sick and the poor.
The ongoing $2.5 billion a year drain on the public purse for the private health insurance rebate is maintained, money which could be better spent on addressing some of the glaring omissions from the health budget. There is nothing in this budget to contain the spiralling costs of specialists. Anyone who needs to see a doctor or a specialist faces longer waiting times and higher out-of-pocket costs. The Democrats believe this effectively wipes out any tax gains for average working Australians. It is those on low and middle incomes who rely on public dental services, and again there is nothing to reduce long waiting lists and no sign of a reintroduction of the Commonwealth dental program cut in 1996.
The Minister for Health and Ageing has acknowledged that mental health services in this country are ‘an absolute disaster’. Australia spends half as much on mental health as comparable countries do, and a fraction of those needing help actually receive it. Yet this budget has delivered nothing to help those one in five individuals who experience mental health problems in their lifetime, or their families. A decade after the Burdekin inquiry found appalling shortcomings in mental health services in Australia, not much has changed. The Democrats have initiated an inquiry into this issue and submission after submission tells us that much more needs to be done.
Mr Costello pays lip-service to the problems of an ageing population but, yet again, in this year’s budget there is no additional funding for home and community care services and no reform of the residential aged care funding system. Preventative health programs would be a better way of containing costs than raising the safety net threshold. Extending Medicare to cover allied health services, including midwifery, psychology, podiatry and physiotherapy, would have improved our primary health services enormously and avoided much more expensive acute care.
The Democrats were disappointed by this year’s Indigenous budget. The trumpeted savings from the abolition of ATSIC are not obvious anywhere in the Indigenous budget. There is just $170 million in additional funding over four years for Indigenous health, which falls far short of what the AMA said was needed. In fact, Indigenous health requires an additional $452 million annually just to bring the health of Indigenous Australians up to par with that of the rest of the population. The Democrats believe it is a matter of shame that in a time of record economic prosperity the health and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians is in crisis and Indigenous life expectancy is still 20 years below the national average and below that of Third World countries such as Nigeria, Nepal and Bangladesh.
The future of the Australian economy is dependent on the skills of its people. Despite the national skills crisis, the government funding for TAFE, our nation’s major training provider, is now significantly less in real terms than it was in 1997, despite large increases in demand and in the numbers of students in the TAFE system. There is nothing in this budget for the TAFE sector. The government’s refusal to invest in the nation’s future skills development is clearly absurd. We need to put resources into areas where demand for skills is growing: biotechnology, health sciences, food processing, business services and community and health care industries, for starters. TAFE funding is also the best way to improve the skills of those wanting to return to the work force or to keep up with technological change.
Universities and university students were also ignored in this budget. There was no relief for students in relation to income support, with HECS increases of up to 25 per cent in most universities. University grants will continue to be eroded by poor indexation. And there are no initiatives for schools. Funding for public school students is still well below the OECD average, and the government’s ideologically driven private tutoring voucher system is being ignored as unworkable and not useful. The government’s new funding arrangements for Indigenous students have caused havoc and heartache in the most disadvantaged remote and not-so-remote schools.
We had hoped that the Democrat-initiated National Safe Schools Framework, which is now a condition of federal grants, would be properly funded, but there are no allocations for financial assistance to schools beyond 2005. Around $15 million per year should have been provided by the federal government to make our schools safer. Bullying is a very serious problem in schools, with long-term ramifications. Expecting that a handful of pilot programs, a web site and some text books will eliminate bullying is fanciful.
We have a tax-and-spend government. What we need is a tax-and-invest government—one that invests in a big way in all Australians, in education and training, infrastructure and the environment. And where is the solid investment in overseas aid? Why are we not doing more to reduce poverty in our region that would lead to greater security? Instead, there is another bill for the war in Iraq—$240 million for the additional deployment of troops to Iraq that the Prime Minister promised would never happen.
Faced with a looming intergenerational crisis, a skills shortage and an $8.9 billion surplus next year, Treasurer Peter Costello could have invested in job creation, industry and infrastructure. Where in this budget are the major projects: the ports, railway networks, intermodal connections, water saving schemes—the sorts of projects that were once funded under the Better Cities Program—and 21st century telecommunications services to rural Australians?
Mr Costello’s 10 budgets have never been known for their investment in the future. Initiatives like the Intergenerational report were just given as reasons to reduce social services like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension because, Mr Costello says, they are not sustainable. What is also notable about Mr Costello’s budgets is that they almost always underestimate the budget surplus. The Democrats suspect that Mr Costello is keeping billions of dollars of Australians’ money for his own election war chest—money that should have been put into services and investment that would keep our economy strong and lift the incomes of the poorest Australians.
The solid financial position of the Australian economy is in part due to the sound management and responsible decisions of the Senate. Over many years, the Democrats have played an effective, responsible and constructive role in reforms to industrial relations, tax, the welfare systems and superannuation as well as the environment. We have made things fairer by preventing some of the bad initiatives of this conservative government from hurting Australians. We have stopped previous budget proposals from attacking the sick and disabled and we have significantly improved other measures. Unfortunately, come July, the coalition is going to be able to pass whatever proposals it wishes because the Democrats will no longer hold the balance of power. The government will be able to pass its grossly unfair tax cuts. But the Democrats will not pass them in the meantime—we will propose alternatives. The history of the Senate and certainly of the Democrats is full of examples of where we have been significant in improving budget proposals to ensure that they are economically responsible, socially fair and environmentally sustainable.
There are measures in the budget that the Democrats welcome, including many initiatives that we proposed or lobbied for. They include extending the maternity payment for adopted children for up to two years; extending the solar energy Photovoltaic Rebate Program for at least another two years; antismoking campaigns aimed at young people; improved taper rates for newstart allowance; a human genetics commission as proposed by my colleague Senator Stott Despoja; and continued, if minimal, funding for the National Pro Bono Resource Centre. There has also been the belated announcement that funding for key domestic violence and sexual assault centres will be maintained. The Democrats have been successful before in changing the government’s plans and convincing them to take up good ideas. We can continue to do that.
The budget welfare reform proposals must be assessed by the experts. We must hear directly from those who will be hurt. We believe the evidence is there that the budget’s proposed welfare reforms will not work. They will make life harder for many people for no good reason. We hope the government is still open to listening to the arguments and is not so arrogant that it will just force them through the Senate. I remind the government that having 51 per cent of the seats does not mean automatically that it has 100 per cent of the answers to the big issues facing Australia. The Democrats hope the coalition will listen to reason on the tax cuts. We know that the highest income earners can afford small tax cuts and the lowest paid workers deserve a bit more money in their pockets than Mr Costello is offering. If Mr Costello wants to be a leader and not just a politician, he has to look beyond the bottom line and budgets and show some compassion for those Australians who most need help.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,BUDGET,33,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-05-12,"—This is a cowardly and foolish budget. It is a budget that attacks the poor and advantages the wealthy. It is a budget that fails the Treasurer’s own sustainability test. It is a budget which again squanders public funds. There is next to nothing for social infrastructure for our education and health, environmental infrastructure for water and clean energy and physical infrastructure for our railways and ports. There is no goal to improve the lot of Australians who struggle daily to make ends meet and no plan to invest in public services and the restoration and protection of our environment. This budget moves us backwards on building a fairer and more compassionate society and on caring for the unique environment we hold in trust for generations to come.
The Australian Greens have a very different vision for this nation. We want the economy to genuinely serve the interests of all Australians, not only the wealthy, and to genuinely set us on a sustainable footing for future generations. We want a society that cares for those who are unable to work, supports those who want to work and acknowledges the contribution of those in unpaid work. We want prosperity based on sustainable use of our natural environment and a fairer sharing of national wealth.
Having listened to the Treasurer’s speech on Tuesday, I found myself wondering if he lives in the same Australia that I do. He talks of a strong economy in its 14th year of continuous economic growth. But what kind of Australia has this strong economy delivered under the stewardship of this government? It has delivered an Australia where the wealth gap between the rich and the poor is at its largest in 40 years and is growing. The benefits of economic growth have not been shared equally across the community and this budget adds to this inequality. One in every nine Australians lives below the poverty line. That rate is higher than the OECD average. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, NATSEM, calculates that the richest 20 per cent of Australians have 62.8 per cent of our country’s wealth. This is forecast to rise to 70 per cent in 2030. Wages for ordinary Australians went up just 3.5 per cent last year, whereas corporate executive pay went up 30 per cent as company profits boomed.
The Howard government has delivered an Australia where employment is increasingly tenuous, casual, part time and not shared evenly amongst the community. Part-time employment has increased much more rapidly than full-time employment. Casual employees now make up 27.9 per cent of the work force. Part-time and casual jobs are generally poorly paid, with worse conditions than full-time jobs.
Despite government claims of low unemployment, there is significant underemployment—that is, people wanting to work more. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that one in four part-time workers wants to work more hours. The Australian Council of Social Service estimates that, if hidden unemployment were added to official unemployment, the unemployment rate would roughly double. Yet by some miracle the government expects tens of thousands of sole parents and people with disabilities to suddenly find work. The economy that the Treasurer has presided over has delivered an Australia where buying a home is increasingly out of reach for most young people, whilst tens of thousands of Australians are homeless.
Despite strong economic growth, our government cries poor when it comes to the expenditure needed to sustain the natural environment that supports our very existence. The Murray River red gums continue their slow but certain death while the government fails to adequately address the problems of water allocation and dryland salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions keep rising and climate change is evident. A new drought threatens vast stretches of the country that have not recovered from the last one. Land clearing continues to destroy native vegetation and to threaten the animals and birds that rely on it. More than six months after promising to protect Tasmania’s old-growth forests, the Prime Minister has not yet protected a single tree.
After 14 years of growth and 10 years of Costello budgets, the real legacy of the Howard government’s economic management is a nation that is less compassionate and running down the environment. Real harm is being done and real lives are being damaged. But the Treasurer thinks that is okay because he can give out tax cuts, and the wealthier you are the bigger the tax cut you get. The Greens say that this budget is cowardly and foolish: cowardly because it punishes the poor and vulnerable whilst giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy; foolish because instead of addressing the intergenerational pressures that the Treasurer talks about it exacerbates them through regressive tax changes and missed investment opportunities. There is simply no justification for giving more tax cuts to the wealthy while cutting the income of unemployed people, people with disabilities, sole parents and parents on low incomes caring for young children.
There is a case for genuine taxation reform. Taxation is one of the most effective tools that the government has for helping those with little and asking those with wealth to pay their fair share. The government should be closing the loopholes exploited by high-income earners in our taxation system that ACOSS estimates cost the community $11.5 billion every year. The government should remove the regressive GST, especially on basic cost-of-living expenses like transport, electricity, gas and telephones. We need to discourage the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging investment in goods and services that benefits society and the environment. Instead of addressing these changes that are so urgently needed, the government prefers to target vulnerable and disadvantaged people, imposing harsher rules and cutting their income support—pushing more people into poverty.
There are a lot of reasons why people cannot find work: things such as lack of education and training, no recent work experience, mental illness, expensive equipment and transport expenses, discrimination, lack of affordable child care, inflexible working hours, no jobs in their geographical area and, not least of all, wanting to give priority to caring for their children. There is a case for welfare reform, but it is not what the government has delivered in this budget. Since the rate of the newstart allowance is below the poverty line, the government’s welfare changes will push more people into poverty. The McClure report on welfare reform proposed simplifying the welfare payments system, but this budget makes the system more complex by adding more layers of payments with different rules. Genuine welfare reform requires a serious investment in people and services to help them. ACOSS estimates that $2 billion a year is needed for this investment. The government did not even get halfway near that in this budget.
Many people receiving the disability support pension would like to work, but they face barriers like discrimination, lack of access to public transport and difficulties with access to buildings—none of which have been addressed in the budget. The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations said of the budget:
Without concrete proposals to encourage employers to employ people with a disability, the budget proposals will do nothing to increase employment of people with disability.
The government could start by leading by example and reverse the fall in the number of people with a disability who are employed in the federal Public Service. The government has a massive surplus but is reducing support for sole parents and full-time carers with low-income partners. When their youngest child turns six, they will be shifted to unemployment benefits, losing $40 per week. Sole parents already do the work of two parents in raising and supporting their children. They already carry a heavy burden. Four out of every 10 sole parents are in the bottom 20 per cent of income earners. The government is always telling us that parents know best how to raise their children, but now the government is telling sole parents and low-income parents when they are no longer needed at home to care for their children.
The community will continue to subsidise middle- and high-income two-parent families through family tax benefit B, which is not household means tested, so that they can choose to have one parent at home caring for their children, but sole parents and low-income parents will be treated less favourably. The Greens believe sole parents and low-income parents should be assisted to undertake paid work if they think they can accommodate it with their caring responsibilities. Seven out of 10 sole parents already undertake paid work at some time in each 12-month period. But it is not fair to put them under more stress by forcing them to do paid work when it means they cannot provide the care that their children need. What sole parents and low-income parents really need is more accessible and affordable child care, access to training and education, and flexible, secure work that provides carers’ leave and regular hours with decent wages.
Australia has a shortage of child-care workers and child-care places. As many as 174,500 children are already missing out on the child care that their parents need for them. On top of that, rising fees are putting child care out of the reach of many families. The additional 87,800 child-care places allocated in this budget do not go near addressing the existing shortage of child-care places. They are not linked or tied to sole parents and low-income parents and they do not meet the needs of those people whom the government expects to find paid work. The National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children estimates that, in order to get parents into work, each of their children will need up to three of those places—that is, a before school place, an after school place and a holiday care place. Parents will also face problems when a child is sick and cannot be placed in child care or with finding child care to accommodate the irregular, late night and weekend work that is typical of casual employment.
This budget gives more cash to the wealthy but makes life harder for unemployed people by imposing harsh obligations on them. The much criticised breaching regime has been changed by imposing an immediate eight-week payment suspension—no questions asked. There are harsher penalties for older unemployed people who are expected to look for full-time work, despite the government’s admissions that they face age discrimination. Long-time unemployed people will be forced to work for the dole for $8 an hour—that is less than the minimum wage—for 25 hours a week, 10 months of the year to keep their income support. That will not address the reasons why people have been unable to find work, nor will it help them have time to search for a job.
It is a myth that we have a low rate of participation in the work force. Australia’s work force participation rate is higher than the OECD average. Plenty of people not participating in paid work are doing things that help make our society a better place. They are doing things like raising children, caring for people with disabilities, nursing elderly and frail people, repairing and protecting our environment, assisting in schools and hospitals, working with asylum seekers, promoting cultural activities and helping young disadvantaged people. Nearly one-third of people over 18 did volunteer work in 2000, contributing over 700 million hours of unpaid work. That contribution must be acknowledged, and all people without a job should be treated fairly.
The government argues that people with disabilities, sole parents and low-income parents must be forced into paid work because the population is ageing and imposing higher health and welfare costs on the budget. Our welfare budget is not large by OECD standards and the reliance on welfare in this country has been falling and continues to do so. The Productivity Commission report on the economic implications of ageing, which was released last month, agrees that health costs in 2040 will be more expensive, but it also states that Australians will be twice as rich as they are now. The assumption the Treasurer is making is that, even though individuals on average will be twice as rich as they are now, they will not be willing to pay for more health care. The Greens believe that he is wrong, and it is not just the Greens who are sceptical about the Treasurer’s assumptions on this issue.
A critique of the Treasurer’s 2002 Intergenerational report that was prepared by ANU academics Professor of Demography Peter McDonald and Professor of Economics Steve Dowrick exposes faulty assumptions and modelling in the Treasurer’s report. They found that the Treasurer’s report consistently underestimates the effect of ongoing increases in educational levels on work force participation rates and productivity increases. As well, the report presents an unduly dire picture of the level of future costs of health and aged care, even though these costs cannot be forecast accurately.
Despite these criticisms, the Greens welcome the opportunity to focus on the long-term goals of government policy. If the Treasurer were truly concerned about a blow-out in, for example, health costs in the long term, he would be investing in public, preventative and primary health care, rather than seeking to privatise our health care system further. The government has already wasted almost $14 billion on the private health insurance rebate since its inception, with no public health benefit to show for it. Thousands of people wait more than a year for elective surgery. People cannot afford to see a dentist, and plenty of people pay up front to see a GP because the government is working hard to make bulk-billing disappear.
The government is determined to entrench a health care system in which you get what you can afford to pay for, not what you need. It is a health care system in which the government shovels money at insurance funds but claws it back from sick people. If the government succeeds in this mission to privatise our health care then the cost of providing health services to an ageing population will shift outside of public control, guaranteeing greater expenditure but less access for low- and middle-income earners. The best way to control health costs is for the government to buy services on behalf of the community through the public health system and to invest in community based care and preventative health, improving services in regional and rural Australia, and addressing the appalling state of Indigenous health. These measures will help to reduce the costs of health services to the public whilst ensuring that health care delivery is fair. Access to health care must be based on medical need, not on private capacity to pay.
If the government were truly interested in taking a long-term view about increasing work force participation and productivity to help pay for an ageing society, it would be investing in education. The public education budget has lost billions of dollars in real terms under the Howard government. Every one of those dollars represents a lost opportunity to improve skills, employability and investment potential, apart from the obvious public good of having a well educated population. All of those things improve productivity. Our universities continue to cry out for proper government funding. Whilst the government refuses to pay for the research and development potential in Australia, it will continue to be unfulfilled. Many of our children are not receiving the start in life that they deserve and, as a result, they struggle to contribute to their full potential. The Greens particularly want to ensure access to free public preschooling for every Australian child.
Perhaps most obviously, the long-term health of our nation depends on the health of the planet—but yet again the budget fails to provide adequate funding for the environment. This is a budget with an $8.9 billion surplus. There is plenty of money to invest in repairing and protecting our environment. As long as we fail to do so, we not only deprive future generations of their inheritance but also undermine the basis of our own material wellbeing. The government has just stripped key environment groups of funding because it did not like the lobbying that they were doing to protect our planet and future. The Prime Minister is expected to announce his package on Tasmania’s old-growth forests tomorrow. One thing we know for certain is it will not be anywhere near the proposal put forward by the Tasmanian Greens, the Forest Transition Strategy, which provides a detailed blueprint for protecting forests and creating approximately 900 sustainable jobs in the tourism and timber industries.
The Greens’ vision for our future is that Australian workers will be happy and clever, not working harder and for longer. A happy, clever work force sharing the work more efficiently can more than provide for our future needs. But the budget contained nothing to advance this vision. Instead, the coalition is targeting low-paid workers whose wages it thinks are too high and should be curtailed. That is why the government wants to move away from an open, independent wage-setting procedure in which all parties are able to present their arguments in public.
There is no evidence that slowing minimum wage growth will lift employment, as the government claims. What we do know, though, is that entrenching low-paid, low-skilled jobs will entrench working poverty. Instead of making life harder for disadvantaged workers, the government should be investing in better skills that will lead to better paid jobs. If the Treasurer is concerned about participation rates then making working conditions harsher is not going to help. The Greens support making work more attractive not less attractive. It is hard to see how reducing wages and conditions will entice older Australian workers to stay in the work force longer.
The foundation of our nation will always be rotten whilst the first Australians continue to suffer the indignity and hardship of over 200 years of discrimination, dispossession and neglect. The government’s treatment of Indigenous Australians does nothing to turn this around. Having abolished the national representative Indigenous body, ATSIC, the government is now setting about imposing requirements on Aboriginal communities in return for services that every other Australian expects as a right of citizenship. These measures will not address the most pressing needs of Indigenous communities: relatively high infant mortality and lower life expectancy, substance abuse, low participation in education, low levels of employment and poor housing. The Greens say that addressing Indigenous disadvantage should be a top priority for government. A sustainable nation must be a nation reconciled with its Indigenous peoples.
Australia also has a poor record in assisting the world’s poorest nations. At a time of great national prosperity there is no excuse for failing to lift substantially our overseas aid commitment from the paltry 0.26 per cent of GNP last year. Yet this year’s budget commits us to just 0.28 per cent of GNP—a long way short of the United Nations’ recommended level of 0.7 per cent of GNP.
The budget allocates $402.5 million towards Australia’s latest Iraq deployment—now in its third year. The total budget for participation in the invasion and occupation of Iraq is already over $1 billion. Whilst other countries are leaving Iraq, the Howard government is digging us deeper and deeper into this quagmire. The increase in defence spending now means that the federal government is spending as much on defence as it is on education. Why is the government spending as much on the preparation for war as it is on preparing our young people for the future? The government’s relationship with the White House is distorting Australia’s defence decisions and budget priorities. Our defence forces should not be designed to suit the priorities of the Pentagon. We need an independent defence and foreign policy.
As I said at the beginning, the Greens see this budget as both cowardly and foolish. It represents a massive failure of the responsibility of government to lay firm foundations for the future of Australia. It robs from the poor and vulnerable whilst giving to the rich. It does not do enough to protect our natural environment and it does not invest in our public health or public education services. Instead, it puts things like war ahead of things like aid.
The Treasurer makes a lot of noise about the future and the need to think in the long term. The Greens agree, but we see no evidence of long-term sustainable thinking in this budget. We are living on borrowed time until we confront the serious challenges this century will bring. We must start valuing our environment, focusing our health system on health rather than on illness, and investing in public education and training. And we must start recognising that we are part of a global community that can and should work together if our collective future is to be assured. This is the positive long-term vision of the Australian Greens.

This part of the statement is on behalf of Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Mark Bishop, as agreed by the Senate on 11 May 2005. The terms of that order are:
That there be laid on the table by the Minister for Defence, no later than Thursday, 12 May 2005, all briefings to the Minister and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, on the matter of road works at Gallipoli over the past 4 years, and all internal minutes and file notes, including records of meetings between the Office of Australian War Graves and officials of the Government of Turkey on the same subject.
I wish to inform the Senate that the documents are unable to be tabled as sought by 12 May 2005, for a number of reasons.
The order itself is capable of a very wide interpretation and can be read in two possible ways. First, the order could be construed as seeking the production of all documents brought into existence in the past four years relating to the matter of roadworks at Gallipoli. Second, the order could be construed as seeking the production of all documents relating to any roadworks that have taken place at Gallipoli over the past four years. If it is the second interpretation then this will include documents brought into existence over a much longer time period.
The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has estimated that if the order is only for the production of documents brought into existence in the past four years then at least 20 files and over 4,000 folios of documents in its possession will need to be examined. The only reason that the government is aware of the potential number of documents involved is that the department is already preparing material for the consideration of the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to respond to Senate questions on notice Nos 447 and 477, which relate to the roadworks at Gallipoli. To enable the answers to those two questions on notice to be prepared much work has already taken place in locating and identifying relevant documents. However, that work is yet to be completed and further work will need to be done if the wider interpretation of the order is pursued.
I am advised that, even if the more narrow interpretation of the order is to be taken, the time frame of 12 May 2005 that has been specified cannot be met. There is still much work to be done in locating, identifying and examining all of the relevant files and documents and ensuring that each document that may be relevant to the order is correctly identified. Further, the order specifically includes ministerial briefings over at least the past four years. While the government is unable to indicate a position at this time on the possible issue of public interest immunity that would normally attach to such high-level briefings, the inclusion of this specific category of documents will result in the need for careful examination of each document. Again, this work can only take place after the documents are located and identified. This will also result in further work needing to be done and this cannot be completed in the time frame contained in the order. In conclusion, the current order is unable to be complied with. Work has commenced to locate and identify each document but it is not physically possible to comply with the current order in the time frame that has been set.
This part of the statement is on behalf of Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, the Minister for Family and Community Services. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Bartlett, as agreed by the Senate on 12 May 2005, and it relates to reports and certification provided by the states and territories for the financial year 2003-04 under the provisions of subclauses 4(33), 4(34) and 4(35) of the 2003 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. I wish to inform the Senate that I cannot table the reports and certification provided by the states and territories for the financial year 2003-04 under the provisions of subclauses 4(33), 4(34) and 4(35) of the 2003 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement by 3.30 pm today. The reasons are that I am considering those reports and will write to my state and territory counterparts regarding my views on the progress of the performance indicated in each of those reports.
I intend to provide my views to the state and territory housing ministers on that progress shortly. This is part of a process that is being carried out under the 2003 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement requiring consultation with each state and territory housing minister. I understand the performance of the states and territories indicated in those bilateral reports will be summarised as an integral part of the Housing Assistance Act 1996 annual report under section 14 for the 2003-04 financial year. The preparation of this part of the annual report is undertaken in consultation with each state and territory. The annual report will then be tabled before each house of the Australian parliament.
This part of the statement is on my behalf as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and on behalf of Christopher Pyne, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing. This order arises from a motion moved by Senator Bartlett, as agreed by the Senate on 16 March 2005, and it relates to certain documents held by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, APVMA, and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.
I wish to inform the Senate that the APVMA does not have any reports relating to glyphosate, herbicide tolerant genetically modified plants and Fusarium. However, the APVMA has provided some brief information in relation to Fusarium and glyphosate used in genetically modified crops.
I also wish to inform the Senate that I am tabling all relevant documents that are held by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. I am advised that the Gene Technology Regulator does not systematically collect and analyse all agronomic data from field trials of genetically modified crops. This is because some of the data relates to the licence holders’ commercial interest in the crop—for example, yield effects—which are not directly relevant to the regulator’s function to protect human health and safety and the environment from risks that may be posed by gene technology. However, some agronomic data, such as data that may indicate whether the modification may result in the genetically modified crop being more of a weed problem than the parent organism, are useful in fulfilling this function and have been collected and analysed.
This part of the statement is on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The order arises from a motion agreed by the Senate on 11 May 2004 and it relates to the tabling of all submissions received by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in response to the ‘Building on success: Community Development Employment Projects discussion paper 2005’.
I wish to inform the Senate that the minister does not agree to release some of the submissions related to the building on success discussion paper on public interest grounds. Some of the submissions contain personal information and the minister believes that the public interest in keeping the submissions confidential outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Disclosing confidential or personal information in this context will undermine public confidence in the submission process and will discourage full and frank submissions in future. Also, the sensitive nature of some of the information in the submissions may, if released, be inflammatory.
The minister will progressively release as many submissions or parts of submissions as possible following consultation with the authors and consideration of sensitivities, with a completion date of the end of May 2005. This time frame is required because the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will need to examine over 100 submissions and contact their authors to inform them of the Senate’s request.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF PREGNANCY SUPPORT SERVICES</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,34,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
What a contemptuous response to a motion of the Senate to produce documents! I guess it is something we should expect to see a lot of in the future as the government takes its majority and uses it and really treats the transparency and democratic processes of the Senate with such contempt.
This was a set of a submissions that were called for by the minister. The minister has relied on these submissions in his press releases and in his arguments justifying policy initiatives taken by this government in respect of the Community Development Employment Projects review process. We must note that the CDEP is an incredibly important program. It has around 37,000 participants. The CDEP activities are provided by some 240 different Indigenous organisations. In Labor’s view, the least these people deserve is some transparency in decision making about the program’s future. The ‘CDEP—future directions’ paper released by Minister Andrews in April claims that most people who made submissions to the CDEP review agreed with the general direction of the changes proposed in the discussion paper. However, ‘Future directions’ seems to gloss over some of the key issues raised by the stakeholders. It is therefore imperative that the government release the submissions it receives so that the Senate can assess its response in light of what people actually said during this review.
It is inappropriate for the government to talk about the public interest being outweighed by the interest of the people who have made these submissions. In the statement, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred to some sensitive issues that may have been raised in some of the submissions. However, we know very clearly that, if people wanted these submissions to be made private, they had every opportunity to do so. The government have not even had the courtesy to advise the Senate of how many of the submissions they refused to release were requests made by the submitters to have these submissions kept confidential. If requests had been made to keep the submissions confidential, some argument might have been able to be developed by this government that we should not have public access to them. But clearly that is not the case. The minister is not even able to provide to the Senate the list of submissions that were clearly able to be made public and were not in any way to be kept confidential.
From the outset, Labor was concerned that the four-week time frame for submissions and the hastily convened two-hour verbal sessions were totally inadequate and would exclude many remote communities from participating in this review. The consultations were a sham, and we said so at the time. The review was never really designed to enable CDEP organisations, participants and other experts to share their views in an open and transparent way. Nevertheless, 16 government agencies, 26 CDEP organisations, seven Job Network members, four ATSIC regional councils, 20 other organisations and 33 individuals took the time to make submissions. There is absolutely no reason these submissions should not be made public. I understand that Minister Andrews’s office has said that it believes it would need to seek the permission of people and organisations that made submissions before they would be able to release submissions. The parliamentary secretary has again—in a very mealy-mouthed way, I must say—referred to the same process.
It is clearly unacceptable and really is holding the Senate in contempt in this process. The discussion paper clearly stated: ‘If you want your comments kept confidential, please let us know.’ This sentence was not hidden away in any footnote; it was there, clear and right up front in the submission. It was on page 1, under the address of where to send your submissions. It was not in small type; it was not hidden away. It was very clear. Right under the address, it says: ‘If you want your comments kept confidential, please let us know.’ But does the parliamentary secretary come into this place and say, ‘Look, there was a number of requests to keep submissions confidential, and that is the reason we won’t release them’? No, he does not. He comes in here and says, ‘We have to seek the permission of every submitter to find out whether we are able to release them, and we will release them over a period of time, as it suits us.’
That is not an acceptable way to treat Senate motions requesting documents. It is completely inappropriate. If the submitters did not request that their submissions be confidential, every single one of those submissions should be on the table today so we can test the veracity of the claims made by the minister throughout this investigation. The government do not want to do that because they want to live in a shroud of secrecy. They do not want to be open to any scrutiny. They do not want people looking at the way they make their decisions. The government do not like transparency; they like to go through a sham process, trying to disguise a predetermined outcome as a process of consultation. Then, worse, they say that all the submissions backed up their position and their outcome. We know that is a sham, and this government ought to be ashamed of treating the Senate this way.
Even if people did request that their submissions be kept confidential, advice from the Clerk of the Senate indicates that—even where information has been collected on the basis that it would be treated as confidential—this is not in itself a ground for a public interest immunity claim. We see the government very conveniently using that as the excuse not to release the documents so that their claims cannot be tested against the results that they have predetermined through this sham inquiry. In this case, there was not even any indication that submissions would be automatically confidential. Nothing was automatic in that process.
There are a number of areas where Labor is concerned that the government has failed to adequately address the issues raised in consultations, but I want to discuss just two today: training and cultural activities run through the CDEP. When the CDEP discussion paper was released, the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs and reconciliation, Senator Carr, noted with concern that there was no mention of training or improving linkages between CDEP and education providers.
In everything that Labor has heard, the need for CDEP organisations to be able to access funding for training was consistently raised as a major issue during the department’s inadequate verbal consultations. When the ‘CDEP—future directions’ paper was released it became clear that the government had completely ignored these comments, but the minister has the gall to state that the consultation process backed up their conclusions. In fact, training is only mentioned in any significant way in relation to 15- to 17-year-old participants—and it was only one paragraph in a 14-page paper. ‘CDEP—future directions’ says feedback indicated agreement that the three areas CDEP should focus on are employment, community activities and business development but, further down the same section, the paper says:
Some people were concerned that by focusing on the three key areas of employment, community activities and business development the role of CDEP in supporting culture was not being recognised.
The report provides no indication of how many people expressed concern or what they said the results of ignoring the cultural aspects of CDEP would be. The government’s response has been to make it explicitly clear that cultural maintenance activities will only be supported in areas where there is not a labour market. This will mean the loss of many projects which support the maintenance of Indigenous culture. It does not appear to be anywhere near an adequate response—but how are we supposed to assess that, when we do not know how many people expressed concern or how concerned they were? When Minister Andrews launched this review, and the sham consultation process that went with it, he said that change would be implemented gradually. He said in his media release of 15 February 2005:
Change will be gradual ... DEWR will work closely with individual CDEP organisations to help them build their capacity to adjust to programme changes ...
The timetable in the discussion paper did not tally with that claim, and the minister confirmed that when he released ‘Future directions’:
This process of change will begin immediately with the changes being negotiated into the CDEP schedule of the Programme Funding Agreements for 2005-06.
The whole review process has left CDEP providers and participants uncertain about their future and about DEWR’s commitment to this unique program. The least the government can do is release the submissions it received, so that everyone is able to make an informed judgment about the adequacy of its response. In his very mealy-mouthed statement today the parliamentary secretary talked about not releasing any documents until completing a process of getting permission from the submitters, a process which is not necessary, and he did not say how many submitters indicated that they wanted their submissions to be made confidential.
What we do know is that doing a quick Google search this evening reveals that the following organisations have already made their submissions public by publishing them on the internet: the Centre of Full Employment and Equity, Catholic Welfare Australia, Jobs Australia, ACOSS and the NTEU. They are already public documents, but the government—ignoring the Senate motion to make them public—cannot even produce for the Senate those documents that are already on the public record. It exposes this whole process of negotiation as a sham. It is appalling for the government to rely on submissions which it will not make public to back up the conclusions it has formed in its ‘Future directions’ paper. It should be unacceptable to the Senate; it is unacceptable to the Labor Party and it is clearly unacceptable to our Indigenous communities. This government should abide by the legitimate motions of the Senate, produce the submissions and place them on the table as directed by the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-05-12,"—by leave—This statement is on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Greig, as agreed by the Senate on 11 May 2005, and it relates to the tabling of the final report of the Breaching Review Taskforce, presented to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in December 2004.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-05-12,"—Recently, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, an independent non-statutory body, presented its annual report to the Senate. Under its terms of reference the authority is required to determine or recommend to the Minister for Health and Ageing prices of items listed as pharmaceutical benefits or recommended by the authority for listing. The pricing secretariat also conducts negotiations with suppliers, where necessary, on proposed prices.
I remind the Senate that the fourth guild-government agreement is in currently in negotiation, and hopefully the outcome will be beneficial to the government, the pharmacy community and the community at large. Pharmacy owners make a reasonable, but certainly not extravagant, living. I remind honourable senators that the government controls prescription margins. The government envisages that funding for the fourth agreement, which covers the five years to 30 June 2010, will be an estimated $11.75 billion. Regretfully, I remind the Senate that in this negotiating environment there has been a great deal of misinformation floating about in the media in relation to the pricing of drugs by pharmacists. I believe it has been circulated by those who have little understanding of the economics of running a pharmacy. Let me give you a few examples.
Access Economics health economist Roger Kilham is quoted as saying that all pharmacists do is ‘stick medicine in a box and put a sticker on it’. This shows an appalling lack of knowledge about the profession. As a matter of course, each time a medicine is dispensed the pharmacist checks the patient’s history and looks for any potentially adverse interactions with other medicines. If a new medication is dispensed, then the pharmacist counsels the patient about its use and explains its effects as well as any potential side effects. Pharmacists are the most accessible health care providers in the community and are often the patient’s first point of contact. Pharmacists refer millions of Australians to GPs every year. They offer expert advice to patients every day on a very wide range of health topics, and access is usually immediate. The services they provide are worth many millions of dollars each year, and they relieve pressure on other parts of an already heavily burdened health system. I am also concerned by the intervention of the AMA president. In fact, I counselled him publicly at a breakfast over this issue, because I do not think it does the AMA any good to be publicly attacking allied health professionals. I am also surprised at the media intervention in this debate of Philip Davies, who happens to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. I do not believe that was helpful.
There are obviously some solutions to save the government money. Let me give you an example. There are certain medical conditions—for example, stomach ulcers—where a number of pharmacists believe there may well be an overreliance on prescribed drugs such as esomeprazole. Rather than people making dietary and lifestyle changes that may help with the condition, they insist on taking their drugs. Therefore, it seems that a campaign to educate people about the cost savings and associated benefits of lifestyle change may greatly assist.
The suggestion that pharmacists enjoy a 10 per cent mark-up on drugs, implying that that this is some type of rort, is ludicrous. I am not sure how one can think that Australian pharmacists can provide what is universally accepted as world’s best service, and which is also provided at world’s lowest cost, if they are not paid for it. The reality is that pharmacists are paid a pittance for the service they provide. Ninety-five per cent of dispensed medications in Australia are supplied under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the price of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines to consumers is set by the government. Pharmacists do not have any capacity to charge above the government determined patient contribution.
All PBS prescriptions attract a flat professional fee which is designed to cover the cost of a pharmacist’s time in confirming doctors’ intentions and directions, confirming the medication’s suitability and dosage for the patient, documenting and recording the prescription according to state law, complying with PBS clerical requirements necessary for reimbursement and counselling the patient in the correct use of their medication. This fee is set at $4.70, and I might add it is grossly inadequate for the work that it is supposed to cover. PBS medications then attract the mark-up on cost of 10 per cent. This 10 per cent mark-up on cost—or margin on sales of 9.09 per cent—has to cover the costs of managing inventory levels, ordering stock from suppliers, receiving and storing stock, and the opportunity cost of money invested in the stock being held. On top of this, pharmacists carry all of the risk of redundant or out-of-date stock.
In theory, the gross margin on sales in any business would normally be used to fund such other overheads as wages, rentals and electricity, but a margin of 9.09 per cent on sales is never going to contribute to those expenses. By way of comparison, Woolworths’s gross margin on sales is 26 per cent, Harvey Norman’s margin is 22 per cent, clothing mark-ups often start at 100 per cent and the mark-up on prepared foods starts at something like 300 per cent. I am not aware of any other business reselling goods which survives on a mark-up of lower than 10 per cent, as the pharmacy industry does.
Protecting public health, I believe—and I am sure most honourable senators would agree—is more important than Woolworths’ profits. Protecting public health should be the prime consideration in any government decision on whether to allow pharmacies to be operated by supermarkets. Woolworths continue to say that they can save money by allowing pharmacies within their supermarkets. But, if the margins are controlled by the government, I would like to ask Roger Corbett how he thinks he can save money. Of the small amount of non-PBS dispensing taking place in pharmacies, the final mark-up is determined by highly competitive market forces. There are effectively 4,000 pharmacies competing with each other. Compare this to the price manipulation in groceries, for example, particularly milk, where there are effectively only two businesses competing with each other.
Media stories have targeted select lines where a high mark-up of 75 per cent may be added to a very low-cost base item. They have deliberately ignored the reality that even non-PBS pharmaceuticals are usually priced at less than 20 per cent mark-up on cost, simply because that is what the market dictates. If an individual pharmacy chooses to apply a higher mark-up, which is its right, as it is for any other form of retailer, then the customers will gravitate to the lower price sellers. That is exactly what happens in the day-to-day business of running a pharmacy, and it is true competition at work.
If the mooted cuts are made from the incomes of pharmacies there will be massive closures and service reductions in the industry. It is the service reductions that really worry me. The most vulnerable pharmacies will be those in isolated and rural areas. The multitude of totally free services that pharmacies provide to the public will disappear, either by being abandoned due to reduced staffing capacity or by the introduction of charges necessary to fund the services. It is also likely that the totally free and on-demand qualified advice that every member of the Australian public can walk into a pharmacy unannounced to receive will be under threat.
Growth in the cost of the PBS is due in part to the introduction of newer, very expensive drugs. I do not believe it is due to the alleged growth in pharmacists’ incomes. In fact, the opposite is true, as pharmacists’ incomes are largely controlled by government but their costs have escalated, with no such controls in recent years. Alternative ways to reduce the costs of drugs may be to ask why more expensive drugs should not be paid for by a higher patient contribution or why doctors cannot be encouraged to use cheaper alternatives to some of the newer drugs, many of which have questionable levels of improvement over the older drugs. Pharmacy is an industry which has already been subjected to substantial cuts in real income over recent years. (Time expired)
