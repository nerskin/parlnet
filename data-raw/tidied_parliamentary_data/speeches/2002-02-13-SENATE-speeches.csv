"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-02-13,"—This is quite an outrageous motion. What we have at the outset of this parliamentary sitting is the government purporting—
Government senators interjecting—
—The government members opposite may well leave the chamber, but it shows the disdain they have for a debate on a bill—the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002—which they claim to be urgent. That makes my point. The government is claiming to make urgent a piece of legislation which is now appearing, amended, for the fourth time in this chamber, which has been brought persistently to the chamber by the government over the last three years and which, most lately, has been mishandled in the week leading to the federal election when the government tried to have it bombed through the Senate and failed to do so. 
This is a piece of legislation with amendments that the chamber has not yet seen. Nobody in this chamber, other than the minister, has a copy of this bill on his or her desk. How can you fast-forward a piece of legislation which senators have not seen? The government has said obliquely that there is only a minor amendment to the bill, but where is that minor amendment? Could I be provided with a copy of the legislation—to be the first in the chamber, other than the minister, to see it—with the amendment and the attendant pieces of legislation? 
The dynamics of this legislation are that the woodchip industry has been able to manoeuvre both the government and the Labor Party into having this as the first piece of legislation on the Senate slate. And what a horrendous piece of legislation it is! The legislation is to fast-forward the regional forest agreement process being validated in law by the passage of this bill through the parliament. The regional forest agreements were signed by Prime Minister Howard and several state premiers over the last three years, and they effectively give all of the unprotected forests in Australia to the logging industry.  
The aim of this piece of legislation is to ensure that the federal parliament and the federal minister for the environment and for forests is hogtied as far as the destruction of Australia's forests in the future is concerned. It removes the power of the minister to intervene to protect forests and wildlife, including endangered species and world heritage forests, effectively for good, while the chainsaws move in and the destruction of those forests, as in my home state of Tasmania, continues at the greatest rate in history.
At the outset of this debate I need to say that this legislation must be considered carefully. There is no way that an overnight look at the legislation and its ramifications can allow members of this house to go to their electorates and get feedback on this piece of legislation. Is it important to the electorate? Yes, it is. It is very, very important to my electorate, to the half a million or so Green voters in Australia and, in particular, to the tens of thousands of people who made a record Green vote in the elections in Tasmania. This was one of the major issues in mind. If you are in Tasmania you see what the regional forest agreement is doing to Tasmania's wild forests—the greatest rate of destruction in history of the grandest forests in the Southern Hemisphere. This year 150,000 log trucks, including B-doubles, will take those destroyed forests to the woodchip mills to be exported to Japan and China, where they are processed into paper and ultimately end up on the rubbish tips of the Northern Hemisphere. The woodchips are being exported not only at the greatest rate in history but also at the lowest price in history for the fewest jobs in history. 
Prime Minister Howard, when he signed the regional forest agreement in Tasmania in 1997, to howls of protest from the Tasmanian people, said that the regional forest agreement would produce jobs. What you will not get in the debate that is going to follow on this legislation, from either the Liberal Party or the Labor Party—because they speak as one on this legislation—is any justification of the Prime Minister's statement, because it was a false promise. Instead of jobs being created, 1,000 jobs have been lost in the industry even though the rate of destruction has increased. That is because the sawloggers and the downstream processors in Tasmania are losing out. More than 90 per cent of the destroyed forests, the trees being cut down in these grand eucalypt and rainforests, in Tasmania is going to the woodchip mill. The latest count was 93 per cent. That means that, for every truck that gets to the sawmill for downstream processing, seven are going to the woodchip mills where the chips are sent to Japan and now, through Gunns, to China.
The opinion polls show that in my home state, as in the rest of the country, 70 to 90 per cent of people are opposed to this process. But we will find in the voting pattern on the vote we are about to have and in the coming days in debate on this matter that more than 70 per cent of the politicians are with the woodchippers. So there we have the dynamic: most Australians are opposed to this process and most politicians are in favour of it. We may ask: how can that be? The fact is that a corrupt process is afoot, whereby there is money going into the coffers of the political parties which is influencing the outcome of the political process. And the money is coming from the very logging companies that are going to gain from this piece of legislation. During the course of this debate over the coming month I will be seeking some explanation from the political parties about that process of influence, because it needs to be discovered.
If you look at it more carefully, the process in Tasmania is much more dangerous in this legislation than just validating the regional forest agreement. I again ask for a copy of the legislation to be given to me. We are debating this matter without any member of the chamber having a copy in front of them, and I do not think that is fair or proper—but it shows how this debate is going to be run. It is going to be run with an unenlightened Senate, ignorant of the impact of this legislation. Members of the Labor Party will join members of the Liberal Party and the National Party, ignorant of the economic and employment impacts of this legislation on their electorates, and simply vote for the legislation as it goes through to benefit the big end of town, which is the woodchip corporations. 
When you look at the impact on the economies in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia where the woodchip industry operates and where regional forest agreements have been signed or put forward, you can see that the public loses out all the way down the line. There is in this legislation provision for compensation. Who gets the compensation? The woodchip corporations do. Under this legislation, there is compensation if a future federal government moves under public pressure to protect a world heritage forest, such as the Weld Valley or the Great Western Tiers in Tasmania, or the Tarkine Wilderness in the north-west of Tasmania, or the tallest forests of the lot in the Styx Valley. Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not appreciate members walking between you and me when I am debating an important matter.
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator O'Brien, that is not an appropriate standard. I ask that you maintain the standards of the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is it within standing orders to debate the detail of the bill when we are actually debating a notice to suspend the provisions of standing order 111?
—The question is that the bill be exempt from standing order 111. I would ask Senator Brown to confine his remarks to the issues relating to that motion.
—And you will find me doing that. I have done so far and I will continue to do so. The Leader of the Government in the Senate should know that you cannot debate whether a bill is urgent or not without looking at what the bill means. It will be interesting to see if the leader of the government gets up and defends the urgency of this legislation when the opportunity arises.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: is the senator now canvassing your ruling?
—As I heard the senator, I understood him to be saying he was abiding by my ruling.
—You are right, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the honourable leader is simply wasting time.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: you actually upheld my point of order, which was that Senator Brown should restrict himself to matters relating to the suspension of the provisions of standing order 111. He certainly was not, and that is why you called him to order. He is canvassing, and he should not canvass your ruling.
—I drew the senator's attention to the terms of this debate, and, in his comments subsequent to that, he indicated that it was his intention to confine his remarks to matters relating to the suspension of standing orders. I will be listening very carefully to ensure that he abides by that commitment.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do hope the honourable member opposite stops wasting the chamber's time, because this is a very important matter. I want to get back to the matter at hand, which is the lack of urgency with this legislation. But with that comes the very important consideration for the Australian public, and that is that it has time to know what is in legislation that is before this chamber and that it has time to feed back to the members of this chamber so that the debate can be in the interests of the wider Australian public—not simply the well-heeled lobby groups and the woodchip corporations, which have got the Labor Party to join the government in railroading this legislation through this chamber. A simple question arises: of all the legislation that a new government can bring forward in the interests of the people of Australia in the first week of a Senate sitting, is the regional forest agreements legislation, which has been before this chamber three times in the last three years, the most urgent? Is that what the government is saying? That is what the government is trying to put forward here, and patently it is not true. Patently, that is false. 
The urgent component of this legislation is that the public be aware of what it contains and that there be full and proper debate on its contents and its ramifications. What I was saying earlier, before I was interrupted by the leader opposite—who will have his opportunity—was that this legislation has in it a compensation mechanism for the woodchip corporations. Is that an urgent matter? Only if the woodchip corporations believe that they are moving into forests of world heritage value, like the Tarkine, the Great Western Tiers and the Styx Valley—which contains the tallest forest in the Southern Hemisphere and, indeed, the tallest forest anywhere outside North America. That forest is about to be razed, chainsawed down from end to end, by the woodchip corporations. 
The only way that you could argue that this matter is urgent is if the government and the opposition believe that the increasing tide of public horror at what regional forest agreements mean for those forests is going to prevent them being logged. In that situation, this legislation will lead to the woodchip corporations being compensated out of taxpayers' money for those forests as if they were a pile of woodchips. In other words, if a minister of the federal parliament responds to public pressure instead of to the woodchip corporations' moves to protect world heritage value forests in Tasmania, if this legislation is passed, then the woodchip corporation will put its hand out for tens of millions of dollars in payout from the taxpayers' pockets—even though the woodchip corporation never paid a red cent towards those forests.
What is urgent here is that we look at the economics and the dynamics of this industry in the small state of Tasmania. How is it that in Tasmania we have the biggest per capita income from exports of any state in the Commonwealth, in an average period of statistics, but the poorest people in Australia? It is because the Labor Party and the Liberal Party serially intervene on behalf of big extractive industries like the woodchippers to feather their bed against the interests of the public who own those resources. Here we have it writ large, because the compensation in this legislation goes to the woodchip corporations if they are denied access to destroying heritage forests and wildlife in Tasmania. 
Where is the compensation mechanism for the workers who are being sacked from that industry by the woodchip corporations while the CFMEU and the Labor Party sit on their hands and say nothing? Where is the compensation mechanism in this legislation for local government in Tasmania, which pays millions of dollars each year on the upgrade of roads damaged by huge log trucks hurtling along them to the woodchip mills, and for the Roads and Transport Division of the state Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources?
—Order! Senator Brown, please confine your remarks to the motion before the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I am going to do that and I will continue to do that, but if the Leader of the Government in the Senate wants to indicate to you that he has a point he should get to his feet and make it. Where is the urgency—and the government can respond to this—in putting through a piece of legislation which is going to leave local government, state government and the people of Tasmania out of pocket without compensation but which will have the big woodchip companies, like Gunns, potentially putting their hands out for millions of dollars and then exporting those profits to shareholders out of state? Where is the urgency in this piece of legislation? It is not there.
It is up to the government and their fellow travellers in this matter, the Labor Party— who failed in the defence of even the workers' interests in this matter—to justify the urgency of this legislation. I am making this move at the dawn of this new parliament because I believe the government and the Labor Party should justify their actions when they try to upset the forms of this Senate to urgently deal with a piece of legislation which patently is not urgent. It was not urgent enough for the government and the opposition to put it through during the last period of parliament. It was not urgent enough for the last Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey, to bring it on in the last six months of the last parliament. He brought it on in the last week when it was too late. It was not urgent enough for him to bring it on during the last six months of that parliament until the death knock, so why has it now suddenly become urgent? What is in the `minor amendment' from the minister that makes the legislation so urgent that it should be debated today? 
This is a travesty of the forms of the Senate. That is why I am objecting to it. This is not an urgent piece of legislation. The whole notion of urgency, which allows pieces of legislation to be put through quickly when it is in the public interest, is being abused by the government that moves this motion and by the opposition that, so weakly, is going to support it. It is being abused in the interests of the big end of town—the woodchip corporations; the donors to the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party. I object to that. If there is now an urgency which did not exist in the last period of parliament, when this could have been brought through and debated at leisure, let the government or the opposition state what it is. If they say, `Well, it didn't get through last time,' let them explain why they did not get it through, because they had the numbers.
The Labor Party is acting in an appalling fashion here. It should hang its head in shame. It has sold out the workers—1,000 have lost their jobs since the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania—and what has the Labor Party or the CFMEU done about that? They have never stepped off a footpath. But when the corporations say, `Jump! Make this urgent!' they jump, because that is who they serve. That is who the Labor Tasmanian government serves, that is who the Labor opposition in this place serves and that is who the government in this place is serving. We will debate this in full in the coming debate, but I object to the process now being used whereby this spurious claim of urgency means that this is the first piece of legislation we deal with in this parliament when there are so many more important issues that we should be debating.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-02-13,"I think we ought to come back to what the motion is about. I certainly would not be voting for this motion if I considered it to be a travesty of the forms of this Senate, as has been suggested by Senator Brown. I do not believe it is. This matter has been around for five years and we saw the legislation last year. I certainly have a copy of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002—I do not know whether Senator Brown has a copy—and I have had a look at it. It is not very different from the matter we were discussing last year.
Everybody knows the story, and we can debate the merits or otherwise of the legislation when it comes on. This is not the time to debate the merits or otherwise of the legislation, but the issues are the same now as they were previously. I appeal to you to get this matter out of the road. There are lots of people who want certainty in this particular area, particularly the workers. That is what is of concern, I hope, to the whole of the Senate. If I thought that this was a travesty of the forms of this Senate, I would not vote for this particular resolution, but I do not think it is because this matter has been around for so long. The sooner we get to debate the merits of the issue, the better.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-13,"—The Australian Democrats very strongly oppose this motion, possibly for slightly different or for extra reasons beyond those that have already been put forward. I acknowledge that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 in the form in which it has been presented is basically the same as a bill that has been around for a while. Obviously, the issue of forestry has been around for a while, but I think that makes it all the more important that this not be rushed. The issue has been around for while, but an examination of how RFAs have been operating in practice for that period has not happened. 
I was part of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into the original legislation in, I think, about 1998 or early 1999, and the issues that have arisen in the three years since then are enormously important, and the Senate and its committees have not had an opportunity to examine those. In their previous term, the government went out of their way to deny that there were any issues there at all, despite their being repeatedly raised by people in this section of the chamber. There are enormous concerns about how the existing regional forest agreements are operating. To move towards fast-tracking legislation that will lock them in place for an incredibly long time is, I believe, very irresponsible.
So, from the Democrats' point of view, this is not so much an objection in terms of process as an objection in terms of the content and the importance of the issue. When the bill was around last year, we did not get the opportunity to examine it in the context of all the broader issues, so in a sense we would be debating the bill in complete isolation from the reality of the outside world. The bill is simply an attempt to lock in existing forestry practices for an extended period, under pain of immense financial cost to the taxpayer if there is any change. There are lots of ironies in relation to that, particularly the fact that this government, so-called believers in market forces, should be taking such an enormous protectionist measure as the one they are taking in this regard. But perhaps that is a debate in terms of the substance of the bill which I can go into at a later stage, whenever we do finally get around to debating the bill itself.
Obviously, the government wishes for that to occur sooner rather than later, but enabling this legislation to be fast-tracked without it being examined in the context of all the issues it is meant to be addressing is, in the Democrats' view, a significant problem. It is a piece of legislation that is specifically meant to provide so-called certainty for the forestry industry in certain regions of Australia, and yet we are expected to debate and approve it—or otherwise—without actually looking at what the reality is with forestry operations in Australia. And, from the Democrats' point of view, the reality is pretty tragic and getting worse: it has been getting worse for quite a period of time but, since the original Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 appeared, things have been getting enormously worse. To not acknowledge, address and examine those things is, frankly, irresponsible. 
As senators will be aware, I have a motion on the Notice Paper to refer this bill off to a committee. Obviously, that can still be done, regardless of whether or not the bill is exempted from the cut-off. I am as always attempting to be constructive in relation to this: it is not just a tactic to put it off into the never-never. It would be a very short time span, but it would enable the Senate to at least make a more informed decision about what it is doing. That is basically the core of the issue. We can forget to some extent our differing views about forestry operations and the immense control that the woodchipping corporations have over processes at the moment. We can put them to one side and debate those when the bill comes up, but in terms of our responsibilities as a legislative chamber to make informed decisions about legislation—laws of the land which will have major impacts on a lot of people for a long period—to do so in ignorance of what the reality is in relation to that area of activity in the community is unacceptable and inappropriate.
When we consider legislation, we all have a responsibility to make sure—as much as we can—that we do it in as informed a way as possible, and we have a particular responsibility to inform ourselves about what the reality is in the real world, what our decision is going to mean in terms of its impacts. This is not just an intellectual debate here. This is not just a debating society. It is not just a question of who can shout the loudest or who can turn people around to different ideologies. It is a matter of decisions we make affecting people in the real world—in the outside world. In that sense, I think it is completely inappropriate for us to not be ensuring that we are informed about what the circumstances are in those areas of activity that the legislation will affect. 
By agreeing to this motion, we will certainly put ourselves in a position where the government will be able to bring on the bill as soon as it wants, and we all know they want to bring it on tomorrow, and, therefore, we will be in a situation where we will be debating the bill without an awareness of what its impacts are going to be. It is a fundamental principle that you do not pass laws without some idea of what the impacts of those laws are going to be and of what the activities of the industry or operation that the law seeks to regulate or affect are.
It is probably an appropriate point, given that we are moving now into a new parliament, to again reconsider what our role as a chamber actually is. We have had all the historical backward glancing in the last year about this 100 years of Federation and, of course, that means 100 years of federal parliament. We have looked at how that has evolved over those 100 years, and we have looked at the role of the federal Senate over those 100 years—it is now even more important than ever. The Senate has now quite clearly evolved into the only mechanism that provides any protection for the people of Australia against absolute power on the part of the executive.
That is a very heavy responsibility. It is certainly one the Democrats take seriously. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that, given that this is the first real debating day of this new parliament. Given that I am looking at this from an historical note at the moment, if we compare the number of bills that went through this chamber in the three years of the last parliament—the number of different pieces of legislation—and the number that went through in the first federal parliament from 1901 to 1903, they are absolutely beyond compare. 
I do not know the precise figures off the top of my head. I know the number of bills put before this chamber in the last three years was in the high 500s. In that time we would have had at best, I would think, 200 sitting days. We are almost to the stage of three bills per day that we are supposed to consider in an informed way. Obviously, some of them are minor procedural bills, but some of them are major. This is a very small bill with major impacts. I think it gets us off to a very bad start as a new parliament for our first act to basically enable the government to ensure that the Senate cannot perform its appropriate role of reviewing legislation in an informed way. 
If that is the start that we are going to have in relation to the operations of this new parliament, I think it is a pretty bad sign. It is a worrying sign for the people of Australia, because laws affect people. If the numbers keep increasing by the same rate as they have over the last decade or two, the chances are that we will have over 600 pieces of legislation in this parliament. If this year is anything to go by, the number of days will decrease. The number of sitting days the government is suggesting for the Senate this year is an absolute disgrace—the lowest number of sitting days in a non-election year since, I think, the 1950s. It is a joke in terms of our role and responsibility. This gets us off to a very bad start in terms of our actual role.
It is worth noting that in addition to those nearly 600 pieces of legislation, the number of pieces of delegated legislation, regulations et cetera have gone through the roof. They are into the thousands. The list of the different bits of regulations, orders and disallowable instruments that was tabled yesterday, our first day, would have had over 100 on it. There is no way that any of us can pretend that those are going to be examined and the implications of them understood by anybody in this chamber. Half of the time they are probably not understood by the ministry that is putting them forward. They certainly cannot be absorbed, analysed and assessed by this chamber. 
That is not devaluing the very important work that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee does in keeping an eye on those matters. They keep an eye on them in a procedural sense and for basic legal appropriateness. They do not assess them in a policy way—neither does this chamber, nobody does. I think it is a growing problem that the public is unaware of and which they need to become aware of. We are a law-making body and we are not in a position to do our job properly.  
If this government keeps up what it has proposed for this year, less than 60 sitting days for the Senate in one year, it will mean fewer sitting days and more legislation. It will get up towards four bills per day in effect. There will be thousands of pieces of regulations and ordinances that will be barely looked at in a policy sense. All of this has some effect on people in various ways— some small, some enormous. They would not be being done if they did not have some effect. I think it is a growing problem that really needs to be acknowledged. 
Without straying too far from the topic under consideration, I think it is an issue that we, as legislators, need to turn our minds to. We are obviously running a real risk when legislation, not just regulations, is going to be passed without proper objective assessment. Obviously you cannot trust the government to always act in the interests of the people. Separate to that, they do not always get it right as well. If it is hard for this chamber to be aware of what is happening in the real world then it is even more remote for people in the bureaucracies and ivory towers who devise the legislation to be aware. 
Coming back to the particular legislation that we are proposing to bring on immediately for debate, I am absolutely certain that the federal department responsible for this is blissfully unaware of what the reality is on the ground in terms of the impact on the environment, the impact on the workers and the impact on the communities in the regions where these forestry agreements operate. The federal department makes a point of being blissfully unaware. They do not want to know. 
This legislation is their final way of being able to keep their blindfold on for 20 years. They can say, `It is all locked in, we do not need to bother now. We will forget about it. We will leave it up to somebody else.' We cannot afford to leave it up to somebody else, in the Democrats' view. That is the sort of thing that we need to examine, at a minimum. Is it something that we can leave up to somebody else? What are those other people doing? Are they operating in an appropriate way? In the Democrats' view they are clearly not—and in many other people's view, not just those in political parties, they are not. We have seen the situation in the Gippsland in recent times where the forestry workers have got together with conservationists to work out a different path because they have acknowledged on all sides that the regional forestry agreement they are operating under is making things worse from every perspective.
It does not matter which approach you take, which angle you come at this issue from. You can come at it from an environmental view, you can come at it from an employment view and you can come at it from an economic view: they are failing on all grounds. For us to agree to putting a piece of legislation through that addresses this crucial area—a crucial area of public policy that is blatantly, in the Democrats' view, failing on all grounds—is incredibly irresponsible. That is why we are so strongly opposed to this legislation being considered by this chamber straightaway without an attempt to acknowledge that, without an attempt to hear from the people on the ground. Forget about all our views for the moment; we need to hear what other people's views are, what the public's views are.
Three or four years down the track from when the legislation was originally proposed, so many things have changed. We have had Western Australia with a Labor government being elected in that time in part—a very significant part—because of its policy shift to abolish logging in old-growth forests, a key area that this legislation goes to the heart of. When this bill first appeared and we had our inquiry into it, that had not happened: Labor in WA supported ongoing logging— the government in WA supported it. There has been a big change, a very positive change, since that time.
Since that time three or four years ago in my state of Queensland, we have seen the Queensland government, in conjunction with environmentalists and the timber industry, develop a very positive agreement that phases out logging in old-growth forests, that builds a sustainable timber industry. Of course, it shows how farcical this government's approach to it is that the one forestry agreement that has been developed and agreed upon broadly by all sides is that which the federal government would not acknowledge. Now that we have a new minister in this area—and a Queenslander as well—in Senator Ian Macdonald, I hope that he will act in the interests of his own state of Queensland, endorse that agreement and provide some backup and assistance. The one positive agreement is the one that the government refuses to acknowledge, and so it actually would not be affected by this piece of legislation. They are the sorts of double standards we have operating here. 
Since this bill originally came forward three or four years ago, we have had enormous developments in New South Wales, in Victoria, in Tasmania—in all of these areas and from all aspects. It is a complete furphy to suggest that this is just a fringe opposition by hardline environmentalists like Senator Brown or the Democrats. The concern is across the community—in Tasmania more than anywhere else—and from all aspects, about the social damage that is being caused, the economic absurdities that are operating and the irreversible environmental damage. We will not be able to examine any of that. We will obviously try and bring it to the attention of the Senate during the debate. But we will not be able to hear from the people on the ground, the communities that are being devastated because of the distorted way in which the woodchip industry has twisted forestry operations. We will deliberately be making ourselves ignorant of the views of the reality of what is happening in the community. 
This is a major issue and, for that reason alone, we should be making sure it does not just become one of the 600 faceless bills that we vaguely glance at as they roll through this sausage machine, with more and more being forced through in a shorter and shorter time frame. When we all know this is such a big issue, it is all the more irresponsible for us to keep ourselves blindfolded to the outside world in considering this particular legislation. So the Democrats very strongly oppose this motion. We think it is an appalling starting point for a new parliament and it sets a very bad tone for where we might be going, not just in the environment but also in terms of any consideration for the community.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-02-13,"—Well, I have heard it all. Senator Bartlett's contribution on behalf of the Democrats about this bill supposedly being rushed through without objective assessment and without our taking into account the facts when we consider the debate remind me of the arrangement that the Democrats entered into with the government for the passage of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. I think we were allowed an average of 20 seconds to debate each of the amendments, which we had not seen, and we were not going to be allowed to vote individually on each amendment. That was the arrangement that the Democrats entered into on that piece of legislation.
This legislation has, in effect, been before this parliament twice, has been to Senate committees twice and was the subject of debate in the last election—when the opposition and the government made it clear that they would support its expeditious passage. The opposition, in supporting this motion, is keeping its word, having allowed extensive community debate in relation to it. I want to contrast that with the sort of treatment that we received in relation to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill when it came through this place. I find it astonishing that the Democrats have the gall to stand up and say what Senator Bartlett has just said about bills being rushed through without objective assessment, when they were party to that treatment we received. 
In press reports on Monday, 11 February, Senator Bartlett comments that if the Democrats `fail to get the bill killed' they will attempt to have it examined by a Senate committee `to ensure its full ramifications are assessed'. So, point 1 is `get the bill killed' and point 2 is have a Senate inquiry. They are the priorities that the Democrats set down when they spoke to the media through Senator Bartlett on Monday.
Senator Brown has suggested that this bill is not so urgent as to require exemption from the procedural rules that prevent it from being debated within 14 days of its introduction. The fact is that this bill is, as I understand it, substantially the same bill as was introduced into the parliament in August last year. It is substantially the same bill which has been the subject of a reference to a Senate legislation committee. This is substantially the same bill, as I understand it, on which both the opposition and the minor parties have had the opportunity to prepare amendments.  
If I understand Senator Brown's comments in the same media articles on Monday, he indeed has already prepared amendments to the legislation. So, to the extent that he might suggest that he is disadvantaged by the expeditious processing of this legislation, I suggest his own comments reveal that that is not the case—that Senator Brown is well aware of the legislation and that in fact he simply does not want it to be passed. I understand that and I respect Senator Brown's motives in pursuing his agenda and the agenda of his party—it is his entitlement to do that—but I do not believe there is merit in the suggestion that somehow dealing with this legislation now will prevent him from putting his point of view. Neither would it prevent the Democrats nor any other party from putting its point of view.
In terms of Senator Bartlett's comments that somehow the passage of this legislation will put on the blindfold, I accept that this somewhat goes to the question of debating the bill. But it was raised in the debate so I feel I should respond to it. Each of the RFAs has five-year review provisions. Far from putting the blindfold on proceedings for 20 years, there are, in regional forest agreements, provisions for regular reviews so that the concerns which are being expressed can be addressed and there can be public debate about those matters. There are a great many reasons why the opposition supports the legislation, but we believe that it is appropriate that the legislation be dealt with now, that it is important that it be dealt with now and that there is no disadvantage to other parties in dealing with the legislation now, given that it is substantially the same as the bill which was introduced into the parliament in August last year. We will be supporting the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-02-13,"—In relation to the exemption of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 under standing order 111, I believe it is proper to support this motion of the government, because in no way does it reduce this chamber's ability to have a full and frank debate on it. On the issue of urgency, I believe it is urgent for two reasons. Firstly, it is urgent for the people who are participating within the industry. Secondly, there are environmental issues that we need to address. As long as there is uncertainty within the industry in Australia, we will continue to see huge imports of timber from overseas—and I would be interested later on to direct, through the chair, a question to Senator Brown as to how he reconciles the total devastation of the environment in countries such as Indonesia while Australia continues to import from those areas. We have an environmentalist saying, `You can't log in Australia because that is destroying the environment,' but at the same time he is effectively causing utter devastation in countries that do not have a managed approach towards harvesting timber products. For those two reasons, One Nation supports the government's position in bringing this bill on.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-02-13,"—I congratulate Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett for achieving their aim of speaking for their full 20 minutes. For Senator Brown it was not much of a struggle, but Senator Bartlett was clearly struggling after about nine minutes of trying. We should understand, and those hundreds of thousands of people across Australia tuning in to the Parliamentary News Network should understand—
—They're switched off.
—Senator Bartlett probably was not too good for the ratings, I have to say. It is only 7.30 a.m. in Perth, where it really counts. We have probably lost all the listeners. I say sorry to PNN—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Besides the snide remarks about Senator Bartlett, the parliamentary secretary on his feet took a number of points of order about straying from the subject, and I would ask you to bring him back to it. This is an urgency debate. 
 (Senator Chapman)—I ask the parliamentary secretary to confine his remarks to the question before the chair. I am sure that he will, as I previously asked Senator Brown.
—That is quite right. I certainly would not want to be referred to as the pot calling the kettle black. There are a number of things that Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett said during the debate that were either misleading or just plain wrong. The issue about the legislation has been dealt with by Senator Harradine— that is, that the legislation has been around for some years. In fact, I think the Tasmanian RFA is actually up for review now. This legislation has been around for so long that the Commonwealth has not been able to pass the legislation to uphold the Commonwealth's commitments to the RFA process for a period of years, basically because we could not get it through the Senate.
—You should have introduced it then.
—We have introduced it more times than I have had hot breakfasts in the last year. It is a matter of record that the review of one of the RFAs is coming up before we can actually get the legislation through the Commonwealth parliament. To use Senator Brown's words, this is far from fast-tracking legislation. It is more like Bob Dylan's famous album Slow Train Coming. This has been a very long and slow and tortuous process. The government did make a commitment on the second last sitting day, two sitting days ago, on 26 September. Senator Hill gave an undertaking to this chamber and to the people of Australia that we would introduce this legislation on the first sitting day, which we are doing. It is the first day of government business today. We are upholding that. I think that is the appropriate thing to do. Certainly I, as the manager, made commitments publicly and in this place to do exactly what we are doing now. So I think it is quite appropriate that we do that.
Could I go to the point about this being some sort of affront to the forms of the Senate. The reality of the sitting schedule for this week and the reality of the standing orders is that if Senator Bartlett had his way the Senate would not actually be able to deal with any legislation at all this week. The Senate regularly decides whether or not bills can be exempted from the cut-off order and makes those decisions. What we are talking about here is not spending two back to back speeches of 20 minutes explaining why a couple of senators and their parties do not want to deal with something. What we are trying to do—and I am grateful for the Labor Party's support in this issue—is to allow the bill to be debated. I am sure it is just an idealistic pipedream from my point of view, Mr Acting Deputy President—and you would probably agree with me—but it would be very good if the Senate could ensure that important legislation was debated.
We will have, I am sure, the first significant filibuster of the 2002 parliamentary term, the 40th Parliament of Australia, on this bill because any time you have a bill with anything to do with an RFA Senator Brown finds as many opportunities as possible to get up and speak for his full allotted time. It is the great art of filibuster. The trouble is we will spend a couple of weeks doing the RFA Bill. It will not be an informative debate because it will be tedious repetition. It will be filibustering. He will do whatever he can to slow the passage of the legislation, and at the end of the sitting periods leading into the Easter recess we will have a backlog of 20 other bills which will not get proper consideration.
Senator Bartlett makes some fair points about the parliament's consideration of bills. It has got to be within the hands of the Senate to ensure that all of the bills get an adequate time for debate. I have been the manager here for a long time, and I know the reality in this place is that in a normal sitting week we do one or two major bills during the government business period. The statistics will bear this out. I would be happy for Senator Bartlett to look at these statistics. We tend to do one or two major bills during Monday through to Thursday and they usually get very thorough debate. In the Thursday lunchtime period, we have what is called the non-controversial timeslot when pieces of legislation which are fairly rudimentary and, as we have come to call them, non-controversial—where every single senator in the place has said, `Yes, we have no objection to that; put it through'—are dealt with. Most of those bills go through in two or three minutes on what we call a tick and a flick, which is probably very unparliamentary language and not a great description of the process, but they get through all of their stages in a short period because they are non-controversial. When you look at the statistics that Senator Bartlett refers to, on the face of them they can look like the parliament is not giving things proper scrutiny. I do not think Senator Bartlett set out to cause affront to members of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee or other senators who do spend enormous amounts of time looking at legislation. Not only do the Senate committees spend a lot of time looking at every piece of legislation or regulations of any interest to them but there are backbench committees. I am sure the Democrats themselves have committees in their own party processes. I am sure the caucus has subcommittees that deal with any issue that comes before them. 
I think that Australians are very well served by the process. I think the weight of legislation, although it is heavy, is dealt with very effectively by the committee structure and by the Senate as a whole. This Senate is very accessible to the people of Australia. It is one of the great benefits of the structure of our federation. There are 12 senators from each state. They all make themselves accessible. They are spread throughout the states and, if anyone has any concern with any proposed piece of legislation, one of us usually hears about it. I think we have a lot to be proud of. I do not think the statistics that Senator Bartlett puts forward in relation to all these hundreds of pieces of legislation paint a fair picture.
I should point out that in this particular piece of legislation there are two relatively small changes. The first is a change to the commencement provisions, which one would expect, the bill having been in and out for the last four years. It includes a new form which will be used in all bills introduced into the parliament from the autumn sittings in 2002. It is a technical matter; it does not go to the substance of the legislation at all. The other is some minor amendments which relate to the interaction between the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which has come into force since the RFA was first drawn up. Of course, those two pieces of legislation need to work together. These changes are minor and technical. Otherwise the bill really has not changed very much at all. To be able to deal with it we do need this motion to pass. It is very appropriate that the Senate does this. But I remind you, as I started off, that what we are doing here is trying to pass a motion so the bill and its provisions can be debated. I say: let the debate begin.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-02-13,"—Some of those remarks of Senator Lundy's were quite interesting, and I cannot wait to hear what the rest of her speech contains. I rise to speak today in this matters of public interest debate to, in part, acknowledge Senator Hutchins's invitation in last night's adjournment debate—I acknowledge it with care, given that he is from the New South Wales Right and one would count one's fingers afterwards if one shook his hand—and to confirm the record on the issue of asylum seekers which, unlike Senator Hutchins's implications, does not require correction.
I note that our colleague had never spoken in the Senate, as far as I can ascertain, on either immigration or mandatory detention before last night. Given that he is a newcomer to this debate and would not have any of the depth of your expertise, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I am very happy to explain some of these issues on which I have been focused for a very extended period of time. Perhaps the good senator's background as a prominent New South Wales trade union official and leader of the ALP's New South Wales Right explain his basic contempt for compassion and his oversimplistic, combative approach to an issue that calls for serious-minded debate and a concern for some of the victims of global politics; or perhaps it is just easier to throw stones and make no constructive contribution oneself. Only he could tell us that.
It was alleged in this chamber last night that my position on refugee policy has been inconsistent. Quite the contrary: I have indeed maintained a very consistent position on issues relevant to mandatory detention, immigration and the international movement of people. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee I have chaired several inquiries into aspects of migration law and immigration law and practice in Australia. I am, in another capacity, a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and participated in that inquiry into detention centres. I have visited detention centres in Australia on more than one occasion. Last year I visited and inspected Tinsley House immigration detention centre in the United Kingdom. I visited the port of Dover and met with staff from the Migrant Helpline and senior officers of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I met with and was briefed by officials from the United Kingdom's Home Office concerning immigration, detention and border control. I have considered in some depth the policy implications of different national approaches, including our own, and more particularly the international macro issues involved.
I have applied what I hope has been some knowledge developed in this process and some experience in these matters to contribute to debate in the community, within my party room and within the parliament. I have spoken not as a bleeding heart, which apparently is a pejorative in Senator Hutchins's view, but as someone who realises the practical challenges facing government. I strongly endorse the government's desire to maintain a balanced migration plan, which includes a generous humanitarian component but focuses on skilled and family reunion streams. I support the UNHCR's assessment and resettlement program, and I actively and vehemently discourage and oppose people smuggling. That in no way detracts from the concern that I hold for the people in this process and most particularly for asylum seekers. I do not step back one centimetre from focusing this chamber on the plight of, for example, Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, detainees in Aranya Prathet in Thailand, or the living conditions of women under the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan—issues on which I have spoken at length in the past.
Senator Hutchins said that I had a series of different public positions on issues concerning refugees. He said of my speech of 19 September 2001 that he felt I was wearing my heart on my sleeve and criticised me for showing `compassion'. He said last night that a letter I sent to constituents in Eden-Monaro was inconsistent with my speech in the Senate. To assist in this process, I would like to compare the two. In my speech on 19 September I said: 
I want to emphasise, as the Prime Minister has, that we and every country have the right to decide who comes to our country and in what circumstances. 
In a letter I wrote to constituents in New South Wales, I wrote:
I share the Prime Minister's belief that Australians should decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.
In my speech I said:
I abhor people smuggling ... and we should strengthen our provisions in dealing with that.
In the letter I said:
I share his—
referring to the Prime Minister's—
commitment to upgrade our maritime surveillance capability by purchasing new long range surveillance aircraft and state of the art radar and telecommunications technology.
So I think that refutes, very effectively, the implications made in Senator Hutchins's speech last night. He would do well to re-examine the record. I repeat today the call that I made in my speech on 19 September that we should look at the challenges that the UNHCR faces and the lack of resettlement programs in other refugee convention signatory countries. There are, after all, 139 signatories to the convention and only 12 countries which, in any real substance, take in refugees for permanent resettlement. I maintain that the United Nations is capable of taking a lead on this issue and should consider convening a special session on refugees, reviewing the implications and the operation of the UN convention in the 21st century. 
I might be criticised for being a bleeding heart, but at least, unlike my critic, I have taken the time and effort to consider this issue and make a contribution to the discussion. I am proud to have taken a compassionate stand on the position of women and children, and I do not shrink from my earlier comments in that regard. I maintain that detention centres are no places for women and children, and I commend the minister, as I have previously, for the Woomera trial release of women and children from detention. 
I will spend a moment talking about those alternative detention arrangements for some women and children detained at the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre in South Australia. The first volunteers were moved into accommodation in the Woomera township on 7 August last year for a project that will run for between three and six months. They will be constantly monitored and evaluated by DIMIA. Woomera was chosen because it is close to an established community, which makes it easier to establish the new procedures required. Those arrangements were put in place only after extensive consultations with the Woomera community, a number of federal departments, the South Australian government, and leaders of ethnic community groups. The eligible women include women with children who have a family member remaining at Woomera, their female children of any age, and their male children 12 years of age and under.
I go back to the point that I made in September and have made on a number of occasions since. This is not just a problem for Australia. This is an international problem of the 20th and 21st centuries—people movement. It is one of the impacts of globalisation. It is one of the impacts of conflict. I take up Senator Scullion's words in his first speech today: if someone rings you and tells you they have the answer, hang up. It is not that easy to solve. It is a problem which Australia and other Western developed nations and other signatories to the refugee convention of 1951 have an obligation to pursue on an international and cooperative basis. It will not benefit in any way, shape or form from cheap, simple, base politics.
I note that in his remarks last night my New South Wales Senate colleague indicated that he was concerned by some attendance of mine at rallies. I am assuming he did not mean the launch of a website which I attended last year on behalf of the Attorney-General at HREOC. They would find it confusing to hear that launch described as `a rally'. I assume he did not mean my representation of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the closing ceremony of the International Human Rights Day event on 10 December by Vietnamese youth groups and Amnesty International. If perchance it was the latter, then perhaps the remarks I made then should be put on the record here today. I said then: 
... now more than ever human rights must be defended by countries such as Australia, not only for our own citizens but for those who live in other countries, who by no fault of their own, find themselves in situations of unrest.
I do not think that is an unreasonable proposition. It would be stretching a very long bow to describe it as such. 
It is not entirely surprising that the speech made by Senator Hutchins last night did not contain a great deal of substance. He has been otherwise occupied in the public examination of post-election entrails, which can be a very time consuming process. In the Australian on Monday, 3 December last year in an article with the subheading `The New South Wales Right's disintegration is pregnant with national implications', Glenn Milne said:
In the words of one senior Left figure who's watching the entire saga with delight: `Leo's got no friends. One thing about the NSW Right, when there's a carcass swinging in the breeze they'll devour the lot.' Yet McLeay thinks he's still kicking. When he was bulldozed by Crean over the new frontbench, one of the victims was McLeay's mate, former Transport Workers Union boss and state Labor president Steve Hutchins. In tried-and-true fashion, McLeay put his mate up for the frontbench. Crean knocked him over.
Hutchins, according to those close to the event, has been in a rage ever since. The pair have been plotting revenge.
And so the entrails go on in Mr Milne's article. One imagines that coming to matters of substance might be something which is not a current focus for the good senator. 
The most enormous pleasure I have gained since I was appointed to the Senate in 1997 is being based in Sydney's Greater West: a burgeoning economy, an amazing landscape and amazing people who have shown their wisdom through their voting intentions in a way I never would have thought possible. In Lindsay in 1996, we won the seat with an 11.8 per cent swing to the Liberal Party. In 1998, the member for Lindsay, Miss Jackie Kelly, increased that swing by 0.3 per cent. In 2001, against a candidate whose name I believe was David Bradbury, who I understand had been the Mayor of Penrith and one might say a protege of Senator Hutchins, the swing achieved by Miss Kelly was 2.44 per cent. 
In Parramatta, where my office is—coincidentally, so is Senator Hutchins's office— we won the seat in 1996 with a swing of 7.11 per cent to Ross Cameron, the member for Parramatta. He managed to increase that swing by 2.8 per cent in 1998 and in many ways, like myself, was written off post-redistribution and told that Parramatta would be a very hard seat for him to hold. Ross Cameron managed to bring against David Borger, previously the Mayor of Parramatta, a swing of 3.64 per cent to retain the seat of Parramatta, somewhat handsomely for Mr Cameron.
Let me finish by referring to a seat which gives me some particular personal pleasure. The seat of Macarthur was significantly redistributed after the 1998 federal election. It changed substantially. A former employer and good friend of mine, the Hon. John Fahey, did not recontest selection for the seat of Macarthur. That preselection was won by Pat Farmer. The campaign in Macarthur was long and arduous for all concerned, but fortunately for people in Western Sydney it was won in an overwhelming fashion by Pat Farmer with an 8.65 per cent swing to the Liberal Party over the Labor Party. In one's efforts in Western Sydney and in one's activities in the parliament, it is always better to put results on the table rather than to mouth invective.

That is, did DSD collect or report on—not target—communications involving Australians? That is the issue.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-02-13,"—I am a bit puzzled by the question, so I will remind the honourable senator of exactly what I said yesterday. As Senator Faulkner knows, the usual response in these matters is to say, `I can neither confirm nor deny', but we did think that yesterday's reporting was so extraordinary—and in particular I referred to the potential damage to public confidence caused by those inaccurate reports—that it was necessary to lay a few facts on the table. What I said was that the director had confirmed that neither the communications of the Maritime Union of Australia nor of the International Transport Federation were targeted by DSD. More specifically, the director has advised that DSD did not provide any reporting to the government on communications from the MUA or the ITF.

I suspect that Senator Faulkner or certainly some on his side know what those rules are. The assurance that I have been given is that—
—They've just been put down in legislation. Everyone knows you legislated last year on them.
—No, the old rules, Senator Ray. I am talking about the old rules, and the copy I have seen was 1994, and so they clearly applied at the time of the last government and were then updated in 1998, with cabinet approval. As I understand it, they are not published rules, but DSD had to operate within them, and that is part of the safeguard and the security apparatus that exists to ensure that there is not abuse. And DSD, I am assured, with one small exception, operated within those rules.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence Signals Directorate</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,answer
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to the interception of communications by the Defence Signals Directorate and the MV Tampa.
The statement that was issued by Senator Hill last night on the involvement of the Defence Signals Directorate in eavesdropping on the Tampa has raised many more questions than it answered. As a result of Senate question time today, a number of very significant issues also now remain unanswered. What we asked Senator Hill in question time today was whether the then Minister for Defence, Mr Reith, or the government issued any request to DSD in relation to its interception of communications to and from the MV Tampa. On two occasions, direct questions from Senator Evans were not answered; Senator Hill was not willing to indicate what the situation was. And when asked, on two occasions, to give the Senate an assurance that DSD neither collected nor reported on communications involving Australian organisations or citizens, as opposed to communications originating from those organisations or citizens, again Senator Hill was not willing to provide that assurance to this chamber today.
So what we have is a situation where Senator Hill's statement of last night, compounded by his lack of information and failure to answer questions today, reinforces what today's Australian editorial has properly described as the `culture of secrecy' which is flourishing under the Howard government. Senator Hill has deliberately set out to avoid the central question in relation to this issue: whether intelligence organisations intercepted communications between the Tampa and Australian organisations or citizens and whether any intelligence gained from those intercepts was provided to the government and used by the government for political purposes. That is the crucial question, and that has not been answered by Senator Hill in question time today. 
We do not know whether communications between the MUA—who are Australian citizens, members of our community—and the ITF were collected. A lot of answers are required on these issues, and we have a situation where the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for Defence in this country, is covering up on the political abuse of Australia's intelligence services. No opposition can accept that, no parliament can accept that, and I do not believe it will be accepted by the Australian people.
We believe that due process should be brought to bear on this incident and that the veil of secrecy must be lifted. We are pleased that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has decided that he will report more fully on this matter. He appears to have done it of his own accord—that is what the minister has told us in question time today—as a result of public and parliamentary pressure. We are pleased that that has occurred. In relation to that report, a full report should be provided by the Inspector-General to the parliamentary joint committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, going to operational matters. And as much as possible, certainly all the conclusions of the Inspector General's report and whatever other details can be revealed publicly without prejudice to national security, must be tabled in this parliament and made public for the benefit of all Australians. This is a matter which requires thorough investigation.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-02-13,"—It has certainly has been a very long and hard three or four months for the opposition. Having failed to get over their pathetic effort at the last federal election, and desperately trying to find a reason to build up another head of steam, we hear Senator Faulkner launching into a tirade against Senator Hill. Senator Hill has appropriately answered the questions that needed to be answered for the Australian public. He has very appropriately and very quickly answered those questions about issues that have been aired publicly in the media and in the newspapers.
Senator Hill has reassured the Australian people. Senator Faulkner and Senator Evans would never be reassured by any answers in this place, because they would be desperately trying to find some issue on which to rebuild some sort of credibility for an Australian Labor Party that has been completely walloped in an election once again. 
Senator Faulkner and Senator Evans know that there is a longstanding tradition that the government does not comment on security and intelligence matters. But because this issue has been raised in the media, because of the seriousness of the allegations, and because the allegations have the potential to undermine public confidence, Senator Hill has quickly sought to reassure the Australian people and the members of the opposition of the situation as it stands. That is why Senator Hill has chosen to inform the Australian people of exactly what is happening: because of public comment and media speculation.
The Defence Signals Directorate have advised Senator Hill, as Minister for Defence, that they are confident that there has been one exception to strict compliance with the rules. What more could the opposition expect from the Minister for Defence, on a matter which is not normally commented on publicly, than for the minister to inform them and the Australian people that the DSD have advised the minister that they are totally confident that there has been, with one exception, strict compliance with the rules. An inadvertent error was brought to the attention of the DSD by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who found it during his regular check of the operations. The matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence, and the minister has replied quite adequately to the issue that has been raised publicly in the media and again here today by the opposition. 
Furthermore, the DSD have also advised Senator Hill that neither communications to the Maritime Union of Australia nor communications to the International Transport Federation were targeted. The minister has given these assurances, and the DSD did not provide any report to the government on communications from the MUA or the ITF, nor did it provide any transcripts of comments that were made by the MUA or the ITF. 
Can I once more reassure the people here in this chamber that Senator Hill has only departed from the longstanding tradition of not commenting on intelligence matters in order to reassure the Australian people and this Senate that there was only one breach, and he has done it because of the potential for public confidence to be undermined. We have all seen what has been written in the media over the past couple of days and the public speculation that is taking place because the issue was raised in the media. Senator Hill has sought to defuse that issue and the potential undermining of public confidence by issuing the advice that he has received from DSD that there has been strict compliance with the rules. There has been only one exception, and that exception was an inadvertent error which was brought to the attention of the DSD by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security during a regular check. Senator Evans quite rightly raised the issue, but it is wrong to suggest that the question was not answered when Senator Hill has provided all the information that it is proper to divulge. Senator Evans would be well aware, in his new role, that intelligence and security matters have to be handled very carefully, and the minister has done that in his role as Minister for Defence. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence Signals Directorate</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-02-13,"—I think today's question time and the minister's responses have been quite informative—a bit like his press release yesterday, which was as important for what it did not say as for what it did say. A careful reading of the Minister for Defence's press release yesterday raises a whole range of questions. 
The minister is very careful in his choice of words and avoids the three key issues—as I would expect Senator Hill to be careful, not only because of the portfolio but because of his vast experience in these issues. But one of the things that is most clear is that the Minister for Defence's press release does not deal with three of the key issues. There is no mention of what directives or requests were made by the government to DSD in relation to the MV Tampa, there is no mention of what use was made of the information gathered by DSD in terms of the accusations being made in the political response of the government, and there is no mention of whether or not DSD has been used to spy on Australian citizens. 
There is some reference to the MUA and the ITF—a very carefully chosen reference which does not cover all communications involving those organisations—but the key issues are not the MUA or the ITF. The key issues are whether or not DSD has been used for political purposes; whether or not Australian citizens have been spied on by one of their own defence organisations; and what the information that DSD may have gathered, either within their charter or outside their charter, has been used for and who that information has been distributed to. Those are the key issues. They are not in the Minister for Defence's defence of the government's position as released yesterday, and they were not referred to today by the minister. 
Today the minister was quite helpful in providing information about the Inspector-General's inquiry. But that is an inquiry that he is determined to take on his own initiative—a much broader inquiry, it seems, than that which was requested by the minister, and I am pleased to hear that. I want to have a look at those terms of reference that he set himself. Clearly that would be a useful thing. Labor has argued from the start that the inspector-general's role is the key role and we want him to have a proper investigation into these concerns.  
The minister was far less fulsome when he was asked the key political questions about what directives former minister Peter Reith gave to DSD and what directions were given concerning gathering information on Australian citizens, which is largely prohibited under the legislation but which is allowed in certain very specific instances. On those questions the minister was silent. In fact, he went on a great deal with border protection rhetoric et cetera—dodging the question. For anyone who did not see it, I urge them to have a look at the tape. It was classic—`I don't want to deal with this. I don't want to answer the question, so I will talk about some broader public issue and accuse the Labor Party of treasonous behaviour and lack of loyalty to the defence of Australia and I'll dodge the issue.' He did not deal with the issues that I put to him very directly, which were: what was the role of Peter Reith, the then Minister for Defence; what directives did he give; what directives did the government give to DSD in relation to collecting information concerning the Tampa and in relation to Australian citizens; and what did they do with that information? None of those questions has been commented on and we have no better information about those issues.
I think it is important that we concentrate on the fact that the DSD is required to get specific approval from the minister to do any monitoring of telecommunications involving Australian citizens. There are protections for Australian citizens, and those protections can only be overcome with the specific approval of the minister. In a letter dated 16 March 1999 to Channel 9's Sunday program, the then Director of the DSD, Martin Brady, made that very clear. He said, when talking about the rules that govern their operations in relation to Australian persons: 
The Rules do provide mechanisms to permit DSD to monitor and report foreign communications involving Australians in some special carefully-defined circumstances such as the commission of a serious criminal offence; a threat to the life or safety of an Australian; or where an Australian is acting as the agent of a foreign power. Specific approval is required for all such collection and reporting.
The question is: was specific approval given? What political directives were given to DSD to allow them to collect information on Australian citizens? In his statement, the Minister for Defence has not denied that information was collected on Australian citizens—he has not denied it at all. He has been careful in his choice of words.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-02-13,"—The Defence Signals Directorate, DSD, has to operate within the law. It operates under laws drawn up in 1994, when the Australian Labor Party were in government, and since updated. The Director of DSD has confirmed that, with one exception, he is confident that there has been strict compliance with the rules in the matters related to this border protection occurrence. Further, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who is charged with overseeing the DSD, will conduct a further inquiry to look at this inadvertent error. The law has been adhered to at all times, with this one inadvertent breach. The DSD has been properly used, and all the intelligence services have been used appropriately in this occurrence of border protection.
Every year thousands of DSD intercepts are made, and clearly you might find some intercepts which might be inadvertent. I understand that, in question time today, the Prime Minister offered the Leader of the Opposition the opportunity to be briefed confidentially on the inadvertent breaches of the thousands of intercepts over the years. The government did not need to be told by DSD what was in the nation's interest in connection with this issue and there was no targeting of the unions. In his statement yesterday, Senator Hill said:
The Director has confirmed that neither the communications of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) nor of the International Transport Federation (ITF) was targeted by the DSD.
More specifically, the Director has advised that DSD did not provide any reporting to the Government on communications from the MUA or the ITF.
If the ALP are preoccupied with these inadvertent breaches, they should go back to the time when they were in government. We use the intelligence services as any responsible government might in Australia's interests, and we certainly did in this incident of border protection. 
There is a longstanding tradition that governments do not comment on intelligence matters but, in a beat-up like this, we have to make it clear that DSD's collection and reporting activities are conducted in accordance with Australian law and a set of long-established rules to protect the privacy of Australians. As I said, these rules go back to a time when there was a Labor government. DSD's performance in relation to these rules is subject to the scrutiny of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who provides an annual report to parliament and, in this case, is making a special report at the request of Minister Hill. The DSD have advised the Minister for Defence that they are confident that, with one exception, there has been strict compliance with the rules. As I said, that exception was an inadvertent error, and inadvertent errors have a long tradition in situations where you are making thousands of intercepts a year. The DSD have advised the minister that neither the communications of the Maritime Union of Australia nor the communications of the International Transport Federation were targeted. 
This government has increased the accountability of Australia's foreign intelligence collection agencies by enacting last year, before we went to the election, the Intelligence Services Act. The act spells out the functions and responsibilities of DSD and ASIS and establishes a parliamentary joint committee to oversee the agencies' expenditure and administration. The legislation strikes the right balance between transparency and the essential need for security. The government makes no apologies for using its intelligence capability to protect our borders. It does so in a way that does not undermine the privacy of Australians and in accordance with the law. The Labor Party are intent on diminishing that capacity and, in so doing, weakening Australia's security.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence Signals Directorate</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-13,"—I have listened to Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Ferguson on this issue, and there have been undertakings that the law has been adhered to at all times. While that is refreshing indeed, there is no guarantee that that is the case because, on the admission of the Minister for Defence today, the matter has been referred to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who is conducting an inquiry. While there is an admission that there was one breach at this stage, one does not know the full extent of what the Inspector-General's inquiries will reveal. 
No-one is asking that people start commenting on intelligence matters, but this raises the issue as to whether or not DSD was receiving information which could be classified and properly labelled as intelligence issues or whether they were issues relating to the privacy of citizens or organisations in this country. That is the issue that needs to be cleared up. As has been conceded here today, what really is at stake is, firstly, the integrity of the then minister and whether there was any impropriety on his part in seeking to use the resources of DSD in a way in which those resources are not meant to be used—that is, against citizens of this country—or, secondly, whether there was any impropriety on the part of DSD in abiding by its own charter. They are the key issues.
If DSD were gathering information—obviously, there would be information which is not just intelligence on other countries—that was not about a serious criminal offence committed by an Australian, a threat to the life and safety of Australian citizens or an Australian citizen acting for a foreign power, then clearly it is not an intelligence matter. If in turn they have passed that on to the minister or the government of the day, then their powers have been abused. This has not yet been put to the test because, as the minister admitted, we have not yet seen the outcome of the inquiry that has been requested from the Inspector-General. There is a fundamental issue here as to whether we are dealing with intelligence matters or non-intelligence issues. In this day and age, people are very concerned about the eavesdropping that takes place. One should not, under any circumstances, believe that it is the old, crude phone tapping, because I do not think that has been implied or even referred to so far in this debate. 
In his statement, the minister said—and it has been said here today—that the Director of the Defence Signals Directorate has confirmed that neither the communications of the Maritime Union of Australia nor of the International Transport Federation were targeted by the DSD. The fact that they were not targeted does not mean that there was not eavesdropping of some form on either of those organisations or on other citizens of Australia. It is not simply the fact that it is either the Maritime Union of Australia or the International Transport Federation that is the important issue here; it is whether or not they were targeted. It could well be that there might not have been targeting. There may well have been interception of private citizens' discussions and those discussions have inadvertently been reported.
The statement of the minister does not dispel that and does not give the confidence that should necessarily be there in this issue. We concede that we are not seeking information on genuine intelligence issues, but the minister in no way today has denied or dispelled as a myth the idea that that information could not have been gathered on private citizens—whether it be deliberately, inadvertently or completely in error—and have been used in a political way against citizens of this nation. That, of course, is completely abhorrent to the nature of people in this country. We are a democratic, free country and people rely on the good faith of government and organisations such as the DSD to maintain that freedom and the faith we have in it. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence Signals Directorate</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-02-13,"—I join in taking note of answers given to what is really a variety of questions today in relation to DSD and the Tampa phone tapping incident, if you want to call it that. I am disturbed—as I think are many Australians—not so much by what the minister is saying but by what he is not saying. I think his answers today leave many people with a sense of discomfort. When I asked the minister precisely when the phone tapping began, he answered, in effect, `We neither confirm nor deny.' 
I can understand any government or person in public office quarantining information. I understand the difference between being open and haemorrhaging. What I do not understand and where the minister has left people feeling dissatisfied in his answer is: on what basis and for what possible reason was the government or one of its agencies listening to a Norwegian ship carrying some 438 supposed refugees? I understand that the government is couching listening in—whatever term you like, phone tapping, intelligence surveillance or monitoring of this situation—as being due to a potential threat to national security. I do not see from anything that I have heard or read that the question of a relatively small bunch of refugees on a Norwegian ship can be regarded in any way as a threat to national security. 
It is very important to remember that the critical political environment, the white-hot environment of terrorism, as we understand it now, did not begin until September 11. That was some days after the Tampa sailed into our waters and onto the front pages of our newspapers. I have some difficulty accepting that there can be any connection between the government's response to the Tampa and, in more recent days, the way in which some people have phrased the arguments to defend the government's position towards it and those refugees as somehow being connected to terrorism. The two issues that we are confronting here today—or perhaps not—are: did the tapping take place, and we have no clear answer on that; and, if so, for what purpose?
But I think another thing that has been missed thus far in this debate is a point which relates to whistleblowing. Senator Ludwig raised it when he asked his question about the proposed espionage bill. The government has acknowledged that that bill will take a little longer to be introduced than was first planned, partly because of what the minister says is misinformation about the bill. Madam Deputy President, I am sure you would be conscious that there was considerable uproar about the prospect of this bill imposing penalties on people who either release or receive information that the government regards as being of national interest or as a matter of national security. I would argue that, if that bill were to pass in its current form, whoever leaked that information to the press and also the press themselves who reported it would be subject to the very harsh penalties in that bill. So we have a classic example of considerable public interest in this topic both here in the parliament and outside in the community—that is, the topic of whether or not phone tapping took place on the Tampa—and yet I understand that this was initiated from the fourth estate. It came from the press and not from the opposition or the crossbenches, as is sometimes the case. I believe this is a classic example of why the bill to which Senator Ludwig referred today is flawed. 
Senator Sandy Macdonald said that this matter was purely a beat-up. I think the Australian community is generally sophisticated enough to sense the difference between a beat-up and a cover-up, and I think the question that the minister has not yet satisfactorily answered is which it is in this instance. The minister's announcement that a full report will be made in which the director will involve himself is a good step, and I applaud that. But what is missing from any full report is something perhaps more important: it is what my leader, Senator Stott Despoja, advocated when she argued that there ought to be an inquiry not just into the Tampa incident per se but into whether legislation, regulations and guidelines that relate to the DSD's activities are adequate to guard against, firstly, improper actions by the DSD and, secondly, the improper use of the DSD by the government. That information should also be fully reported to the Senate as part of a more holistic approach and not simply confined to research into the current issue. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-02-13,"—by leave—I move:
	(1)	That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, be appointed to inquire into and report by 16 May 2002 on the following matters:
	(a)	the so-called `children overboard' incident, where an Indonesian vessel was intercepted by HMAS Adelaide within Australian waters reportedly 120 nautical miles off Christmas Island, on or about 6 October 2001;
	(b)	issues directly associated with that incident, including:
	(i)	the role of Commonwealth agencies and personnel in the incident, including the Australian Defence Force, Customs, Coastwatch and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority,
	(ii)	the flow of information about the incident to the Federal Government, both at the time of the incident and subsequently,
	(iii)	Federal Government control of, and use of, information about the incident, including written and oral reports, photographs, videotapes and other images, and
	(iv)	the role of Federal Government departments and agencies in reporting on the incident, including the Navy, the Defence Organisation, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Office of National Assessments; and
	(c)	in respect of the agreements between the Australian Government and the Governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea regarding the detention within those countries of persons intercepted while travelling to Australia, publicly known as the `Pacific Solution':
	(i)	the nature of negotiations leading to those agreements,
	(ii)	the nature of the agreements reached,
	(iii)	the operation of those arrangements, and
	(iv)	the current and projected cost of those arrangements.
	(2)	That the committee consist of 7 senators, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and 1 nominated by minority groups and independent senators.
	(3)	That the committee may proceed to the dispatch of business notwithstanding that not all members have been duly nominated and appointed and notwithstanding any vacancy.
	(4)	That the chair of the committee be elected by the committee from the members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.
	(5)	That the deputy chair of the committee be elected by the committee from the members nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
	(6)	That the deputy chair act as chair when there is no chair or the chair is not present at a meeting.
	(7)	That, in the event of the votes on any question before the committee being equally divided, the chair, or deputy chair when acting as chair, have a casting vote.
	(8)	That the committee and any subcommittee have power to send for and examine persons and documents, to move from place to place, to sit in public or in private, notwithstanding any prorogation of the Parliament or dissolution of the House of Representatives, and have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken and such interim recommendations as it may deem fit.
	(9)	That the committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of 3 or more of its members and to refer to any such subcommittee any of the matters which the committee is empowered to consider. 
	(10)	That the committee be provided with all necessary staff, facilities and resources and be empowered to appoint persons with specialist knowledge for the purposes of the committee with the approval of the President.
	(11)	That the committee be empowered to print from day to day such documents and evidence as may be ordered by it, and a daily Hansard be published of such proceedings as take place in public.
The opposition has moved this motion to establish a committee on what generally has been known as the `children overboard incident' that occurred during the federal election campaign. I thank the Senate clerks for helpfully removing the tabloid colloquialism and renaming the event `a certain maritime incident', which is perhaps more appropriate—but, if not more appropriate, certainly more senatorial.
Today's tabling by the Prime Minister of the internal PM&C report Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” really does reinforce the need for a full parliamentary inquiry to scrutinise this matter. It does not get Mr Howard, and it does not get the government, off the hook on this issue. This report reveals an appalling lack of process and wide knowledge that what was being said publicly by ministers was wrong, and it points very strongly to a serious cover-up by certain ministerial advisers and ministers. It is inconceivable that Mr Howard did not know that what was being said publicly was just plain wrong. Look at page vii of this report. Let me just quickly quote from it:
In the light of continuing media attention, PM&C contacted Defence Strategic Command seeking evidence to confirm the initial advice and asking for a chronology of events. A chronology was provided to PM&C at around noon on 10 October, carrying the footnote “There is no indication that children were thrown overboard. It is possible that this did occur in conjunction with other SUNCs jumping overboard”.
I interpolate here that a SUNC is a suspected unlawful noncitizen. The report continues:
PM&C did not pursue the issue further once the photographs were released to the media on the afternoon of 10 October because the issue appeared to have been clarified.
The issue appeared to have been clarified? What an extraordinary statement to make. This matter can be properly and thoroughly examined only by a public Senate inquiry, and the resolution that I move today enables that particular inquiry to take place. I must say that we have had a very tangled web woven on this issue. There is no doubt that the Howard government deceived the Australian people on this issue, and what the opposition says is that it is time to unravel the web. It is time that we cleared up the various versions of events that have come from ministers, from departments and from agencies to find out what happened and how it was done.
I think the report which was tabled today in the House of Representatives by Mr Howard—the political tactic is to get all of the bad news out on the first day that there is a full parliamentary sitting; it is an age-old tactic that Senator Hill knows well—has generated many more questions than it answers. It is important that many of the people who were interviewed for this Prime Minister and Cabinet report alone—not to mention all of the other reports that have been undertaken, including one in Senator Hill's own department—who were interviewed for this report by an officer of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, are interviewed by a parliamentary committee where all those who come before the committee are bound by rules on providing evidence within that forum.
There is no doubt that this report indicates that Mr Reith, and Mr Reith's staff, knew within 24 hours of his statements that elements of his original statement about children overboard were wrong. There is absolutely no doubt. Look at page ix under the heading, `Key findings regarding correction of misunderstanding about the photographs':
By 1100 on 11 October 2001, Mr Reith and a number of his senior advisers had been informed that the photographs released the previous day did not depict children in the water after having been thrown overboard on 7 October.
I have only had the most cursory opportunity—I have been stuck in this chamber since two o'clock today—to read some aspects of this Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” report, but there are an amazing number of questions that just this report alone raises. I know that today in the House of Representatives Mr Howard really used every trick in the book to avoid answering the direct question, `When did you know?' When was the Prime Minister told? 
Mr Howard was pressed on this but he was either unwilling or unable to name the date. He refused to tell the parliament when he knew. No Australian appreciates being misled by their government; in fact, Australians hate being lied to—they really do— particularly by people, governments and those of us in public life and in parliament, in whom they invest their trust. This behaviour in relation to this incident is, in the view of the opposition, the antithesis of proper, transparent democratic process. Using incumbency and using the reputation of our defence forces and intelligence agencies to create a grossly inaccurate perception of events that are very emotional in their nature, and to do that for political purposes, is about as low as a government can go. That is why we want to explore this issue and see how far the Howard government sank on this particular matter. 
We had discussions with minor party senators, the Australian Democrats, and the Independent senators, and after those discussions the opposition agreed to extend the terms of reference that I had originally proposed for this inquiry and examine the cost and processes behind Mr Howard's so-called `Pacific Solution'. Of course, since the New Year there have been media reports of vast blow-outs in the budget covering the establishment and maintenance of offshore detention centres; we think it is appropriate that this be examined and we have accommodated the Australian Democrats, particularly, who put those views to us, and I know that they are supported by other senators in the chamber.
Before I complete my comments, because I know time is short on this, I want to very briefly address one of the amendments that will come forward in the name of Senator Brown relating to extending the inquiry into the Tampa-DSD matters which were a matter of questioning in question time today. I do understand the motivation of Senator Brown in this; I think these are proper questions to ask. But we believe that the select committee is the wrong forum in which to pursue questions about the activities of the Defence Signals Directorate and other intelligence organisations in relation to the Tampa incident. 
We do welcome the fact that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has decided that he will examine all matters pertaining to the interception and processing of communication between the Tampa and others. He must examine how this material was processed, who received the information and how it was used. He must do all that. But also—and I know Senator Brown would want to do this—we have to look at what the outcome of the inspector-general's inquiries might be. Under the new security legislation that was passed by this parliament last year, it is, in the view of the opposition, appropriate not to overturn the processes that were agreed, I think without dissent, by both chambers of this parliament. We believe that Mr Blick's report should be presented to the parliamentary joint committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I might say that by `report' I mean `unexpurgated report'—a full report going to those issues that can be dealt with if necessary by that committee out of the public arena.
Having said that—and I made this very clear earlier today in this chamber—all those elements of the report should be made publicly available. All those elements which do not compromise national security must be provided fully and publicly on this important issue. Accepting that Senator Brown's motivation here to investigate what appears to be yet another abuse of process is proper, we will not support the amendment on the basis that the investigation in the first instance, as it should be, is being pursued by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 
I urge the Senate to support this motion on the establishment of the select committee, especially in light of the new information that we know from the documents that have been tabled in the House of Representatives today. Further ramifications are revealed in this document Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” that has been released by Mr Howard. These matters will not go away. It is a high priority for the Senate to deal with them, and we believe that the approach that the opposition has taken in consultation with minor party and Independent senators is the appropriate course of action. I commend the opposition's motion to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>A Certain Maritime Incident Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-02-13,"—This is a political stunt. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have come together again, as they so often do—it is really hard to find division between them these days—to set up a committee to achieve a certain outcome, and the outcome is obviously designed to be criticism of the government. As Senator Faulkner knows, that is generally what happens. It also happens on the first day of a sitting and they are doing it again today. Illustration that this is just a political hatchet job I think can be found clearly when you look at the terms of reference and you find that the chair of the committee under these terms that have been drawn up in collusion between the Labor Party and the Democrats must be a member of the Australian Labor Party. This committee has to be run by a nominee of Senator Faulkner. The reason for that is obviously that it is designed to achieve a political outcome rather than a real determination of the facts and something that might be useful to the Australian people.
There was a time, I might say, when select committees were automatically chaired by the government side. It was believed that that was a reasonable thing. Then we went through a phase when on occasions an Independent senator was appointed chairman to give a little more objectivity, for obvious reasons. It has now gone one step further, and the whole Senate select committee process now has really lost its substance and purpose and has simply become another political tool. The end result of that is that it is a waste of time and money and it does not achieve anything worth while in terms of Senate process at all. We are going through that farce again today. It has been predetermined. It is a great disappointment to me that the Australian Democrats do not appear to be learning their lesson: if they are to be a third party they have got to show some objectivity and independence from the Australian Labor Party. They have not done it here and it is a long time since they in fact did that.
—That's not true.
—You can defend the Democrats if you like, Senator. They will appreciate that. On the issue of the children overboard, the government has come clean and provided the parliament with the results of a substantial inquiry into that event—an inquiry that was ordered by the Prime Minister, I might say, because the Prime Minister is of the view that this matter should be on the public record. That has been done and so the public are now well informed in that regard, so there is little point in going through that process at all. 
From the Labor Party's perspective, this is really about camouflaging their state of policy confusion on the matter of border protection. This is all about the issue of border protection: what is necessary to protect Australia's borders and what you do in relation to those who breach the borders. As we know, detention in Australia was actually introduced by the Labor Party, but they are now running 100 miles an hour in the opposite direction because they are split. The members of the frontbench say they are ashamed of the existing policy, and the current leadership of the Australian Labor Party is not prepared to require discipline from them, so they have divided. It is very embarrassing and awkward.
Then you have the issue of border protection itself: do they support the government's position on border protection or not? In the election, they said they did; now that they are back in opposition, they really do not want to acknowledge that because, again, half the party say they are opposed to it. What the Australian government says is that we will protect the borders. Those who engage in criminal conspiracy—in other words, those who engage people smugglers to breach our borders to behave illegally—will be returned to where they came from. In some circumstances, those who breach the borders will be sent to a third country where they will be processed rather than being allowed to take advantage of Australia, which has been seen as a soft touch.  
Yes, it has been a firm response. It has been a fair and humane response and it is actually working. Perhaps that is what is frustrating the Labor Party more than anything. It is a response that the Australian people appreciate, and it is working. In contrast, the ALP is all over the shop—it does not know what its policy ought to be; it is divided between the left and right. I do not know whether Senator Faulkner is with his Left colleague Carmen Lawrence from Western Australia or whether he is with Mr Crean on this particular issue, and I am sure he would not be prepared to get up and tell us that.
—With the Labor Party.
—Where is Carmen Lawrence? Isn't she on your frontbench? Anyway, to cover this disarray, the Senate is to be subjected to what is clearly going to be a useless, time-consuming and expensive public inquiry that is unlikely to contribute anything useful at all. We will be opposed to this. In relation to Senator Brown's amendment, he wants to add another matter which is the subject of examination by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The inspector-general should carry out his task; the office is designed that way to give public confidence. There is no need to include that as a term of reference, and we will be opposed to that.
In relation to Senator Murphy's proposal to include an extra Independent senator, we will support it—for what it is worth—because anything that is going to throw a small spanner into this happy harmony between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party is something we think might be worth while. We wish Senator Murphy well; this will actually be a test of his independence. Maybe, if this amendment happens to get up, we should move that Senator Murphy be the chair of this committee, but I bet the Labor Party would not like that because there could be just a touch of objectivity within that, which is the last thing the Australian Labor Party wants to see on this issue.
It is a matter of regret to me, on the first day back, that there is no sign that, after six years in opposition, the Labor Party has learnt its lessons. It just wants to engage in political stunts. It wants to cover up its internal disarray and its policy vacuum and, in doing so, it is going to cost a number of senators a lot of time and, what is more important, the public a lot of money.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>A Certain Maritime Incident Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-02-13,"—I support the motion because there is a prima facie case that the government, including the Prime Minister, was involved in a deception of the Australian people over the videotapes purporting to show children being thrown in the water in the run-up to an election. When, at the critical period when people are deciding who should be in government in a democracy, you have senior members of cabinet—and, indeed, the Prime Minister by implication—involved in deceiving the Australian public, then it warrants the most serious investigation, the discovery of the facts and the revelation of exactly what happened and who was responsible. The buck stops with the Prime Minister. I repeat: the buck stops with the Prime Minister. It is very important that the matter be independently and thoroughly investigated.
I will add that, at the time of the incident, I made it clear that I had serious doubts about those reports. The opposition ought to have moved at that time to demand an inquiry into the matter but they have left it until much later and, indeed, now we are getting an inquiry. We now have vigorous public debate as to whether there has been eavesdropping on Australian citizens in the matter of communications with the Tampa during the huge international controversy over the asylum seekers aboard, who were picked up by the Tampa in August last year, and the consequent events. This matter is also extraordinarily serious, and that is why I move an amendment:
At end of paragraph (1), add:
(d) how information from the Defence Signals Directorate was conveyed to and used by the Government during and since the Tampa crisis.
The opposition has indicated that it is satisfied, so far, that the matter be left in the hands of the inspector-general. I am not. I would expect that, when that report is available, a Senate inquiry would have the inspector-general come before it to be questioned and that, as Senator Faulkner just indicated, the report in full would be released to the public. It is very important that the inspector-general be there to explain how his inquiry has proceeded and that the Senate, the parliament and the people of Australia are able to assess for themselves the thoroughness of that inquiry and what matters may not have been undertaken during its course. I am concerned that, once again, the opposition is allowing the government to set the agenda here and with the efflux of time— they hope—to have the matter taken off the agenda or dealt with in a way which is not fully public and which allows people who were involved at the time, but who may have moved away, to be able to fudge the evidence when the time comes. That does not satisfy me. 
The opposition should be supporting this amendment. The inspector-general will undertake his inquiry and that information must come forward, but it should then be subject to the scrutiny of a parliamentary committee such as this one. Indeed—and I have made this public—that information should be subject to a fully independent judicial inquiry which may subpoena evidence and go into matters which are of national security which cannot be canvassed in public but can be canvassed in camera by a properly appointed judicial inquiry.
There can be no more serious matter than when a government or its agencies spy on innocent citizens of the country. There can be no more serious matter than when a government would be involved in using information against citizens of the country for political purposes, let alone commercial purposes or any other matters that are not to do with national security. I noticed the words being used in this debate—for example, that messages from the international labour body concerned were not targeted by those intercepting the signals. All the calls going to the Tampa were targeted. The word `targeted' there is being used to lead people to believe that only certain calls were being listened to. The way in which this encryption service works is that all calls are targeted and through a computer mechanism certain calls are downloaded, investigated and analysed. We need to be clear about that: all calls were being targeted at that time.
We now have the Minister for Defence saying that there has been a minor misdemeanour, but he is not saying what that misdemeanour was. I say to the government: if it is a minor matter, why don't you say so? The government is making a mistake by not revealing what the nature of this so-called minor matter was. It would take a lot of heat out of the debate at the moment and a lot of concern out of the public domain if the government were to come clean and tell us what that minor infraction of the rules was that was committed during the heat of an election campaign and which, by implication, advantaged the government or somebody else to the disadvantage of an Australian citizen. How can it be that a minor matter is still subject to cover-up and secrecy? This is a breach of the rules which this parliament has set, which this parliament expects to be carried through and which this parliament should now be investigating. That is why this amendment is important. 
The Labor Party is making a mistake by not supporting this Green amendment for a parliamentary investigation into the DSD's activity vis-a-vis the government during the election campaign, and having it now. The Labor Party is making a mistake by now backing off from this alternative. The Labor Party is making a mistake by saying that it will accept Prime Minister Howard saying, `Let's leave it to the inspector-general.' He is no doubt an honourable man but this is a political matter now and the buck stops with the Prime Minister. And it will only stop there properly if you have a strong and vigorous opposition taking it up to the Prime Minister. Now is the time to have a Senate inquiry into this matter. Is the public going to be satisfied by a report from the inspector-general which has large pieces marked `not for publication', which is dealt with by a standing committee which is not empowered to look after the public interest in this matter? I doubt it. So I ask the opposition to reconsider this important amendment and to support it, instead of backing down at the moment when an inquiry should be put forward.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-02-13,—I foreshadow that I intend to move a motion that seeks to amend paragraph (2) of Senator Faulkner's motion.,SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>A Certain Maritime Incident Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-13,"—The Democrats are very pleased that this motion has been moved by Senator Faulkner to establish this inquiry and appreciate very much the cooperation that the Labor Party has shown in taking on board some of the suggestions of the Democrats. The Democrats believe that there are broader aspects of the government's refugee policy that have changed so dramatically in the last six months that they need to be examined further, and the inclusion of some aspects of the Pacific solution by Labor will allow us to go some way towards that. But I still believe that there is much more that needs to be done to get to the truth and facts behind the government's policy and how it is operating. However, we will certainly pursue that during estimates next week and see what can come out there and revisit at a later time the potential for a broader inquiry. 
In the short term, the inclusion in this motion of a component enabling the committee to examine the nature of the agreements between Australia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea will provide us with a good opportunity to examine the many unanswered questions about that aspect of the government's policy, as well as the core issue of the maritime incident itself—the children overboard incident. This is also an area where there are many questions that need answering. It is a perfect example of this government's whole approach to the very difficult and complex issue of refugee policy, and examining broader aspects to do with Nauru and PNG will show up much more the government's disingenuousness, obfuscation and deliberate misleading of the people about what they are actually doing.
The facts have to come out, not just in terms of the public being aware but in terms of the broader aspect of the level of deliberate dishonesty that this government will engage in, particularly on this issue. They know it is an election winner. The only reason they are still on the government benches is their exploitation of this issue, and they exploited it without any concern for the facts, the truth or the cost of the damage to the country. I think a trend is starting to emerge now. People are becoming more aware: they are aware that there was clear misleading of the Australian people by the minister and the Prime Minister—a range of ministers—about what happened in relation to this incident. That is why this inquiry is so important. 
We have seen the extraordinary revelations yesterday in relation to the Department of Defence tapping telephones and the government's cover-up in relation to that. It shows again the lengths the government will go to. We have had the issue I raised in question time today of allegations made to convince the Australian people that adults were, basically, forcibly sewing children's lips together—allegations that have subsequently been extensively investigated and found to be completely false. I think there is a pretty clear pattern emerging here. On anything to do with immigration or refugees, whether it is tapping telephone calls to the Tampa or whether it is misleading the Australian people about the activities of refugees and asylum seekers themselves, this government cannot be trusted. The statements they make about this area cannot be trusted. 
In such a circumstance, where, we now know, the form is there, the record is clear. Because the government know that it has been so politically valuable for them, in this area of policy they obviously will do whatever it takes, including deceiving the Australian people, to try and maximise that electoral advantage. At least in this policy area, I think the Senate—and more and more the Australian public—are now realising that you simply cannot take the government at their word. That being the case, we have to examine the facts ourselves. We have to make sure that we can be informed in an accurate way about what is happening and about the policy so the Australian people can get the facts instead of distortions and misinformation from the government. This is a very valuable inquiry.  
Senator Hill, for some reason, seemed to think that it was a terrible thing for the Democrats to actually cooperate with the Labor Party. I am not sure if that attitude would be replicated when we cooperate with the government, which we obviously do plenty of times. I know it is just cheap political rhetoric from Senator Hill but, nonetheless, it is pretty obviously a hollow claim. Indeed, it is very rare, I would think, for Labor and the Democrats to have reached a common view on anything to do with immigration and refugee policy. In the last six months we have been very much out on our own, so this is a rarity, if anything, and, in that sense, we welcome it. And as illustration of the temporary nature of such cooperation, the so-called cosy relationship between Labor and the Democrats will be rent asunder because we will be supporting Senator Murphy's amendment when he moves it and I understand the Labor Party will not. For the information of Senator Hill, who may wish to note this comment, I have had no discussions with the Labor Party about the chair of the committee. I am quite open to discussion with all members of the committee about what the best option might be. That is something that would be worth examining. If Senator Hill wants to move away from fairly fatuous political rhetoric and get down to trying to be constructive, we will happily examine that. The Democrats will be supporting this motion. 
I should put on the record that we will not be supporting Senator Brown's amendment. We have motions on the notice paper already in terms of requesting the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to investigate and report to parliament, and that is going to be undertaken. I saw Senator Brown himself on the television news—it is always good to see him on the media, putting forward his wisdom—saying we need an independent inquiry into this issue. I agree, and think it is going to happen with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. A Senate inquiry, while it is very useful, is not independent. That is not to say I would rule it out, but I think it would be best to see what the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security produces first. That may well then lead to another inquiry similar to this one, where we have to examine again exactly how low the government went in terms of their level of deceit of the Australian people. But I think that is something for later, rather than for now.

The opposition has moved this motion to establish a committee on what generally has been known as the `children overboard incident' that occurred during the federal election campaign. I thank the Senate clerks for helpfully removing the tabloid colloquialism and renaming the event `a certain maritime incident', which is perhaps more appropriate—but, if not more appropriate, certainly more senatorial.
Today's tabling by the Prime Minister of the internal PM&C report Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” really does reinforce the need for a full parliamentary inquiry to scrutinise this matter. It does not get Mr Howard, and it does not get the government, off the hook on this issue. This report reveals an appalling lack of process and wide knowledge that what was being said publicly by ministers was wrong, and it points very strongly to a serious cover-up by certain ministerial advisers and ministers. It is inconceivable that Mr Howard did not know that what was being said publicly was just plain wrong. Look at page vii of this report. Let me just quickly quote from it:
In the light of continuing media attention, PM&C contacted Defence Strategic Command seeking evidence to confirm the initial advice and asking for a chronology of events. A chronology was provided to PM&C at around noon on 10 October, carrying the footnote “There is no indication that children were thrown overboard. It is possible that this did occur in conjunction with other SUNCs jumping overboard”.
I interpolate here that a SUNC is a suspected unlawful noncitizen. The report continues:
PM&C did not pursue the issue further once the photographs were released to the media on the afternoon of 10 October because the issue appeared to have been clarified.
The issue appeared to have been clarified? What an extraordinary statement to make. This matter can be properly and thoroughly examined only by a public Senate inquiry, and the resolution that I move today enables that particular inquiry to take place. I must say that we have had a very tangled web woven on this issue. There is no doubt that the Howard government deceived the Australian people on this issue, and what the opposition says is that it is time to unravel the web. It is time that we cleared up the various versions of events that have come from ministers, from departments and from agencies to find out what happened and how it was done.
I think the report which was tabled today in the House of Representatives by Mr Howard—the political tactic is to get all of the bad news out on the first day that there is a full parliamentary sitting; it is an age-old tactic that Senator Hill knows well—has generated many more questions than it answers. It is important that many of the people who were interviewed for this Prime Minister and Cabinet report alone—not to mention all of the other reports that have been undertaken, including one in Senator Hill's own department—who were interviewed for this report by an officer of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, are interviewed by a parliamentary committee where all those who come before the committee are bound by rules on providing evidence within that forum.
There is no doubt that this report indicates that Mr Reith, and Mr Reith's staff, knew within 24 hours of his statements that elements of his original statement about children overboard were wrong. There is absolutely no doubt. Look at page ix under the heading, `Key findings regarding correction of misunderstanding about the photographs':
By 1100 on 11 October 2001, Mr Reith and a number of his senior advisers had been informed that the photographs released the previous day did not depict children in the water after having been thrown overboard on 7 October.
I have only had the most cursory opportunity—I have been stuck in this chamber since two o'clock today—to read some aspects of this Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” report, but there are an amazing number of questions that just this report alone raises. I know that today in the House of Representatives Mr Howard really used every trick in the book to avoid answering the direct question, `When did you know?' When was the Prime Minister told? 
Mr Howard was pressed on this but he was either unwilling or unable to name the date. He refused to tell the parliament when he knew. No Australian appreciates being misled by their government; in fact, Australians hate being lied to—they really do— particularly by people, governments and those of us in public life and in parliament, in whom they invest their trust. This behaviour in relation to this incident is, in the view of the opposition, the antithesis of proper, transparent democratic process. Using incumbency and using the reputation of our defence forces and intelligence agencies to create a grossly inaccurate perception of events that are very emotional in their nature, and to do that for political purposes, is about as low as a government can go. That is why we want to explore this issue and see how far the Howard government sank on this particular matter. 
We had discussions with minor party senators, the Australian Democrats, and the Independent senators, and after those discussions the opposition agreed to extend the terms of reference that I had originally proposed for this inquiry and examine the cost and processes behind Mr Howard's so-called `Pacific Solution'. Of course, since the New Year there have been media reports of vast blow-outs in the budget covering the establishment and maintenance of offshore detention centres; we think it is appropriate that this be examined and we have accommodated the Australian Democrats, particularly, who put those views to us, and I know that they are supported by other senators in the chamber.
Before I complete my comments, because I know time is short on this, I want to very briefly address one of the amendments that will come forward in the name of Senator Brown relating to extending the inquiry into the Tampa-DSD matters which were a matter of questioning in question time today. I do understand the motivation of Senator Brown in this; I think these are proper questions to ask. But we believe that the select committee is the wrong forum in which to pursue questions about the activities of the Defence Signals Directorate and other intelligence organisations in relation to the Tampa incident. 
We do welcome the fact that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has decided that he will examine all matters pertaining to the interception and processing of communication between the Tampa and others. He must examine how this material was processed, who received the information and how it was used. He must do all that. But also—and I know Senator Brown would want to do this—we have to look at what the outcome of the inspector-general's inquiries might be. Under the new security legislation that was passed by this parliament last year, it is, in the view of the opposition, appropriate not to overturn the processes that were agreed, I think without dissent, by both chambers of this parliament. We believe that Mr Blick's report should be presented to the parliamentary joint committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I might say that by `report' I mean `unexpurgated report'—a full report going to those issues that can be dealt with if necessary by that committee out of the public arena.
Having said that—and I made this very clear earlier today in this chamber—all those elements of the report should be made publicly available. All those elements which do not compromise national security must be provided fully and publicly on this important issue. Accepting that Senator Brown's motivation here to investigate what appears to be yet another abuse of process is proper, we will not support the amendment on the basis that the investigation in the first instance, as it should be, is being pursued by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. 
I urge the Senate to support this motion on the establishment of the select committee, especially in light of the new information that we know from the documents that have been tabled in the House of Representatives today. Further ramifications are revealed in this document Investigation into advice provided to ministers on “SIEV 4” that has been released by Mr Howard. These matters will not go away. It is a high priority for the Senate to deal with them, and we believe that the approach that the opposition has taken in consultation with minor party and Independent senators is the appropriate course of action. I commend the opposition's motion to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-02-13,"—This is a political stunt. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have come together again, as they so often do—it is really hard to find division between them these days—to set up a committee to achieve a certain outcome, and the outcome is obviously designed to be criticism of the government. As Senator Faulkner knows, that is generally what happens. It also happens on the first day of a sitting and they are doing it again today. Illustration that this is just a political hatchet job I think can be found clearly when you look at the terms of reference and you find that the chair of the committee under these terms that have been drawn up in collusion between the Labor Party and the Democrats must be a member of the Australian Labor Party. This committee has to be run by a nominee of Senator Faulkner. The reason for that is obviously that it is designed to achieve a political outcome rather than a real determination of the facts and something that might be useful to the Australian people.
There was a time, I might say, when select committees were automatically chaired by the government side. It was believed that that was a reasonable thing. Then we went through a phase when on occasions an Independent senator was appointed chairman to give a little more objectivity, for obvious reasons. It has now gone one step further, and the whole Senate select committee process now has really lost its substance and purpose and has simply become another political tool. The end result of that is that it is a waste of time and money and it does not achieve anything worth while in terms of Senate process at all. We are going through that farce again today. It has been predetermined. It is a great disappointment to me that the Australian Democrats do not appear to be learning their lesson: if they are to be a third party they have got to show some objectivity and independence from the Australian Labor Party. They have not done it here and it is a long time since they in fact did that.
—That's not true.
—You can defend the Democrats if you like, Senator. They will appreciate that. On the issue of the children overboard, the government has come clean and provided the parliament with the results of a substantial inquiry into that event—an inquiry that was ordered by the Prime Minister, I might say, because the Prime Minister is of the view that this matter should be on the public record. That has been done and so the public are now well informed in that regard, so there is little point in going through that process at all. 
From the Labor Party's perspective, this is really about camouflaging their state of policy confusion on the matter of border protection. This is all about the issue of border protection: what is necessary to protect Australia's borders and what you do in relation to those who breach the borders. As we know, detention in Australia was actually introduced by the Labor Party, but they are now running 100 miles an hour in the opposite direction because they are split. The members of the frontbench say they are ashamed of the existing policy, and the current leadership of the Australian Labor Party is not prepared to require discipline from them, so they have divided. It is very embarrassing and awkward.
Then you have the issue of border protection itself: do they support the government's position on border protection or not? In the election, they said they did; now that they are back in opposition, they really do not want to acknowledge that because, again, half the party say they are opposed to it. What the Australian government says is that we will protect the borders. Those who engage in criminal conspiracy—in other words, those who engage people smugglers to breach our borders to behave illegally—will be returned to where they came from. In some circumstances, those who breach the borders will be sent to a third country where they will be processed rather than being allowed to take advantage of Australia, which has been seen as a soft touch.  
Yes, it has been a firm response. It has been a fair and humane response and it is actually working. Perhaps that is what is frustrating the Labor Party more than anything. It is a response that the Australian people appreciate, and it is working. In contrast, the ALP is all over the shop—it does not know what its policy ought to be; it is divided between the left and right. I do not know whether Senator Faulkner is with his Left colleague Carmen Lawrence from Western Australia or whether he is with Mr Crean on this particular issue, and I am sure he would not be prepared to get up and tell us that.
—With the Labor Party.
—Where is Carmen Lawrence? Isn't she on your frontbench? Anyway, to cover this disarray, the Senate is to be subjected to what is clearly going to be a useless, time-consuming and expensive public inquiry that is unlikely to contribute anything useful at all. We will be opposed to this. In relation to Senator Brown's amendment, he wants to add another matter which is the subject of examination by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The inspector-general should carry out his task; the office is designed that way to give public confidence. There is no need to include that as a term of reference, and we will be opposed to that.
In relation to Senator Murphy's proposal to include an extra Independent senator, we will support it—for what it is worth—because anything that is going to throw a small spanner into this happy harmony between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party is something we think might be worth while. We wish Senator Murphy well; this will actually be a test of his independence. Maybe, if this amendment happens to get up, we should move that Senator Murphy be the chair of this committee, but I bet the Labor Party would not like that because there could be just a touch of objectivity within that, which is the last thing the Australian Labor Party wants to see on this issue.
It is a matter of regret to me, on the first day back, that there is no sign that, after six years in opposition, the Labor Party has learnt its lessons. It just wants to engage in political stunts. It wants to cover up its internal disarray and its policy vacuum and, in doing so, it is going to cost a number of senators a lot of time and, what is more important, the public a lot of money.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-02-13,"—I support the motion because there is a prima facie case that the government, including the Prime Minister, was involved in a deception of the Australian people over the videotapes purporting to show children being thrown in the water in the run-up to an election. When, at the critical period when people are deciding who should be in government in a democracy, you have senior members of cabinet—and, indeed, the Prime Minister by implication—involved in deceiving the Australian public, then it warrants the most serious investigation, the discovery of the facts and the revelation of exactly what happened and who was responsible. The buck stops with the Prime Minister. I repeat: the buck stops with the Prime Minister. It is very important that the matter be independently and thoroughly investigated.
I will add that, at the time of the incident, I made it clear that I had serious doubts about those reports. The opposition ought to have moved at that time to demand an inquiry into the matter but they have left it until much later and, indeed, now we are getting an inquiry. We now have vigorous public debate as to whether there has been eavesdropping on Australian citizens in the matter of communications with the Tampa during the huge international controversy over the asylum seekers aboard, who were picked up by the Tampa in August last year, and the consequent events. This matter is also extraordinarily serious, and that is why I move an amendment:
At end of paragraph (1), add:
(d) how information from the Defence Signals Directorate was conveyed to and used by the Government during and since the Tampa crisis.
The opposition has indicated that it is satisfied, so far, that the matter be left in the hands of the inspector-general. I am not. I would expect that, when that report is available, a Senate inquiry would have the inspector-general come before it to be questioned and that, as Senator Faulkner just indicated, the report in full would be released to the public. It is very important that the inspector-general be there to explain how his inquiry has proceeded and that the Senate, the parliament and the people of Australia are able to assess for themselves the thoroughness of that inquiry and what matters may not have been undertaken during its course. I am concerned that, once again, the opposition is allowing the government to set the agenda here and with the efflux of time— they hope—to have the matter taken off the agenda or dealt with in a way which is not fully public and which allows people who were involved at the time, but who may have moved away, to be able to fudge the evidence when the time comes. That does not satisfy me. 
The opposition should be supporting this amendment. The inspector-general will undertake his inquiry and that information must come forward, but it should then be subject to the scrutiny of a parliamentary committee such as this one. Indeed—and I have made this public—that information should be subject to a fully independent judicial inquiry which may subpoena evidence and go into matters which are of national security which cannot be canvassed in public but can be canvassed in camera by a properly appointed judicial inquiry.
There can be no more serious matter than when a government or its agencies spy on innocent citizens of the country. There can be no more serious matter than when a government would be involved in using information against citizens of the country for political purposes, let alone commercial purposes or any other matters that are not to do with national security. I noticed the words being used in this debate—for example, that messages from the international labour body concerned were not targeted by those intercepting the signals. All the calls going to the Tampa were targeted. The word `targeted' there is being used to lead people to believe that only certain calls were being listened to. The way in which this encryption service works is that all calls are targeted and through a computer mechanism certain calls are downloaded, investigated and analysed. We need to be clear about that: all calls were being targeted at that time.
We now have the Minister for Defence saying that there has been a minor misdemeanour, but he is not saying what that misdemeanour was. I say to the government: if it is a minor matter, why don't you say so? The government is making a mistake by not revealing what the nature of this so-called minor matter was. It would take a lot of heat out of the debate at the moment and a lot of concern out of the public domain if the government were to come clean and tell us what that minor infraction of the rules was that was committed during the heat of an election campaign and which, by implication, advantaged the government or somebody else to the disadvantage of an Australian citizen. How can it be that a minor matter is still subject to cover-up and secrecy? This is a breach of the rules which this parliament has set, which this parliament expects to be carried through and which this parliament should now be investigating. That is why this amendment is important. 
The Labor Party is making a mistake by not supporting this Green amendment for a parliamentary investigation into the DSD's activity vis-a-vis the government during the election campaign, and having it now. The Labor Party is making a mistake by now backing off from this alternative. The Labor Party is making a mistake by saying that it will accept Prime Minister Howard saying, `Let's leave it to the inspector-general.' He is no doubt an honourable man but this is a political matter now and the buck stops with the Prime Minister. And it will only stop there properly if you have a strong and vigorous opposition taking it up to the Prime Minister. Now is the time to have a Senate inquiry into this matter. Is the public going to be satisfied by a report from the inspector-general which has large pieces marked `not for publication', which is dealt with by a standing committee which is not empowered to look after the public interest in this matter? I doubt it. So I ask the opposition to reconsider this important amendment and to support it, instead of backing down at the moment when an inquiry should be put forward.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-02-13,—I foreshadow that I intend to move a motion that seeks to amend paragraph (2) of Senator Faulkner's motion.,SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-02-13,"—The Democrats are very pleased that this motion has been moved by Senator Faulkner to establish this inquiry and appreciate very much the cooperation that the Labor Party has shown in taking on board some of the suggestions of the Democrats. The Democrats believe that there are broader aspects of the government's refugee policy that have changed so dramatically in the last six months that they need to be examined further, and the inclusion of some aspects of the Pacific solution by Labor will allow us to go some way towards that. But I still believe that there is much more that needs to be done to get to the truth and facts behind the government's policy and how it is operating. However, we will certainly pursue that during estimates next week and see what can come out there and revisit at a later time the potential for a broader inquiry. 
In the short term, the inclusion in this motion of a component enabling the committee to examine the nature of the agreements between Australia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea will provide us with a good opportunity to examine the many unanswered questions about that aspect of the government's policy, as well as the core issue of the maritime incident itself—the children overboard incident. This is also an area where there are many questions that need answering. It is a perfect example of this government's whole approach to the very difficult and complex issue of refugee policy, and examining broader aspects to do with Nauru and PNG will show up much more the government's disingenuousness, obfuscation and deliberate misleading of the people about what they are actually doing.
The facts have to come out, not just in terms of the public being aware but in terms of the broader aspect of the level of deliberate dishonesty that this government will engage in, particularly on this issue. They know it is an election winner. The only reason they are still on the government benches is their exploitation of this issue, and they exploited it without any concern for the facts, the truth or the cost of the damage to the country. I think a trend is starting to emerge now. People are becoming more aware: they are aware that there was clear misleading of the Australian people by the minister and the Prime Minister—a range of ministers—about what happened in relation to this incident. That is why this inquiry is so important. 
We have seen the extraordinary revelations yesterday in relation to the Department of Defence tapping telephones and the government's cover-up in relation to that. It shows again the lengths the government will go to. We have had the issue I raised in question time today of allegations made to convince the Australian people that adults were, basically, forcibly sewing children's lips together—allegations that have subsequently been extensively investigated and found to be completely false. I think there is a pretty clear pattern emerging here. On anything to do with immigration or refugees, whether it is tapping telephone calls to the Tampa or whether it is misleading the Australian people about the activities of refugees and asylum seekers themselves, this government cannot be trusted. The statements they make about this area cannot be trusted. 
In such a circumstance, where, we now know, the form is there, the record is clear. Because the government know that it has been so politically valuable for them, in this area of policy they obviously will do whatever it takes, including deceiving the Australian people, to try and maximise that electoral advantage. At least in this policy area, I think the Senate—and more and more the Australian public—are now realising that you simply cannot take the government at their word. That being the case, we have to examine the facts ourselves. We have to make sure that we can be informed in an accurate way about what is happening and about the policy so the Australian people can get the facts instead of distortions and misinformation from the government. This is a very valuable inquiry.  
Senator Hill, for some reason, seemed to think that it was a terrible thing for the Democrats to actually cooperate with the Labor Party. I am not sure if that attitude would be replicated when we cooperate with the government, which we obviously do plenty of times. I know it is just cheap political rhetoric from Senator Hill but, nonetheless, it is pretty obviously a hollow claim. Indeed, it is very rare, I would think, for Labor and the Democrats to have reached a common view on anything to do with immigration and refugee policy. In the last six months we have been very much out on our own, so this is a rarity, if anything, and, in that sense, we welcome it. And as illustration of the temporary nature of such cooperation, the so-called cosy relationship between Labor and the Democrats will be rent asunder because we will be supporting Senator Murphy's amendment when he moves it and I understand the Labor Party will not. For the information of Senator Hill, who may wish to note this comment, I have had no discussions with the Labor Party about the chair of the committee. I am quite open to discussion with all members of the committee about what the best option might be. That is something that would be worth examining. If Senator Hill wants to move away from fairly fatuous political rhetoric and get down to trying to be constructive, we will happily examine that. The Democrats will be supporting this motion. 
I should put on the record that we will not be supporting Senator Brown's amendment. We have motions on the notice paper already in terms of requesting the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to investigate and report to parliament, and that is going to be undertaken. I saw Senator Brown himself on the television news—it is always good to see him on the media, putting forward his wisdom—saying we need an independent inquiry into this issue. I agree, and think it is going to happen with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. A Senate inquiry, while it is very useful, is not independent. That is not to say I would rule it out, but I think it would be best to see what the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security produces first. That may well then lead to another inquiry similar to this one, where we have to examine again exactly how low the government went in terms of their level of deceit of the Australian people. But I think that is something for later, rather than for now.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-02-13,"—I am conscious that we are starting the adjournment and that there are other speakers who wish to continue making remarks regarding Senator Gibson's decision to leave the Senate—and they are most deserved. I will endeavour to finish my remarks on the issue I want to raise tonight as quickly as I can. 
Tonight I want to make some comment regarding the recent bushfires that ravaged many parts of New South Wales over Christmas. I note that today the Senate and the House of Representatives passed, unanimously, motions that acknowledged the contribution of thousands of Australians who were involved in the fight to prevent loss of life and property. We particularly acknowledged the efforts of firefighters, emergency and rescue services, members of various government services and agencies, as well as many thousands of volunteers, both individually and as members of organisations across so many communities. Tonight I want to record my own appreciation of the work done by all those thousands of Australians, particularly in the areas of the Sutherland shire and the Illawarra, where I live.
I was not directly affected by the fires, but members of my family living in Stanwell Park and Heathcote were. They were initially stranded in Stanwell Park on Christmas Day as the fires approached, and my father, who resides at the John Paul Retirement Village in Heathcote, was—along with all the other residents—evacuated. So we saw first hand the magnificent way in which a community pulled together to help those threatened and evacuated because of the fires. Local clubs, businesses, charities and service organisations provided emergency accommodation, food, clothing and other support for hundreds of people who were forced to leave their homes. In a number of cases, nursing homes and retirement villages were evacuated during the early hours of the morning of Boxing Day. This was no easy task, but it was achieved with efficiency and safety. 
Tragically, unfortunately, some people were very seriously affected, losing their homes and possessions. I want to record my appreciation to both the federal government and the state government of New South Wales for acting quickly to assist those people to rebuild their homes and their lives.
Whilst today's motion was carried unanimously, it is unfortunate that some members of the Liberal and National parties have tried to make political capital out of these tragic circumstances. I refer to an article by Senator John Tierney in the Australian newspaper of Friday, 11 January. That article is entitled `Blame Bob Carr and greenies for the fire crisis, suggests John Tierney'. I will not quote extensively from the article, but Senator Tierney talks about the conflagration in New South Wales and that it was far more intense and extensive than it would have been in earlier times when more realistic policies had prevailed. He goes on to say:
New South Wales environmental policies in this area are doing more harm than good. The incineration of the Royal National Park twice in seven years is stark testimony to that.
I happen to live very close to the Royal National Park, and I would remind Senator Tierney that, if he looked at the facts, he might recall a few salient points. Firstly, in 1994 the fires caused far greater property damage—and, indeed, a number of lives were lost—than occurred in the most recent fires at Christmas, even though the most recent fires were probably a greater threat in their intensity and geographical spread. Fortunately, on this occasion, unlike 1994, no lives were lost at all, though, unfortunately, one fire fighter suffered a heart attack during the crisis.
I do not want to apportion any blame for the 1994 fires but I remind Senator Tierney and the Senate that the Liberal-National Party coalition was in power in New South Wales in 1994, not the Labor Party. Obviously there has been much improvement since that time in our ability to combat large bushfires, and no doubt we will also learn from this latest crisis. We must keep improving our firefighting capability but it requires constructive debate, not political point scoring.
Secondly, Senator Tierney should note that a lot of the fires were deliberately lit, which explains why fires suddenly occurred in areas where they would not normally have been anticipated. No amount of back-burning, which he urges, can protect some areas when people deliberately start fires near homes, townships and communities. Thirdly, fires do not follow predictable courses. For instance, I recall that in 1994 houses were burnt in the Sydney suburbs of Bonnet Bay and Jannali. These are highly residential areas and those houses were in streets which were a very large distance from surrounding bushland.
On this most recent occasion, many homes in the Sutherland Shire and the Illawarra were saved because of the professionalism of our firefighters and the improved equipment, resources and training that has been provided since 1994. For instance, in Waterfall and Bundeena, both communities in the heart of the Royal National Park, not a single house was lost. So it is simplistic and spurious to claim that fires and the resultant damage could have been prevented simply by more burning off. But that is the usual cry of the Liberals and the National Party, and particularly Senator Tierney, who tried to make political capital out of other people's misfortunes.
I also draw attention to criticism levelled at the New South Wales Rural Fire Service by Andrew Fraser, the National Party member for Coffs Harbour in the New South Wales parliament. What is interesting about Mr Andrew Fraser is that that same gentleman had to recently call upon the services of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service to put out fires which he had started on his own property. Without getting permission to do so, he started fires on his own property in an attempt to burn off. That fire got out of control, escaped into a local state forest and destroyed two hectares of land. It would have been a lot worse except for the efforts of the volunteer firefighters who rushed out to Mr Fraser's own property to put out that fire. 
Whilst I support strongly the motion that was moved today in the Senate, I note point 4 which indicated that the Senate recognises the way that the community heroically pulled together in a time of crisis, and that truly demonstrates the strength of the Australian spirit. Unfortunately, some of the comments and articles of Senator Tierney and Mr Andrew Fraser demonstrate all that is mean spirited about the coalition.
I will finish by taking this opportunity to extend my best wishes to Senator Gibson. He is definitely not a mean spirited person. In fact, he is a very warm and open-hearted person. I have not had an opportunity to work with him much on committees, except on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit when I first came into the parliament. However, my wife and I enjoyed his company and that of his wife, Pauline, on a trip to Ireland. I know that Pauline and Brian will accept our best wishes—both mine and Jan's—and I hope they have many long, happy years together out of the Senate in whatever endeavours Brian pursues.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-02-13,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was awarded a contract by the Tasmanian Government to provide project costing, specification and planning for the development of an integrated, cross-jurisdictional prototype capable of delivering online transaction for 3 levels of government. The contract was between Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and the Tasmanian Government. The funding for that work was approved by the TIGERS Steering Committee as the work met the TIGERS funding criteria.
(2)	The selection process was undertaken by the State Tasmanian Government
(3)	The total cost of the contract was $55,000.
(4)	Yes. Two independent consultants were engaged to provide a quality assessment of the specifications. One provided an independent assessment of risks, quality and costing aspects of the information provided in the project brief. The other reviewed the project management aspects of the project brief. 
(5)	The first consultant was selected on the basis of a tender process carried out in accordance with Commonwealth Government Procurement guidelines.
The second consultant was used because TIGERS has an existing contractual arrangement with that consultancy firm to provide independent project management reviews during the life of the TIGERS program.
(6)	The first consultant cost $11,000. Work carried out by the second consultant has been covered under its existing contract.
(7)	Yes.
(8)	Both consultants advised that the project brief lacked detail, and the solution proposed which involved the development of a prototype was too large, complex and expensive. Given this, a high risk was assessed with proceeding to the development of the prototype.
(9)	In this case, the specifications were not developed by staff working for the TIGERS program because of the scope and the complexity of the work. Under these circumstances, the Tasmanian Government in consultation with staff working for the TIGERS program developed the contract and the deliverable's identified in the contract. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was engaged to develop the specifications in accordance with the contractual requirements. 
(10)	In this case, additional expertise was required to provide advice on the viability of the solutions because of the scope, complexity and cost identified in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Communications: Contracts to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,1,answer
