"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and 10 related bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
Can I outline that the bills implement the government’s commitment to establish a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They provide for the establishment of—
—A big new tax!
—a scheme regulator and a registry, and address such matters as emissions coverage of the scheme, emission caps and the definition of liable entities. Of course the opposition interject, but this is a matter requesting exemption from the cut-off. The bills are required to address the urgent need to respond to climate change through the CPRS. The bills give effect to the outcomes of negotiations that were agreed by the government and the opposition back in November 2009. The provisions that give effect to these agreed outcomes back in November 2009 were considered in detail by the Senate Committee of the Whole in November and December, as we recall.
The CPRS is the key mechanism for meeting emissions reduction targets that have the support of both the government and the opposition and are key targets. Uncertainty created by a delay in the passage of the bills does raise risks for business regarding the future costs of climate change action and is hampering investments that enable the transformation to a low carbon pollution economy.
—Nice try, but untrue!
—That’s not what they’re saying!
—I note that the opposition now seem to carp and interject. Nonetheless, some elements of the CPRS such as the crediting of carbon sequestration by reafforestation projects commence on 1 July 2010, and passage will give certainty to both farmers and businesses who intend to participate. These are the reasons we require urgency for these bills. Passage of the legislation will also give business time to prepare for the CPRS and associated regulation.
The introduction and passage of these bills in the same sitting will not limit consideration by the Senate. The Senate has obviously taken a view to discuss and debate these bills at length. There has been ample opportunity for proper consideration of these bills, consistent with the government’s longstanding commitment to ensuring adequate scrutiny and debate of proposed legislation. Those are the reasons outlined for why the bills require exemption from the cut-off and I ask the Senate to agree to the motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-02-24,"—The coalition will not be supporting the exemption from the cut-off under standing order 111. The government is asking us to change procedure. We do not want to change procedure on this occasion. This is the third attempt to introduce this suite of bills. The government has introduced these bills in the past. The Senate has rejected them. The government now wants to waste time introducing these bills for a third time here when there is no case put that these bills need to be exempt from the cut-off which is a normal position in this place. The government has not made a case.
The minister has outlined that these bills have a commencement in 2011—not this year, but 2011. So there is no urgent need demonstrated for these bills to be brought into this session when the normal Senate procedure under the standing orders would be for these bills to be considered in the next session of parliament after being introduced in this session. It is clear that the bills do not have majority support in this place and I would anticipate that being the case again, so there is no urgency. I think the government is just trying to waste time and maybe make a political point out of these bills. Let the Senate do its work in its normal manner.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-02-24,"—In closing the debate can I say that the point the opposition make is that they do not see that failure to deal with the bills will result in continued uncertainty for business and further delay in new investments that will lead to a low-pollution economy. These bills were agreed to by the opposition in November. They have been through a committee debate that went for many, many days. The need to act on climate change remains pressing and the CPRS remains the lowest cost way to tackle climate change. Passage of these bills will ensure Australia caps carbon pollution for the first time. The CPRS will make polluters pay and use the money raised from polluters to support families. Failure to pass these bills will make the challenge of tackling climate change more difficult.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ludwig’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-24,"—I seek leave to make a short statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—Explain yourself again!
—I am glad that Senator Carr is so keen for me to make a statement. Maybe he would like to keep quiet and actually listen for once, rather than speaking over someone—as a fellow Victorian. I was not able to get down here before the vote. But, on that last vote, I want to share the reasons why I did not support the motion to exempt the bills from the cut-off. Frankly, in Australia support for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is dropping by the day. There is no need to rush this through parliament, bypassing simple processes. It is an absolute joke. That is the reason why I did not support the cut-off motion—because it would have meant rushing through this legislation when there is absolutely no rush at all.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-24,"—I seek leave to move a motion to provide that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Prohibition of Support for Whaling) Bill 2010 have precedence over all government business until determined.
Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I move:
That these bills be now read a second time.
I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speeches read as follows—

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme 2010
In the final hours of parliamentary sittings last year the government made the commitment that on the first sitting day this year, we would introduce into parliament legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS).
The government did this through introducing the CPRS legislative package into the House of Representatives on 2 February 2010.
We said the bill introduced would be inclusive of the amendments agreed to by the coalition party room in November 2009.
And that is what this bill contains.
Let me make it clear on behalf of the government that our position on the CPRS is based on five strong foundations:
Firstly, it reflects a scientific consensus, accepted by governments around the world, that climate change is real and happening now, and will inflict severe costs on this country.
Second, the government’s target for emissions reduction is both responsible and achievable and the CPRS is the best mechanism to achieve those targets.
Third, the CPRS is the lowest cost way to reduce emissions for Australian households.
Fourth, the CPRS is the most globally responsible approach to the threat of climate change—it ensures Australia meets its emissions reduction targets.
And fifth, the CPRS reflects the consistent policy of the government that formed a key element of our 2007 election platform that was supported by the Australian people.
The alternative approach offered by the opposition is nothing more than a pretend policy and it cannot be trusted.
Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, thinks climate change is, in his own words, ‘absolute crap’.
The opposition leader’s climate change plan is nothing more than a climate con job.
It does less, costs more and will mean higher taxes.
There are three essential problems with the opposition leader’s climate con job.
Firstly, it will not work; it does not require anything of emitters of carbon pollution and there is no cap on carbon pollution.
Secondly, it slugs taxpayers instead of big polluters.
Thirdly, it is unfunded, inevitably meaning higher taxes.
The Tony Abbott climate con job does less, costs more and will mean higher taxes.
This is the contrast that the Australian parliament faces today.

Climate change science

It is extremely important, of course, that we take account of the climate change science.
Human induced emissions are increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels in 2007 were nearly 40 per cent higher than those in 1990.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in its 2007 fourth assessment report that:

… warming of the climate system is unequivocal—

and—

very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.

Its findings are supported by the national science academies in all major developed and developing countries, including our own.
No government can ignore these findings. No political party or political leader can responsibly ignore the science.
The Australian government accepts that climate change is a reality and that we must act.
Despite the claims of many in the coalition, there is no evidence warming has stopped.
Globally, 14 of the 15 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2009.
The Bureau of Meteorology reports that 2009 was the second hottest year on record in Australia.
The past decade was the hottest decade on record in Australia and globally.
The current Leader of the Opposition is risking Australia’s economic and environmental future by saying he is:
… hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change.
He made that statement on 27 July 2009.
Every other responsible political leader in Australia —including the former member for Bennelong and the member for Wentworth—has previously accepted the global scientific consensus and resolved to act in Australia’s national interest.

Impacts on Australia

The science shows that in future, without global action, the earth will continue to warm and sea levels will continue to rise.
Australia is already the driest inhabited continent on earth and is heavily exposed to the impacts of climate change.
Australia faces huge environmental and economic costs from climate change impacts, including on water security, agriculture, energy supply, health, coastal communities and infrastructure.
Climate change is already affecting water availability in Australia.
If global emissions continue unabated, irrigated agriculture—and the thousands of associated jobs—in the Murray-Darling Basin may well disappear by the end of the century.
Australia is a largely coastal society, with around 85 per cent of the population living in the coastal region. This means as many as 247,000 existing residential buildings valued at up to $63 billion are potentially at risk from a 1.1-metre sea level rise.
The Great Barrier Reef is already showing impacts of climate change through mass coral bleaching and could be effectively destroyed by mid-century if there is not action.
Climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of bushfires, heat waves and extreme tides in Australia.
We know only too well the impact that these events can have on the lives of others in our community.
Yet the Leader of the Opposition has rejected the science, mainstream conservative thinking and the best economic advice.
And he has rejected, therefore, acting in Australia’s national interest.

CPRS: the best mechanism

Australia’s emissions challenge is clear and it has bipartisan support, as we understand it.
In May last year the government set out its target range: a five per cent unconditional reduction, with up to 15 per cent and 25 per cent both conditional on the extent of action by others.
This target range was supported by the coalition at the time and reaffirmed on 2 December 2009 by the office of the Leader of the Opposition:
                The Coalition is committed to the bipartisan targets as they currently stand.
The challenge posed by those targets is clear:
In 2020 Australia’s emissions are projected to be 664 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent; and
At a five per cent target, Australia’s emissions reduction challenge is to reduce 2020 emissions by 138 million tonnes; at a 15 per cent target, the challenge is 194 million tonnes; and at 25 per cent, the challenge is 249 million tonnes.
That is the challenge that both political parties —both sides of politics—have committed to on the grounds that there is a bipartisan position concerning the targeted cuts in emissions by 2020.
The debate today, therefore, should fundamentally be about how best to rise to that bipartisan challenge.
On this front, the Howard government’s Shergold report, the Garnaut review and the United Kingdom government’s Stern report all canvassed different approaches to taking action to achieve emission reductions and came to the same conclusion that an emissions trading scheme is the lowest cost and most effective mechanism to deal with climate change.
Even the current Leader of the Opposition in his 2009 book Battlelines acknowledged that:

               
 The Howard Government—

in 2007—

               
 proposed an emissions trading scheme because this seemed the best way to obtain the highest emission reduction at the lowest cost.

That appears at page 171 of the book of the member for Warringah called Battlelines.
The business community also recognises the value of the emissions trading approach. The Business Council of Australia has said:

               
 … the best way for Australia to transition to a low emissions economy is through a market-based emissions trading scheme—

and the international community accepts that view. Thirty-two countries around the world already have emissions trading schemes, and others, including the US, Japan and Korea, are developing such schemes currently.
Virtually no other developed economy in the world agrees with the opposition leader’s more recent rejection of emissions trading.
And there is a simple reason why, and that is that emissions trading is the most effective and lowest cost means to reduce carbon emissions.
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme requires emitters to buy a permit for each tonne of carbon pollution they produce.
The government will determine the number of permits that will be available each year and, by doing so, will set a cap on pollution levels.
A cap each year allows a targeted reduction in emissions to be achieved over time.
A carbon price is established, therefore, by the auctioning and trading of permits.
The carbon price creates an incentive for polluters to reduce their emissions in the cheapest, most efficient way.
After dismissing the CPRS, the current Leader of the Opposition has proposed what he calls a ‘direct action’ policy as an alternative—but it is a con job.
His plan lets polluters off the hook and shifts the burden to ordinary families.
The fact is no cobbled-together list of subsidies, as outlined in opposition leader’s policy announced today, could ever hope to match the effectiveness of putting a clear price and cap on carbon pollution across the economy because, unlike the CPRS, the opposition leader’s policy is less effective. It will not work.
It will cost more because it does not create incentives to find the low-cost methods to reduce emissions. It is a ‘pick winners’ approach.
It also has no cap on emissions; it therefore cannot guarantee to meet an emissions reduction target.
The opposition leader’s position also cannot link to international markets to take advantage of cost effective emissions reductions in other countries, and it will shift the cost of emissions reductions from big emitters of carbon pollution to households.
Finally, the proposal does not provide compensation to pensioners, carers and low- and middle-income households, something to which the government has paid particular attention.
Former Prime Minister John Howard’s own Shergold report found that relying on subsidies alone to reduce emissions will be more expensive than a market-based approach like the CPRS.
Likewise, Professor Garnaut concluded that without a carbon price, the cost of achieving emissions reductions will be much higher.

Lowest cost way to reduce emissions

The government, for its part, is determined to implement a scheme which tackles climate change at the lowest cost. Ultimately there is no cost-free way of reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change.
Any politician who tells the community otherwise is simply not telling the truth—and cannot be trusted. The Leader of the Opposition, in announcing the coalition’s policy, stated it would not cost the community and it would not cost jobs. It is a position that defies rational thought. It is not true.
The fact is the CPRS is the lowest cost way of reducing emissions.
It also imposes the lowest costs on Australian families.
The impact on household costs will be just above a one per cent price rise.
The average price impact of the CPRS on households is estimated at around $624 per year by 2013 for the average household.
Around 90 per cent of all households under the proposals for the CPRS will receive assistance—on average that will be around $660 per year.
All pensioners and low-income households will be fully assisted.
That is because the money raised from emitters of carbon pollution, who have a liability to purchase permits, will be used to assist working families with the price increases under the scheme.

The CPRS is globally responsible

Any country that accepts the science, as I said before, and the threat that climate change represents has a responsibility to act.
No country can address this problem alone—it will require an unprecedented level of international cooperation.
The government has said that Australia will do its fair share as part of the global effort—we will do no more and no less than other countries.
Last December, the world met in Copenhagen as part of the effort to forge a global agreement to tackle climate change.
The outcome, called the Copenhagen accord, is less than we, and like-minded countries, wanted.
But it is an important step forward towards coordinated global action on climate change.
For the first time, leaders of both developed and developing countries have agreed to:
specify emissions reduction targets or actions by both major developed and developing nations;
limit global warming to less than two degrees;
provide the finance necessary to support mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries; and
measurement, reporting and verification by both developed and developing countries.
However, the Copenhagen conference also left much work to do and Australia remains committed to achieving a comprehensive agreement under the UNFCCC.
Countries are already acting and Australia is by no means going it alone.
Thirty-two countries already have emission trading schemes and others are developing their own.
Others including the US, China, and India have set targets and are taking climate action.
In recognition that the Copenhagen accord did not deliver a final binding treaty, the government has said that we will not increase Australia’s emissions reduction target above five per cent until three conditions are met:
the level of global ambition becomes sufficiently clear;
the credibility of those commitments and actions is established; and
there is clarity on the assumptions for emissions accounting and access to markets.
The government’s aim and intention is to reach conclusion on these matters of course in partnership internationally as soon as possible.

A consistent and responsible approach to climate change

The CPRS is the principal mechanism by which we will achieve our targets and act on climate change in the national interest. It is the only fundamental foundational mechanism by which we will achieve the targeted reduction that I averted to earlier, 138 million tonnes by the year 2020 to achieve the five per cent reduction.
But we have also put in place around $15 billion in complementary measures to assist the transition to a low-carbon economy and increase the demand for low-pollution jobs. These are very important measures. They include:
increasing the renewable energy target to 20 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by the year 2020;
support for energy efficiency;
$4.5 billion for industrial scale carbon capture and storage and large scale solar power generation; the Australian Climate Change Science Framework to set climate change research policies; and
$126 million Climate Change Adaptation Program to better manage climate change impacts.
However, projections show that even with these measures Australia’s emissions will continue to rise, reaching 120 per cent of 2000 levels in 2020.
That is why we need a substantial, economy-wide approach that reduces emissions in the most efficient lowest cost mechanism possible.
For the last three years, Labor both in opposition and in government has backed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as the most effective and lowest cost means to reduce carbon pollution.
The current Leader of the Opposition has had five different positions on this issue. The government has been consistent and the new Leader of the Opposition completely inconsistent on this issue.
He supported emissions trading during the Howard government period when the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, concluded and made absolutely clear that the science demanded a response from government and that the lowest cost most efficient mechanism for achieving targeted emission reductions was an emissions trading scheme.
As part of that government the now Leader of the Opposition accepted that position. Then of course when it was opportune to afford him the opportunity to drag down the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, the now Leader of the Opposition claimed that climate change was ‘absolute crap’.
Then he said at one point that the Liberals should support the CPRS unamended. Then he demanded amendments to the legislation last year when it was previously in a different form before the parliament.
And now he opposes the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in totality for his own political gain.
Indeed, in his own words, the opposition leader has described himself as a ‘weather vane’ on climate change. He shifts around on the most important public policy challenge that we face.
It is the responsibility of any political leadership figure in this country to adopt a credible position and he has already failed that test.
His erratic approach now forms Liberal Party policy.
And you cannot trust a leader on issues like this if he thinks the climate science, the subject of considered peer review work by many, many scientists around the world that have stood up to intense scrutiny, is ‘absolute crap’. His position cannot be respected.
What we know is that the Leader of the Opposition does not accept the climate science and he is looking for a political fig leaf. Hence we see the policy position that has announced today and it cannot work.
What will work is an emissions trading scheme in the form of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

Conclusion

The government respects the climate science and the need to act.
Our position has been consistent for years.
And we are acting in an economically responsible manner seeking the most effective and lowest cost means to achieve targeted emissions reduction.
The bills before the House today establish a clear framework to tackle this great challenge.
If the opposition still has any credibility, character or consistency, they will support this legislation based on the agreement that was endorsed by the coalition party room less than 10 weeks ago.
That was a credible stance to engage responsibly on behalf of the Australian community with the government to negotiate amendments and agree to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to secure passage of the legislation.
The responsible stance that the former Leader of the Opposition took on that issue on behalf of the community led to him being torn down as the Leader of the Opposition for politically opportunist reasons. What we now see from the opposition is a completely unrealistic, unworkable, incredible, economically irresponsible policy response.
What this country needs to deal with climate change is an emissions trading scheme to achieve the least cost emissions reductions.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 contains consequential and transitional provisions relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
The Bill seeks to amend 12 Acts and one set of regulations.

National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting

The most significant amendments relate to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.
This Act provides the existing national framework for the reporting of information on greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy production. To maintain the Government’s commitment to the streamlining of reporting of greenhouse and energy data, the Act will be the starting framework for monitoring, reporting and assurance under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
A number of changes are proposed to strengthen the Act and align it with the requirements of the Scheme, as outlined in the Government’s White Paper titled Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future, which was released on 15 December 2008. Under the amendments, one report will satisfy an entity’s reporting requirements for the Scheme and current reporting requirements under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.

Coverage of synthetic greenhouse gases

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme covers synthetic greenhouse gases. As some of these gases are already regulated under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989, amendments will be made to that Act to align it with the Scheme.

Establishment of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority

The bill contains a number of consequential amendments relating to the establishment of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority.
As well as administering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the new Authority will take over administration of both greenhouse and energy reporting and the renewable energy target. This necessitates a number of legislative amendments to replace two existing statutory bodies—the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer—and transfer their functions to the Authority.
The creation of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority also gives rise to a number of other consequential amendments—for example, to apply financial management and accountability requirements to the Authority.

Measures to prevent market manipulation and misconduct

Australian emissions units and eligible international emissions units are to be financial products for the purposes of the Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 and Division 2, Part 2 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The bill amends these Acts accordingly.
These amendments will provide a strong regulatory regime to reduce the risk of market manipulation and misconduct relating to emissions units. Appropriate adjustments to the regime to fit the characteristics of units and avoid unnecessary compliance costs will be made through regulations. The Government has consulted on those regulations, which will be made shortly after passage and apply from commencement of this legislation.
As required by the Corporations Agreement between the Commonwealth, States and Territories, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted about the amendments to the corporations legislation and, to the extent necessary, has approved those amendments.

Taxation treatment of emissions units

Schedule 2 of the bill amends various taxation laws to clarify the income tax and goods and services tax treatment of emissions units.
The main consideration in designing the tax treatment of units is that the tax treatment should not compromise the main objectives of the Scheme. This means that tax should not influence decisions between purchasing, trading and surrendering units or alternatively reducing emissions. The preferred tax treatment will help implement the Scheme and reduce compliance and administration costs for taxpayers and the Australian Government.
For income tax, the amendments establish a rolling balance treatment of registered emissions units which is similar to that for trading stock. The result of the treatment is that the cost of a unit is deductible, with the effect of the deduction generally being deferred through the rolling balance until the sale or surrender of the unit.
The proceeds of selling a unit are assessable income with any difference in the value of units held at the beginning of an income year and at the end of that year being reflected in taxable income. Any increase in value is included in assessable income and any decrease in value allowed as a deduction.
The Bill also amends the goods and services tax law. It characterises a supply of an eligible emissions unit or a Kyoto unit as a supply of a personal property right and not a supply of or directly connected with real property. The amendments will promote certainty about the application of the normal GST rules to Scheme transactions.

Conclusion

The consequential amendments contained in this bill are important for the efficient and effective operation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The amendments seek, where possible, to streamline institutional and regulatory arrangements and minimise administrative costs with the Scheme.

Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2010

This bill would establish the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority—a new statutory authority that would be responsible for administering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
It is one of a package of bills to establish the Scheme.
The Authority will be responsible for auctioning and allocating emissions units, maintaining a national registry of emissions units and ensuring that firms comply with their obligations under the Scheme.
The Government’s intention is to establish an effective, efficient and independent regulator.
The Authority will be a body corporate headed by a Chair and between two and four other members. Through the Chair, it will employ Australian Public Service employees on behalf of the Commonwealth.
It will have a modern set of information-gathering, inspection and enforcement powers, conferred on it by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010.
The Authority will be at arm’s length from Government. As with other independent regulators, the Minister will only be able to provide directions on general matters and there are limited grounds on which a member of the Authority may be removed from office.
The Authority will also be accountable. It will be required to produce three yearly corporate plans and annual reports, and comply with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.
The Authority will take over the functions of the existing Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer, so that a single regulatory body will have overall responsibility for administration of climate change laws. This transfer of functions is to be affected through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010.
While it will have strong powers to ensure that Scheme obligations are complied with, the Authority will also have an important role in advising and assisting persons in relation to their obligations under the Scheme—something that is formally reflected in the Authority’s functions.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—Customs) Bill 2010

This bill, which is part of the legislative package to establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, is one of three technical bills which anticipate the possibility that the charge payable by a person to the Commonwealth for issue of an Australian emissions unit as the result of an auction, or for a fixed charge, is a tax within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.
This bill caters for the possibility that the charges I have mentioned are, in whole or part, both a tax and a duty of customs by providing for the imposition of such a charge under this bill.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—Excise) Bill 2010

This bill, which is part of the legislative package to establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, is one of three technical bills which anticipate the possibility that the charge payable by a person to the Commonwealth for issue of an Australian emissions unit as the result of an auction, or for a fixed charge, is a tax within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.
This bill caters for the possibility that the charges I have mentioned are, in whole or part, both a tax and a duty of excise by providing for the imposition of such a charge under this bill.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—General) Bill 2010

This bill, which is part of the legislative package to establish the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, is one of three technical bills which anticipate the possibility that the charge payable by a person to the Commonwealth for issue of an Australian emissions unit as the result of an auction, or for a fixed charge, is a tax within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.
The Commonwealth does not consider that these charges are taxes for constitutional purposes. However, the Government has taken an approach of abundant caution, with the charges bills providing safeguards in case a court reaches a different view on this question.
This bill caters for the possibility that the charges I have mentioned are, in whole or part, a tax. In those circumstances, this bill imposes the charge, but only to the extent the charge is neither a duty of customs nor a duty of excise.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) Bill 2010

This bill seeks to establish in legislation the CPRS fuel credit measure. It will provide transitional assistance to eligible industries and fuels that will not benefit from the cent-for-cent fuel tax reduction made under the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010.
The CPRS fuel credit will offset the increase in eligible fuel prices by an amount equal to the reduction in the fuel tax rate. CPRS fuel credit amounts will be adjusted automatically with adjustments to the fuel tax made under the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010.
The CPRS fuel credit program will give transitional assistance to the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014. For the period the Government has fixed the emissions unit charge at $10 per tonne, based on current taxation arrangements, this credit will equal 2.455 cents per litre.
Activities incidental to the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries currently receive 50 per cent of the fuel tax credit under the Fuel Tax Act 2006 until 30 June 2012 after which they will be entitled to a full fuel tax credit. As these incidental activities will therefore receive a partial benefit from the reduction in fuel tax until 30 June 2012, they will be entitled to a partial CPRS fuel credit until that date. This CPRS fuel credit will be 50 per cent of the full CPRS fuel credit while the reduced fuel tax credit rate applies, and the full CPRS fuel credit thereafter until 30 June 2014.
CPRS fuel credits will also provide transitional assistance to heavy on-road transport users for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012. The industry will be entitled to a CPRS fuel credit of 2.455 cents per litre based on current taxation arrangements and the introduction of an emissions unit charge fixed at $10 per tonne.
Liquid petroleum gas (LPG), liquid natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) are alternative transport fuels and will face a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme emissions unit obligation. However, as LPG, LNG and CNG are currently outside the fuel excise system they will not benefit from the fuel tax reductions applying to other fuels. The CPRS fuel credit program will therefore be extended to these fuels.
To be eligible for a CPRS fuel credit for the supply of gaseous fuels, an entity must be the liable entity for that fuel under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010.
Suppliers will benefit from a CPRS fuel credit for differing transitional periods depending on the fuel.
The CPRS fuel credit will be provided to LPG suppliers for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014 as it is predominantly used for private motoring as an alternative to petrol.
The CPRS fuel credit will be provided to LNG and CNG suppliers for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012. This treatment is the same as for heavy on-road transport as LNG and CNG are predominantly used for this purpose.
The Government will review these measures upon their conclusion.
As the volume of emissions from these fuels is substantially lower than the volume from petrol and diesel, the Australian emissions unit auction charge impact on them will be lower. To reflect this, these fuels will receive less than the full amount of the CPRS fuel credit.
From 1 July 2011, based on current taxation arrangements and the introduction of the emissions unit charge fixed at $10 per tonne for one year, CNG will receive a CPRS fuel credit of 1.91 cents per litre which is 78 per cent of the full credit, LNG will receive a credit of 1.23 cents per litre which is 50 per cent of the full CPRS fuel credit. LPG, which has the three‑year assistance period, will receive a credit of 1.64 cents per litre, which is 67 per cent on the full CPRS fuel credit, for the first year after which the credit will be adjusted in accordance with increases in the emissions unit charge.
The CPRS fuel credit program will be administered by the Australian Taxation Office and claims will be made in the Business Activity Statement in the same manner as fuel tax credits.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 will legislate amendments to the Fuel Tax Act 2006, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 necessitated by the introduction of the CPRS Fuel Credits Bill and the administrative arrangements announced by the Government.
The measures in the CPRS Fuel Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill are mechanical in nature. For example the existing formula in the Fuel Tax Act for determining the net fuel amount, which is the amount either owed to the Commissioner of Taxation or that the Commissioner owes, is being replaced. The new formula includes the CPRS fuel credit and increasing or decreasing adjustments for CPRS fuel credits.
Full details of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010

This bill seeks to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to confirm in legislation the Government’s commitment in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future White Paper. The Government will cut fuel taxes on a cent-for-cent basis to offset the initial price impact on fuel of introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
The Government recognises that people have limited flexibility to respond quickly to changes in fuel prices but that, over time, transport choices can respond to price changes.
To give households and businesses time to adjust to the Scheme, this legislation introduces a mechanism to automatically adjust the rate of fuel tax on all fuels that are currently subject to the 38.143 cents per litre rate of excise.
Fuel tax consists of excise duty on domestically manufactured fuels and excise-equivalent customs duty on imported fuels. Fuel tax is predominantly applied at a rate of 38.143 cents per litre across the range of fuels including petrol, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, heating oil, biodiesel and fuel ethanol.
Different fuels emit different amounts of carbon when they burn and their prices will increase according to the volume of their emissions. To minimise compliance costs, the fuel tax cut will be made ‘across the board’ to currently taxed fuels. The fuel excise adjustment will be based on the expected rise in the price of diesel resulting from the introduction of the Scheme. This will ensure there is cent‑for-cent assistance for diesel users.
Diesel emits more carbon than petrol on a per litre basis so the fuel tax cut will provide more than cent‑for-cent assistance for petrol users, which make up the majority of motorists. However, diesel use is becoming more common as fuel and vehicle standards improve. Basing the fuel tax cut on diesel will therefore ensure that the Government’s cent‑for‑cent commitment is delivered for the most common fuels used by households.
Any reductions will take place on 1 January and 1 July of each year, to harmonise with the Business Activity Statement reporting period.
The first fuel tax reduction will occur on 1 July 2011 with the commencement of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On 1 July 2011, based on current taxation arrangements and that the emissions unit charge will be fixed at $10 per tonne, the fuel tax will be reduced by 2.455 cents per litre to 35.688 cents per litre.
After the fixed emission unit price of $10 per tonne lapses on 30 June 2012, the need for further reductions, and the amount, will be assessed based on the average Australian emissions unit auction charge over the preceding six‑month period. If the average unit charge at the time of the assessment is greater than the average unit charge that formed the basis of the previous reduction, then the fuel tax rate will be further reduced. This approach will apply to adjustments that occur from 1 July 2012.
If the current average unit charge amount is less than the previous average unit charge amount then the rate of fuel tax will remain the same — the fuel tax rate will not be increased if the emissions charge has fallen.
Information on the six-month average Australian emissions unit auction charge will be published by the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority in accordance with section 271 of the CPRS Bill.
The final reduction will be made, if necessary, on 1 July 2014. The fuel tax rate at that date will be the ongoing rate, that is, the fuel tax rate will not revert to the 38.143 cents per litre rate. At this time the Government will review the mechanism introduced by these amendments.
The amendments to the Excise Tariff Act will commence on 1 July 2011 assuming that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commences on that date.
Full details of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010 are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010

I am introducing today a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to confirm in legislation the Government’s commitment in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future White Paper. The commitment is to cut fuel taxes on a ‘cent for cent’ basis to offset the initial price impact on fuel of introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
This amendment will introduce a new section into the Customs Tariff Act to ensure that the reductions made to the excise rates on fuels due to the introduction of the Scheme also apply to the relevant imported products.
Where a relevant excise rate, as defined in the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010, is reduced, this amendment will substitute the same rate to the excise-equivalent customs duty rates. The substitution will apply to the subheadings in Schedules 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and item 50(1A) in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act.
Only the rate of excise-equivalent duty - that is, the non-ad valorem - component of the duty will be substituted.
The amendments to the Customs Tariff Act will commence on 1 July 2011 assuming the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 commences on that date.
Full details of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010 are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Amendment (Household Assistance) Bill 2010

This bill delivers on the Government’s commitment to assist low and middle‑income households with the expected increases in the cost of living arising from the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
Climate change threatens Australia’s way of life and our future prosperity.
Australians want action on climate change.
That’s why the Government has moved to introduce the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
It will allow economic growth without growth in emissions.
However, the introduction of the Scheme will have a modest impact on the cost of living for households.
That is why the Government is providing low and middle-income households with upfront assistance to adjust to the impacts of the scheme.
Through a package of cash assistance, tax offsets and other measures, the Government will help these households maintain their standard of living while moving to a low pollution future.
This bill delivers on the Government’s commitments given in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper that:
pensioners, seniors, carers, veterans, people with disability, the unemployed, students and other allowees will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme;
low-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme; and
middle-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme.
The assistance in this bill delivers on these commitments.
The average overall cost of living for households is expected to be $624 higher once the scheme is fully up and running (by the middle of 2013), or about $12 per week. However, the average amount of assistance that the Government will provide to help with this will be $660.
8.1 million households, out of a total 8.8 million households will receive direct cash assistance. All pensioners, people with a disability, carers and low income households will be fully compensated for cost increases they face.
This bill takes account of changes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme announced on 4 May 2009 that introduces an initial $10 per tonne fixed carbon price in 2011‑12 and a flexible carbon price in 2012‑13. The composition of the Household Assistance package reflects this staged approach.
The Bill is also fully consistent with the amendments to the CPRS package agreed with the former Opposition leader, Mr Turnbull, and introduced and debated in the Parliament in November and December of 2009.
The Bill also takes account of other policy changes in the Budget, principally the Government’s Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform, which will affect how assistance is paid.
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will see a modest increase in the overall cost of living as we start to recognise the costs of carbon pollution in our everyday lives.
It is anticipated that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will result in increases in the cost of living of 0.4 per cent in 2011‑12 and 0.7 per cent in 2012‑13, resulting from an initial $10 per tonne fixed carbon price in 2011‑12 and a flexible carbon price in 2012‑13.
For many households government payments only represent a share of their income. Therefore increasing payments in line with headline Consumer Price Index impacts alone will not fully restore their standard of living following the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
To adequately compensate these households, compensation needs to go beyond the average household Consumer Price Index impact.
To ensure fairness, household composition has also been taken into account in designing the assistance.
This household assistance will be funded from the sale of carbon pollution permits. The Government has committed to use every cent raised from the introduction of the scheme and the sale of carbon pollution permits to help households and businesses adjust and move Australia to the low pollution economy of the future.

Increases to pension, benefit and allowance payments

The measures contained in this bill will increase the amount of certain social security and Veterans’ Affairs pension and allowance payments by 2.5 per cent over two years. This includes a 1 per cent increase from 1 July 2011 and a further 1.5 per cent increase on 1 July 2012, including upfront indexation.
These payment increases include bringing forward the expected Consumer Price Index related indexation increases that will automatically flow from the Scheme’s introduction. These indexation increases are expected to be 0.4 per cent in 2011‑12 and 0.7 per cent in 2012‑13. The 0.4 per cent expected indexation increase for 2011‑12 will be brought forward and paid from 1 July 2011. The 0.7 per cent increase in the expected indexation increase will be brought forward and paid from 1 July 2012.
Because assistance for the cost of living increase provided through certain payments will be brought forward, subsequent indexation arrangements will be adjusted to avoid duplicate assistance.
These increases will apply to a range of income support payments including the age pension, carer payment, veteran service pensions, disability support pension, Newstart allowance, Youth Allowance, parenting payments and the special benefit. A list of affected payments is included in the bill.

Increases to family tax benefit

Similar to pension and allowance increases, family tax benefit will be increased to help low and middle-income families meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The increases to family tax benefit will include the upfront payment of the expected automatic indexation increases that will flow from the scheme’s introduction. These automatic increases are expected to be 0.4 per cent in 2011‑12 and 0.7 per cent in 2012‑13. Subsequent indexation points for family tax benefit payments will be adjusted to avoid the duplication of assistance.
The per-child maximum standard rates of family tax benefit Part A for under 16 year olds and the family tax benefit Part A supplement will be increased by 2.5 per cent over two years, in line with changes to pensions and allowances.
Per-family standard rates of family tax benefit Part B and the Part B supplement will also be increased by 2.5 per cent over two years.
Additional increases are also being made to the base rate of family tax benefit Part A to assist recipients of these payments.
Adjustments will be made to indexation of family tax benefit Part A and Part B rates on 1 July 2012 and 1 July 2013 (and over further indexation points if necessary) to prevent duplication of the amounts brought forward on 1 July 2011 and 1 July 2012.
A new family tax benefit combined end-of-financial-year supplement will be created for families eligible for both family tax benefit Part A and Part B, where the main income earner has income above $58,000 per year. The value of the supplement will be up to $240 per family in 2011‑12 and up to $620 per family in 2012‑13 and later years. The supplement will phase in at four cents in the dollar when the primary earner’s income reaches $58,000 until the supplement reaches the maximum amount. The entitlement to this supplement will cease when a family’s entitlement to family tax benefit Part A or Part B ceases.

Measures delivered through the tax system

Assistance is also being provided through the tax system. These measures provide additional assistance to eligible low and middle‑income households through increases to the low income tax offset and various tax offsets for taxpayers who maintain a dependant.

Low income tax offset

From 1 July 2011, the low income tax offset will increase by $150 from $1,500 to $1,650. From 1 July 2012, it will increase a further $240 to $1,890. This will increase the taxable income up to which a taxpayer is entitled to an amount of low income tax offset to $71,250 for the 2011‑12 income year and to $77,250 for the 2012‑13 income year and later income years.

Senior Australians tax offset

These increases in the low income tax offset will increase the income level above which senior Australians eligible for the senior Australians tax offset begin to pay tax. From 1 July 2011, eligible senior Australians will have no tax liability until their income reaches $31,474 for singles and $27,680 for each member of a couple. From 1 July 2012, eligible senior Australians will have no tax liability until their income reaches $32,737 for singles and $29,280 for each member of a couple. Adjustments will also be made to the Medicare levy thresholds for senior Australians.

Dependency tax offsets

Measures for households include assistance to eligible adults who maintain a dependant. These increases will apply to the dependent spouse offset, the child‑housekeeper offset, the invalid-relative offset, the parent/parent‑in‑law offset and the housekeeper offset.
From 1 July 2011, these dependency offsets will increase by $60 while, from 1 July 2012, they will increase by $90. These increases will be in addition to the annual increases in these offsets that occur due to automatic indexation.

Transitional payments

A carbon pollution reduction transitional payment will be payable for each of the 2011‑12 and 2012‑13 income years to independent adults in low-income households who can show they have not been assisted in line with the Government’s commitments.
The amount of the carbon pollution reduction transitional payment for the 2011‑12 income year will be $200 per claimant and $500 per claimant in 2013.
The carbon pollution reduction transitional payment will become payable to qualifying individuals for the first year from 1 July 2012 and will be assessed with reference to the individual’s income in the 2011‑12 financial year. The person will have until 30 June 2014 to lodge a claim for the 2012 carbon pollution reduction transitional payment.
The second year of carbon pollution reduction transitional payment will be assessed with reference to the individual’s income in the 2012‑13 financial year and will become payable from 1 July 2013. A person will have until 30 June 2015 to lodge a claim to receive the 2013 carbon pollution reduction transitional payment.

Conclusion

Through the measures introduced by this bill, the Government will provide upfront support to low and middle-income households to help in adjusting to a low pollution future.
The Government will update the household assistance package on the basis of any new information on the estimated carbon price before the scheme starts. Each year, the adequacy of this assistance will be reviewed in the context of the Budget.
Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.",SENATE,<title>CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-02-24,"—I stand here proudly opposing the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2], albeit knowing that the government thinks that this might be a trigger for a double dissolution election. If that is the case, I say, ‘Mr Rudd, bring it on!’ Health is critically important to all Australians and this legislation is going to adversely impact on our health system. We want to have a balance, as I said yesterday, between the public and the private sector. We know the consequence of this initiative, and that consequence will be increased pressure on public hospitals and increased pressure on private health insurance premiums. We have seen in the media today suggestions that there are likely to be increases in private health insurance and we do not want that made any worse as a result of Mr Rudd’s miscalculation.
What is very important, though, with respect to this legislation is that the government has breached its word, the government has broken yet another promise, and that is on top of the promise with respect to GROCERYchoice and the shocking waste of taxpayers’ money, Fuelwatch, the promise of childcare centres being established in schools and the establishment of GP superclinics. The government has failed dismally. The superclinics were promised before the previous election and the government has not delivered. The government promised to fix the public hospital system by 30 June 2009 and it failed—it has not responded. Here we are heading into the second quarter of 2010 and the government still has not responded. It said it would take over the public hospital system. The government has not. It has breached its word; it has broken its promise. As families, as mums and dads, we tell our kids that truth and honesty is important and that you do not break your word. Mr Rudd, you should take that lesson. You should know that that is the case. You have children and you should be aware of that. I am sure that is what you have told them as kids.
There are so many promises that have been broken. I have a copy of a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association from Mr Rudd dated 20 November 2007. It promises no change to the private health insurance rebate scheme. And then we have a whole range of promises. On 12 May 2009 the Australian Health Insurance Association commented on how upset they have been with respect to the broken promise by Mr Rudd. The Australian Medical Association, on 12 May 2009, said:
Changes to the 30 % Private Health Insurance Rebate mean many Australian singles and families will pay a lot more for health insurance, and if you don’t keep your private health insurance you’ll be slugged with an increased Medicare Levy surcharge. They get you both ways.
I was at a rural doctors breakfast this morning. We were talking about the importance of health in rural and regional Australia. There were some very good demonstrations of that in the presentations that were made. This is not just going to hurt in the capital cities; this will hurt in rural and regional areas, places like northern Tasmania and north-west Tasmania.

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—I hear Senator O’Brien interjecting. What we want is real change in Tasmania on 20 March, because we know the state Labor government has failed dismally when it comes to health and the provision of health services in Tasmania. They made a promise to move the Royal Hobart Hospital onto a working port. They spent millions of dollars on consultants and reports to make that happen and guess what happened? They did a backflip. They changed their mind and wasted all that money. What a shocking waste. I have it here. It says:
After three years of planning costing in excess of $10 million—
of Tasmanian taxpayers’ money—
in May 2009 the State Labor Government again changed its position to redevelop the hospital on the current site but defer completion until 2030 …
Hello? Yes, 2030, in 20-odd years time from now. What a joke that is.
In terms of health services in Tasmania, Tasmanians deserve real change. They deserve better. Let us see what else we can learn from the health situation in Tasmania, knowing it is a very important issue, one of the top issues for Tasmanians as they make their decision on 20 March 2010. They will decide whether they want real change with the Will Hodgman led Liberal government post that special day.
In 1998 the state Labor Party promised to reduce waiting lists, but today there are thousands more Tasmanians on waiting lists. Tasmanians wait much longer than the national average. They promised to do better and they have failed, just like Mr Rudd promised and has not delivered. At the end of May 2009 there were 4,094 Tasmanians who had been waiting longer than the clinically recommended times—more than half of the waiting list. Of the 4,094 overboundary cases, there were 2,847 waiting at the Royal Hobart Hospital, 875 at the Launceston General Hospital in my home town of Launceston, 292 at the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie and 80 at the Mersey. These people were promised better services. They were promised that the waiting list would reduce and they have been let down by the Bartlett Labor government. They should do so much better. Tasmanians, as I say, have an opportunity to decide on 20 March.
It is clinically recommended that patients in categories 1, 2 and 3 be admitted within 30 days, 90 days and 365 days respectively. Waiting longer than clinically recommended for elective surgery, let us face it, often means more pain. That is what has happened, sadly, to the Tasmanians who have had to wait on these lists—they have suffered and endured, in many cases, more pain.
What did Lara Giddings, the Tasmanian Minister for Health, say in budget estimates on 20 June 2009? She said:
We do know people who have been on elective surgery waiting lists become emergencies.
So we know what is going to happen. Once that list stays long—and it will stay long under Labor—people will end up in accident and emergency. That is not what we want for our fellow Australians and fellow Tasmanians.
—If you’re worried about waiting lists, why did you sell them?
—I do not mind the odd interjection from Senator O’Brien, who is a Labor senator for Tasmania. I hope he is passing on this factual information to his state Labor colleagues so that we can get a good deal for Tasmanians when it comes to health and health care right across the state.
In May 2009 only 72 per cent of category 1 patients, 51 per cent of category 2 patients and 68 per cent of category 3 patients were admitted within clinically recommended times—a poor performance. In Tasmania, in the year to June 2008, there were 2,886 patients who waited more than a year for surgery and, of those, 173 waited longer than—wait for it—500 days. They had to wait 500 days. Even the federal government’s own state of our hospitals report last year showed that the number of Tasmanians waiting longer than a year for surgery was 10 per cent—in fact, 10.1 per cent—compared to 1.8 per cent in New South Wales and the national average of three per cent. Why do we lag behind? Why are we suffering so much under the Bartlett Labor government in terms of health and health care? It is totally unacceptable. It is very unfair on Tasmanians.
The acting CEO of the Royal Hobart Hospital, Michael Pervan—and you would think he would be reasonably balanced and independent—said in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry in 2009:
Our performance on elective surgery at the Royal Hobart Hospital has been lacklustre to say the least …
We know that the Tasmanian Liberals are committed, under Will Hodgman and his team, to fix the problems and make it better. I congratulate Will Hodgman and Brett Whiteley, the shadow minister for health down there, who has worked hard. He has consulted with all the key stakeholders to make a real difference, to make a real change. I hope that is delivered not just for him but for Tasmanians on 20 March, in a few weeks time.
In conclusion, what will definitely occur as a result of this legislation under Labor—whether it be federal or state Labor—is increased pressure on public hospitals, increased waiting times and waiting lists under Labor and increased pressure on private hospital insurance premiums. The Rudd government promised up hill and down dale, in cold hard writing and in face-to-face meetings with the key stakeholder groups and the public prior to the election that there would be no change. They have broken that promise. That is a great shame. But it is consistent with their breach of promises on a whole range of issues, and not just in the area of health. It is consistent with their mismanagement and maladministration of our economy generally and, more recently, of the installation program. What a disaster of mismanagement and maladministration. The government should be ashamed, but it seems that the government have no shame. Instead, they have used the Sergeant Schultz response: I know nothing. That is the response they have made. It is not good enough, and I call the government to account.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-02-24,"—I too would like to make some comments in the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2] about the management by this government of what is a $100 billion a year system—big business in anyone’s terms. The coalition government had a good track record of managing that $100 billion a year system, but in a few short years Labor has shown that it cannot do it. The Labor government has been an abject failure on health. Prime Minster Kevin Rudd promised big and delivered little. Of the billions of dollars splashed around in stimulus packages, not one cent went to health. The private health insurance rebate changes are a tax on health—a tax that Kevin Rudd promised he would not impose. In opposition, the now Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, both stated before the election that they would not alter the health insurance rebates. They even put it in writing. In a press release dated 20 September 2007, the current health minister—and I know my colleague Senator Humphries quoted this yesterday but it will not do any harm to quote it again today—said:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
The Prime Minister put the same commitment in writing to the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association in November 2007 prior to his election as Prime Minister.
The coalition rejected Labor’s attack on private health, and it was defeated in the Senate. This new tax has been rejected by the parliament, but Labor is determined to impose it. The health rebates were one of three pillars introduced by the Howard government to strengthen private health. These measures saw membership of private health funds rise from 34 per cent under the Keating government to 44 per cent today. I am very proud to say that the coalition has always believed in a balance between public and private health. After all, a strong and affordable private health sector alleviates pressure on state public hospital systems.
The fact is that all Australians will pay a price if this new tax is imposed. On the government’s own estimates, tens of thousands of people will drop their insurance coverage. It would force people to rely on our already stressed public health system. Queues at emergency departments and waiting lists for surgery would grow longer. It would affect not only the public hospitals but also, as people drop out of insurance, those who continue to keep their private health insurance who would see their premiums rise. Higher premiums would continue to make it harder for many to keep their insurance and possibly deter young people from taking out a private health insurance policy for the first time. Public hospitals are already stressed and strained and broken. Remember that the Prime Minister promised to fix them by mid-2009, but he is yet to produce a plan to fix hospitals, a plan that he said he had before the last election.
The Labor government says it needs this tax because of the global financial crisis, but its attack on private health started in its first budget before the global financial crisis. The Labor government misleads people about the need to tax private health insurance. Kevin Rudd says the money is needed for health reform, and he told Australians that the recent Intergenerational report would show that the tax would deliver $100 billion over decades to come. But there was no mention of the $100 billion in the Intergenerational report. Ms Roxon, the health minister, said the money from this new tax would be used to fund e-health. Then she said it would be used for new medicines and improved technology. That just proves that Labor is willing to say anything to support this tax increase.
The fact is that in regional, rural and remote Australia e-health could be used to great benefit. With only a small number of medium-sized regional towns, doctors in outlying areas, particularly in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, could use e-health to have faster diagnoses, faster treatment and faster recovery times for the many patients that they have to treat. But, at present, if there are no advances in e-health—and advances are technically possible in this day and age—many patients must make the very long round-trip to regional hospitals to get a diagnosis, go home and then come back to be treated and, hopefully, get well in the long term. It is estimated that the measures that Labor is putting forward in the Senate today will save $1.9 billion over the forward estimates. Anyone would have to say that that is a drop in the bucket compared to the cash splashes Labor has thrown around without one cent going to health.
For instance, the wasted funding of the failed Home Insulation Scheme has cost more than this will save. The coalition suggested increased excise on tobacco as an alternative, but Labor refused to consider this. Let’s face it: Prime Minister Rudd and Health Minister Roxon are ideologically determined to hit those Australians who pay to look after their health needs. The changes to the private health insurance rebate are just the latest phase in Labor’s unrelenting war against private health insurance—Labor hates private health insurance. When in government the coalition introduced an open-ended private health insurance rebate because, for every rebated dollar, a privately insured person contributes two more to our health system as a whole. We believe in the right of all Australians to take charge of their own healthcare needs and plan for the future. We have always worked hard to deliver incentives to promote the uptake of private health insurance and take the pressure off Medicare.
People will now drop out of health insurance because they cannot afford the much higher premiums. With interest rates no doubt on the rise, people will be thinking, ‘What do we pay for this month? Do we pay the mortgage’—which is more or less obligatory—‘do we pay school fees and provide for our children; do we buy food to put on the table; or do we go on with private health insurance?’ It will be very tempting for them to scrap the latter option. That will restart the catastrophic premium membership death spiral of the 1980s and 1990s, when Labor almost wiped out private health. It took a herculean effort on behalf of the coalition to reinstate that when we came to government.
Under this scheme, the private insurance rebate will decrease on a sliding scale for singles earning over $75,000 and couples on $150,000 per annum. The 30 per cent rebate remains for people with an income up to $75,000 a year for singles and up to $150,000 for couples. The rebate will decrease to 20 per cent for people on incomes of $75,000 to $90,000 for singles and $150,000 to $180,000 for couples. It will decrease further to 10 per cent for people on incomes of $90,000 to $120,000 for singles and $180,000 to $240,000 for couples. Payments cut out completely at that upper level of $120,000 for singles and $240,000 for couples. The Medicare levy surcharge will increase to 1.25 per cent for people on incomes of $90,000 to $120,000 for singles and $180,000 to $240,000 for couples. The Medicare levy surcharge will rise to 1.5 per cent for people at a higher income level. It is currently one per cent for people earning over $70,000 for singles and $140,000 for couples.
Over 9.5 million Australians are covered by private health insurance for hospital cover—that is 45 per cent of the population—and over 11 million people have some form of private health cover; 1.3 million people insured are over 65 years of age, which is 50.3 per cent of all Australians in this age group.
Members of health funds contributed $10.6 billion to the Australian healthcare system in 2008, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year. Fifty six per cent of all the surgical procedures are performed in private hospitals. Most of these are covered by private health insurance. And almost 15 per cent of public hospital admissions are privately insured patients. It is estimated that premiums will increase at rates of around 10 per cent, or possibly more, per year from 2010 to 2011, rather than the five to six per cent as now. Inevitably, there will be demands from the states for additional public hospital funding from the Commonwealth over the next Australian healthcare agreements to compensate them for extra pressure on their public hospitals.
If this measure goes through, we are talking about increased financial pressure on the federal government, increased financial pressure on the state governments and increased financial pressure on families and individuals as they start to make what could be catastrophic choices for them between paying for health as they would like to and choosing other forms of expenditure. I urge the Senate to defeat this measure.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-02-24,"—I too rise to contribute to the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the related bill. The history of politics in Australia tells us many things. One of the things that it tells us is that a government will only remain in office as long as it faithfully retains the public’s trust and confidence. At times, however, and rather unfortunately, we have a government that attempts to manipulate the trust and confidence of the people of Australia by making very specific promises to them in the run-up to an election while, at the same time, having a secret political agenda whereby it never has any intention of actually delivering on those promises. The Rudd government was very big on making promises in the run-up to the 2007 election—and it never had any intention of delivering on those promises. The Rudd government, many times over now, has clearly shown to the people of Australia that, when making a pre-election commitment, it will do anything, it will say anything and it will promise anything, but it has absolutely no intention of ever carrying out those policy commitments.
We on this side of this chamber have often described the way that the Labor Party manipulates the voting public of Australia as ‘spin over substance’. We see that spin every single day in his chamber as ministers stand up and provide sham or non-answers to questions related directly to their portfolios, and then we go home and we see the spin again on the TV at night as ministers and Mr Rudd make their shallow political excuses. Senator Conroy, in his portfolio, is a direct example of someone who makes very shallow political excuses in relation to Labor’s repeated failures to carry out their policy commitments.
It is also accepted that a political party may make a promise that it genuinely believes will be in the national interest. It makes that promise based on the best advice that it is given at the time, and then the political party may find out later that due to circumstances that are so radically changed it would actually be irresponsible to put that promise into effect. The global financial crisis was not such an excuse. I think it is also fair to say, and indeed fair to acknowledge, that in the run-up to an election, in the heat of an election battle, a future prime minister, a party leader, a minister or a shadow minister may overreact in a given situation and, in promising a remedy to an issue, may actually overreach themselves and their good intentions. However, there is a clear difference between overreaching or overreacting as part of election fervour and blatant lying by a political party as part of its party platform. In the case of Labor the record is very, very clear. The Labor Party gave a commitment to the people of Australia that it would not change the existing private health rebate system should it be elected into office. That is the promise that Mr Rudd made to the people of Australia. The next election will be all about trust and confidence, and Mr Rudd, by his repeated actions, has destroyed the trust and confidence that the Australian people had in his government.
Before I deal with the specific issues surrounding this legislation, I would like to just remind the Senate of some other promises that Mr Rudd made in the lead-up to the election that yet again he never had any intention of delivering on. Perhaps the most famous one was when the now Prime Minister uttered the words: ‘I am an economic conservative, and as an economic conservative I believe in budget surpluses.’ Mr Rudd told the people of Australia that he was an economic conservative, because he had worked out that was the faith and the confidence that the people of Australia had put in former Prime Minister John Howard. There was a true economic conservative. Mr Rudd realised that, if he could hang off the shirt tails of Mr Howard, if he could portray himself as being an economic conservative, that would do well in the lead-up to the election. So the voters, based on the promises made by Mr Rudd, based on the words that were uttered by him, placed that faith in him. What we now see, though, is that, with the record debt levels that this country is in, Mr Rudd would have trouble even spelling the word ‘surplus’ let alone delivering one as part of a budget to the people of Australia.
Mr Rudd also told the people of Australia that he would keep our borders safe. Who can remember these famous words on 15 August 2007 by Arch Bevis, the then homeland security spokesman for Labor? He made this promise to the Australian people: ‘Labor places the highest priority on national security, both defence and homeland security.’ I see Senator Humphries, our now shadow parliamentary secretary, here smiling. Yes, you are right, Senator Humphries: that was once again merely a promise that they never had any intention of delivering on. What are we up to now? Eighty-one, 82, it could be 83—I have not checked the news in the last hour—but I understand there were 82 boats at the last count since the Labor Party relaxed the coalition’s strong border protection policy in 2008.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise in a point of order on relevance. I am truly enjoying the colour and movement of the debate, but the bills are to do with the private health industry rebate. We have had about five minutes on refugees. I am wondering whether at any stage the good senator would like to wander back to debate the bill.
 (Senator Ryan)—I understand that the tradition in this place has been to allow wide-ranging relationship to the legislation. I remind Senator Cash of the bills and call upon her to continue.
—I thank you very much for that, Mr Acting Deputy President, because clearly the Labor Party have no idea why we are in this chamber today. It is just another piece of legislation to them—another broken promise which they would like this Senate to put through without scrutinising. We are here today because of the broken promises that Labor made to the Australian people. I note that not one member on that side has the guts to come into this place—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I add sound to colour and movement in my earlier point of order.
—There is no point of order. Senator Cash will continue.
—We are here today because the Australian people voted those on the other side into office based on the specific commitments they made prior to the 2007 election. How disappointed they now must be with the performance of the Rudd Labor government, because the bills that we are debating here today are just others in a series of broken promises by the Rudd Labor government. The Rudd Labor government made the promise to the people of Australia that, if elected to govern, they would not change the private health insurance rebate regime for the 11 million Australians who take responsibility for their own health care needs by taking out private health insurance and thereby relieving the pressure on the public system. That was the Labor Party’s promise to the people of Australia. Did they say it once? No. Did they say it twice? No. It was a little bit like Christmas when this promise was being made. Let us have a look. What did Nicola Roxon say when she was shadow minister? She had the audacity to accuse us on this side of saying that we did not have any faith that the Labor Party would deliver on the private health care rebate promise. This is what she actually said:
Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining—
sorry, I am almost laughing as I am saying this—
all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.
This is absolutely untrue.
She also said this:
The Howard Government will do anything and say anything to get elected.
How words come back to bite you. On 20 November 2007, in a letter to the AIHA from the now Prime Minister, this is what Mr Rudd said:

Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.

But the promises did not stop there; they continued. In February 2008, as quoted in the Australian, the Prime Minister said:
The Private Health Insurance Rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.
In May 2008, on Macquarie Radio, Nicola Roxon said:
We continue to support the 30 per cent, 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebate for those Australians who choose to take out private health insurance.
It goes on. In October 2008 in a speech to the relevant association, Nicola Roxon said this:
Private health insurance consumers will still be able to claim the 30 to 40 per cent rebate and the lifetime health cover incentives will remain in place.
And then there was another one on 24 February 2009, as quoted in the Age newspaper. She is now the health minister of this country. Nicola Roxon said:
The government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebate.
So when is a promise not a promise? When it is given by the Australian Labor Party in the lead-up to a federal election. The fact that we are here today, yet again, debating these bills in the Senate, after they have already been rejected by the parliament, goes straight to the Labor Party and the lack of credibility that it has. All these bills show the Australian people is that Mr Rudd and the Labor Party made these promises as part of what one might describe as a contrived scheme of deception aimed at conning the Australian voters into believing one thing, when Mr Rudd knew that the Labor Party never had any intention on delivering on those promises.
Putting aside the fact that the bills that we are debating today represent nothing more and nothing less than yet another one of the broken promises by the Labor Party, if we actually look at the policy itself, the policy is fundamentally flawed and, if implemented, will actually have a detrimental impact on the people of Australia. The Labor Party tells us that the measures contained in these bills are estimated to save $1.9 billion over the forward estimates. And when one actually looks at those figures in terms of the Labor Party and its spending, one might say it is really just a drop in the bucket compared to the cash splashes that were thrown out by them, but with not one cent being spent on health. Do you know why? Because these bills have nothing to do with saving money. That is just the ruse, that is just the excuse that the Labor Party are giving. These bills represent nothing more and nothing less than the politics of envy. The Labor Party is ideologically determined to hit those Australians who are prepared to pay up and look after their own health needs. These bills represent nothing more and nothing less than Labor’s ideological push to target the so-called rich of this country.
These changes represent just another phase in the unrelenting war that the Labor Party rages against private health insurance, because at the end of the day we all know one thing: Labor hates private health insurance. But that is where the Labor Party is so wrong. The problem for the Labor Party—that is, in targeting the so-called rich—is that the damage that will be caused if this legislation is passed is going to be much more widespread. It will end up affecting those people who cannot afford to look after their own health and take out private health insurance. So much for the Labor Party telling the people of Australia that they are the ones who try to look after the battlers.
The fundamental flaw in this legislation is that, whatever money the Rudd government tells the people of Australia it is trying to save by implementing these measures, the actual effect of the policy once implemented will be the fact that the consumer, the average Australian person, will actually end up paying more either in terms of increased hospital waiting lists or increased private health premiums. People will actually drop out of private health insurance if these measures go through, and the only end result of that can be more pressure on the public health system. How is that a solution to the health crisis that this nation is actually facing? It is not a solution. It is bad policy. But, what is worse, it is bad policy based on nothing more and nothing less than an ideological war. The end result is going to be the restart of the catastrophic premium/membership death spiral of the 1980s and 1990s, when Labor almost wiped out private health insurance and almost destroyed Australia’s health insurance system. So much for fixing our hospitals.
But what is new in that regard? Labor has been an abject failure in health previously and their record to date shows that they continue to be an abject failure in health. Remember Kevin Rudd—Mr Rudd, the now Prime Minister? He was the chief bureaucrat in Queensland under the Goss Labor government, which began widespread hospital closures and the removal of more than 2,200 hospital beds. That is how Mr Rudd fixes a hospital system. He balloons the bureaucracy while actually taking away the beds on the ground. That is a Labor Party solution to solving the health problems that Australia faces! These bills are not about saving money. They represent nothing more and nothing less than an ideological war that the Labor Party wages on those people who are able to afford—and only just, some of them—to take out private health insurance. It an ideological war against those Australians who put aside money every week to take responsibility for their own healthcare needs.
It has been noted during the debate that it appears to be only those on this side of the chamber who have stood up to contribute. I note that not one Labor senator has yet fronted this chamber to justify to the Australian public why we are again being asked to push these bills through the Senate—not one member from the other side. Where is their explanation to the people of Australia as to why the Labor Party has done a complete backflip on a 2007 election promise and a 2008 promise when elected, continuing into 2009? Maybe they know that you actually cannot come into this place and defend the indefensible.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-02-24,"—I rise today to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and a related bill. The fact that I am standing here today speaking on these bills astounds me. I recall clearly Minister Wong standing up immediately after the defeat for the second time of the government’s CPRS legislation late last year and stating loudly and clearly that the legislation would be reintroduced as a matter of priority this year. Of course, this statement followed the pronouncement by the Prime Minister that the CPRS legislation was required to address the greatest moral challenge of our time.
So what has the government done with the CPRS? It has used its numbers to ram the legislation through the other place, but incredibly it failed to give the CPRS bills sufficient priority to bring them on here before the cut-off date. That is right, the government could not get its act together to get the legislation in here by the cut-off date—legislation that the government claims is needed to address the greatest moral challenge facing this generation, legislation that the minister said would be put before the parliament at the earliest opportunity. Clearly there appears to have been a greater moral challenge for the government, and that can only be the breaking of a clear promise to the people of Australia to maintain the Medicare levy surcharge and the private health insurance rebate.
It is clear to all this week where the priorities of this government lie, pressing forward with measures that are in clear breach of undertakings made to the Australian people. What is not clear is the government’s motivation. Did the Prime Minister really believe climate change to be the greatest moral challenge, or was it just a convenient political ploy that worked to wedge the then coalition government before the election? The lack of priority provided to their flagship measure for addressing climate change suggests it was probably the latter. Similarly, what motivations are behind the promise to maintain the levy surcharge thresholds and the private health insurance rebates followed by their current attempt to breach them? Again, a cynic would conclude the necessity of avoiding electoral backlash from everyday Australians with private health insurance cover may have had more to do with their promises prior to the election than any sort of commitment to maintaining the measures. Their current actions are illuminating in that regard.
The impact of the federal government’s proposed changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds on the public hospital system are of serious concern and should frighten all Australians who care about the public health system, and all state governments due to the impact on their responsibility for delivery of primary health care. Not only have Kevin Rudd and Labor broken an election promise on private health insurance—one that he put in writing, I note—but they have also broken a promise not to impose new taxes, which is exactly what this is: another great big new income tax. By the late 1990s, private health insurance membership had collapsed to around 30 per cent of the population. In the June quarter 2008 it was 44.7 per cent. Make no mistake, this was all down to the Howard government’s success in encouraging Australians to take out private health insurance cover, to take pressure off the public purse and the public health system—a system which was designed to help those who do not have the financial resources to cover their health requirements.
This was a remarkable turnaround, from 30 per cent in the 1990s to 44.7 per cent in 2008. It did not just happen in a vacuum. The turnaround was achieved through the deliberate and persistent introduction of measures in the first few years of the Howard government. Upon its election in 1996, that government saw the need for urgent and decisive action to redress the neglect that the private health insurance sector had suffered under 13 years of Labor, which had led to the numbers of privately insured falling consistently for many years prior to the election of the Howard coalition government. It is important to remember that this is not just a question about the health of the private insurance industry or even about those who can afford private cover. What Mr Rudd is proposing in these bills will punish those who have been paying to look after their own health and, by the government’s own assessment, force tens of thousands of them into the public system, taking away resources from those who do not have the financial capacity to access the private system.
The issue is of huge importance to all Australians with healthcare needs and those who are close to them. Put simply, as the number of Australians and their families with private insurance falls, the number of Australians needing to access their healthcare needs through the public system increases, with consequent increases in demand for those publicly funded services and a greater inability by the public system to cope. And, as was happening in the early to mid-1990s, the more people who drop out of private cover and take their chances in the public system—in general and for obvious reasons, the people who drop out of private cover tend to be those with no immediate healthcare needs—the more expensive the premiums become for those remaining in the private system, who for obvious reasons tend to be those who actually do have current healthcare needs, and the more likely it is that those remaining will be forced to drop out because they can no longer afford the higher premiums that result. As this works through the system, that will include many of those who do actually have immediate care needs but cannot afford the higher premiums. In the 1990s the result was an impending explosion in demand for public health care, with detrimental consequences looming for all Australians’ healthcare needs. Wisely, the Howard government sought to address this through a series of three targeted measures now known as the three pillars: the 30 per cent rebate, lifetime health cover and the Medicare levy surcharge. With the three pillars and the delicate balance that they provide, the decline in private health coverage was arrested and we are now back at the levels of private health cover that we see today. But changes proposed by the government in these bills threaten to undermine the effectiveness of the three-pillars approach to private health funding, with enormous potential consequences for public health care in this country.
There are a number of facts that are relevant to this debate. Labor says it needs this tax because of the global financial crisis and its impact on the government’s ability to fund health measures. But the fact is the government’s attack on private health started in its first budget, before the global financial crisis, when it was still predicting large surpluses—and those were the days! Labor says that these measures will save $1.9 billion over the forward estimates, this coming in the same week that we see the pink batts program exposed as throwing away and wasting billions of dollars. The government says that scheme and other measures—such as the bungled Building the Education Revolution—are stimulating the economy. But the reality is that all these measures contain massive waste and inefficiency and any actual benefits could have been achieved for far less with better targeted measures that were better thought out. There is a total sum of around $94,000 million, or $94 billion, committed to stimulus measures. If better targeting and management could have resulted in just a 10 per cent saving on that spend, some $9,400 million, or $9.4 billion, could have been saved—not to mention the interest savings of at least half a billion dollars each and every year as less would have had to be borrowed. It becomes clear that Labor’s attempt to disenfranchise middle Australians from their private insurance health cover cannot be justified on good management grounds.
While Labor rips $1.9 billon out of the hands of private individuals, the government continues to borrow billions, raise taxes and distort the economy with ill-conceived, non-productive and badly run programs. If it isn’t pink batts or Building the Education Revolution, it is the nationalisation of the communications network and a program of central control of the economy which is clearly going to see health nationalised as part of the government’s head-long ideological rush towards a failed system that we all thought had ended decades ago. Raising the cost of people’s private health cover will not fix the massive and unnecessary national debt that Labor has created. And the fact remains that encouraging people who can afford to make a long-term commitment to private health is good for the overall viability of a health insurance system built on the community rating approach, under which insurers are prohibited from charging premiums assessed on the basis of risk; that is, they cannot price-discriminate on the basis that a potential insured person is, for example, a smoker or on the basis of their age or family background or medical history or even their current medical condition. Indeed, having healthy people participate is a vital component of a system based on the community rating approach.
It is also important to note that private health insurance adds money to the health system. Over 10 million Australians have private health insurance. This means that over 10 million people are adding an amount, generally equal to 70 per cent of their private health insurance premiums, to the overall amount of money available to fund health care across Australia. And of course, yes, the government has also paid 30 per cent of each premium. As such, for every 30c in the dollar that the government spends on health care supporting the privately insured, a further 70c is contributed by individuals to the overall amount of money being spent on hospital health care across the country—but not if Labor has its way and introduces a reduced rebate. Looking at it the other way around, on the fairly sound assumption that without the delicate balance provided by the three-pillars policy people would drop out of private cover and that they may, sooner or later, require hospital care which would then need to be entirely funded from the public purse, the government is getting a return on its expenditure through the 30 per cent rebate of over 200 per cent; that is, for every dollar it spends assisting the private health insured it saves over another $2.
In a sense, rather than the federal government subsidising people’s private healthcare needs, the system is actually subsidising the expenditure of all Australian governments on primary health care to the tune of 70c in the dollar for every privately health insured person in this country. But the government is prepared, through the measures contained in these bills, to put all this at risk. As a result of these bills, the delicate balance achieved through the three-pillars process will be destabilised, leading to a mass exodus—by the government’s own figures as released in Treasury modelling last year—from the private health system mainly by, and this is important, those with little immediate need for hospital care. This will then lead to the semifailure or even the complete failure of the community rating system as the loss of the premiums provided by those who have little need for current care will leave a greater proportion of those privately insured who do have high-care needs, thereby leaving the private insurers with the majority of expenditure while suffering a severe loss in income. As such, private health insurance premiums will go through the roof.
This in itself is bad. In the short-term it will lead to far higher premiums but it will probably have little impact on the public health sector, as the first wave of people leaving private health insurance as a result of higher premiums will have little immediate need to call on public health resources since they are probably the healthier of those who are currently insured. But what will be the further consequences? As private health premiums rise, the number of insured persons with little ability to pay higher premiums but with high hospital care needs—particularly older Australians—will increase. Shamefully, many will be forced to abandon their private cover because they simply cannot afford higher premiums. This is when the public health system will start to feel the full consequences of this measure—when the loss of the 70c in the dollar subsidy that privately insured persons provide, from their own pockets, to the overall healthcare spend in the nation will come home to roost.
Over 10 million Australians are covered by private health insurance for hospital cover. There are 1.3 million people insured who are over 65 years of age, which is 50.3 per cent of all Australians in this age group. Members of health funds contributed $10.6 billion to the Australian healthcare system in 2008, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year. Fifty-six per cent of all surgical procedures are performed in private hospitals. Most of these are covered by private health insurance. Almost 15 per cent of public hospital admissions are privately insured patients. It is estimated that premiums will increase at a rate of around 10 per cent or more per year from 2011 to 2012, rather than the five to six per cent increase that we see currently.
Inevitably, in the next Australian healthcare agreements there will be demands from the states for additional public hospital funding from the Commonwealth to compensate them for extra pressure on their public hospitals directly arising from the passage of these bills. The consequences for the private health sector—not just private health insurance but the providers they fund—and the public hospital system are completely ignored by this government and, tellingly, by the state Labor governments. Hopefully, there will be a couple fewer of those in a few weeks time.
The changes to the private health insurance rebate are just the latest phase in Labor’s unrelenting war against private health insurance. It is undeniable that Labor hates private health insurance. The coalition introduced an open-ended private health insurance rebate, because, for every rebated dollar, a privately insured person contributes two more to our health system as a whole. The coalition believes in the right of all Australians to take charge of their own healthcare needs and plan for the future. We have always worked hard to deliver incentives to promote the uptake of private health insurance and take the pressure off Medicare. People will drop out because they cannot afford the much higher premium increases. That will restart the catastrophic premium membership death spiral of the 1980s and 1990s, when Labor almost wiped out private health.
If tens of thousands of people now give up their private cover, the Prime Minister and this government will be directly responsible for a massive blow-out in public hospital waiting lists. At this stage, there is no indication that any meaningful compensation or allowance will be made by the Commonwealth to compensate for the impact on the states and territories of this measure that we are debating today. The Australian Medical Association has said:
Changes to the 30 per cent Private Health Insurance Rebate mean many Australian singles and families will pay a lot more for health insurance, and if you don’t keep your private health insurance you’ll be slugged with an increased Medicare Levy surcharge. They get you both ways.
Labor clearly promised prior to their election that they would maintain the Medicare levy surcharge, but they are now opening the door for thousands of people to leave private health insurance. Sick people already wait for hours in public hospital emergency departments, despite the big increase in bulk-billing since 2003. Australians still wait months for elective surgery, despite a 16 per cent real increase in federal funding for state-run public hospitals by the previous government under healthcare agreements. People who leave private cover as a result of these changes will now add more waiting time and people to these lists.
Fewer people covered by the surcharge means less money invested in the health system. At present, a family on $100,000 a year takes out private health insurance or pays an extra $1,000 to Medicare. Statistically, most families in this situation have private insurance, which means that they do not compete with less financial people for elective surgery in public hospitals, or they can contribute to public hospital revenue by electing to be treated as private patients. Under the measures contained in this bill, these families will have far less incentive to be privately insured.
On 12 May 2009, The Australian Health Insurance Association said:
The Rudd government’s decision to dismantle the private health insurance rebate will place increased pressure on the public hospital system and force up premiums for those Australians who take responsibility for their own health care by taking out private health cover. Every single one of the more than 11 million Australians with private health insurance (one million of whom live in households with an income of less than $26,000 pa) will have to pay more for their private health insurance as a direct result of this policy.
The Prime Minister himself has undertaken not to play with the three-pillar system. In a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Prime Minister said:
Both my minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.
No wonder Australians are questioning the Prime Minister’s ability to do what he says he will do. Let us not forget Labor’s abject failure in health. Kevin Rudd has promised big but delivered little. Of the billions of dollars splashed around in the stimulus package, not one cent went to health. The billions spent on insulation batts have been more important to this government than people continuing to fund their own health needs—or building hospitals or paying doctors or nurses more money.
Labor’s overriding promise was to ‘fix’ the nation’s hospitals. Labor ‘had a plan’, Mr Rudd told Australians, ‘to end the buck-passing’ between Canberra and the states. He had ‘a long-term plan’ to fix the nation’s hospitals, and the ‘buck would stop’ with him. Mr Rudd went further—he promised to ‘fix’ hospitals by mid-2009 and said that ‘if significant progress’ on hospital reform had not been achieved by then his government would ‘seek a mandate from the Australian people at the following federal election for the Commonwealth to take financial control of Australia’s 750 public hospitals’.
But the hospitals remain unfixed and, as evidenced by the legislation we are debating today, it has not taken long for the old ideological hatreds within Labor to emerge in the government. This attempt to limit access to private health insurance rebates—which would see people downgrade or drop their cover—is an instance of that. We see the government’s attempt to introduce superclinics—there are only 12 operating out of the 36 promised—along with their attack on private hospitals and health insurance, and we have to ask: are they trying to move us to a British-style national health system?
Working families, low- and fixed-income earners, the elderly and people living in rural and regional Australia will be hardest hit by the consequences which will flow from this ill-conceived policy. This legislation represents bad policy, appears hard to justify on any of the measures put forward by the government and will ultimately lead to the undermining of the public-private healthcare balance achieved in this nation.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech

I will commence my contribution to this debate by commending Senator Bushby, who, like a number of my other colleagues, raised the issue of the Prime Minister’s promise to the nation prior to the last federal election that he would not remove the private health insurance rebate. This to me has been the core of this debate. Articulated by coalition senators throughout this debate has been the core issue of a broken promise. It is worth repeating again. It will be in Hansard many times so that, when people read each of these speeches in coming months, they can clearly understand the core promise that was broken by Mr Rudd. I will read it again for the benefit of listeners:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including—
as Senator Bushby clearly said a moment ago—
the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
Mr Rudd said that in a letter addressed to the Australian Health Insurance Association on 20 November 2007 which has since become public.
The core issue is commitment by a government to the people of Australia. If you make promises during an election campaign, the people, when they go to the ballot box, expect to have those promises fulfilled. Promises on health matters are always core promises. Health matters are very significant. I have three quotes I wish to read out on the theme of promises or commitments that the Prime Minister made to the Australian people prior to the last election. The first one is from a press conference held by the Prime Minister on 29 February 2008. This is generally on keeping election promises. He said:
Trust is the key currency of politics, and unless you can be trusted to honour that to which you’ve committed to do, then, I’ve got to say, you’re not going to obtain the enduring respect of the Australian people.
Well, Mr Rudd has broken his own promise as well as breaking other promises. In breaking this commitment on the private health insurance rebate, he does not have the enduring respect of the Australian people. He then said, to the National Press Club, on 27 August 2008:
When we formed government, I said I had no intention of recycling the absolute cynicism of previous governments - making a swag of pre-election commitments then reneging on them as “non-core” promises.
He also said, at the Australian War Memorial, on 17 March 2008:
We’re going to adhere to the integrity of the budget process but all working families, all working families will be protected by our Government in the production of that budget and we will honour all of our pre election commitments. Every one of them, every one of them.
Well, he is not going to do that. If protecting working families does not involve keeping the private health insurance rebate, what does? That is an essential element in the budgets of many families. That is what keeps them in the private health insurance system.
My colleagues have indicated, in previous contributions to this debate, that the burden upon the public hospital system will be increased exponentially in some areas because of people dropping out of the private health insurance system. We have an overburdened system as it is. To add complication to this by removing the rebate is just beyond comprehension. I cannot understand why a government with the flavour of Labor want to hurt families. That does not make sense. Their rhetoric is certainly not matched by their actions in relation to this legislation.
I contrast a promise that Prime Minister Howard made in 1996. Mr Howard has often been badgered about this promise, but let us get clearly on the table the facts about how his honesty and integrity stand up to Mr Rudd’s. In 1996, Mr Howard promised there would be no goods and services tax introduced, and he kept that promise throughout that term of government. During that period it became obvious that a GST was required and would be—as it has proven to be—very beneficial to this country. What did Mr Howard do? He said: ‘I gave a commitment not to introduce the GST. However, on the evidence now facing me, I want to introduce a GST. But I will go back to the people and let the people of Australia decide before that implementation takes place.’
Let us contrast that with what Mr Rudd has done. Mr Rudd said prior to the election, ‘There will be no removal of the rebate.’ Now he has introduced legislation into the parliament to remove that rebate, to hurt the working families he so wants to protect, without giving the people of Australia a chance to make a decision about that. A promise was given by Mr Howard. He changed his mind and then went back to the people in a very open, honest and sincere manner. A promise was given by Mr Rudd. He changed his mind and said, ‘Let’s run the legislation through the parliament; let’s not include the people in this decision.’ That shows a huge contrast between the style of government that Mr Rudd has now and the honesty and integrity that we had when we were in office. We had the guts and the fortitude to say, ‘Yes, we have changed our minds but we’re going to go back to the Australian people to get their approval before we implement legislation which is going to have a serious impact on their lives, financially.’
Mr Rudd’s legislation is going to have a serious financial impact on people’s lives. That is one aspect of this debate, and that has been covered adequately by all of my colleagues. However, the main aspect is going to be the psychological, emotional and physical comfort of the Australian families who will have to opt out of the private system and go into the public system. The public system, as we know, is overburdened.
I want to highlight some issues from my home state of Tasmania in relation to the overburdening of the public system. We have an election coming up on 20 March in Tasmania—as you would be aware, Acting Deputy President Hurley, as you are also from the lovely state of Tasmania. The election will be fought on a number of issues, but a contrasting issue will be health. We have a leader, in Will Hodgman, and a shadow health minister, in Mr Brett Whitely, who wish to improve the waiting list times in our Tasmanian hospital system, enabling Tasmanians to have elective surgery and other aspects of treatment at a rate that the current Labor government cannot achieve.
If Mr Rudd’s bills concerning the rebate pass through this place, the good work that the Tasmanian Liberals are about to undertake if they win office—and all indications are that they are going to come very close to winning office—will be undone. The hard policy line that the Tasmanian Liberal team want to take will be undone because of the additional workload that will be placed on hospitals. There are 218,000 Tasmanians who currently have health insurance—that is 43.2 per cent of the population covered by private health insurance—which is assisting to take the burden off the public sector. If this rebate is removed, that burden will be placed squarely back onto the public sector by the so-called ‘working families’ that Mr Rudd wants to protect.
We are talking about income levels where the rebate will be removed. We are talking about income levels that are not really high. Take a married professional couple with three or four children. The combined income of the two professionals—teachers, policemen or nurses—will be hit fairly significantly by the rebate. This is an important aspect that I think the Prime Minister and his health minister have overlooked—the rebates are going to cut into ordinary families. The thresholds are ridiculously low for families who get out there and work, contribute and assist in easing the burden on the public system.
Waiting times in Tasmania, as I indicated, have increased from 34 days to 46 days, and 7,750-odd people are on these waiting lists at any given point in time. That is an increase of 600 people on the waiting list since 2006. Now, if the rebate is removed, we are going to have the terrible situation of additional people being placed on those waiting lists. Our hospital systems, as they are currently managed, could not run with those additional burdens.
We have had others indicating that the rebate should not be removed. In particular, some of the key industry stakeholders have indicated that the rebate should stay. We could argue that, yes, the private health industry has a vested interest in maintaining rebates. However, the fact is—as Senator Bushby put it—that every one dollar that is placed into the private health system saves two dollars in the public health system. That has to be a good thing. That has to be something that this government should want to continue.
Why does the government—in the false set of economic figures—want to remove that assistance from the private sector and place it squarely on the public sector? It just does not make sense. Again, as I indicated, if Mr Rudd is concerned about looking after working families why is he doing this? What is the purpose of putting this hurt onto families? As some of my colleagues have asked, is it some kind of ideological warfare? The facts do not add up. The argument that it will be assisting working families does not add up. And there will be a public backlash, which the government probably has not even thought of.
Is this something deep-seated, deep-rooted? Is this an evolution of something that started way back in the past? Does it not really matter what the facts and figures are or how they are presented—do they just think, ‘We don’t want to see people on a salary over $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000 getting a rebate’? Is there some deep-seated issue that we are not of aware of and that the government are not coming clean about?
I do not know; I just know that the policy does not make sense and that the community backlash would be enormous. That is why—I go back to my point about broken promises—the Rudd government will, mostly likely, not go to the people on this issue. There would be a backlash. So they have to pass it in the mid-term or towards the latter days of this period of the parliament. If we went to the coming election with this policy, I am sure Mr Rudd would feel the full brunt of the people of Australia. And maybe, if this bill did pass through the Senate and become law, the people would remember and there would be a backlash towards the Rudd government for breaking yet another promise.
This goes to the core of what Mr Rudd’s government is doing in breaking promises—more than any other government that I have ever seen. A litany of promises is slowly but surely being compiled and documented. The original shine on this Prime Minister, along with the original thought that this Prime Minister would be good for Australia, is slowly but surely coming off. It is becoming a talking point throughout this country that Mr Rudd is not standing up for what he first said.
I go back to my point about the contrast with Prime Minister Howard. When he changed his mind he had the guts and the decency to go to the people of Australia and say: ‘I’m changing my mind. The coalition has a different view to what we had prior to the last election. I’m going to give you, the people of Australia, a chance to make a decision on this, and you can throw me out of office or re-elect me.’ History tells us that we were re-elected on that issue, and the GST has become a prominent part of Australia’s economy and has assisted the states enormously.
So Mr Rudd needs to rethink this. He needs to really consider the impost he is placing on families. He needs to really consider the implications of breaking yet another election commitment. If he does have any decency about him, he should just come clean and say: ‘It’s a mistake. We are focused on an ideological issue here. It does not make sense. Let’s just drop it.’ But I think we have come to see that there is a little bit of arrogance creeping into the prime ministership. I think the Prime Minister thinks he is not vulnerable at all. I just hope that the Australian people judge him correctly on this issue and try to sort through the smokescreens to see why the government wants to remove this rebate and really consider the other promises that the Prime Minister has made and failed to deliver on.
These promises go over many, many issues. I do not have enough time to highlight them all, but there are a lot of things: Fuelwatch, GROCERYchoice and the takeover of hospitals that was intimated by the Prime Minister. Now he just wants to have a takeover of discussions about hospitals; he does not want to take them over at all. He said he would be simplifying paperwork and reining in corporate salaries. He has had issues with bank deposit guarantees and even with where he was going to live, as well as the Special Envoy for Whale Conservation. The list of issues that this Prime Minister is committed to and has completely ignored or failed to deliver upon goes on and on.
As I said in my opening remarks, nothing goes to the core of Australian issues and honesty as does health. Health is a very important issue in this country. Health is a very important issue for all the working families and others in Australia. Promises that were made—promises that potentially could have changed a decision at the last election—have not been kept. A promise on health is one you do not break, and you do not continually break promises on health through an election period or through the cycle of a parliament. I think Mr Rudd really needs to take a long, hard look at where he is going with the health rebate and stop the silliness and apologise and come clean to the Australia people.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2010-02-24,"—I am honoured to follow my colleague Senator Parry in condemning this legislative attack on private health insurance. The coalition remains steadfastly opposed to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2] despite the fact that our vote on this legislation will hopefully lead to its defeat. This will, of course, give the government another mechanism by which it could dissolve both houses. That does not deter us from our determination to see this horrendous and outrageous legislation defeated. We say that because, as my colleagues have emphasised, this is one of the most extraordinary and blatant breaches of a profound and clear and unqualified election commitment by the Labor government that we have ever seen.
These changes to implement a means test for the private health insurance rebate and increase the Medicare levy surcharge for certain income levels will affect all Australians reliant on the health system in this country. This attack, as it is, on private health insurance is a clear indication of the inherent ideological contempt that the Labor Party has for private health insurance which we have seen repeatedly over the years. Most importantly, it is a breach of a fundamental election commitment made by the Labor Party to the Australian people before the last election. They promised the Australian people that they would keep the private health insurance rebate as it was. On the eve of the last election, in a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association, then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year—
that is, 2007—
that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 45 per cent rebates for older Australians.
It could not have been clearer or more unqualified. We have never trusted Labor on this. We have always said to the Australian people, ‘You should not trust Labor on the subject of private health insurance.’ Labor has a longstanding and deeply rooted hatred of private health insurance. But, of course, in 2007 Labor accused us of running a scare campaign on the matter. Then shadow health minister, Ms Roxon, said in a press release on 26 September 2007:
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
As we now know, it was absolutely true. Only one party has now proven that it misled the Australian people prior to the last election, and that is the Australian Labor Party. They promised the world prior to the last election, and it is now catching up with them. As we have seen, they have broken this fundamental commitment in relation to the private health system.
While in government Labor continued publicly to commit to leaving the rebate unchanged, even as late as February of last year, but we now know that the Minister for Health and Ageing was getting advice on imposing a means test on the rebate. It was only because of the coalition’s belief, when in government, that Australians should have a choice in regard to health care that the significant decline in private health fund membership brought about by Labor’s last term in government was curtailed and reversed. Through a series of measures under our government, such as the rebate on premiums and Lifetime Health Cover, the former coalition government, frankly, rescued private health insurance in this country, bringing membership levels up to a sustainable 44 per cent of the population, compared with 34 per cent under Labor when we came into office.
We as a coalition have always believed in a balance between public and private health as being fundamental to the health system in this country. We do believe that a strong and affordable private health sector eases the pressure on the state public hospital systems, which we all know are under relentless pressure. Members of private health funds contributed $10.6 billion to the Australian healthcare system in 2008, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, its data:
. . . also demonstrates that the private health sector has contributed to a greater increase in the provision of in-hospital treatments since the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate. Since 1998-99, when the rebate was introduced, in-hospital treatments in the private sector have risen by 60 per cent, compared to a 25 per cent increase in the public sector’s capacity in the same period.
I go on to quote the AHIA:
The rebate is therefore an important policy component which assists in keeping premiums as low as possible for all Australians with private health insurance, especially the 1 million Australians who live in households where the household income is under $26,000 a year.
So there is no doubt that the private health insurance system does play a fundamental role in our healthcare system. The association stated in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this matter:
The 30% Rebate represents an effective investment in the health system by the Australian Government because every dollar that the government contributes towards the private health insurance rebate is matched by more than two dollars by the individual. The AHIA is concerned that the means‐testing of the rebate, with its projected savings-to-government of $1.9 billion over five years, could reflect a total withdrawal from the health system of up to $6.3 billion in funding over that period.
Any attempt to undermine private health insurance will inevitably have a dramatic impact on the public system as more people inevitably abandon their private health insurance to rely solely on the public system. We in the coalition are certainly not convinced by the government’s arguments in relation to the rationale for these bills. Nor are we convinced that they have acknowledged the full ramifications of this attack on the private health insurance industry.
This package of measures, as we know, imposes a decreased rebate, on a sliding scale, for singles earning over $75,000 and couples earning over $150,000. The rebate will decrease to 20 per cent for single people on incomes of $75,000 to $90,000 and for couples on combined incomes of $150,000 to $180,000. The rebate will decrease further to 10 per cent for single people on incomes of $90,000 to $120,000 and for couples on combined incomes of $180,000 to $240,000. Payments will cut out completely at $120,000 for singles and $240,000 for couples. The government, on its own figures, admits that 40,000 people will drop private cover as a result of this measure. On the government’s figures that comprises 25,000 people expected to drop their hospital and general treatment cover; 10,000 with hospital and general treatment cover expected to keep the hospital cover but drop the general cover; and 5,000 people with general treatment expected to drop that cover.
But I think there is evidence that the Treasury modelling is unduly optimistic. The Australian Private Hospitals Association said in their submission to the Senate inquiry:
Both Treasury and the Department of Health and Ageing, in providing advice to the government, have made some assumptions that are, to say the least, open to serious question.
Catholic Health Australia commissioned research by Access Economics which showed that five times the number of Australians would quit their private health insurance as a result of these changes. Their commissioned research indicated that approximately 100,000, or more, Australians would abandon private health insurance. The CEO, Martin Laverty, told the Senate inquiry that the difference in the results of the Access Economics modelling and the Treasury modelling was due to Treasury assumptions around price elasticity. Catholic Health said:
Treasury is assuming that an income earner on $75,000 a year has the same spending power as an income earner on some $250,000 a year. Treasury has applied a price elasticity formula to someone on $75,000 as it has to someone on $250,000. If you think about that for a moment, it is assuming that, if there is a 10 per cent increase in the cost of private health insurance for someone on $75,000, that would mean an average policy is going to be about $2,000. That would represent 3.4 per cent of the take-home income of someone on $75,000 as opposed to 1.2 per cent of the take-home income of someone on $250,000.
So, clearly, there are major flaws in the Treasury assumptions by which they have arrived at the numbers of people they think will drop private health cover. The CEO of the AHIA, Dr Michael Armitage, told the Senate committee examining these bills that their research indicated that significantly more would abandon their private health insurance as a result of this disastrous policy. Dr Armitage told the committee:
… up to 240,000 Australians are likely to exit their cover as a result of the legislation. This number represents a decline in membership 10 times greater than that projected by the Department of the Treasury. Further, we have calculated that 730,000 Australians are likely to downgrade their level of private hospital cover and an additional 775,000 Australians will exit their general treatment cover for matters such as dentistry as a consequence of the policy.
So this decision to means test the private health insurance rebate, representing as it does a fundamental breach of an undertaking to the Australian people, will have a dramatic effect on premiums and on public hospital waiting lists. Catholic Health Australia estimates this measure would mean another 36,000 people joining public hospital queues. Inevitably, that will mean there will be demands from the states for additional public hospital funding from the Commonwealth in the next Australian healthcare agreements to compensate for the extra pressure that this government, by dint of this disastrous policy, is going to put on the public hospital system.
It is estimated that premiums will increase at a rate of around 10 per cent, or possibly more, per year from 2010-11 rather than the five to six per cent as of now. We have just seen a six-odd per cent increase approved by this government—well, just watch this space: the increases that would result from this policy, were it to be implemented, would all be that much greater. Private health fund Bupa told the Senate committee that premium increases as a result of this policy will affect all holders of private health insurance, not just the so-called ‘higher income earners’ which this government is attacking. Further, Bupa highlights the risk that it is younger people who are expected to downgrade or abandon their cover. The Australian Private Hospitals Association, like others, are concerned about how these changes will undermine the community rating system as those least likely to make a claim drop out of the system. They highlight:
… major changes that undermine the fragile balance of the insured population—
such as these proposed changes to the PHI rebate—
will have severe effects on the capacity of health insurers to continue to pay claims without needing to raise premiums.
The Private Hospitals Association also points out, as have many others, that waiting times for public hospital waiting lists can only go up as a result of the government’s means testing of private health insurance.
And there is a double hit to these individuals and families, of course—not only does the rebate decrease but, if you drop your private health cover, the Medicare levy surcharge increases. So they get you going both ways. It will go up to 1.25 per cent for people on incomes of between $90,000 and $120,000 for singles and $180,000 to $240,000 for couples. Then it rises to 1½ per cent for single people on incomes over $120,000 and families earning over $240,000. ‘Sock it to the’—so-called—‘rich’ has been a Labor mantra from the beginning of the Australian Labor Party’s existence.
There is an overwhelming weight of evidence that this is a deeply flawed policy that will impact on the entire healthcare system in a very damaging and detrimental manner. What we have seen this government progressively do is try and impose means testing on a number of programs as a way of finding savings rather than getting into the business of addressing the core issue of its reckless spending. We have seen the recklessness of that spending on a grand scale with the disaster of the Home Insulation Program.
In relation to private health, they have sought to implement these changes with very little real and well-based analysis of the flow-on effects to all those who are privately insured and the dramatic effects that this will have on the public hospital system of this country. The opposition remains completely opposed to these unjustified policy changes. We condemn Labor for an extraordinary and blatant breach of an election commitment, for which they have given no rationale and no excuse to the Australian people. This is very bad policy. We remain steadfastly opposed to this ideological ALP attack on private health insurance.
As I said at the outset, this is the second time that the Senate has considered this disastrous package of measures. The opposition urges the whole Senate to oppose these bills yet again, despite the fact that that would give the government a second trigger for a double dissolution election. Labor has broken a fundamental promise that it made to the Australian people in a completely unqualified fashion. It is a crusade by the Labor Party to undermine the private health system and, by dint of that action, increase pressure on the public hospital system that is so important to so many Australians. These measures should not be supported. The government should find other ways to reduce the massive debt and deficits that it has created by its reckless spending in office.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-24,"—The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] is before us. It is entirely linked to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. They go hand in hand. They are completely linked. You cannot debate this bill without debating the other bill to cut the health insurance rebate for thousands of Australian families. They need to be considered together.
The Rudd government wants to hike up the Medicare levy surcharge that Australian families will have to pay if they decide not to take up health insurance. Why is the government doing this? It knows very well that cutting the 30 per cent health rebate, which many Australian families rely on and depend on, will make private health insurance more unaffordable for many Australian families. The government also knows that, if you drastically reduce the health rebate, you face the huge risk of people exiting the private system and further overburdening our public system, which is already under the pump. Already, many families are going to feel the pinch after the announcement yesterday that health insurance is set to go up by another 5.8 per cent—around that figure—from April this year. That means that the costs to Australian families of comprehensive health insurance—which does not even include extras such as optical, physio and many dental services, and all the other expenses that families rack up throughout the year—will be just short of $3,000.
What is this government trying to do to help? I do not know about help: it is trying to jack up the Medicare levy surcharge so that all those people who cannot afford the increase in health insurance will be forced to grin and bear it—otherwise, they are going to be slugged with a higher Medicare levy surcharge. That is not fair. It is another Rudd slug.
This is like a double blow. It is like whacking the Australian public for six and then the very next ball whacking them for six again. First you get told that your health insurance is going to go up. Then you get told that there is nothing that you can do about it. This hardly sounds like the kind of policy that should be coming from a government that pretends to be looking after working families. The Rudd government has proven itself to be a phoney with health. It is all talk about helping families, but when push comes to shove it is all spin and no substance. The Rudd government is most vulnerable on health. I have been saying this for a while. The Rudd government has overpromised and underdelivered on health. This is clearly an issue for the Rudd government. They are not listening to the Australian public. The idea of making it harder for Australian families with health is not on. We will not be supporting a clear breaking of an election promise on the health insurance rebate. We will also not be supporting this idea of penalising families with a higher Medicare surcharge just because of the other bill that you are bringing in. It is wrong. The Rudd government needs to be held to account on this issue.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-02-24,"—I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak on these important pieces of legislation, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]. These are measures that speak volumes of the contempt that the Rudd government holds for the Australian people and for what the ALP said and did going into the last election. This legislation is a clear example of the government saying one thing to get elected and doing another thing in office. That is the tragedy behind so many stories of the way that the Rudd government has approached these things. But private health insurance stands out as one of the strongest and clearest examples of failings by the government to live up to its word and to live up to the promises that it made to millions of Australians.
Private health insurance is an issue that affects all Australians, whether they have it or they do not. That is something that is often misunderstood and misinterpreted by those on the other side in the way that they present information in this debate. A strong private health insurance industry helps all aspects of the health sector. A strong private health insurance sector that keeps people utilising private hospitals and private health facilities reduces demand on the public health sector. It is a very simple formula. It reduces demand on public hospitals and, in doing so, helps to ease what are very long and unacceptable waiting lists and delays at a state level.
The problem with the approaches and the policies of the Rudd government is that they will reduce the incentives for people to take out private health insurance and strip support for the taking out of private health insurance from many thousands of Australians. In doing so, they will ensure that the take-up rate of private health insurance is lower and that public support for and utilisation of the private healthcare sector is reduced. As a consequence, demand and pressure on the public sector will increase.
That is why this issue affects all Australians, whether they have private health insurance or not. All Australians should be concerned that this government—which promised not to fiddle with private health insurance rebates and which from Prime Minister Rudd down gave its solemn word in the run-up to the last election that it would not change anything—wants to break its promise on this and that, for the second time around, has brought legislation to this place to try to break its promise in this key area. Once again, we see the Australian Senate acting as both the barrier between the government and the breaking of its own promises and the body that tries to keep the government honest on what it delivers to the Australian people.
Between nine and 10 million Australians have private health insurance, and many of these people will be directly impacted by the changes that this government is attempting to introduce. We know that when Labor was last in power the private health insurance sector was a shadow of what it is today. It was a shadow of what the Howard government helped it to build itself up to. We saw during that period of Labor government that the participation rates in private health insurance dropped from 67 per cent in 1983 to just 33½ per cent in 1996. In 13 years of the Hawke-Keating Labor government attempting to manage private health insurance we saw this massive reduction—that is, a halving of participation in the private health insurance sector.
What will we see under the Rudd government? Based on its current policy and approaches, we will see the same type of outcome. We will see that its attacks on the health insurance sector and the taxes that it is applying to ordinary Australians who want to do their bit to look after themselves, their families and their health insurance will cause these rates to plummet yet again. The government broke its word to the Australian people after the last election, and I am sure that this will be the first of many assaults that this government launches on the health insurance sector, the nearly 10 million Australians who have health insurance and every single Australian who has an interest in the private health sector and, indeed, the health sector overall.
This debate impacts on every single electorate across Australia. Many of the South Australian electorates are directly affected by private health insurance. South Australia has among the highest numbers of older Australians in Australia. Older Australians cling to their private health insurance because they know how important it is. They go without to hold onto their private health insurance because they know how important it is. South Australians in every one of our federal electorates hold onto their private health insurance because they know how important it is for them to be able to access the private healthcare system, to do their bit to look after themselves and, in doing so, to ease the pressures on the public healthcare sector.
Let us look at some of those electorates where there will be a very direct impact on thousands and thousands of South Australians. In the electorate of Wakefield, there are some 44,567 voters who are estimated to have private health insurance. Nearly 63,000 people across the electorate are covered by that insurance—families with younger people—
—And Labor voters.
—Indeed, many of them are Labor voters. In the seat of Wakefield, which the Labor Party won from the Liberal Party at the last election on the promise that they would not fiddle with private health insurance—‘not one jot, not one tiddle’ were the famously bizarre words of the Prime Minister when giving his commitment not to fiddle with private health insurance—there are 63,000 people. Where has Nick Champion, the local member, been on this issue? What has he been doing to champion the many people in his electorate who will be negatively impacted by the tax and attacks on private health by this government? In the electorate of Grey, 64½ thousand people have private health insurance—that is, around 47 per cent—and I am sure that a good many of them are Labor voters, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells pointed out before. I know that Rowan Ramsey, the member for Grey, has been pursuing this issue passionately, and at least he has stood up for the voters in his electorate.
I am sure that 47 per cent of voters in Grey will be grateful to Rowan, as will the people in Barker, where the local member, Patrick Secker, has stood up for the 48 per cent of people in that electorate who have private health insurance. Nearly 70,000 people in the electorate of Barker have private health insurance and will be impacted by this legislation. Patrick Secker has been out there with Rowan Ramsey talking about the impact in his electorate and standing up for his voters.
That stands in stark contrast to the electorate of Port Adelaide, where the local member, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Mark Butler, is a key defender of these attacks on private health insurance. He is defending them notwithstanding the fact that 67,400 people living in his electorate have private health insurance coverage and that those people will be impacted by his and his government’s decision to attack the private health insurance industry and make it harder for them to maintain their private health coverage. That is what it comes down to: it is making it harder for them to maintain it.
Another seat that the Labor Party won at the last election was Kingston. Another new member, Amanda Rishworth, joins Nick Champion, from Wakefield, in having gone silent on this issue. She has been dead quiet when it comes to standing up for her electorate. But she should be standing up for her electorate because, in Kingston, 55 per cent of people have private health insurance—that is right: 75,400-odd people living in the electorate of Kingston have private health insurance, which is the majority of households and families. They are doing their bit to look after themselves and will be penalised by the decision of the Rudd government that their local member, Ms Rishworth, is supporting.
An electorate with an even higher proportion of private health insurance is Adelaide, represented by Kate Ellis, a minister in this government, no less. She is, once again, defending this policy despite the fact that 68 per cent of households in her electorate are covered by private health insurance. That is up to around 89,000 people in the electorate of Adelaide who have coverage—old people and young people, on the roll and not on the roll. A clear majority of people in the electorate of Adelaide who commit themselves to doing their bit to help the system overall will be penalised by the decision of Ms Ellis and the Rudd government to make it harder for them to keep up their private health insurance.
In the adjacent electorate of Hindmarsh, Mr Steve Georganas, who chairs one of the parliament’s committees on health and ageing matters, seems to think it is acceptable to attack the private health insurance industry. This is notwithstanding the fact that, estimated on previous figures, 89,193 people—or some 68,000, or 69 per cent of, voters—in Hindmarsh, an electorate that statistically has been shown time and again to have one of the highest proportions of older Australians anywhere in the country, have private health insurance. Many of them will be hurt by this decision. Where has the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing been? Where has the member for Hindmarsh been in standing up for nearly 70 per cent of his electorate? Where has he been as the representative of the electorate in Australia with one of the oldest populations and therefore, unsurprisingly, such a high level of private health insurance? These members all stand condemned for their failure to champion the issues in their electorates.
The final electorate in South Australia is Sturt, represented by Christopher Pyne. It has the highest, 70-plus per cent, coverage of private health insurance in South Australia. Christopher Pyne, Patrick Secker, Jamie Briggs in Mayo, which has an equally high level of private health insurance coverage, and Rohan Ramsey in Grey have all championed the tens of thousands of families in their electorates who will be hurt by this measure. But we have heard not a peep from any of these Labor members, in particular Mr Georganas, who represents an electorate with such an aged population. This is the shame of it.
I have gone through those statistics to demonstrate that there is a clear reason why the opposition is taking a strong stance on this issue. We are taking a strong stance because the policy issues stack up. As I explained at the beginning of my contribution, it is about protecting the private health insurance sector so that we can sustain the public health sector in a strong way. But it is also about standing up for voters, standing up for people who will be adversely affected by this measure and standing up for the people who heard the promises of the Rudd Labor government during the last election campaign that it would not change anything to do with private health insurance rebates—not one jot; not one tiddle, as I have said before. Instead, the Rudd government has come in and, in one fell swoop, is attempting to hit so many voters so hard on this issue that is so important to them.
That is why we will continue to stand steadfast in our opposition to these changes. We will continue to oppose the government. We will continue to ensure that, no matter how hard the government try to break their promises, we will be there holding them to their promises, holding them to do what is right and, in doing so, standing up for the millions of Australians who will otherwise be hit by this seriously wrong policy measure.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-02-24,"—in reply—I thank senators for their contributions and appreciate the opportunity to sum up the debate and respond to the points raised. The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2] will amend various acts to give effect to our 2009-10 budget measure to introduce three new private health insurance incentive tiers. They are part of a package with the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2009 [No. 2]. We believe that these reforms are needed to make the rebate fairer and more sustainable for the future.
These bills were defeated by the Senate at the second reading on 9 September 2009. When defeating these bills last September, the Senate dismissed one of the government’s key measures to deal with the fiscal impact of the global financial crisis. If these bills and associated legislation are defeated again today by the Senate, it will have a $2 billion impact on the budget over the forward estimates. Taking a longer view, Treasury advises that the private health insurance rebate will be the fastest-growing part of our health expenditure over the next 10 years, growing by more than 50 per cent above inflation. If this measure is not passed it will increase health spending by 0.15 per cent of GDP, or around $100 billion, over the period 2049 to 2050.
The Minister for Health and Ageing has announced that in 2010 private health insurance premiums will increase by an average of 5.78 per cent. This is after the government had sought resubmissions that reduced premiums for 8.5 million Australians, or 75 per cent of the people covered by private health insurance. While the government acknowledges that any increase may place pressure on insured people, careful scrutiny of private health insurers’ applications has kept increases to the minimum necessary. This is unlike the opposition’s policy as put forward by the shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club last week where he said that he preferred a pure market and criticised that the minister has the power to set rate increases. The rate rise reflects that in 2008-09 private health insurers paid more than $11 billion in benefits to members—an increase of 10 per cent—compared with the previous year’s $10 billion. Benefits paid to members were around 87 per cent of total premiums paid by members. This increase in benefits is highlighted in the Intergenerational report findings that the private health insurance rebate is going to be the fastest-growing aspect of our health expenditure. Spending on the private health insurance rebate has grown from $2.1 billion in 2000-01, the first full year of operation, to $4.2 billion last financial year. This spending is unsustainable, particularly in light of the global financial crisis and since the 2008-09 budget tax receipts were revised down by around $170 million. This is why the government has reintroduced these bills and is firmly committed to seeking their passage in this form.
The government does support a mixed model of financing and delivery for health services in Australia and recognises the essential role of the private health sector. However, government support for private health insurance must be directed to those hard-working Australians who need the assistance most, not the high-income earners who clearly do not. Hairdressers, secretaries and taxi drivers will continue to receive benefits, but not the millionaires and politicians who, quite frankly, do not need it. Under the fairer private health insurance budget measure, those who most need the rebate will be completely unaffected and the overwhelming majority of insured Australians will not see any change to their rebate. An estimated 75 per cent of Australians with private hospital cover will be totally unaffected by these changes, but high-income earners who have a greater capacity to contribute to the costs of their health care will no longer have their premiums subsidised by those on much lower incomes.
In designing the reforms a key element has been to ensure Australians maintain a high level of private health insurance membership. Already almost 475,000 more people have taken out private hospital cover since this government was elected. This is not something we want to see reversed. The opposition predictions that previous changes to the Medicare levy surcharge were going to lead to a massive exodus of people from private health cover have been shown to be false. To maintain this high level of insurance we need to use the complementary levers of the Medicare levy surcharge, lifetime health cover and continued support of private health insurance rebates for those who need it. Treasury advises the government that by balancing the measures we can ensure that 99.7 per cent of privately insured Australians keep their cover. Treasury estimates that only 25,000 people will drop out of private health insurance. These Treasury estimates have been supported by the independent Ipsos private health insurance survey where the results show only 15,900 people would drop their hospital cover, based on members’ responses when the package was explained to them.
The Department of Health and Ageing estimates that the small reduction in hospital cover will only result in 8,000 extra admissions to public hospitals over two years. The President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Andrew Pesce, agreed, saying that their modelling showed that ‘there isn’t going to be a huge dropout at this stage.’ The peak public hospital body, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, has said that there will be ‘little or no impact on the numbers of people with private health insurance’.
There is one politician on the opposition side in this chamber who has spoken honestly about this legislation: Senator Joyce. He said that the opposition should consider the legislation with ‘an open mind’. He said, ‘If there is a net saving, you would have to positively consider it.’ I call on Senator Joyce and all members of the coalition to look at the evidence of the net saving to budget, to be financially responsible and to support this measure. The ministers for health and finance have written to Senator Joyce offering him evidence and further information if he needs it on how this is a net saving to budget.
In relation to the position of other members of this chamber, I am aware that the Greens have proposed two positions. Their first was that they support the rebate reduction but not the Medicare levy surcharge changes, which is why we are now dealing with these three bills separately and not as a package. The government’s position on this is very clear. These bills need to be agreed to as a package which is how we can ensure that the membership rate of private health insurance will stay high. Ensuring this high level of participation requires increased Medicare levy surcharge rates for higher income earners so that the increased costs of insurance for high-income earners after the reduction in the rebate is balanced by an increase in tax penalties for those high-income earners who drop out of or refuse to take out private health insurance. It is important to note that this measure is not being introduced in isolation. It is just one element of the reforms that the government has been implementing. Since coming to office, the government has been working hard to reform Australia’s health system, including a $64 billion package on health and hospital funding.
I would also like to deal with a number of issues that have been raised by senators during this debate. Senator Fierravanti-Wells—it is fortunate that she is in the chamber today—accused the Prime Minister of misleading the public by saying that the cost of not passing this package is $2 billion over four years, $9 billion over 10 years and $100 billion over 40 years. I can explain this to the Senate. The cost of the program grows over time. All of those figures are correct; they have been verified by Treasury. If the opposition does not pass this package, the cost will continue to go up. Not passing the package will cost the budget $2 billion over the forward estimates, $9 billion over the next 10 years and a whopping $100 billion over the next 40 years. This is why you need to rethink your outright opposition and particularly how it will impact on the nation’s finances.
Senator Siewert raised in her speech a suggestion, and has tabled an amendment, that the total cost of the increase in the surcharge should be devoted to mental health. The government agrees that mental health is a priority and has been increasing funding in this area since coming to office in addition to the 50 per cent increase in the Health and Hospitals Fund. However, I will be clear with the senator that we cannot support her amendment. This measure is part of the budget package; it is not an additional available pool of expenditure. Further, we need to reform our health system in a methodical and strategic way, not on the run.
Senator Bernardi made the bold claim that the Howard government delivered the record high participation rate of private health insurance. I can assure the senator, although I know he is loyal to the Howard government past, that this is not the case. Firstly, rates of private health insurance before the introduction of Medicare were much higher as there was no universal scheme. Secondly, we now have a higher rate of participation than the Howard government did: 0.5 per cent higher than when the previous government left office; almost 475,000 extra people have private hospital cover. And just this morning the shadow health minister said to reporters:
The $1.9 billion in this measure, in this attack by the Rudd government on private health, comes from people dropping out of private health.
This is clearly not correct. It is a concoction by the opposition and typical of their ability to be very liberal with the truth on these bills. As we have said many times before, 99.7 per cent of members are estimated to retain their membership. The savings come from the increase in the surcharge under this bill and the reduction in the rebate under the other bills—certainly not from any dropout beyond 0.3 per cent of members. To continue to reform our health system and to cope with the ageing of the population, we will have to spend smarter, putting the health dollars where they are needed most. These bills will help the government to do just that.
In summing up, by maintaining a carefully designed system of carrots and sticks, the government’s budget measure will have a negligible effect on both premiums and the public hospital system while increasing the sustainability of the rebate and the fairness with which it is applied. With that contribution, I thank all of the speakers in the debate and commend these bills to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Siewert’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2010-02-24,"—The internet and new and evolving technologies open up a world of exciting possibilities and benefits for the very young, right through to the senior members of our communities. The take-up of text messaging and twitter, and social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, Bebo and Habbo, to name just a few, have all changed the way we communicate. As we experience these exciting developments, it is crucial that children and young people using these technologies have the necessary information and skills they need to make smart decisions online and to become good digital citizens. It is clear that understanding how to navigate the online world safely is an important element in the development of digital literacy. It is important, too, that teachers and parents are empowered to provide the right advice to their students and their children. And it is important for education departments and their schools to use the appropriate methods to address cybersafety within their communities.
One of the issues to do with cybersafety is cyberbullying. Other dangers include cybergrooming, sexual solicitation, child pornography, cyberstalking, identity theft and breaches of privacy. These are all issues that must be addressed. The tragic death of a teenager in my home state of South Australia in 2007 brings home these dangers in a heart-wrenching way. Cybersafety is a term with which we are all becoming increasingly familiar. This government is committed to addressing the issues of cybersafety.
This month, along with many other countries, we recognised the need for greater awareness with Safer Internet Day. ‘Think before you post’ was the core message of this year’s international cybersafety event, supported in Australia by the Australian Communications and Media Authority as part of its Cybersmart program. To mark Safer Internet Day, the Australian Communications and Media Authority held cybersafety educational activities in schools throughout Australia. These activities included a national Cybersmart detectives activity for more than 800 primary-school students; the release, on the Cybersmart website, of cybersafety themed videos produced by children and young people; a hot seat, new cybersafety badge and poster in protected children’s networking website SuperClubsPLUS Australia; and a mail-out of posters and other cybersafety materials to all Australian local councils and public libraries. ACMA Chairman Chris Chapman explained the Safer Internet Day theme well on the ACMA website, saying:
While many claim to know the risks of posting too much personal or inappropriate information online, they may not always translate that into safe online behaviour. Thinking about the consequences before hitting ‘post’ may help to minimise negative experiences online …
ACMA has joined forces with state and federal police, Bravehearts, MySpace, the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, the Internet Industry Association, Microsoft, the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, Yahoo!7, Google and Telstra, in promoting Safer Internet Day cybersafety messages. Safer Internet Day is observed in more than 50 countries and recognised right across Europe, North and South America, Asia and, of course, as I have said, Australia. Activities internationally are run by Insafe, an international network for internet safety.
The Rudd Labor government are committed to action in this area and are investing more than $125 million in a comprehensive suite of measures to address the varying challenges faced by families when they spend time online. Our plan includes law enforcement, education and information, research and international cooperation. Money allocated to cybersafety programs includes funding for 91 officers in the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations team. To provide a safer online environment for Australian internet users, particularly children, additional funding has been allocated to ACMA to continue to expand educational activities to help deal with cybersafety risks, including the risk I mentioned earlier of cyberbullying. In particular, waiting times for schools participating in the ACMA cybersafety outreach program will be reduced and the operating hours of the cybersafety online helpline will be increased to ensure its availability when children are most at risk. In developing our overall approach, the government have considered extensive industry feedback on the most appropriate ways to improve safety online.
We take cybersafety seriously. We know that there is no easy solution and there is no one solution to this issue. Cyberdangers are complex. The internet can be a minefield as well as a mine of information. Because cyberbullying and cybergrooming, sexual solicitation and cyberstalking are not carried out face-to-face, people may not know the identity of the person targeting them. Children and young people can be groomed, bullied or stalked in their own homes, in their bedrooms and personal spaces, where they should feel safe and protected. Cyberbullying, unlike pre-internet bullying in schools, does not stop at the front door when a child gets home from school; it can be with them 24/7. It does not stop at the flick of a switch or the push of a button but continues even without the victim’s presence—and this can be through mobile phones or on the internet. That is why parents are encouraged to ensure that their children’s mobile phones and computers do not live in the children’s bedrooms. There is evidence that cyberbullying, particularly among the young, is emerging as a significant risk to cybersafety for young people and that the consequences can be devastating, from acute anxiety, depression, anger and truancy to self-harm, eating disorders and, unfortunately, in extreme cases, suicide.
As I said, action is being taken to address this increasingly serious and very often underreported problem, as well as the issue of cybersafety more generally. I carried out a study tour of the UK specifically relating to this issue, and one message that came across was that the underreporting of such incidents by children was because they feared parents would take away their mobile phones or switch off their computers, thinking that it would end there, when in fact research has shown that that is not is the appropriate thing to do to assist in resolving the issue.
ACMA provides free resources for children, parents, teachers and library staff. It has a user-friendly website, www.cybersmart.gov.au, and also an online helpline for confidential counselling and advice, so parents and children can go to this website and access the information they need to deal with this issue.
In addition, as part of its cybersafety plan the Rudd government has also been getting advice from young people through its youth advisory group. Funding of $17 million over five years for a range of education, awareness and counselling services based on recommendations from the government’s 300-strong youth advisory group, and advice from its consultative working group on cybersafety are all genuine steps taken by this government to address the issue of cybersafety. Earlier this month the government announced a $3 million pilot project that was to be carried out in 164 schools across Australia. The program is to be developed and run by the Alannah and Madeline Foundation child safety charity—whose representatives I met with in Parliament House today—which is currently working with government and non-government primary and secondary schools from urban, rural and remote areas.
Participating schools are provided with online resources to help them create a tailored approach to cybersafety issues. Overall, the program aims to help schools work with parents and the community to keep children safe. Ways that they hope to achieve this include improving the curriculum and student welfare practices in this area and giving teachers the skills to confront such issues. The results will be independently assessed and considered in the federal government’s review of the National Safe Schools Framework, due to end midyear.
As further support for its work in this area the government is committed to setting up a joint parliamentary standing committee on cybersafety. Also this month the Australian Federal Police teamed up with Microsoft Australia to deliver the UK created internet safety program, ThinkUKnow Australia. It was launched by the Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O’Connor, last Friday and offers interactive training to parents, carers and teachers through schools using a network of accredited trainers.
As parents and community members we can contribute by being watchful and by taking time to listen to the concerns of young people and to the concerns of our children, by accessing the ACMA website and by getting the information that we need so that we can address the issues before they arise and have the information ready. We can also encourage people to speak out about their fears and experiences. Communication, understanding and support are the keys, and we can all play a part.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Cybersafety</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Employment Participation (Senator Arbib) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators.
This government continues to duck for cover and refuses to take responsibility for its serious failures with the Home Insulation Program. Earlier this week I asked the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib, when he first became aware of the safety issues for workers involved in the rushed and failed Home Insulation Program and he refused to answer. Today Senator Abetz asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, representing the Prime Minister, whether he would be able to ask the Prime Minister to get that information. The Prime Minister tells us that he is responsible and that the buck stops with him. Senator Evans, in relation to Senator Arbib, just glibly suggested, ‘Why don’t you ask him a question?’ So I asked Senator Arbib a second time: ‘When did you, Minister, first become aware of the serious safety issues for workers involved in the failed Home Insulation Program?’ Again he was very disciplined and very focused in giving us a lot of propaganda but he did not answer the core question: when was he, as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, as Mr Stimulus himself, first made aware of the serious safety issues for workers involved in the failed Home Insulation Program? To this day we do not have an answer. I can only hope that Senator Evans will take his commitment to this chamber seriously and raise the matter with the Prime Minister and that the Prime Minister will be true to his word—that he is responsible—and will get the information from Minister Arbib that we continue to be unable to get from him in this chamber.
When he was appointed as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery he was Mr Stimulus. He was going to be the one who was going to be responsible for all the jobs out there. He was out there bragging about every single job that was created. He was telling us, in speech after speech, what a wonderful program it was. But now that things are going pear shaped, he is running for cover.
—That’s right. He’s ducking for cover.
—Yes, he is ducking for cover, as Senator Bernardi has just mentioned. This was a rushed program and it was implemented in the most incompetent manner, and all of that has been well documented in recent weeks. But why is this minister, who told us earlier this week that he attended regular meetings to supervise the rollout of this program and to discuss issues of risk and to discuss other issues in relation to the rollout of this program, not prepared to tell us when he first became aware of the serious worker safety issues in relation to this program? Perhaps he does not know.
The reality is that this minister is too busy running the affairs of the New South Wales Labor Party to be properly focused on his responsibilities as a minister. This minister is trying to stop New South Wales premiers from getting rolled and is having to manage the fallout when they do get rolled. He is doing deals offering Labor Party preselection to the Senate and then taking it away. He is having lunches and dinners in the cafes and Chinese restaurants of Sydney where he is offering preselection or taking it away. I will be very interested in the contribution of Senator Hutchins to this take-note motion, because I would like to hear from Senator Hutchins what he thinks about Senator Arbib’s activities in New South Wales.
Then you hear Senator Arbib has got his proteges being appointed as secretaries-general of the New South Wales Labor Party and then getting them sacked. Of course if he gets them sacked he has to find them a job in the Senate. I wonder who are going to be the people suffering the consequences of that. If you have a minister that is so entrenched and so desperate to stay on top of the machinations of the New South Wales Labor Party, of course he cannot focus on his true job as a minister of the Crown.
This is very serious. There have been some serious failings in the rollout of this program that have been seriously criticised by industry experts right from the word go. The minister has got some serious questions to answer and he is refusing to answer them. The Prime Minister, who to get his job was relying on Senator Arbib to roll the great Labor federal member from Western Australia, Kim Beazley, has probably been accommodating Senator Arbib’s failings—too much so, we would argue. He is prepared to look past them. But this is a time when the Prime Minister should stand up to the New South Wales Labor Right’s powerbroker, Senator Arbib, because he is actually losing his influence. The word on the street is that he is struggling to keep a hold on what is going on over there. I hope, for the sake of Senator Hutchins, that he will not succeed in stopping his preselection.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2010-02-24,"—That is indeed a welcome endorsement, which I will take back to the internal processes within the Labor Party! Since the accession of Mr Abbott to the Liberal leadership we have seen a sharp turn of that party from what I suppose Malcolm Turnbull believed. He was in many ways one of the honourable heirs of the founder of the Liberal Party, Robert Menzies. Robert Menzies was a true liberal. In fact, in his signature speech in 1942, when he spoke about the forgotten people—whom he was to successfully appeal to in 1949—he marked out the differences between the party he wished to represent and other parties. I will quote him:
Let me first define it by exclusion. I exclude at one end of the scale the rich and powerful: those who control great funds and enterprises, and are as a rule able to protect themselves—though it must be said that in a political sense they have as a rule shown neither comprehension nor competence.
I think the modern conservative party now taken over by Tony Abbott would qualify for that—‘neither comprehension nor competence’. What we are speaking about is part of the stimulus package that this government initiated when the world was struck by the greatest financial crisis we had had since the Great Depression. It was this government that decided to act, rather than let the economic forces operate without some sort of restraint—and let me tell my conservative colleagues over there on your left, Mr Deputy President, about that.
Let me tell you the OECD’s statistics for unemployment last year: Australia, 5.6 per cent; Canada, 8.3 per cent; Finland, 8.3 per cent; France, 9.4 per cent; Ireland, 11.8 per cent; Hungary, 10.1 per cent; United Kingdom, 7.8 per cent; and the United States, 9.3 per cent. In two years America’s unemployment rate rose from 4.6 to 9.3 per cent.
We as a government understood that we had to act. We could not just let market forces operate—and nor did your party, Mr Deputy President, when they came into power in 1949. They knew that there was a need for the state to intervene, to make sure that the economy kicked over. They were not going to let anything like the Great Depression happen again, when political crises led to turmoil and revolution. That is what the real Liberal Party did. They knew what they had to do. They had to act, and that is exactly what this government has done. It has pushed money into the economy and stimulated the economy so that this does not happen to us.
Again, I go back to our unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent. This has expanded all over our country, not just in the cities but in regional and rural Australia. We have the strongest economic growth of any of the 33 world economies. We are the only country in that group that has recorded positive growth. Let me tell you what has occurred in this period for our colleagues in the north. The US economy has contracted 3.9 per cent. The euro area has contracted 4.7 per cent. The United Kingdom has contracted 5.5 per cent. Japan, our second greatest trading power, has contracted 6.4 per cent. This has happened since the global financial crisis. It has not happened in this country, because this government has sought to intervene—whether it is in this program or other programs—to make sure the people in this country are not left destitute, homeless and unemployed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Home Insulation Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-02-24,"—I take that last speech as a defence of the maladministration and negligence of the whole scheme. We on this side of the House want to be nice to Senator Hutchins but not to his nemesis. All week, Senator Arbib has been slipping and sliding, ducking and weaving, and zigging and zagging his responsibilities, but the spotlight has stayed on the maladministration and negligence of this political hoon. Senator Arbib was appointed by the Prime Minister as the parliamentary secretary overseeing the implementation of the stimulus package.
—Senator McGauran, I think the reflection you made on the minister should be withdrawn.
—That Senator Arbib is a political hoon?
—Yes, I think you should withdraw that.
—I withdraw it. But he cannot duck his responsibilities. Yesterday, I heard the Prime Minister giving out the standards of ministerial responsibility. However low the Prime Minister wants to set that bar, there is one change he cannot make, and that is to the question of misleading parliament—that is always a sackable offence. There is a lot about Senator Arbib’s performance in the last week that says the misleading of parliament is an issue. Many of the answers he has given in this parliament beggar belief. The whole scheme from top to bottom beggars belief. It beggars belief they even took the scheme on.
—They were told not to.
—They were told not to. It beggars belief that Senator Arbib and Minister Garrett, his senior minister, did not see the Minter Ellison report until two weeks ago. This report set out all the warnings about rushing this scheme—all the work safety issues, the possible bloated pricing and shoddy performances. It predicted it all.
It beggars belief that Senator Arbib came into this chamber just two days ago and said that all the departments, and officials from all the ministries, attended those safety meetings and, when asked the next day whether the Prime Minister’s department was one of those that attended the meetings, he said no. He ducked and weaved but he said no—that they were not part of it. He is protecting the Prime Minister. It beggars belief that the Prime Minister’s department was not at those meetings.
Senator Arbib said that he had been informed of the risks but he never asked any questions about what sorts of risks they were. He did not know about the 93 fires or the thousands of electrocuted ceilings—he just knew there were risks. He never asked what or why. It beggars belief. It has more to do with misleading this Senate than anything else. It beggars belief that Minter Ellison would report that he met weekly with them, and yet he knew nothing of the system’s collapse, the shoddiness of the system. I think the other day he even denied he had met with Minter Ellison on a weekly basis, saying he had met them on a ‘regular’ basis.
It all beggars belief because it is not true. There are a lot of untruths being told this week and Senator Arbib is part of that. There is a cover-up, from the Prime Minister’s office through to Minister Garrett’s and Senator Arbib’s offices. But why should we be surprised that Senator Arbib would mislead the parliament or be part of so many untruths? This is a senator who entered parliament for all the wrong reasons. You could say public administration and public service were very low on his list of reasons for entering parliament. It was all to do with political gain, political intrigue and the favours and rewards he could milk from the system, and his mates.
It is incredible that this political hoon, this shallow, overrated New South Wales politician, would enter this parliament and try and bump people as decent as Senator Forshaw or Senator Hutchins, who are both—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy President. Although you have asked Senator McGauran to withdraw in relation to a term he used, he has repeatedly used that term. I ask that you ask him to withdraw it again.
—I apologise. I was distracted for a moment and I did not hear. Senator McGauran, if you used the term that I asked you to withdraw before, I ask you to withdraw it again.
—Was that ‘political hoon’, referring to Senator Arbib?
—Or ‘shallow’?
—Or ‘shallow’ or ‘overrated’?
—As I said, I was distracted. I was talking to the Clerk. Senator O’Brien, perhaps you could specifically—
—Mr Deputy President, Senator McGauran is trying to be too smart by half, frankly. He knows that he used the term which I complained of and which he has now repeated. He withdrew it before. You were talking to the Clerk—I understand that—and while you were talking to the Clerk he returned to the phrase and used it again. Then, trying to be smart, I suspect, he used it again to question whether that is the term that is objectionable. He knows it is objectionable. He is playing a game.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I can confirm that Senator McGauran did run off at the mouth and say that Senator Arbib was a political hoon, and I think it is appropriate that he withdraw it.
—Let us be very careful where we go here. Senator McGauran, I asked you to withdraw that term.
—I withdraw the term ‘political hoon’, but I am glad to see that I can still call the senator overrated and shallow. He is trying to muscle out decent senators in Senator Hutchins and Senator Forshaw, experienced and intelligent senators who have come in for all the right reasons. Sure, they have come out of the New South Wales right and they know their politics as well as anyone, but they have got public administration and public service as No. 1, not political intrigue as No. 1; it is well down the list.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I—
—Stand up for Senator Hutchins, please!
—Senator Hutchins can stand up for himself. He is very capable of standing up for himself and I am sure he will do exactly that. But it is very disappointing to see that the only way the opposition can attack the government is to make personal attacks on a very good minister in this government.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—No. He is a very good minister in this government. He is a good minister in this government because he is doing what the Australian people want our government to do. Let us go back to what Senator Hutchins was talking about. What was Senator Hutchins saying? He was talking about the crisis that we faced in this community at the start of the global financial collapse. This government had to do something. This is not a Liberal government. This is a Labor government. This is a government that was determined to pull us out of the problems that the rest of the world was facing. What was the rest of the world facing? The rest of the world was facing a recession.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Senator Bernardi, I know you do not like to hear this, but the rest of the world was facing a recession. We avoided that. Why did we avoid that? Because this government acted. We had to act quickly and we had to stop unemployment skyrocketing like it has in the United States.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order on my left! Senator Farrell is entitled to be heard in silence.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I appreciate that protection, particularly from Senator Bernardi. All the opposition can do is launch personal attacks. The core issue that Senator Hutchins was referring to was unemployment. He was talking about the Australian unemployment figures of over five cent. I would like to drill down into those figures a little. He did not refer to some of the state figures. What are the state figures in South Australia? You will be interested in this, Mr Deputy President. In South Australia the unemployment figures are 4.4 per cent. That is well and truly one per cent lower than the national average.
At a crucial time in our history, when all the other countries in the world were seeing their economies fall into recession and unemployment rising, what was happening in Australia, and particularly in South Australia? In South Australia unemployment has fallen to 4.4 per cent. I think it is worth noting that that is the lowest unemployment rate that the state has ever recorded. Why have we done that? Of course it has been due to the stimulus package of the federal government, but I have to also give some credit to the state government, because they have also played a crucial role. One of the things that the Rann Labor government did in South Australia at this crucial period was to ensure that they were very quick off the mark to implement the federal government’s stimulus package. One of the reasons why unemployment amongst the states in mainland Australia is the lowest in South Australia is that, when the federal government introduced its stimulus package, South Australia was quick off the mark to take advantage of that.
When you compare what has happened right around the world, in those 33 economies that Senator Hutchins referred to, where are we? Our economy has not gone into recession. Young people in particular have been able to find jobs and the economy has stayed out of recession. That, principally, is what we needed to do at a crucial time in our history. The rest of the world was falling into recession. We have avoided it. In South Australia, with a combination of Rann Labor and Rudd Labor—the two Rs—we have kept our country out of recession, unemployment is going down, not up, and we are going to find that those figures continue to go down because we have adopted the correct policies.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-24,"—It is not surprising that Senator Farrell stood up and tried to defend Senator Arbib, his fellow warlord, faction master, powerbroker—or however they like to describe themselves as they promote themselves through the press. But what I find amazing is the contribution by the warlord, Senator Farrell, and the poor victim of betrayal, Senator Hutchins. Senator Hutchins was actually an employer of note of Senator Arbib’s; the apprentice has eclipsed the master through a dagger assault—whether it was from the front or in the back, we are not sure. We only know that Senator Arbib has risen beyond his capacity. That is one thing we know for sure, because this is a minister who cannot be relied upon to do his job. The job he was given in this place was to oversee the administration and implementation of the batty pink batt program.
What was the result of this program? We have had fires in 95 homes—and it is estimated that there are another 135 homes at risk of fire—thanks to a dodgy insulation program. Senator Farrell and Senator Hutchins have the hide and the nerve to come in here and say that a $3 billion pink batt program was somehow going to save the global economy from recession. What absolute nonsense. They had bats in the belfry if they thought that that was going to save Australia from recession! Poor administration has imposed an enormous cost—tens of millions of dollars worth—on the taxpayer unnecessarily.
And the safety and efficacy of this program was the responsibility of Senator Arbib. The minister whose name they dare not mention on that side of the chamber. Neither Senator Hutchins nor Senator Farrell wanted to invoke the name of the great powerbroker, Senator Arbib. Senator Arbib has been a disaster. His answers to questions are evasive; they are disingenuous. In the Minter Ellison report it said there were weekly meetings with the relevant ministers. Then Minister Arbib said it was ‘regular meetings’, and then today it was ‘infrequent meetings’. He clearly cannot get his time line right as he scrambles to cobble together a defence—a defence that no-one in their right mind will buy.
There was a minister responsible for safety who did not raise the issue of fire safety or other safety issues, such as electrocution. They are the sorts of safety aspects that might endanger people’s lives but this minister did not bother to ask questions about that. He relied on departmental advice which, of course, they all deny seeing. They did not see the Minter Ellison report, even though there were weekly or regular meetings with Minter Ellison! All of these things beggar belief. This is a man who has failed the most basic accountability test of government. Minister Arbib—like their flawed and failed insulation program, which has gone—should go. Mr Garrett should go. They need to stand up and do the mea culpa and say: ‘Yes, we made a terrible mistake. We botched this like we have botched so many other things in the Australian economy and like we have botched so many other things in government.’
Senator Arbib botched so many things in his control of the New South Wales government—the most dysfunctional government, bar the Rudd government, in Australia—and he has botched the handing out of Senate seats like some Illinois governor. He has promised two Senate seats—one to Mr Thistlethwaite, who is his factional cohort and is Labor secretary in New South Wales, and one to some other cat last year. He has two Senate seats up for grabs; the only question is: whose?

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—Will it be Senator Marshall’s seat? Probably not; Senator Arbib’s influence does not extend that far. Would Senator Hutchins possibly be under threat because Senator Hutchins was mounting such a solid defence of his former apprentice, now master? Perhaps it will be Senator Forshaw’s seat. He is not in the chamber, unfortunately. Senator Forshaw is probably packing up his office as we speak.
It is outrageous that a man has so much power and so little accountability. He does not have enough of a conscience to stand up and be honest with the Australian people. He does not have enough accountability and integrity to front his colleagues and say, ‘I’m sorry; you’re out of here, mate.’ He has to do it through the press and to make promises that he cannot keep. Well, the Australian people know that this government—not just this minister—have made too many promises they cannot keep. The promises that they have kept they have failed to implement appropriately. And Australia is worse off as a result. This minister and Minister Garrett need to go.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
           That the provisions of paragraph (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Corporations Amendment (Financial Market Supervision) Bill 2010, Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill 2010 and the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Bill 2010, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
        Leave granted.
        The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bills

The Corporations Amendment (Financial Market Supervision) Bill (the bill) establishes the framework to provide for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to assume responsibility for supervision of Australia’s domestically licensed financial markets, in line with the Government’s announcement on 24 August 2009.
The bill also provides for ASIC to set rules regarding supervision of transactions on Australia’s financial markets and provides ASIC with the powers necessary to enforce such rules.
The Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill will allow ASIC to recover the costs of supervision from market operators. 

Reasons for Urgency

ASIC is to take over the responsibility for the supervision of Australia’s financial markets from the third quarter 2010.
In order for this to occur, introduction and passage of the bill in the 2010 Autumn sittings is essential.
ASIC will require approximately three months lead time once the legislation is passed to customise the supervisory systems and ensure they are operational before it assumes sole supervisory responsibility.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-24,"—For those of us who live in Northern Australia, the Rudd Labor government’s continued failure to meet the development and, indeed, other needs of Northern Australia is legend. With the Rudd government it seems to always be a case of out of sight, out of mind. Senators would appreciate that, whilst Northern Australia—that is, north of the Tropic of Capricorn in Australia—produces something like 40 to 45 per cent of Australia’s export earnings, it only has about five per cent of Australia’s population. As a consequence, as far as Mr Rudd is concerned, it is insignificant politically. If it is insignificant politically to Mr Rudd, then he has no interest in returning to the north of Australia a fair share of Australia’s wealth, much of which, as I have indicated, has come from Northern Australia.
In this debate today I am delighted to be supported by two very significant Northern Australians, Senator Nigel Scullion from the Northern Territory and Senator Alan Eggleston from Western Australia, who was for many years the distinguished Mayor of Port Hedland in that state.
The Rudd government’s insensitivity to development in Northern Australia can be no better exemplified than by the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report that has recently been released by the Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia. That in itself is interesting. Originally, the Rudd government announced with great gusto that there would be a minister for Northern Australia. It was not long before it changed to ‘Western and Northern Australia’. Whilst good for Western Australia, I keep asking: why isn’t there a minister for Queensland or a minister for Victoria or a minister for Tasmania? It seems that Mr Gray’s attention has been diverted from the north to his home state. It is also worth noting that, while Gary Gray is a nice enough sort of fellow—I think his heart is in the right place—he lives in Perth and has little direct connection with the north of Australia.
The Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce was, as we all know, set up by the Howard government. It was chaired at the time by my colleague Senator Bill Heffernan and contained a number of northerners. It was a task force that was specifically tasked with showing the way forward for sustainable development of Northern Australia. The task force did a lot of good work with the original personnel on that group. Unfortunately, when the government changed, so did the task force personnel and the terms of reference for the task force. Rather than having, as was originally intended, a blueprint for Northern Australia, a way forward, a leadership exposition of what needs to be done and what can be done in Northern Australia, we have this pathetic report recently released by Mr Gray from the new task force.
Time is not going to allow me to go through these reports—the associated scientific compendium and the science review—which are many hundreds of pages. Suffice it to say, here was a classic opportunity for a government and a government appointed committee to show optimism, to show leadership, to show the way forward and to show how it could be done in Northern Australia. What has the task force report delivered? Not the optimism and the way forward that we had hoped for but why it cannot be done, why it need not happen and how you have to be cautious with everything that occurs. Regrettably, while some of the information in the report is sound, the emphasis given to the negatives has meant a curtailment of the march towards further development of Northern Australia.
What I want to emphasise to all those greenies who lauded the recommendations is that recommendations such as ‘by 2030 one-third of the lands in Northern Australia should be locked away in the National Reserve System’ are just stupid. That recommendation was applauded by the greenies. It is interesting to note that the first public exposition of this task force report was the day before it was publicly released and widely gloating was one of the task force members, who also just happens to be a member of the WWF and who is renowned for his antagonism to sustainable development anywhere and particularly in Northern Australia.
What these people do not understand is that in the world today there are 80 million new mouths to feed every year—80 million new people come into this world. Someone has to feed them. Places like China, which used to produce a lot of its own food, had its own food bowl on the plains, are no longer able to grow the food to meet that country’s need, let alone export to the world. For the future of the world, we need to look at places around the world that can have sustainable production of food into the future. Regrettably, this task force report did not do that but put forward all of the negative stuff. If the radical greenies who applauded this report could understand that we do need increased food production then they would not have been quite so supportive of this report and critical of development.
There is a mosaic of good lands in Northern Australia and there are billions of megalitres of water that flow out of Australia every year from Northern Australia. And yet, at the same time, we all know of reports that the south of Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin, which used to feed Australia, is getting drier. Here we have a classic opportunity to sensibly pave the way for sustainable food production in Northern Australia. However, that great opportunity, I have to say with a great deal of regret, has been lost.
I was amused to hear Senator Carr in question time today say that his government believed in science for science’s sake and did not want to influence scientists with politics. Well how come with this task force, after the report had been released and when there was criticism of them not seriously considering water storage damming proposals in Northern Australia, they let it slip that they did not even investigate dams in Northern Australia because they had been told that the Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australian governments, and the Commonwealth government—all Labor governments I might add—had a no dams policy and so therefore they should not even bother looking at dams. What sort of a scientific report is that when one of the great big elements of any look at sustainable development has been removed from the purview of the scientists looking into it? I happen to know that there are sites on the Gilbert River in my state of Queensland and on the Flinders River at Richmond, the O’Connell diversion, which are well advanced in their plans. They are sustainable and they can harvest water. And this report, instead of working out how that could be done and looking at how we could do it in a careful way—and we all want it to be careful—simply ignored those sorts of proposals.
All in all this report is a great shame; it is a great opportunity lost. It is typical of the Rudd government’s complete inaction when it comes to Northern Australia and the possible development of the north. I can assure the Senate and the people of Australia that a Tony Abbott led government in the future will take a much more sensible view of sustainable development in the north and will allow the north to develop in a sustainable way in the manner in which those of us who live in the north know that it can.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I welcome the opportunity to talk on the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report. This is the most comprehensive review of land and water science relevant to the north of Australia that has been undertaken for many a long time. If I recollect the past decade or so correctly, when we were in opposition, I do not recall Senator Macdonald’s government moving to do anything about a sustainable development of Northern Australia, other than to set up a committee and to start to talk about it—but I will come back to that in a minute.
Sustainable development of Northern Australia is a priority for this government, and we have moved very quickly to start to do something about it, not languishing for 10 years, as the previous government did, before they realised that there were opportunities here. But rather than charge into Northern Australia and just assume that there is plenty of water or just assume that there is plenty of land that you can develop or that you can capture—the science shows that neither is really possible to the extent people opposite would like it—we have undertaken a task force that is a comprehensive review of the science of this part of the country.
In September 2008 the Rudd government changed both the terms of reference and the membership of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce established by the previous government. We wanted terms of reference that focused on tackling the broad range of environmental, economic and social challenges—so it was much broader than just the economic challenge; it also encompassed social and environmental challenges facing Northern Australia in the future. We wanted the task force membership to include experience from a diverse range of interests—not just a bunch of mates who happened to be current politicians, but people who actually had experience and knowledge in areas including business, Indigenous issues, conservation, agriculture, mining and science. So we broadened the expertise and the knowledge on that task force.
We also wanted the task force membership to have a better gender balance—the previous task force of course had no women on it—and where possible to draw on the experience of those who had firsthand experience living and working in Northern Australia. This was about bringing together the best minds, not your best mates, to work in partnership to identify opportunities for sustainable development in the north. We removed the six coalition politicians from the task force and invited other existing members to continue in their role. John Daly from the Northern Land Council was replaced by Wali Wunungmurra from the same organisation, and Noel Pearson was replaced by Richard Ah Mat. We also added the following people: the Chair of the Ord Irrigation Cooperative, Elaine Gardiner; the Chair of the Indigenous Land Corporation, Shirley McPherson; the Executive Director of the Queensland Resources Council, Michael Roche; the Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Dr Rosemary Hill; the eminent Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Charles Darwin University, Professor Bob Wasson; and Northern Territory based environmentalist Dr Stuart Blanch. So there are professors and doctors who actually have expertise in this area. We know the membership has been attacked by those opposite, but we added just one person of Indigenous descent to the task force and two northern based environmentalists.
I know that my colleagues will go on to reveal exactly what this task force uncovered, but they found that there are positive opportunities in Northern Australia across a range of industries. They also found that developing Northern Australia as an integrated, sustainable region presents a complex challenge that requires strategic focus, not gathering your mates together and thinking you can solve the problems of the world without the expertise that is needed. It requires national leadership and close collaboration between all governments involved. It also found that institutional and governance arrangements in the north are not yet strategically focussed to seamlessly manage both land and water across the region.
The task force stressed that the planning and management of land and water resources in Northern Australia must account for Indigenous rights and interests. Unlike my colleagues opposite, this is a document that has brought together the review of the science, has identified where some of the gaps are and has made some suggestions about a way to move forward, about how to particularly identify the potential for future sustainable development. It is a report that is based on knowledge and expertise and that provides us with a much more sound base on which to pursue the sustainable development of Northern Australia than would have occurred under the previous government.
In the time left I also want to draw people’s attention to a book I launched on Monday, called Dry Times: Blueprint for a Red Land. This is another piece of research and documentation that all helps in developing knowledge about and providing assistance to Northern Australia. It is a book about desert Australia, which of course spreads across six states and territories. As we know, desert Australia is 5.5 million square kilometres—three-quarters of the country’s land area. This book was written by Dr Mark Stafford Smith and Mr Julian Cribb. It outlines for people the extremities and the uncertainties. It complements quite nicely the task force report. In fact, on Monday it was suggested that the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report now has a coupling bookend, in a sense, with this desert Australia book launched earlier this week. The two go hand in hand and provide us with long-term sustainable science about how we can move this part of the country forward. Deserts are home to diverse vegetations but they are generally very poor. We do not really understand how to live in this country with its extremes and its variabilities. This book outlines the knowledge of the desert. It goes through what the desert experiences. We know that there are people and animals and vegetation, flora and fauna, that cope with the extremes of the desert day in, day out and month in, month out. This book actually suggests that if we take stock and if we have a look and learn about what is going on in the desert we can apply that nationally.
So I say to my colleagues opposite that the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report is not only about the north; it is also about how we can develop this country for the benefit of everyone. Dry Times: Blueprint for a Red Land provides lessons for the rest of this country about how we can deal with extremes of environment and extremes of climate. Things happen differently in the north of this country, in the deserts and the Top End, right across from Townsville to Broome and from Alice Springs right through to the top. Things do happen differently. But fauna and flora survive. What we have to do is understand why they survive—what do they do that makes them sustainable? That is the science on which we need to base any future sustainable development. You cannot just move into an area of this country and suggest that all the water there can be captured, all of the land can be put to agriculture, and suddenly we can feed the rest of the world. It does not work like that, and it will not work like that. We need to learn from the environment and from there plug the gaps and ensure that we have a comprehensive strategy to move forward. The Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce does this, and the Dry Times book launched on Monday is another response on how we handle the desert.
This government has ensured that sustainable development in Northern Australia is done in a systematic, scientific and routine way based on expert knowledge, collecting the science and the data that is there. This is a blueprint on which we can now move that part of this country forward and ensure that any economic return we have is handled in a sustainable, sensible way. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-24,"—I must admit I was pleasantly surprised when I read the report of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce. It is a balanced report. It is not one that simply goes full steam ahead. You see a lot of these task force reports saying, ‘Yep, it’s a free-for-all.’ It is a well-written, well-considered report that represents a truly refreshing approach. When you read it you realise that the participants in the task force have sat down and truly looked at the facts. They have looked at them given where each other comes from, so you have got the full range of stakeholders involved—as Senator Crossin pointed out—and you can tell that they must have seriously listened to each other and seriously listened to the advice that they were given.
—But not to too many others, though.
—They have represented all the stakeholders, as I will point out again, and they have seriously considered the issues and have put down a structured report that looks at the issues and that looks at the science. They have also put down the basis on which they have done their decision making. They have actually set down a set of principles which guided their decision making and their recommendations. I think that is a refreshing approach. It is certainly different from the approaches in many of the other similar sorts of reports that I have seen in other areas.
What it is saying is we should not make the mistakes of the past. We should not make in the north the mistakes that we have made in the south, given the way that we have developed land and the way that we have developed unsustainably so that we are in the fix that we are in with the Murray-Darling system right now. In this debate Senator Macdonald made a comment that we have got to find a new food bowl because of how the Murray-Darling is and because other places around the world are not going to be able to produce the food needed. The Murray-Darling is in the state that it is in because we have abused that system. It has not been developed in a sustainable manner. We have overused it. We have not planned properly. We have overcommitted the landscape and we have overcommitted the water resources, and that is why it is in the mess it is in now. In the north of Australia we can do things differently.
I really liked the outline that the chair of the task force committee, Joe Ross, gave. He makes comments in the front of the report about the vision that they have put down. They are not saying this is the vision. They are saying it is a vision that the task force had. They are saying the vision could include the elements that they have outlined, which I also think is a good approach. He says:
Our vision for northern Australia is based on mutual respect. Respect for the rights and interests of the Indigenous Peoples of the north. Respect for the environment. Respect for the critical role that land holders have in caring for country. Respect for Indigenous and western knowledge. Respect for the communities of the north and the need to empower them to create opportunities for their own future.
I think that is a very important statement and I was very pleased to see it in the report. But of course certain people are getting upset because it does not say, ‘Right, let’s go full steam ahead, Guys! Let’s develop the north!’
—‘Guys’ being the important word there.
—Exactly. The point is that it is not saying it is the food bowl of the north. It is saying that the potential of Northern Australia to become a food bowl is not supported by the evidence; in other words, there is not unlimited water. There may be a lot of water but it is part of systems. It is not wasted water. It is part of important, beautiful ecosystems. It is part of functioning ecosystems.
The other point as to Northern Australia is that, while we have not had any extinctions in the north of Australia, with some species we may be on the brink. Scientists are saying there are a number of species up there that have had dramatic declines in numbers for reasons they do not know. It could be a changed fire regime. That plays an important part. There could be other issues that are impacting on these species. The fact is we do not know. Despite the fact that the north is not significantly developed, it is being used by the people who own the land and live up there. It might not be being used in the way that some people want but it is being used. But our current land management practices are unfortunately having an impact on the species up there. Australia already has the unenviable record of having the most number of mammalian species that have become extinct. Do we want to keep adding to that? Do we want to keep adding to the loss of biodiversity that we have generated in the south?
—A minute ago you said it was okay.
—Senator Macdonald, I sat here and listened to you without interrupting you, even though I passionately disagreed with you. I would appreciate it if you would do the same for me.
—Sorry.
—Thank you. The point here is that our current land management practices are also already having an impact on the environment. We already know that many species could be on the brink. We need to investigate that issue. The report points out that we could increase our water use by 100 to 200 per cent—it does say that—but when you look at how much water is being used up there you see there is very little water being used. There is a capacity to increase agriculture from 20,000 to 40,000 hectares, which I acknowledge is a relatively small amount. It points out that the water is not necessarily available where some of the best land is available and it also points out that we should be looking at a mosaic style agriculture that has a reduced impact.
There are things in this report that I have to admit I do not agree with. I am a bit nervous about the issues around changing land tenure until we have some of the other issues sorted out. I am a bit nervous about their recommendations about continuing extensive grazing, if that is not done in a sustainable manner. We already know that some grazing in the north has had an impact on the environment. It is linked to changed fire management practices. It is linked to introduced pastures that can become weeds. But I think that, given the overall direction of the report, it is worth supporting. The point that people are nervous about is the fact that, as I said, it is not going full steam ahead. It is not going to be the food bowl of Australia, or of the world for that matter. But carefully managed it will.
A very important point as to this report is the absolutely essential role of the Aboriginal Australians who live in and own this country, so there is the need for them to be at the heart of decision making and to get the benefits of any development in the north. They absolutely need to be. The report makes that very clear, and I strongly support that element of the report. It clearly points out the constraints as to the way we should be developing the north of Australia. But I will go back to the point that this is a blueprint with a suggested vision and it is now up to the government to implement the recommendations and to support communities of the north to develop their own vision based on the set of principles that are articulated in this report, which I think are very sound. I think the recommendations are very worthwhile and worthy of support. I urge the government to take them up and to take on the challenge that this report sets out, because it is different, because it is saying we need to take a different approach and because it is saying we can avoid the mistakes of the past. But that actually requires the government to be very brave in the face of a whole lot of development pressures that say: ‘Ignore the science. Why you would want to pay attention to the science?’ We have ignored the science in the past and look where we have ended up with the landscape of Southern Australia, where we are having to spend billions and billions of dollars to repair that landscape.
We will never get back the ecosystems that have been damaged or the species that have become extinct. Unfortunately, there are threatened species that continue to edge towards extinction. We do not want to repeat this in the north. We can learn. This is 2010. We have moved into a new century. We should be managing that land in a different way. But if you listen to the voices of the past we will end up with the same mistakes of the past. We will alienate our Aboriginal community. We will send species into extinction. We will have a massive land repair job on our hands. I have not even got to the point about the impact climate change is going to have on the north of Australia. It will change those ecosystems. It will bring climate variation. If you look at the projections for the impact of climate change on agriculture in the north of Australia, you will see there will be a significant impact. We need to learn from the mistakes of the past. We need to do things differently.
This report confronts those challenges head on and says that there is a different way of doing it. Please, Australia, listen to it. Please let us do things differently. Let us support these recommendations and see how we can truly learn from the past and work with Aboriginal Australians to have a different future for Northern Australia. It will develop, but it should develop sustainably. This report clearly outlines there is a future for the people living in the north. It is not the traditional view that some people like to see, where you send in the bulldozers, clear the land and put in more and more agriculture and use all the resources without consideration for the future and without consideration for the science or the ecosystems. This report says: do it differently. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this matter of public importance debate. To talk about the sustainable development of Northern Australia is an exciting opportunity for all of us in this chamber. I am looking forward to the contribution from my esteemed Western Australian colleague Senator Eggleston who, like my good self, had a long working history in the north. I delivered furniture, he delivered babies, but both very honourable vocations.
I was not here for Senator Macdonald’s contribution and, if he wants to extend the same courtesy of disappearing out of the chamber while I make mine, I would welcome that. On that note, I think it is a little bit rich of the opposition to attack the Rudd government. The words used in the matter of public importance are:
The Rudd Labor Government’s continued failure to meet the development needs of Northern Australia preventing the region from advancing.
 It is quite mischievous. I might be wrong—and I am sure other senators can correct the record for themselves—but a lot of this has stemmed from the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report. What it boils down to is that the make-up of the task force was significantly changed when the Labor government took office after November 2007. Gary Gray, the Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia, said that the opposition did not like it because the politicians were removed from the task force. I do not have a problem with that at all. If we look at the make-up of the politicians who were on that task force, two of them are no longer members of parliament anyway. One is from the Northern Territory and one is from Queensland. But what is wrong with saying to Australia, ‘We want to know what is going on’? What is wrong with asking the stakeholders, the people involved, in that part of the world? I am not saying that some of the members of this task force, the previous Liberal members, were not part of the north. There were one or two who lived in the north—there is no argument about that. I do not live in the north, but I made my living running through the north, as did Senator Eggleston. I have a passion for the north and I have a passion for the north of Western Australia.
On that note, let me give the Senate a few figures. I was in Kununurra in July last year. The Prime Minister was also there for a couple of days with Gary Gray, the Liberal Western Australian Premier, Mr Barnett, and the Minister for Regional Development, Brendon Grylls. The federal government announced a package of $195 million for injection into the Top End, the East Kimberley, which predominantly takes in the two towns of Kununurra and Wyndham. That package was warmly and gratefully received by the people of Kununurra, and so it should be. On saying that, the state government committed a heck of a lot of money to that part of the world—I think some $220 million—because everyone recognises that to achieve outcomes for Australia we have to work together. It is very easy to sit on the other side of the chamber and throw darts and arrows at every decision that is made, but I do not think for one minute that that lot over the other side have the right to bag the Rudd government for the efforts it has made in the East Kimberley hand in hand with the state government.
In that part of the world, $50 million is being flagged for health. We all hear about, talk about and read about the health conditions of our Indigenous Australians and about the gap. No-one would argue that $50 million is no small amount of money. It is a start. There is a long way to go, but at least the Rudd government is starting. That $50 million is broken up into a couple of projects. One of significant importance is $20 million for the Kununurra hospital expansion. I welcome that. I have had to visit the Kununurra Hospital. I know it upsets a few on that side, but I came through all right. They do a fantastic job, but they need more money up there because it is a gateway to the great state of Western Australia, especially if you are coming from Darwin in the Northern Territory. There are some 17 or 18 health initiatives going on up there. Another major contribution from the Commonwealth government to that part of the world is around $50 million in housing. We know the problems with housing and we have a long way to go. Senator Evans said in this chamber last year in a debate on Aboriginal housing, ‘Quite frankly, none of us have got it right. No-one can stand up and brag about how well we have done. It is time to work together and start fixing that.’ That is what we are doing.
Of the $50 million, $30 million is going into social housing in Kununurra and Wyndham and the other $20 million is going into transition housing in Kununurra and other locations. There is $15 million going into transport, $10 million of which is going into the Wyndham port facility upgrade. That is fantastic. I have an affiliation with Wyndham. Unfortunately it is not a happy one, because a mate of mine was taken by a crocodile up there. But it is great to see that Wyndham is also on the receiving end of this money. Wyndham has always been the poor cousin of the two towns up there. Into the community is going $16 million for a wonderful array of initiatives.
What we are seeing is that we have a long way to go. It is very mischievous of the opposition to use the report of the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce to attack the Rudd government, which has done far more in such a short time for that part of the world than the previous government did. There is no argument about that. I was in Kununurra last Monday, and I had the fortune to sit with the shire president, Mr Mills. He made it very clear to me, on behalf of the community of Kununurra, that they were very relaxed and very happy with the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report. There were no spears at dawn. One would think, from listening to the opposition, that the whole of Northern Australia has been badly let down. The Rudd Labor government has done much, much more than was done in 12 years of the Howard government.
The opposition should just come clean. If you want to use this as a political football, at least have the guts to stand up in front of us and tell us it is a political football. But you bag everyone. You bagged the make-up of the task force and you sooked because the politicians were removed—very childish. I have heard some scurrilous comments about the make-up of the task force. If I were one of the task force, I would not even waste my oxygen talking to some of the members of the opposition. To make comments degrading the credibility of the task force is absolutely nothing short of disgraceful. But we will not be deflected by petty arguments from the opposition. We have got a job to do. We have been elected to do that job. We will do that job. Not only that; we are coming through one of the worst financial crises in our history— (Time expired)  ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-02-24,"—I rise to speak on a matter of great public importance: the continued failure of the Rudd government in setting the pace for the development of Northern Australia. I am sad that Senator Crossin has left the chamber. I know that she is involved with other things, but she did ask us what we have done. I would have thought that, as a Territorian, she might have noticed that, whenever she turns left on her way out of Darwin, she hits this funny thing called a railway line, built by Shane Stone and John Howard. And, anytime she is sneaking around the waterfront, she might have noticed the port, which is now a fundamental piece of infrastructure that is the backbone of the pastoral industry of Northern Australia and has allowed us access to markets to make it viable. I thought she might have actually noticed some of those things and perhaps given credit to the previous government for its wonderful work.
I have read the grand vision in the report of the Northern Australia Land And Water Taskforce. Senator Sterle said that it was only the vision of the people in the task force. Well, it probably set the pace and the tone for the remainder of the report. I always commend my very good friend Senator Siewert for her comments, but, when the Greens start to support this sort of process—a coalition of lethargy and inaction—we have all got to be really concerned. I live in Northern Australia. To those people who want to lock it up and leave it because it all seems too hard or who say that we have to proceed with caution, I say that that is not in anybody’s interest, particularly the interest of those who live in the north. The vision in the report is probably correct in a couple of ways. It is probably quite likely that 50 per cent of the people who live in Northern Australia will be Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, and that will be a fantastic thing.
I had this little mind bubble, when Senator Conroy was here, about the rollout of the NBN. If you are in a community of less than a thousand people, you are not going to be able to have any telecommunications. This is central infrastructure for Northern Australia, but, if you want to count all the towns with under a thousand people, you will find a lot of them in Northern Australia. That is where they belong. So the words of those opposite seem to be completely different from their actions.
I have read very carefully through many aspects of this report, particularly the vision, and it does seem to be condemning our First Australians—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians—to a very bleak future. Anybody who reads this report, having lived in Northern Australia, would say it is very negative. As my two fine colleagues Senator Macdonald and Senator Eggleston—and I thank Senator Macdonald for his fine contribution—would know, it is tough in Northern Australia. It is hot, it is further away from anything, the roads are bloody rubbish, it is harder to find people and the towns are smaller. It has always been harder. We do not expect it to be too much different, but it has got to be tied together with the aspirations of the rest of Australia. Because of that tough environment, Territorians and people from Western Australia and Queensland are tough. We are pioneers. This report is a complete slap in the face to anybody who lives in Northern Australia because it condemns them to a future of: ‘Just hang on a minute. Let’s not rush it. We’ll just leave it all on its own.’ It will be like some sort of zoo, where you have a little look around while moving across the countryside.
Somehow we—particularly the First Australians—are going to make money out of carbon trading. That seems to be one of the fundamentals of this report. The carbon trading process is very vague in here, but apparently it is going to be a lot to do with controlling and dealing with the savanna landscapes. I am quite sure that that will be a part of the future in terms of management of biodiversity. But this report effectively condemns Northern Australians to just being some sort of accelerated park managers who very vaguely deal with some sort of biodiversity management that is funded overseas by some carbon credits. I am not really sure—the report did not go into it in any great detail. It is a complete shock.
I will read an extract that characterises the approach of the report. This is with regard to the international significance of cultural landscapes:
Communities, landholders and governments now work together to conserve Indigenous protected areas, national parks, private wildlife sanctuaries, areas under conservation covenants, World Heritage sites and wetlands listed under the Ramsar Convention. Enhanced efforts in natural resource and biodiversity management have reversed the decline of small mammals—
have stopped them going out the door. The report continues:
An ecosystem services economy based on payments for ongoing management of biodiversity is now a mainstream part of the regional economy.
And the last line says that a third of the north of Australia is now going to be within a national reserve system. Well, that is a place where I know many of my Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friends do not want to live. If that is the only opportunity that we are condemning them to then the report has got it completely and utterly wrong. What is wrong with Indigenous Australians having the same opportunities? Why is it that they could not possibly run a pastoral property sustainably?
—They can.
—I will take the interjection from Senator McLucas. No doubt she enjoys the next paragraph that will ensure that we enable the ‘destocking of marginal pastoral land’. You wouldn’t want to get too far west of the divide to see a lot of sad people in that regard. Again, there is a condemning of our First Australians to absolutely no opportunity—and this I think is absolutely and utterly reprehensible. It is a little bit like saying that this vision is like a national park. Unfortunately, we have now had the report recommending that the First Australians join them. They will be cuddling trees and doing something weird—I’m not sure what—with carbon credits but the vision is not of them actually enjoying the remainder of the opportunities the Australian economy can provide.
Why have we got a different approach? Are we asking the rest of Australia down south, ‘Just cuddle a few trees; just be a bit green. Manage the ecosystem,’ and everything will be right? I can tell you that any economy that is completely dependent on some rubbish idea that you can be sustainable into the future on some sort of carbon credit system and that you can somehow manage the environment while somebody—I don’t know where—is going to pay everybody to do that, is relying on absolute and utter nonsense. I condemn this report and I warn people to look very carefully at it, because if this nation is going down a line which says, ‘Aboriginal people can own land but they can’t use it,’ I think it is a step in completely the wrong direction.
Senator McLucas is from Queensland. The Queensland government has already decided to go and take away the rights of people to use their land correctly under the Wild Rivers Act, and we will be very active to ensure that their rights to use their own land are returned to them.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—I am happy to take your interjections, Senator McLucas, all day. We should look very carefully at this report and treat it with a deal of caution because it does not treat our First Australians with the same rights afforded to the remainder of the landholders in Australia. That is why it cannot be supported. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-02-24,"—I am also pleased to join this debate, for two reasons. Firstly to commend the report—a balanced, sensible report that has been handed down to the people of Northern Australia by a balanced and sensible group of people who have looked at the science and the aspirations of northern Australians and come up with a set of 15 sensible recommendations that will take us forward.
But in commending the report I also rise to defend the membership of the committee that has been put together by our government. Let’s remember, Senators, that this committee was the committee that was established under Senator Heffernan and which included only the Liberal and National Party politicians of Northern Australia. There were no Labor people and no people from the Greens. They came up with this wonderful suggestion that the only group of people who would have any knowledge of the aspirations of northern Australians had to be Liberal and National Party members of parliament. It was the biggest political stack I have seen in my life. Thank goodness we had the opportunity to pull those senators and members off the committee and give it some balance so that it had a way forward.
I noticed that Senator Macdonald, in his contribution today, took the opportunity again to denigrate the membership of the committee. He has made wild assertions in this place and also in the media in North Queensland, about the expertise and the motivations of the membership. I notice that he was a little less vitriolic here in the chamber than he was in the North Queensland press recently, and that suggests to me that he was playing to his audience.
It also suggests to me that there are a number of members of the committee who had to go into print to defend themselves against his vitriol, his bias and his—

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—I will get to that. He has offended many people who gave of their time to make sensible, realistic recommendations about Northern Australia to the committee. In the press in North Queensland, Senator Macdonald said that the government was ‘pandering to a green agenda’, that the report was a ‘series of motherhood statements and bureaucratic recommendations’, and that the task force was ‘clearly captured by the radical green element’. He said:
The report is lightweight with a political focus towards green and indigenous issues.
So there is a bit of a contradiction between Senator Scullion’s point and what Senator Macdonald has said in the North Queensland media. That warranted a letter to the editor in the Townsville Bulletin and an opinion piece in the Cairns Post which was entitled ‘Debate report instead of name calling’. The letter of the week was by Michael Roche, Queensland Resources Council—hardly a person that you could say was captured by the radical green element. Michael Roche is well respected for his knowledge of the mining sector, as are a range of people who we put in the task force, including Elaine Gardiner, Shirley McPherson, Dr Rosemary Hill, Stuart Blanch and Professor Bob Wasson. Let’s remember that the committee also includes Terry Underwood, who is a grazier; David Crombie; David Baffsky; Lachlan Murdoch, Richie Ah Mat, Walynbuma Wunungmurra—I apologise for the mispronunciation of your name—Mr Joe Ross and Andrew Johnson from CSIRO. This is not what you would call a painted green task force.
Let us go to what Mr Roche had to put into print to defend himself against Senator Macdonald’s name calling.
—I did not see this. You will have to send it to me.
—Happily; I will table it. I will seek leave to table this document at the end of my speech. He said—and this is only in part:
There appears to be a premeditated effort underway to destroy the credibility of the report by attacking the task force’s bona fides and credentials.
He goes on to say:
The task force includes three members with impeccable Northern Australian agricultural credentials, including the President of the National Farmers Federation, a tourism industry leader, the head of CSIRO’s Land and Water Research Group, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Charles Darwin University as well as eminent conservationists and Indigenous leaders from Northern Australia.
These are the people whom Senator Macdonald and Senator Scullion are attacking. These are the people who have given their time to provide us in Northern Australia with a blueprint for the way forward. Mr Roche goes on:
The task force did not contain bureaucrats and neither did they write the report, which was a collective effort by task force members.
He then says:
Instead of massively misrepresenting the credentials of the task force, let’s have a discussion about our findings and recommendations and around our reliance on the best available scientific evidence rather than name calling and slogans.
That is what Mr Roche had to put into press in the Townsville paper, which Senator Macdonald reckons he did not see—and I am surprised at that—and also in the Cairns Post. Instead of playing the man, let us talk about what is in the report. Let us talk about what other people said about the report. David Crombie, from the National Farmers Federation, said:
I don’t think anybody expected we were going to be transferring the Murray Darling food production system to northern Australia.
I disagree with him slightly there; I think that Senator Heffernan did. He goes on to say:
There are opportunities for greater intensification of agriculture, there’s opportunities for more integrated development in the livestock sector, there are opportunities for pastoralists and lease holders, and there are opportunities for indigenous communities.
This brings me to the point that Senator Scullion was making. I do not think Senator Scullion has read this report—I am sure he has not—because if he had he would have come to a very similar conclusion, I imagine, as David Crombie from the National Farmers Federation. As Mr Crombie says, there are opportunities identified in the report for an increase in agricultural production, for an increase in a whole range of economic activities that all of us in Northern Australia have the opportunity to partake in, particularly—and this is a very strong focus of the report—Indigenous people. I also want to go to Rachel Mackenzie from Growcom. I think her words are very informative:
It was time southern Australia gave up fanciful notions that horticulture could be simply moved holus bolus from areas such as the Murray Darling Irrigation Basin to northern Australia. Growcom supports the development and expansion of horticultural crops suitable for the climatic conditions and soils in northern Australia and wherever else in Australia that suitable climatic conditions have been shown to exist.
It rains a lot in Queensland and Northern Australia, but it is a very short season. It rains a lot, but it is pretty close to the coast where you cannot dam, and it is also a long way from market. Let us be a bit honest with the people of Northern Australia. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,20,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2010-02-24,"—The Rudd government has shown no understanding that the north of Australia has enormous potential or, it seems, no commitment to realising that potential. The recent Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce report was disappointing, because it seems to me its recommendations were focused on preserving the past instead of focused on the future and the opportunities that were offered. The potential of the north is enormous. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s I attended north Australia development conferences that highlighted the fantastic potential for development in Northern Australia not only in agriculture but also in many other fields, including tourism, mining and aquaculture, which would create jobs and realise the potential of the north.
To be fair, the task force was severely constrained by the terms of reference given to it by the Rudd government, which were mostly about land and water. But even in agriculture this report is far from visionary. Notwithstanding the great success of the Ord River project, which was funded by the federal coalition under Prime Minister Menzies and which is now being extended at a cost of over $200 million, thanks to the Barnett government in Western Australia, the task force report claims that the potential for irrigated agriculture is limited because there are only four potential new dam sites across Northern Australia. But, as Senator Siewert pointed out, a lot of arable land was identified away from these rivers and dam sites. And, of course, agriculture does not have to be limited to the area’s surrounding dams, because water can be piped across long distances to facilitate development. For example, Libya has a network of pipes large enough to drive trucks through to transport water 1,000 kilometres from aquifers inland to provide water for irrigated agriculture on the Mediterranean coast. I can see no reason why this could not be done in Northern Australia to provide water for irrigated agriculture in many locations across the north. All that is needed is the vision, and the vision, it seems, is not there.
As I said, from my experience I am aware that there is enormous potential for economic development in areas not mentioned by the Northern Land and Water Taskforce report and apparently not in consideration by the Rudd government. For example, great opportunities exist in areas as diverse as fishing and aquaculture, from prawn and fish farms to cultured pearls, as well as in tourism and in the resources sector. In tourism, people look to go to areas that are unique and different. For example, Germans and other Europeans flock in their thousands to Africa to see what is different about Africa. The things that are unique and different about Australia are mostly to be found in the north. But has the Rudd government charged Tourism Australia to shift its focus to Northern Australia? The answer is no, in spite of falling inbound tourism figures to Australia from countries like Japan.
Clearly, the mining industry offers enormous potential in the north, but there is a need to upgrade infrastructure, such as roads and ports, to facilitate such development. However, this kind of infrastructure was not included in the Rudd government’s stimulus program. When I attended the Riding the Boom conference in the Pilbara a couple of years ago the parliamentary secretary, Gary Gray, when confronted by local residents who called for improvements in community infrastructure to match the vast wealth coming out of the Pilbara coast, told them they were all ‘whingers’. That is rather disappointing and shows no feeling for or understanding of the needs of the people in that area.
I am disappointed that the Rudd government has made no real commitment to expanding Indigenous employment opportunities, given the well-known plight of Aborigines in the north. We have all heard sad stories of drug and alcohol addition, and physical and sexual abuse, in Indigenous communities. It is generally agreed that the root cause of most of the problems for Indigenous people is that they have no hope in their lives—their tribal culture has been distorted and they have not found a way into the world of mainstream, modern Australia. What is needed is to find jobs for Indigenous people so that the poisonous cycle of welfare dependence and hopelessness is ended and replaced with Indigenous people having a sense of dignity and purpose in their lives, coming from having a job and a regular income.
Some years ago the mining industry committed itself to increasing Indigenous employment and training. Companies such as Rio Tinto have achieved outstanding success, with 25 per cent of the workforce at the Argyle diamond mine being Indigenous. But there are still 4,000 unemployed young Aborigines in the East Kimberley alone, and one must ask why the Rudd government has not sought solutions to this situation. The proposed Price Point LNG plant, on 25 kilometres of land just north of Broome, is another project that offers the potential for Indigenous employment, but the press is carrying stories that the Rudd government may not give the project the go-ahead. One must wonder who the Rudd government is listening to. Is it the traditional owners, who have supported the Price Point project because of the benefits it will bring to local Indigenous people? Or is it those living on the east coast who do not want to have any progress or development in the north—people such as Murray Wilcox QC, whose recent photographic book on the Kimberley completely misrepresented the impact of the Price Point— (Time expired)

SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS
TABLING STATEMENT
24 February 2010
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 2 of 2010 and Second Report of 2010, I draw the Senate’s attention to some provisions of the Corporations Amendment (Financial Market Supervision) Bill 2010 and of the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010.
The Corporations Amendment (Financial Market Supervision) Bill 2010 will implement a significant change in the supervision of financial markets by providing that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission will undertake this role.
Proposed section 798G will allow ASIC to make market integrity rules. These rules can deal with a wide range of circumstances relating to the activities or conduct of licensed markets and associated people and financial products. A market integrity rule can only be made by legislative instrument with the written consent of the Minister. A market integrity rule may include a penalty up to $1 million.
The explanatory memorandum states that the regime is designed to allow ASIC to make rules to cover new and emerging issues as markets change and that the potential to impose a penalty ranging up to $1 million is appropriate as this reflects the broad range of matters which the market integrity rules are expected to cover.
The Committee acknowledges the reasons outlined in the explanatory memorandum for this approach, but usually prefers that matters of this significance would be identified in more detail in the primary legislation.
The Committee leaves to the Senate as a whole the question of whether it is appropriate for ASIC to be given such a broad ability to make market integrity rules.
However, the Committee considers that the power to make market integrity rules could be supplemented by including in the primary legislation some general minimum requirements or a framework for the content of these rules. For example, without unduly constraining ASIC’s ability to make market integrity rules the bill could include requirements for any such rule to specify its purpose, to whom it applies, to detail the conduct the subject of the rule, to explain if fault is required and to ensure that any penalty is adequate and appropriate.
The Committee has sought the Minister’s advice on whether this type of approach might be considered.
The Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 also seeks to introduce a significant change by implementing a national system to assign healthcare identifiers for consumers and providers.
Proposed subsection 9(1) will authorise a service provider to assign a number to a healthcare provider or recipient and proposed subsection 9(4) provides that the service operator is ‘not required to consider’ whether the provider or recipient agrees.
The bill also includes provisions authorising parties to disclose healthcare identifiers between parties in some circumstances.
The Committee recognises that the bill is implementing a clear policy decision and leaves to the Senate as a whole the question of whether these provisions unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties.
The Committee also has questions about whether the bill should provide the ability to review a decision under subclause 9(1) to assign an identifier and about the rationale for delegating, without providing a justification in the explanatory memorandum, the ability for regulations to impose a penalty of up to 50 penalty units for contravention of a regulation.
The Committee has sought the Minister’s advice about these provisions.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2010-02-24,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 55th annual session of the NATO parliamentary assembly, Edinburgh, which took place from 14 to 17 November 2009.
I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will speak briefly to the report. I was very pleased and delighted to participate in this delegation to NATO. This assembly comprised the NATO member countries and a number of invited and other participating delegates from associate countries. This delegation and this conference was a very important one, given our participation in ISAF in Afghanistan. The fact that we have between 1,300 and 1,500 combat troops in Tarin Kowt conducting and participating in the war on terror is a very significant thing for a country the size of Australia.
The NATO countries, numbering some 28, gather through their parliamentary representatives to consider and discuss various aspects of NATO’s functions. We as a delegation attended NATO headquarters in Belgium. Then we went across the channel to Edinburgh. There were many people who helped the delegation. His Excellency Dr Alan Thomas, the Australian Ambassador to the European Community, Belgium and Luxembourg, was very forthcoming with a great deal of advice and assistance. The mission generally provided a lot of help to what I believe is a very important part of parliamentary life in Australia, particularly while we have troops fighting in Afghanistan.
I pause to say that Colonel Michael Toohey, who is the Defence Attache to the European Community, Belgium and Luxembourg, assisted the delegation very greatly. He is a very fine Australian military officer. Upon getting off the aircraft in Belgium, to see an Australian uniform with a beautiful bright plume on a slouch hat was an absolute delight and a credit to the Royal Australian Army and to Colonel Toohey. He assisted us on our visits to a number of very important war graves, Tyne Cot and many others. He gave us thorough briefings on and the backgrounds to what had happened. We were in the very famous town of Ypres in Belgium on 11 November, which is Remembrance Day, and we participated in the services there commemorating what was a very significant historical event in Australia’s military history in Belgium in World War I.
I thank my parliamentary colleagues the Hon. Arch Bevis, the member for Brisbane; the Hon. Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen; Senator Mark Bishop, from my home state of Western Australia; and Mr Richard Selth. It was a very convivial group of people. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. The experience is very well documented in the report and sets out that the conference—particularly considering that we did meet the Dutch parliamentarians, and we are partnered with the Dutch in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan—was a most useful and beneficial one to attend. I believe that Australia should participate, particularly considering that not only are we involved in Afghanistan but also from time to time participate in taskforce 151, which is an antipiracy taskforce in the Gulf and adjacent to Somalia. We should give great consideration to attending this conference, if only with observer status, into the future, given our participation in these two engagements. The Senate should take note of what I think is quite a significant report from an important delegation.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-24,"—On behalf of the coalition, I move:
That—
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and 10 related bills be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 11 May 2010.
In undertaking the inquiry, the committee should consider.
the package of amendments announced by the Government on 24 November 2009 and incorporated in current proposed legislation, including the impact of the bills on the Australian resources sector, Australian exports, the competitiveness of Australian industry, employment levels and electricity prices;
the modelling underpinning the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) including the lower projected carbon price and the cost of the CPRS package over the current budget period to 2014-15;
the outcome of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in December 2009;
the current state of progress of other countries in implementing emissions and abatement measures to meet non-binding emissions reduction targets; and
the status of, and likely prospects for, the United States of America’s emissions trading legislation.
The committee should seek evidence from, but not limited to, the Productivity Commission, Frontier Economics, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Coal Association and the Energy Supply Association of Australia.
In moving this motion, the coalition strongly believes that there is a need for these measures to be fully examined. That is the historical role of the Senate, and it has done so, if I might say, exceptionally well. Even when the blood rushed on the very rare occasion to the Howard government head and we did not want Senate inquiries into legislation, it was amazing when the Senate did so vote how certain things were exposed to us which made us say quietly behind our hand, ‘Thank goodness for that Senate inquiry because it did expose a few things that had not been taken to account.’ Those of us who have been here a few years know the importance of Senate committee inquiries and the great benefit that they provide. I trust that there is no honourable senator in this place who thinks that the probing, the testing and the inquiring by Senate committees of proposals is something that should be rejected out of hand. I hope we all support that. Indeed, we have a Prime Minister who allegedly supports evidence based policy.
The bill that we are seeking to submit to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, very interestingly—if people listened closely they would have heard this in the title—is the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and the related bills. This is new legislation. This is different legislation to that which we have debated in the past. What it seeks to do, and I think quite appropriately, is incorporate a lot of the amendments that the Senate wanted passed last time around.
What do those changes involve? They involve a significant change to the CPRS, the big new tax on everything, of $114 billion. This is a huge scheme, the most significant scheme ever sought to be legislated by a Commonwealth government. This is a massive issue, whether you like a CPRS or you do not like it. In a bid to try to get Senate support, Labor moved a host of amendments. Those amendments have never really been fully tested, fully exposed, fully considered by a Senate inquiry. The differences in the packages and how the money is spread around are at the thousand-plus million dollar mark. This is a lot of money. The compensation being paid to families changed in this legislation.
Can I just stop on that one. We remember the debacle of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, when we asked him about the compensation scheme under this legislation, so cockily telling us: 92 per cent of Australian families would be compensated—and how dare we as an opposition ask questions like this because it was all debated previously and we should know and we should be ashamed of ourselves. Two days later the Leader of the Government in the Senate was in this place and, like Labor always do—they can never apologise and say they got something wrong—he said he ‘misspoke’. The 92 per cent figure, if I recall, evaporated down to about 51 per cent of families getting full compensation. Even the Leader of the Government in the Senate does not fully understand the legislation and the compensation package.
Also, there are huge changes in relation to the power-generating sector, which is very important. Mr Rudd told the Australian people that there would be an increase in power prices, but when we asked for the modelling and all of the detail we were not given it. When Mr Rudd is asked how this new scheme, this different scheme, would impact on the cost of a loaf of bread or a litre of milk, he cannot tell us. I think the people of Australia want answers, and we are entitled to explore those issues courtesy of a Senate inquiry. We as a coalition are proposing that the inquiry take 2½ months and report on 11 May 2010. A scheme of this magnitude and one which has had wholesale changes now made to it I think is worthy of an inquiry of that length. It is not very long, given the significant nature of the package we are dealing with.
At the time of the last election this issue was described as the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’. That was said 22 times during the last election campaign, yet in the Australia Day speeches by the Prime Minister it was not mentioned at all. The government itself has shunted this legislation down its list of priorities. It is no longer the greatest moral challenge of our time. Indeed, according to the government’s own agenda in this place, the greatest moral challenge that it faces is breaking an election promise on private health insurance. But I am distracting myself from the main argument.
This legislation will come into force on 1 January 2011. If all the evidence comes back that everything is hunky-dory and good then the Senate can consider and explore these issues further in debate and the legislation can still be put in place, one would assume, by 2011, so there is no rush for this legislation. Indeed, the Labor Party itself changed the commencement date from 2010 to 2011. It did that of its own volition. The nauseatingly moralising Prime Minister, who just talks and talks, and who said that this was the greatest moral challenge of our time, all of a sudden has said that it is that great a moral challenge that we can just defer consideration and implementation for 12 months. We are not changing the commencement date; all we are doing is saying let us have a look at the detail of this legislation.
This legislation has had a lot of precursors. There was the exposure draft by Senator Wong, then Mr Combet was called in to bring in a completely different bill, then there were the substantial amendments at the end of last year and now we have a newly drafted bill. Underpinning all of those manifestations of the legislation were certain propositions, certain givens, that we were told the modelling was based on and, of course, the greatest of those was that there would be world action at Copenhagen, that the world would come together. That was one of the underlying principles of the modelling and the considerations. We now know why the Prime Minister felt so at home at Copenhagen—it was a talkfest with no action. It was all talk and no action—that is why the Prime Minister revelled in it, loved it and identified with it. Now that we know that there is no world action, one of the supporting pillars of this legislation has been taken out, because of the consequences for Australian jobs, Australian industry and the security of Australian power supplies.
Another underpinning was that carbon capture and storage would be commercially viable by the year 2020. I genuinely hope it is, but a lot of the advice I am getting is that, as we move closer to the year 2020 and since those pronouncements were made about two years ago, people are now questioning whether it will become commercially viable. I think it is appropriate that we explore that.
Another underpinning of the so-called modelling—the bits and pieces we did get and we were told about—was what the Australian population was going to be by the year 2050. Within 12 months, from the first introduction of the legislation until the end of last year, that figure changed considerably—by millions of people. If I recall, it was by either two or three million people. When you are dealing with a population of only about 21 million, that is 10 per cent. That is a huge discrepancy.
Why can’t we be told what the outcome would be if the new figures were imported into the modelling? What would be the pressures on our power generators to provide the electricity to these people? What would be the pressures on our community in providing all the community services that those extra two or three million people would anticipate to be their birthrights? There would be a huge impact on our carbon emissions. There is no doubt about that. We as a Senate are entitled to know the answers to those sorts of questions. I could go on at some length about the modelling and what is underpinning it, which the government has sought to sell to the Australian people, but these are just some examples of what we on this side of the chamber believe needs to be explored.
I know that there are also some who would say that the science may well have shifted in recent times. In this religiously defined debate, I have declared myself—also in religious terms—an agnostic and I will not enter into the science of the debate, other than to say I have noted that some of the IPCC considerations are now being modulated or remodelled. But I will not go there, because our motion does not seek to re-explore the science, despite the huge embarrassment I think the University of East Anglia is in, as well as a few other institutions and people. As far as we are concerned, that is to the side. We believe that there are matters of graver importance to be considered. Let us make no mistake: this would be a massive, big new tax on everything. It would impact every man, woman and child in Australia today and every man, woman and child in Australia for generations to come.
One of the reasons we need to explore the documentation that the government has given us is that new information has come to light—substantially new information. For example, the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, IPART, have said that electricity prices will rise by up to 62 per cent over the next three years, a third of which will be as a result of Mr Rudd’s big new tax on everything. Now, why would the New South Wales state government allow that information to get into the public domain? Because they dispute Mr Rudd’s modelling in relation to electricity prices. Let us make no mistake about that. IPART are an independent body; I am sure they did not leak it. They provided their report to the New South Wales Labor government and, magically, it appeared in the media. I wonder how that occurred! New South Wales state Labor do not trust Mr Rudd’s modelling. There is similar information for Victoria. There is the Morgan Stanley report on the impact of the so-called CPRS, this big new tax on everything, about how it would impact and devastate the power-generating capacity in Victoria. That report—or the snippets we have got from it, because federal Labor refuse to release it although it is within their power to release it; deliberately they refuse to release it—indicates that Victorians would suffer a similar increase in electricity prices as people in New South Wales, once again debunking the modelling by the federal Labor government.
What is clear is that, as the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—this big new tax on everything—has progressed, more and more holes have been found in the Labor government’s arguments, underpinnings and modelling, as a result of which their CPRS Bill is significantly different to their draft exposure and then bill of 2009, because of course now we have the 2010 version. So this has been through three manifestations, and this third manifestation is worthy of a very considered and detailed inquiry. In addition, although this would in rough terms be a 2½-month enquiry, the only time that the parliament would be denied consideration of the bill would be the next sitting fortnight of the Senate—only two weeks—because the report would be ready for the Senate on 11 May, which I understand is budget week. So the actual delay in considering the legislation is only two weeks from the point of view of parliament. When you are considering a document that would submit Australia to a $114 billion big new tax on everything, I think it is worthy of inquiry.
I also say in relation to the failure of Copenhagen—and what a dismal failure it was; a big talkfest, with 114 people from Australia over there, those that the Prime Minister loves, but no world action—that if we go ahead with this suggestion we will in fact contribute to a worse world environmental outcome. Allow me to explain: through carbon leakage, the world would be worse off. In my home state of Tasmania we have a Nyrstar zinc works, as does Senator Farrell in Port Pirie—and Senator Wong. They produce one tonne of zinc for roughly two tonnes of CO2, which is pretty clean in comparison to the rest of the world. China does it for six tonnes of CO2 per tonne of zinc produced. If we price ourselves out of the world market, people will not be buying clean, Australian zinc; they will be buying polluting, Chinese zinc, and as a result the world’s carbon emissions will be even greater. That is the perverse outcome of Mr Rudd’s ill thought out scheme. It is the reason that we in the coalition believe that there is a very real need for a lot of these issues to be tested, especially the huge movement as a result of the failure of Copenhagen. President Obama himself seems to be walking away from an emissions trading scheme. Canada said, ‘If the US are in, we’re in and we’ll adopt their system.’ That is no longer so. The US is walking away; therefore, Canada is walking away. And so it is unravelling around the world.
Just for the record, we as a coalition believe in a no regrets policy in this space, and that is why Mr Abbott has provided a very exciting direct action plan to deal with these issues without the need for a $114 billion big new tax on everything which would devastate jobs, devastate our economy and devastate electricity supplies around our nation. So I say to all honourable senators, irrespective of your views—whether your predisposition is to support or oppose this legislation, whether or not you believe in the science, whether or not you believe the modelling is up to scratch—these are all issues worthy of consideration, and I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,30,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-24,"—Senator Abetz is very, very kind about how the Australian people view the ETS. It has been one of the greatest political debacles of all time, the major plank of Labor Party policy and the moral issue of our time, apparently. We see now the sort of logic, acumen and diligence that goes into these Labor Party plans, and it is no better personified than by the ceiling insulation program. If these people cannot get fluffy stuff into the ceiling without creating a national crisis, how on earth can we trust them to completely rejig the Australian economy? The question comes before us as to why we would have an inquiry. I have a few ideas; Copenhagen is one of them. Copenhagen is a slight change of events and something that should be examined.
The Labor Party under their own admission, through such people as Lindsay Tanner, the Minister for Finance and Administration, said of the last program that they had to rush it out and they did not have the time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. That was his quote on Sky News. Why wouldn’t that make us want to make sure that if they are not prepared to dot the i’s and cross the t’s then maybe we should do it for them? Because they have brought back this piece of legislation, we must have a full and transparent inquiry to once more engage the Australian people on how ultimately farcical this whole plan is.
Everybody in the Labor Party is deserting it like rats deserting the sinking ship. They will not be running in here today to stand at the back and holler and scream. No, there will be dead silence over there today. Even their leader, Kevin Rudd, has gone quiet on this. He has tried the idea of walking both sides of the fence but it has turned into something that is quite anatomically difficult for him. We go back once more to Mr Keating and the clear idea that, if you do not understand this massive new tax, do not vote for it. If you do understand it you would never vote for it. Most importantly, there is his retort that it is your choice that you want to make this your battleground, so we are going to do you and we are going to do you slowly.
This ETS is nothing more than a program that was never, ever going to change the climate. It was never, ever going to make the globe cooler. What it was going to do was rip tens of billions of dollars, in excess of $100 billion, out of the consumer by way of credits that would be passed on, but for whose benefit? The climate was not going to change. Who was the benefactor of this? Stockbrokers and bankers made their commissions on the way through. They became very environmentally conscious once they started seeing the billions of dollars that were going to land on their boardroom tables.
To be honest, I think the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, became very environmentally conscious when he looked at the debt racing through the roof and was trying to apply a mechanism to see how he could get the government’s hands on some of that money to prop up the parlous state of finances that the Labor Party had placed this nation’s budget in. These are the people who all of a sudden became environmentally conscious, so these are the people who also have to be questioned. What was this all about? We see in the Wall Street Journal that Yvo de Boer has resigned and that the IPCC is floundering and falling to pieces. These are not my statements; these are statements in articles today by Gordon Crovitz. We have to start bringing these issues forward and discussing them.
It is only proper that the Australian people took the Labor Party on trust and thought, ‘You are doing something that is right, so, although we don’t understand it, we will give you the benefit of the doubt.’ But the more they came to understand it, the more they did not like it. The more they came to understand it, the more they came to the position that they were basically being misled. They were being misled and they were being ripped off. The Australian people have a right to a further inquiry. They have a right to a further ventilation of the facts. They have a right to see exactly where Australia sits now that Copenhagen has fallen flat on its face. They have a right to understand what this will do to our economy if we fly solo, as is the intention of the Labor Party and what they wish to do to our nation. They have a right to ask how absolutely, patently absurd it would be if Australia had not dodged the bullet, if Australia had actually, in some sort of pall of insanity, voted for the ETS and it was now in place. Imagine the place we would be living in now! Imagine the peculiarity of where we would be now! Australia would be on its lonesome out there with its own tax on a colourless, odourless gas, apparently on the premise that we are going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra.
It was the Australian people who rose up and basically made the phones melt down in this joint. It was those same people who rang up and lobbied and said, ‘You cannot do this to us.’ They have the right to a further inquiry. They have a further right to have their day in court. They have the right to clearly pin this tail to the Labor Party donkey. This is the ETS tail on the Labor Party donkey and we have to make sure all of Australia sees it. This is what the Labor Party intend to do—wondrous visions, huge costs and bizarre economics, and a complete reconfiguration of our nation’s economy based on a tax on a colourless, odourless gas, as administered from the same government that gave us the ceiling insulation program. If that is not scary enough, have a look at how they are going in the other place.
We have to clearly start to state to people that the whole point of the ETS was to put the price of a product up so that you could not afford it. That is the premise of it. It was going to be a pricing mechanism. It was to make things more expensive so that you could not afford them, so that you would change what you purchased. It was a mechanism to make you poorer, and in making you poorer you could not afford the things that you really should be entitled to.
The premise that you could actually change your buying patterns on such things as electricity is an interesting concept. If we look at what has been happening to electricity prices and the increase in electricity prices—up 25 per cent in some states—have we seen a corresponding reduction in the use of electricity? No, we have not. We have just seen that the people who use electricity are poorer because they do not have as much money. What was the ETS going to do? It was going to put up the price of electricity so that every time you turned on the television you would realise that that was being taxed and you were becoming poorer, because in a room in Canberra they believed they could single-handedly cool the temperature of the globe. Every time you opened the fridge and a little light went on you would be reminded that Mr Rudd was taxing you. Every time you ironed clothes you would be taxed. Every time you cooked the toast, you would be taxed. We have to take it back to this simple analogy.
The Labor Party had this wondrous scheme of approaching nirvana, global peace—and a massive new tax for the Labor Party. And on the way through a lot of very rich and very successful bankers would become even richer and more successful—and good luck to them because when you see a mug you have just got to take them for a ride. And they could see a mug coming. They could see the mug punter, the Australian parliament, about to deliver them an absolute entree into a massive new sector of wealth. Everything that was involved in our nation, whether we liked it or not, would have some interconnection with this tax. It was not an option. You did not have an option whether you paid the tax or not. You just paid it. It is not a case of if you are poor you do not pay it—you just pay it. No matter where you are, you pay it. Then there is the administration of the so-called compensation scheme. That was going to be done with the same diligence, of course, that we saw with the ceiling insulation program. It was a cack-arsed mess.
But the Labor Party want to bring it back. The fact is that the Labor Party said, and the Deputy Prime Minister Gillard came out and said, that the first thing the parliament will do—and this is why we still had the hype going on last year—will be to bring this piece of legislation back. But times have changed and the Australian people have brought a sense of balance and foreboding into the Labor Party. So as the first thing that they want to bring back, they want ever so quietly to sneak it in here and just have a quiet little vote—maybe do it on the voices. The moral issue of our time would be stuck between tabling the report and, while not into the noncontroversial, be put into the section of the red that says: ‘Please deal with this very quickly when we are not on broadcast.’ That is where they would like to have it: ‘Please put us out of our misery where no-one can see it. Please quietly strangle this behind the door. Please take this to a public toilet near you and flush it away. Please get rid of this.’ The Labor Party have to go through the motions but they do not want to fess up to exactly what they were going to do to the Australian economy.
These are the people who have the hide, the gall, to say that they are responsible. These people have the gall to talk about who is a risk to the economy.
—You are the risk! No-one would let you anywhere near—
—I will tell you what is a risk: the risk is the ETS. The risk is the government that would do that. The risk is the people who bring in such things as the ceiling insulation program. You are the risk and your risk is epitomised by this ETS. That is the risk that the Labor Party is to the Australian people. In this Disneyland like trip, which was the ETS, that is Labor Party management par excellence. That is where the risk is, and the Australian people will see what a risk you people are—what an absolutely hypocritical and disastrous outcome the Labor Party would be.
It is your policy, isn’t it? It is your policy to bring in this ETS. It is your policy to rejig the Australian economy. It is your policy to make people poorer. It is your policy that you believe you can cool the temperature of the globe from a room down the corridor from this chamber. Now that is not only unbelievable; it exemplifies risk. It goes to show you that nothing else the Labor Party tells you you can take seriously, because that is who they are. In this fanciful world they live in, the fanciful world of an ETS, the fanciful world of $245 billion in gross debt, the fanciful world of ceiling insulation, the fanciful world of Labor Party economics, that is the risk they are to the Australian people. That is why the Australian people are marking you down on your economic credentials. That is why you are polling down. They are a wake-up to you.
We are going to make sure that they see more and more and more of you on this issue. We are going to watch with some interest as Prime Minister Rudd and Mr Swan and Mr Tanner come into the House and laud the benefits of this massive new tax. We are going to watch with interest. I challenge Mr Tanner to come into the other place tomorrow and talk to us about the benefits of the ETS and how this is a good outcome for the economics of our nation and how it is going to help us pay back our debt. I challenge Mr Swan, once he gets off his puerile little statements, to have the courage and conviction to talk about the ETS and what a great outcome it is. But, no, Minister Wong, they are going to leave you high and dry, because that is what they do to you, and they are doing it right now.
I do believe that Minister Wong believes in this policy. I disagree with it, but I do believe she believes in it. But the others are such philosophical mercenaries, such absolute drifters, such economic illiterates, that they would devise this massive new tax for a complete rejigging of the Australian economy, they would lay it on Minister Wong’s lap and when it blows up they would all run away. And that is exactly what they have done.
They did it, and we are going to pursue them for it. This tax has gone absolutely pear-shaped. I will watch with interest to see whether Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Mr Tanner field questions in the other place about the benefits of the ETS. Let us try them out. They want to talk about conviction; they want to talk about who is a risk. Let us see if they do that. Let us put the weight back on them. Let us see whether they actually go in and support you, Minister Wong, or whether they leave you high and dry.
I look forward to going around the seats of Dawson, the Hunter Valley and Flynn, and in marginal electorates, and explaining to them what the Labor Party has in mind for them. It is a moral issue of the Labor Party’s times. It is not the moral issue of our time; it is the moral issue of the Labor Party’s times. And it will personify the Labor Party’s times, as brief as those times will be. When the Labor Party’s times are over, so too will be the ETS. That is what is so important. When the Labor Party, the government of this nation, is finished, then that is the only time we can safely say that the ETS is finished. So we must finish the Labor Party’s role in government to finish the ETS. It is as simple as that.
But what you will see are the so-called halcyon days of the global crusade led by the Prime Minister as it all falls flat on its face after Copenhagen. We will see where this goes next. We will judge the mettle of Mr Swan, we will judge the mettle of Mr Tanner and we will judge the mettle of Mr Rudd to see if he truly is a man who knows where both of them are and whether he wants to go forward by coming into the chamber and prosecuting his case for the delivery of the ETS. This personifies his economic credentials. I am interested to see. But they will not. They will dwell on the puerile, they will dwell on the minimal. But they will not dwell on their major economic policy, the global issue, the moral issue of our times.
So I say to all people: judge them by what they do and judge them by how they act. Do not judge them by the vaudeville spectacle that is currently provided for us in the other place every day at question time. Judge the Labor Party by the ceiling insulation debacle. That is what we should judge them by. Ask yourself this question: if they could not successfully get fluffy stuff into ceilings without creating a national crisis that is going to cost tens of millions of dollars to fix, that ended up costing people’s lives and that has burned down in excess of 100 houses without this sort of calamity—watching the Labor Party is like the further escapades of Calamity Jane—how do you reckon we would be going under a Labor Party ETS? How do you think the world would now look under an ETS?
What an absolute farce. Even now they do not have the capacity, the intestinal fortitude, to walk into the chamber. If Mr Rudd is over the ETS he should walk in and say, ‘It is over; I am finishing it. I am not going forward with it.’ If he was a man of ticker, that is what he would do. But he will not do that. He plays this funny little game where he is sort of for it but he wants it to quietly die. It is really remarkable. This is what the people see. They are starting to encapsulate their view of Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Mr Tanner through their view of the ETS. They are saying: ‘That is who they are; they are the ETS—the extra tax system, the enormous tax system.’ The CPRS was initially the ‘cunning plan’ to get a double dissolution and ‘RS’ is what the economy would be if they got there. That is what it was all about. The polls were with them at that stage but now they have become something else. They have morphed—gecko-like. They have morphed into another form of creature.
—Chameleon-like!
—Chameleon. Well, it is not gecko; I was thinking of Mr Garrett’s shoulder. Yes, chameleon-like. A new species of chameleon is now developing. We will have this inquiry so that we can clearly spell out to the Australian people exactly who you are. We have to reveal all the chameleon-like tendencies, all the falsities and all the ridiculous propositions that have been put forward in this moral issue of our times. It is the biggest economic document—bigger than the GST—that has been foisted on the Australian people. We will show the Australian people the bullet that they have avoided. We know it is not going to go through. It is an absolute dog of a scheme. Everyone knows that now. We will show you what economic responsibility really is. If you want to see what irresponsibility is, it is Labor’s ETS.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,30,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-24,"—Support for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is dropping by the day. Every day there is another group coming out saying there is no need to rush this through recklessly. Look at what happens when this government rushes things through. Look at the batty batts program—rushing it through. It is embarrassing. Lives are at risk and up to $1 billion has been wasted, and all because you rushed it through. It is wise and prudent to take the time, especially when community support for a carbon pollution reduction scheme is dropping by the day. They are also getting nervous about this government being able to implement things. It is wise and prudent to use this time to look at the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills through a Senate inquiry.
We have to also realise that this Senate has already agreed that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills will be considered in May. That is the earliest they are going to be considered. So why would you stand idly by and not support this Senate inquiry? Anyone who does not support this inquiry is not fair dinkum about making sure we are doing the right thing by the Australian public. These bills are scheduled to come back to the Senate in May. The Senate has agreed to that, so we should use this time wisely and prudently to look at these new bills. Rushing ahead is risky, especially with this government, as proven by the batty batts program. Look what happened with the NBN: 17 million bucks in a tender went belly up—and you are asking us to trust you on implementation. We are all getting nervous, so why not have the Senate look at these new bills to make sure that we are taking the time to consider the matter fully?  At the end of my speech, I will move the amendment which has already been circulated in the chamber. It says in part that the committee of this inquiry:
... must invite the Productivity Commission to make:
a detailed submission to the committee setting out viable alternative schemes to the CPRS and the cost and benefits under those schemes of achieving the targets that are contained in the bills ...
Let us look at other schemes. Let us have the Productivity Commission look at this rather than have the government saying, ‘Other schemes aren’t worthy.’ Subparagraph (b) of my amendment—I will not read the whole lot out as I will move the amendment at the end of my speech to add paragraph (4)—proposes that we look at ‘the potential costs to the Australian economy by committing to the targets contained in these bills before all other major world economies’, such as China, the United States of America, India and Russia, commit to targets that are lower than those that have been set out by the Rudd government. How will that impact on our economy? These are questions that need to be answered, and I think we must invite the Productivity Commission to provide a detailed submission on the matter.
I will be supporting this motion, albeit with the amendment that I have put forward, because it is wise and prudent to do so. It is not stalling the legislation, because the Senate has already agreed that the legislation is not coming up to be debated until May. So why do we not use this time prudently to have a Senate inquiry looking into the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and invite the Productivity Commission to look at two other details that I think this Senate needs to have answers to before we start debating the bills in May? I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“(4)   In undertaking the inquiry, the committee must invite the Productivity Commission to make:
a detailed submission to the committee setting out viable alternative schemes to the CPRS and the cost and benefits under those schemes of achieving the targets that are contained in the bills; and
a detailed submission to the committee setting out the potential costs to the Australian economy by committing to the targets contained in these bills before all other major world economies (including China, the United States of America, India and Russia) commit to at least the emission reduction targets, and before we know what those targets are, this detailed submission should also include the potential costs to the Australian economy if other major world economies do commit to lower emissions reduction targets and any impacts resulting from the reliance of other major economies on nuclear power sources”.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,30,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-02-24,"—What an extraordinary proposition from the opposition.
—Is Senator Wong closing the debate?
—No, Senator Boswell. It is not my motion; it is your motion. That means that I cannot close the debate. I would like to close the debate to send the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills off to an inquiry, because we have had this debate and all we had from Senator Joyce was a reiteration of the same set of conspiracy theories and, frankly, madness that we heard over a long period of time in what I think was the third longest debate in the Senate’s history—the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009.
There has been some talk about this being rushed. I say that we are in no danger whatsoever of being accused of rushing. We had 12 years of inaction under John Howard until he finally decided to adopt an emissions trading scheme as policy and this legislation has been before the Senate no fewer than four times. You might recall that the first time the opposition played procedural games so as not to have to debate it. What are they doing now? Exactly the same thing—more procedural games because they do not want the bills brought on. It is somewhat bizarre, because we have had a lot of hairy-chested noise and a lot of chest-thumping from the Leader of the Opposition. He keeps saying, ‘Bring it on!’ Yet here in the Senate chamber we saw the opposition seeking to delay yesterday and then successfully delaying debate today on this legislation until the next sitting.
While the Leader of the Opposition is saying, ‘Bring it on!’ and beating his chest, we have the opposition in the Senate wimping out because they do not want the debate. If they want the debate so much—if they want to do what Senator Joyce said and run the scare campaign they say they want to run—they should bring the debate on. But they are not doing that. They are playing procedural games deferring it until the May sittings, and now they want another inquiry.
For the information of the Senate, if this inquiry gets up it will be no less than the 15th inquiry into climate change since the Rudd government took office. There have been 15 inquiries. This is process gone mad. These are people who will do and say anything to avoid taking action on climate change. I would have more respect for the opposition if they could just reiterate what they believe, which is, as Mr Abbott said, ‘Climate change is absolute crap.’ Why don’t you just tell people that instead of playing these games in the Senate to avoid having the discussion?
While I am on the subject of some of the more remarkable things put forward in this debate, I comment as a side issue on the irony of Senator Joyce lecturing the Senate about economic risk. Senator Joyce is seen as such a liability by the coalition as the shadow minister for finance—and we know they are all lining up to take his job—that he cannot even get a question during question time on any issue to do with economics, presumably because he might mix up his millions, billions and trillions.
This matter has been before the Senate previously on four occasions. This would be the 15th inquiry into climate change since we took office. Senator Abetz says, somewhat grandiosely, ‘There are a lot of amendments.’ But he is talking about the amendments that we negotiated with the then Leader of the Opposition and Mr Macfarlane and that were endorsed in Senator Abetz’s party room. He is asking the Senate to go and do an inquiry into amendments that his party room supported before they tore down their leader. This is extraordinary. Didn’t you talk about it in your party room? You were certainly in there for many hours before you endorsed it, yet now you are going to send it off for another Senate inquiry just to make sure that we waste more taxpayers’ funds on more inquiries on an issue that you have already decided you are going to oppose. That is really the issue here: you are not referring this matter for inquiry because you actually want to find out anything. You are not referring it because you might change your minds or because you want to inquire. You have made your position absolutely clear to the extent that you have executed a leader so you do not have to vote for action on climate change. That is what you have done.
It is really quite an extraordinary abuse of process to be suggesting that there is any merit to this inquiry. We have had years of inquiry into the best way to reduce emissions in this country. Your own Prime Minister, John Howard, commissioned Peter Shergold to do a report through the Task Group on Emissions Trading. It reported whilst you were still in government and it said very clearly that the lowest cost way to reduce emissions, which is the key to dealing with climate change, is to introduce an emissions trading scheme. You went to the last election with that policy. You now have elected a man who says climate change is absolute crap. I disagree, but what you are doing is delaying debate in this place rather than simply saying, ‘Bring it on,’ having the debate and voting against the bills. I do not quite understand why it is that you would take this path.
There were a whole range of other matters, and I do not want to go into this in detail because we had a very long debate on the last occasions where many of these same issues were argued by the opposition over and over again. I remind senators on that side, when they accuse people on this side of being part of some bizarre conspiracy around the science of climate change, that even John Howard recognised the science. Margaret Thatcher recognised the science. The US Department of Defence has also indicated its view on climate change, which is that it does represent a significant threat. We know that emissions trading has been adopted in over 30 countries.
—It has not!
—It has been adopted in over 30 countries. I will take that interjection, Senator Boswell, because it would be useful if we could actually have some facts in this debate. Unfortunately, those on the other side are not interested in facts. You are not interested in the implications climate change has for our economy and our way of life. You are not interested in the risks that climate change poses to our agricultural sector.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Senator Bernardi is well known as a man who denies the existence of climate change; he should think about what has happened in his home state of South Australia in recent years in terms of inflows into the Murray-Darling and the availability of water.
The reality is that those on the other side do not believe climate change is real. They run the Liberal Party these days. They have put forward a policy which is nothing more than a climate con job to get them through to the election, which is what you would expect from a party that is run by people who do not believe climate change is real. But what is really bizarre is that you have Mr Abbott beating his chest about ‘bringing it on’ at the same time as his senators are playing procedural games so as not to have the debate here, and now want the 15th inquiry, as I said, into climate change since the Rudd government came to power.
The government does not support this referral. It is just another delaying tactic from the opposition—people who, no matter what evidence is presented to them, currently wish not to act.
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think the minister would have to reflect on how this can be a delaying tactic when—
—That’s no point of order.
—Sorry, the Senate has already agreed that this legislation would not come back before May.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—There is no point of order.
—Senator Fielding, whose views on climate change are well known—
—Oh, nail him up!
—No. I will take that injection. Senator Johnston just said, ‘Nail him up.’ I have never used language like that. It is only those on that side who have used language like that.
—That’s what you use.
—You have never heard me using language like that. This is not an unknown tactic. When you wish to speak—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you. It is not an unknown tactic, is it: when people want to use the language of prejudice, they then accuse others of using it. The reality is that those are not words that I use, Senator; they are words you have used. It is true that Senator Fielding’s views on climate change are well known. I disagree with them—he is entitled to them, but I disagree with them. I think it is irresponsible to take this view, given the risk to Australia now and in the future.
—Oh, there’s a personal comment; there’s an attack.
—Order!
—There are some people in this chamber who do not really treat this chamber with much respect. What I was, I think, trying to point out before the interjection by the frontbencher representing the opposition is this: we wanted these bills brought on. Senator Fielding refers to the delay. I remind him that he delivered the delay with the opposition. He voted with the opposition to ensure these bills were delayed again, so it is a little disingenuous for him to come in here and talk about this issue of delay when he in fact ensured that the coalition’s delaying tactics worked. He should be upfront about that.
The government does not support this motion. This is a motion, again, to defer consideration. This is a motion to provide the 15th inquiry since we have come to government on a policy that was negotiated with and supported by your party room.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—I acknowledge you have changed position. You now have elected a man who thinks climate change is absolute crap. That has made Senator Bernardi very happy. But the reality is that no amount of inquiry, no amount of discussion and no amount of debate is going to change your minds. So you have to wonder what is the real agenda behind yet another delaying attack from an opposition that has done nothing but oppose and delay action on climate change, both in government and, now, in opposition since last year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,30,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-02-24,"—The resolution that we are debating now is to refer the ETS, or the CPRS, to a committee. Senator Wong says we have done all that and we have had 15 inquiries. I suppose in some way she is right. But the reason we do need an inquiry is that the whole bill has changed. It fell to the ground in a heap of custard at Copenhagen. When Senator Wong went to Copenhagen with her 109 colleagues, or whoever she took over there—I suppose someone has to carry the hairdryer—
—Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I rise on a point of order. I find those sexist remarks unparliamentary and I would ask that the senator withdraw them. I have been in this Senate for quite some years and in the Tasmanian parliament for 10 years and I am over the fact that people can make disparaging remarks of that kind. I would seek that they be withdrawn.
—I withdraw. Because Senator Milne has asked me to withdraw, I will withdraw. I do have some regard for her. What I was saying to Senator Wong is that the whole bill has changed. The bill was based on the fact that Australia, Canada, the EU, the former Soviet Union, Japan and annex B countries would be in a scheme from 2010, with China and higher income developing countries being in the scheme from 2015. India and the middle-income countries would be in the scheme from 2020. And there would be full coverage—that is, everyone in an ETS, right around the world—from 2025. That is what the modelling was based on. I do not know how you were ever going to achieve it. I could never see it working. I sat back and thought, ‘This is going to be a disaster beyond all disasters,’ but I never thought it would be the disaster that it turned out to be.
What this parliament now has in front of it is a bill that has been modelled on the assumption that all the countries in the world would be involved in an ETS scheme by 2025. That clearly did not happen in Copenhagen. What happened in Copenhagen, as everyone knows, is that very little was achieved. What was achieved was that there was no agreement on mandatory targets, no process of verification of targets, no treaty and no timetable, and there was some vague commitment that the world would try, by all doing their own thing, to hold the temperatures at around two per cent. That was the outcome of Copenhagen and that is the agreement that the Labor Party signed off on. I put it to the Senate that the whole package of bills that is being offered to the parliament has changed. It changed at Copenhagen, because the modelling that was predicted was that all would be in it by 2025. The prediction that small business would be okay and would be reimbursed was on the presumption that overseas competitors would not have any advantage, because we would all be in a scheme. The prediction for pensioners was predicted on us all being in a scheme. We know that is not going to happen.
If you are going to present this legislation again to the parliament, you have to go back and remodel the predictions and the assumptions. The bill that you are putting before the parliament now and which we are referring to a committee has to be changed. You are putting up something now that is a fraud, a con, because you know it cannot work the way in which your modelling predicted. That is the reason that we should be sending it to a committee. I do not know which way the numbers will fall, but what I do know is that the legislation on the table is wrong. It is being presented to this parliament wrongly, because the assumptions are wrong.
Also, what Senator Wong signed up to was that we had to get the non-developed countries as part of a climate regime scheme. The world had to put $30 billion on the table between 2010 and 2012, and from 2012 until 2020 the world had to stump up with $100 billion. Senator Milne and I have continually asked Senator Wong: what is our share? We have not been told what our share is, unless Senator Milne has received some information that I have not received. Both of us have tried to find out what our share will be. That amount of money has to be referred to a Senate committee. What is our share of $30 billion for the lemon of a program that the government pushes forward? What is our proportion of $100 billion in 2020? How are we going to raise that money? Is it by tax or is it by some sort of levy? One of the proposals that the government supported was a tax or a levy on aviation and shipping fuel. This will further penalise our exports. These are the things that have to be presented to a committee so that we can get the information. I am sure that Senator Milne would agree with me. These are the things that the parliament must know before we proceed with debating legislation.
What we are debating is an entirely different bill to the one that was before Copenhagen, that assumed we would all be in one big happy party by 2025. We would all be in it—China, Russia, India, Brazil; we would all be one big happy family all joined up in an ETS. Well, it was never going to work; I could never see how it was going to work. I could never see how the world was all going to join together; I could never see how America was going to sign an ETS with a 10 per cent unemployment rate. It was just a Labor Party pipedream that could never happen. And it was exposed in Copenhagen.
Now you have the greatest lemon of a policy that has ever been presented—at least in my 30 years in this place. It started off that everyone was full of vigour and the people wanted it. They wanted it until they could see that they were going to be the only ones who were going to pay their insurance policy. I refer to some Galaxy polling that was done before Copenhagen. The polling said about 54 per cent did not want to do it until after Copenhagen; about 34 per cent wanted to do it straightaway. As the debate heated up people could see that they were going to be the only ones paying the insurance policy, and Australia would be the only one that would be involved in an ETS and the rest of the world were not going to be involved. And how close we came to that. How very, very close this nation came to the greatest disaster of all time; if we had put that legislation through. Senator Wong keeps using the 30 countries. Let me tell Senator Wong: yes, if she uses the EU as 30 countries—there are probably 27 or 28 countries in it—but because it is one collective economy, we would have been the only independent economy that would have been stupid enough, silly enough to actually vote. And how close we came! One vote and there was a change of leadership; one vote the other way and Australia was down the drain by $120 billion—and that is close. I hope the people who are listening to this realise just how close they came to Australia being saddled with a $120 billion tax, which was turned around by Tony Abbott and his colleagues. It was turned around, but it was such a close call.
You have to wonder. If you cannot sell $2 billion worth of batts and you are not marketing them, then you are just giving them away for virtually nothing. If you cannot do that, how are you going to run the most complicated, convoluted scheme that has ever been presented to the world—a world government scheme and everyone has to play their part? You can imagine how complicated that would be. And if you do not have the capacity to give $2 billion worth of batts away, you have absolutely no chance of ever coming to terms with an ETS.
The game is up. Senator Conroy understands that the game is up. Most of the hardheads in the Labor Party know that the game is up, but they cannot find the escape route. That is their problem. They cannot find an escape route. If they go with the Greens, they will get castigated. If they pull out, they will lose what we call the doctors’ wives votes, the soft leafy suburbs. So they are stuck. They would love to get out of it. If someone could give them a way out, if someone could release them from this $120 billion lemon that they have tied around their neck—
—A stinking cat!
—It is like a stinking cat tied around their neck and they cannot find a way to get rid of it.
It is a gold mine for us. We will go around every working-class seat and say: ‘Your jobs are on the line. You’ve got a choice. If you want to vote for Kevin Rudd, you’ll be voting for an ETS. You will be voting for a stinking cat that is going to cost you $120 billion, it’s going to put the industries that you work in—the mining industries, the aluminium industry, the steel industry, the glass industry, the cement industry—at risk and it’s going to put your jobs at risk. The government will make your industries anti-competitive. It was so before Copenhagen, but it is doubly so now.’ But the government are hell-bent on putting this legislation through. They come here and want to get it through. They want to get it through today. I would not vote for something that is not even a true reflection of what is in the bill. The bill is finished. They have to go back and remodel it, present their remodelling to the parliament and then ask the parliament to vote on something that is real. But they are presenting a fraud, a con to the parliament of Australia and they know it.
The modelling is wrong. Canada, United States, China, Russia—the big emitters—have said, ‘We’re not going to have a bar of this.’ And you could have said that before we even went to Copenhagen. How could America, with 10 per cent unemployment—it would probably be worse if it did not have such a huge defence force—vote for it? How could it get through congress? It just could not. It was never going to work. But those opposite believe they can get it through in some sneaky way in a form that is not really reflecting what is in the bill.
If the Labor Party want to go ahead with this—I cannot see how they can get out of it—then with Senator Joyce and Senator Bernardi and Senator ‘Whacker’ Williams, I will be out in the field. This is politics. We will be telling all of those blue-collar workers that Labor has ratted on them. The Labor people have ratted on the blue-collar worker because they want to keep the green section of their party happy!
—Like you ratted when you sold Telstra!
—If you want to talk about Telstra, we can do that on another date. We are talking about ratting on the blue-collar workers that you are supposed to represent. You are going to cost them their jobs; you are going to desert them. You just want to bring in a bit of subterfuge about Telstra—
—Subterfuge!
—Yes, it is subterfuge. We are debating the greatest cause of job losses in Australia, and it is hard to believe that it is the ALP that is doing it. They are doing it to their own blue-collar workers because they have probably made some pact with the soft, leafy suburb sections of their party. It is just a free kick in front of goal for the conservative forces in every working class suburb. I have seen the polls just falling away overnight. I indicated that in a Galaxy poll the figure had gone up to 60 per cent not wanting to do anything before Copenhagen. Those wanting to go ahead had fallen from 34 per cent in a poll a week before to 27 per cent. If you take the Greens out of that 27 per cent, and that is 12 per cent and going up and the government vote is going down, you end up with about 12 per cent support.
If we are going to go through this facade of presenting legislation to the parliament, then the Australian people want to know that what we are debating is a true and accurate reflection of what is in the bill. It is not, and it never was since Copenhagen. They also want to know where our share of the $30 billion is coming from, and the $100 billion we have to pay the non-developed countries. Until the government tells us these things, they are just not telling the truth. They are not telling the Australian people what it is all about. I have tried and tried with Senator Milne—we often do not agree on things; sometimes we do, as we do on this issue—to find out what our share of the $30 billion is, what our share of the $100 billion is and how we are going to fund it. It is not small bikkies; it is big bikkies. The government has to tell us these things. They have to tell the electorate. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. That is what you are trying to do by presenting this ETS bill. Your assumptions on small business, pensioners, overseas trade and everything else are wrong. This matter has to go to a committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,30,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-24,"—There are any number of questions that one could raise and should raise about the government’s ill-named, in fact deceitfully named, Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is a government that has clearly failed to level with the Australian people, because they bought the assumption that the Liberal Party and the coalition would walk willingly with them through this forest of economic disaster and deceit. They tried to deceive the Australian people by saying they were going to create green jobs and it was not going to have any adverse impact on the world; it was going to be picked up by all countries around the world, and Copenhagen was going to be a spectacular success.
I have to say that not all Labor members did that. They were very disciplined. But a number of people felt deeply uncomfortable with this. Although Minister Garrett’s judgement is absolutely flawed in regard to the installation of insulation, he also feels deeply uncomfortable because in his heart he is a deep green movement person. He knows this is not an environmental policy; it is an economic policy that is designed to grab $10 billion—that will pick the pockets of the Australian people to the tune of $10 billion—every year by targeting big business and then pretending that big business, or business, will not pass those costs on. But of course they have also ignored the impact on small business—the heart and soul, the very driving force, of our economy—who have had their pockets picked by Mr Rudd and his team of extremists.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-24,"—On behalf of the coalition, I move:
That—
The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and 10 related bills be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 11 May 2010.
In undertaking the inquiry, the committee should consider.
the package of amendments announced by the Government on 24 November 2009 and incorporated in current proposed legislation, including the impact of the bills on the Australian resources sector, Australian exports, the competitiveness of Australian industry, employment levels and electricity prices;
the modelling underpinning the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) including the lower projected carbon price and the cost of the CPRS package over the current budget period to 2014-15;
the outcome of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in December 2009;
the current state of progress of other countries in implementing emissions and abatement measures to meet non-binding emissions reduction targets; and
the status of, and likely prospects for, the United States of America’s emissions trading legislation.
The committee should seek evidence from, but not limited to, the Productivity Commission, Frontier Economics, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Coal Association and the Energy Supply Association of Australia.
In moving this motion, the coalition strongly believes that there is a need for these measures to be fully examined. That is the historical role of the Senate, and it has done so, if I might say, exceptionally well. Even when the blood rushed on the very rare occasion to the Howard government head and we did not want Senate inquiries into legislation, it was amazing when the Senate did so vote how certain things were exposed to us which made us say quietly behind our hand, ‘Thank goodness for that Senate inquiry because it did expose a few things that had not been taken to account.’ Those of us who have been here a few years know the importance of Senate committee inquiries and the great benefit that they provide. I trust that there is no honourable senator in this place who thinks that the probing, the testing and the inquiring by Senate committees of proposals is something that should be rejected out of hand. I hope we all support that. Indeed, we have a Prime Minister who allegedly supports evidence based policy.
The bill that we are seeking to submit to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, very interestingly—if people listened closely they would have heard this in the title—is the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and the related bills. This is new legislation. This is different legislation to that which we have debated in the past. What it seeks to do, and I think quite appropriately, is incorporate a lot of the amendments that the Senate wanted passed last time around.
What do those changes involve? They involve a significant change to the CPRS, the big new tax on everything, of $114 billion. This is a huge scheme, the most significant scheme ever sought to be legislated by a Commonwealth government. This is a massive issue, whether you like a CPRS or you do not like it. In a bid to try to get Senate support, Labor moved a host of amendments. Those amendments have never really been fully tested, fully exposed, fully considered by a Senate inquiry. The differences in the packages and how the money is spread around are at the thousand-plus million dollar mark. This is a lot of money. The compensation being paid to families changed in this legislation.
Can I just stop on that one. We remember the debacle of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, when we asked him about the compensation scheme under this legislation, so cockily telling us: 92 per cent of Australian families would be compensated—and how dare we as an opposition ask questions like this because it was all debated previously and we should know and we should be ashamed of ourselves. Two days later the Leader of the Government in the Senate was in this place and, like Labor always do—they can never apologise and say they got something wrong—he said he ‘misspoke’. The 92 per cent figure, if I recall, evaporated down to about 51 per cent of families getting full compensation. Even the Leader of the Government in the Senate does not fully understand the legislation and the compensation package.
Also, there are huge changes in relation to the power-generating sector, which is very important. Mr Rudd told the Australian people that there would be an increase in power prices, but when we asked for the modelling and all of the detail we were not given it. When Mr Rudd is asked how this new scheme, this different scheme, would impact on the cost of a loaf of bread or a litre of milk, he cannot tell us. I think the people of Australia want answers, and we are entitled to explore those issues courtesy of a Senate inquiry. We as a coalition are proposing that the inquiry take 2½ months and report on 11 May 2010. A scheme of this magnitude and one which has had wholesale changes now made to it I think is worthy of an inquiry of that length. It is not very long, given the significant nature of the package we are dealing with.
At the time of the last election this issue was described as the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’. That was said 22 times during the last election campaign, yet in the Australia Day speeches by the Prime Minister it was not mentioned at all. The government itself has shunted this legislation down its list of priorities. It is no longer the greatest moral challenge of our time. Indeed, according to the government’s own agenda in this place, the greatest moral challenge that it faces is breaking an election promise on private health insurance. But I am distracting myself from the main argument.
This legislation will come into force on 1 January 2011. If all the evidence comes back that everything is hunky-dory and good then the Senate can consider and explore these issues further in debate and the legislation can still be put in place, one would assume, by 2011, so there is no rush for this legislation. Indeed, the Labor Party itself changed the commencement date from 2010 to 2011. It did that of its own volition. The nauseatingly moralising Prime Minister, who just talks and talks, and who said that this was the greatest moral challenge of our time, all of a sudden has said that it is that great a moral challenge that we can just defer consideration and implementation for 12 months. We are not changing the commencement date; all we are doing is saying let us have a look at the detail of this legislation.
This legislation has had a lot of precursors. There was the exposure draft by Senator Wong, then Mr Combet was called in to bring in a completely different bill, then there were the substantial amendments at the end of last year and now we have a newly drafted bill. Underpinning all of those manifestations of the legislation were certain propositions, certain givens, that we were told the modelling was based on and, of course, the greatest of those was that there would be world action at Copenhagen, that the world would come together. That was one of the underlying principles of the modelling and the considerations. We now know why the Prime Minister felt so at home at Copenhagen—it was a talkfest with no action. It was all talk and no action—that is why the Prime Minister revelled in it, loved it and identified with it. Now that we know that there is no world action, one of the supporting pillars of this legislation has been taken out, because of the consequences for Australian jobs, Australian industry and the security of Australian power supplies.
Another underpinning was that carbon capture and storage would be commercially viable by the year 2020. I genuinely hope it is, but a lot of the advice I am getting is that, as we move closer to the year 2020 and since those pronouncements were made about two years ago, people are now questioning whether it will become commercially viable. I think it is appropriate that we explore that.
Another underpinning of the so-called modelling—the bits and pieces we did get and we were told about—was what the Australian population was going to be by the year 2050. Within 12 months, from the first introduction of the legislation until the end of last year, that figure changed considerably—by millions of people. If I recall, it was by either two or three million people. When you are dealing with a population of only about 21 million, that is 10 per cent. That is a huge discrepancy.
Why can’t we be told what the outcome would be if the new figures were imported into the modelling? What would be the pressures on our power generators to provide the electricity to these people? What would be the pressures on our community in providing all the community services that those extra two or three million people would anticipate to be their birthrights? There would be a huge impact on our carbon emissions. There is no doubt about that. We as a Senate are entitled to know the answers to those sorts of questions. I could go on at some length about the modelling and what is underpinning it, which the government has sought to sell to the Australian people, but these are just some examples of what we on this side of the chamber believe needs to be explored.
I know that there are also some who would say that the science may well have shifted in recent times. In this religiously defined debate, I have declared myself—also in religious terms—an agnostic and I will not enter into the science of the debate, other than to say I have noted that some of the IPCC considerations are now being modulated or remodelled. But I will not go there, because our motion does not seek to re-explore the science, despite the huge embarrassment I think the University of East Anglia is in, as well as a few other institutions and people. As far as we are concerned, that is to the side. We believe that there are matters of graver importance to be considered. Let us make no mistake: this would be a massive, big new tax on everything. It would impact every man, woman and child in Australia today and every man, woman and child in Australia for generations to come.
One of the reasons we need to explore the documentation that the government has given us is that new information has come to light—substantially new information. For example, the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, IPART, have said that electricity prices will rise by up to 62 per cent over the next three years, a third of which will be as a result of Mr Rudd’s big new tax on everything. Now, why would the New South Wales state government allow that information to get into the public domain? Because they dispute Mr Rudd’s modelling in relation to electricity prices. Let us make no mistake about that. IPART are an independent body; I am sure they did not leak it. They provided their report to the New South Wales Labor government and, magically, it appeared in the media. I wonder how that occurred! New South Wales state Labor do not trust Mr Rudd’s modelling. There is similar information for Victoria. There is the Morgan Stanley report on the impact of the so-called CPRS, this big new tax on everything, about how it would impact and devastate the power-generating capacity in Victoria. That report—or the snippets we have got from it, because federal Labor refuse to release it although it is within their power to release it; deliberately they refuse to release it—indicates that Victorians would suffer a similar increase in electricity prices as people in New South Wales, once again debunking the modelling by the federal Labor government.
What is clear is that, as the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—this big new tax on everything—has progressed, more and more holes have been found in the Labor government’s arguments, underpinnings and modelling, as a result of which their CPRS Bill is significantly different to their draft exposure and then bill of 2009, because of course now we have the 2010 version. So this has been through three manifestations, and this third manifestation is worthy of a very considered and detailed inquiry. In addition, although this would in rough terms be a 2½-month enquiry, the only time that the parliament would be denied consideration of the bill would be the next sitting fortnight of the Senate—only two weeks—because the report would be ready for the Senate on 11 May, which I understand is budget week. So the actual delay in considering the legislation is only two weeks from the point of view of parliament. When you are considering a document that would submit Australia to a $114 billion big new tax on everything, I think it is worthy of inquiry.
I also say in relation to the failure of Copenhagen—and what a dismal failure it was; a big talkfest, with 114 people from Australia over there, those that the Prime Minister loves, but no world action—that if we go ahead with this suggestion we will in fact contribute to a worse world environmental outcome. Allow me to explain: through carbon leakage, the world would be worse off. In my home state of Tasmania we have a Nyrstar zinc works, as does Senator Farrell in Port Pirie—and Senator Wong. They produce one tonne of zinc for roughly two tonnes of CO2, which is pretty clean in comparison to the rest of the world. China does it for six tonnes of CO2 per tonne of zinc produced. If we price ourselves out of the world market, people will not be buying clean, Australian zinc; they will be buying polluting, Chinese zinc, and as a result the world’s carbon emissions will be even greater. That is the perverse outcome of Mr Rudd’s ill thought out scheme. It is the reason that we in the coalition believe that there is a very real need for a lot of these issues to be tested, especially the huge movement as a result of the failure of Copenhagen. President Obama himself seems to be walking away from an emissions trading scheme. Canada said, ‘If the US are in, we’re in and we’ll adopt their system.’ That is no longer so. The US is walking away; therefore, Canada is walking away. And so it is unravelling around the world.
Just for the record, we as a coalition believe in a no regrets policy in this space, and that is why Mr Abbott has provided a very exciting direct action plan to deal with these issues without the need for a $114 billion big new tax on everything which would devastate jobs, devastate our economy and devastate electricity supplies around our nation. So I say to all honourable senators, irrespective of your views—whether your predisposition is to support or oppose this legislation, whether or not you believe in the science, whether or not you believe the modelling is up to scratch—these are all issues worthy of consideration, and I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-24,"—Senator Abetz is very, very kind about how the Australian people view the ETS. It has been one of the greatest political debacles of all time, the major plank of Labor Party policy and the moral issue of our time, apparently. We see now the sort of logic, acumen and diligence that goes into these Labor Party plans, and it is no better personified than by the ceiling insulation program. If these people cannot get fluffy stuff into the ceiling without creating a national crisis, how on earth can we trust them to completely rejig the Australian economy? The question comes before us as to why we would have an inquiry. I have a few ideas; Copenhagen is one of them. Copenhagen is a slight change of events and something that should be examined.
The Labor Party under their own admission, through such people as Lindsay Tanner, the Minister for Finance and Administration, said of the last program that they had to rush it out and they did not have the time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. That was his quote on Sky News. Why wouldn’t that make us want to make sure that if they are not prepared to dot the i’s and cross the t’s then maybe we should do it for them? Because they have brought back this piece of legislation, we must have a full and transparent inquiry to once more engage the Australian people on how ultimately farcical this whole plan is.
Everybody in the Labor Party is deserting it like rats deserting the sinking ship. They will not be running in here today to stand at the back and holler and scream. No, there will be dead silence over there today. Even their leader, Kevin Rudd, has gone quiet on this. He has tried the idea of walking both sides of the fence but it has turned into something that is quite anatomically difficult for him. We go back once more to Mr Keating and the clear idea that, if you do not understand this massive new tax, do not vote for it. If you do understand it you would never vote for it. Most importantly, there is his retort that it is your choice that you want to make this your battleground, so we are going to do you and we are going to do you slowly.
This ETS is nothing more than a program that was never, ever going to change the climate. It was never, ever going to make the globe cooler. What it was going to do was rip tens of billions of dollars, in excess of $100 billion, out of the consumer by way of credits that would be passed on, but for whose benefit? The climate was not going to change. Who was the benefactor of this? Stockbrokers and bankers made their commissions on the way through. They became very environmentally conscious once they started seeing the billions of dollars that were going to land on their boardroom tables.
To be honest, I think the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, became very environmentally conscious when he looked at the debt racing through the roof and was trying to apply a mechanism to see how he could get the government’s hands on some of that money to prop up the parlous state of finances that the Labor Party had placed this nation’s budget in. These are the people who all of a sudden became environmentally conscious, so these are the people who also have to be questioned. What was this all about? We see in the Wall Street Journal that Yvo de Boer has resigned and that the IPCC is floundering and falling to pieces. These are not my statements; these are statements in articles today by Gordon Crovitz. We have to start bringing these issues forward and discussing them.
It is only proper that the Australian people took the Labor Party on trust and thought, ‘You are doing something that is right, so, although we don’t understand it, we will give you the benefit of the doubt.’ But the more they came to understand it, the more they did not like it. The more they came to understand it, the more they came to the position that they were basically being misled. They were being misled and they were being ripped off. The Australian people have a right to a further inquiry. They have a right to a further ventilation of the facts. They have a right to see exactly where Australia sits now that Copenhagen has fallen flat on its face. They have a right to understand what this will do to our economy if we fly solo, as is the intention of the Labor Party and what they wish to do to our nation. They have a right to ask how absolutely, patently absurd it would be if Australia had not dodged the bullet, if Australia had actually, in some sort of pall of insanity, voted for the ETS and it was now in place. Imagine the place we would be living in now! Imagine the peculiarity of where we would be now! Australia would be on its lonesome out there with its own tax on a colourless, odourless gas, apparently on the premise that we are going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra.
It was the Australian people who rose up and basically made the phones melt down in this joint. It was those same people who rang up and lobbied and said, ‘You cannot do this to us.’ They have the right to a further inquiry. They have a further right to have their day in court. They have the right to clearly pin this tail to the Labor Party donkey. This is the ETS tail on the Labor Party donkey and we have to make sure all of Australia sees it. This is what the Labor Party intend to do—wondrous visions, huge costs and bizarre economics, and a complete reconfiguration of our nation’s economy based on a tax on a colourless, odourless gas, as administered from the same government that gave us the ceiling insulation program. If that is not scary enough, have a look at how they are going in the other place.
We have to clearly start to state to people that the whole point of the ETS was to put the price of a product up so that you could not afford it. That is the premise of it. It was going to be a pricing mechanism. It was to make things more expensive so that you could not afford them, so that you would change what you purchased. It was a mechanism to make you poorer, and in making you poorer you could not afford the things that you really should be entitled to.
The premise that you could actually change your buying patterns on such things as electricity is an interesting concept. If we look at what has been happening to electricity prices and the increase in electricity prices—up 25 per cent in some states—have we seen a corresponding reduction in the use of electricity? No, we have not. We have just seen that the people who use electricity are poorer because they do not have as much money. What was the ETS going to do? It was going to put up the price of electricity so that every time you turned on the television you would realise that that was being taxed and you were becoming poorer, because in a room in Canberra they believed they could single-handedly cool the temperature of the globe. Every time you opened the fridge and a little light went on you would be reminded that Mr Rudd was taxing you. Every time you ironed clothes you would be taxed. Every time you cooked the toast, you would be taxed. We have to take it back to this simple analogy.
The Labor Party had this wondrous scheme of approaching nirvana, global peace—and a massive new tax for the Labor Party. And on the way through a lot of very rich and very successful bankers would become even richer and more successful—and good luck to them because when you see a mug you have just got to take them for a ride. And they could see a mug coming. They could see the mug punter, the Australian parliament, about to deliver them an absolute entree into a massive new sector of wealth. Everything that was involved in our nation, whether we liked it or not, would have some interconnection with this tax. It was not an option. You did not have an option whether you paid the tax or not. You just paid it. It is not a case of if you are poor you do not pay it—you just pay it. No matter where you are, you pay it. Then there is the administration of the so-called compensation scheme. That was going to be done with the same diligence, of course, that we saw with the ceiling insulation program. It was a cack-arsed mess.
But the Labor Party want to bring it back. The fact is that the Labor Party said, and the Deputy Prime Minister Gillard came out and said, that the first thing the parliament will do—and this is why we still had the hype going on last year—will be to bring this piece of legislation back. But times have changed and the Australian people have brought a sense of balance and foreboding into the Labor Party. So as the first thing that they want to bring back, they want ever so quietly to sneak it in here and just have a quiet little vote—maybe do it on the voices. The moral issue of our time would be stuck between tabling the report and, while not into the noncontroversial, be put into the section of the red that says: ‘Please deal with this very quickly when we are not on broadcast.’ That is where they would like to have it: ‘Please put us out of our misery where no-one can see it. Please quietly strangle this behind the door. Please take this to a public toilet near you and flush it away. Please get rid of this.’ The Labor Party have to go through the motions but they do not want to fess up to exactly what they were going to do to the Australian economy.
These are the people who have the hide, the gall, to say that they are responsible. These people have the gall to talk about who is a risk to the economy.
—You are the risk! No-one would let you anywhere near—
—I will tell you what is a risk: the risk is the ETS. The risk is the government that would do that. The risk is the people who bring in such things as the ceiling insulation program. You are the risk and your risk is epitomised by this ETS. That is the risk that the Labor Party is to the Australian people. In this Disneyland like trip, which was the ETS, that is Labor Party management par excellence. That is where the risk is, and the Australian people will see what a risk you people are—what an absolutely hypocritical and disastrous outcome the Labor Party would be.
It is your policy, isn’t it? It is your policy to bring in this ETS. It is your policy to rejig the Australian economy. It is your policy to make people poorer. It is your policy that you believe you can cool the temperature of the globe from a room down the corridor from this chamber. Now that is not only unbelievable; it exemplifies risk. It goes to show you that nothing else the Labor Party tells you you can take seriously, because that is who they are. In this fanciful world they live in, the fanciful world of an ETS, the fanciful world of $245 billion in gross debt, the fanciful world of ceiling insulation, the fanciful world of Labor Party economics, that is the risk they are to the Australian people. That is why the Australian people are marking you down on your economic credentials. That is why you are polling down. They are a wake-up to you.
We are going to make sure that they see more and more and more of you on this issue. We are going to watch with some interest as Prime Minister Rudd and Mr Swan and Mr Tanner come into the House and laud the benefits of this massive new tax. We are going to watch with interest. I challenge Mr Tanner to come into the other place tomorrow and talk to us about the benefits of the ETS and how this is a good outcome for the economics of our nation and how it is going to help us pay back our debt. I challenge Mr Swan, once he gets off his puerile little statements, to have the courage and conviction to talk about the ETS and what a great outcome it is. But, no, Minister Wong, they are going to leave you high and dry, because that is what they do to you, and they are doing it right now.
I do believe that Minister Wong believes in this policy. I disagree with it, but I do believe she believes in it. But the others are such philosophical mercenaries, such absolute drifters, such economic illiterates, that they would devise this massive new tax for a complete rejigging of the Australian economy, they would lay it on Minister Wong’s lap and when it blows up they would all run away. And that is exactly what they have done.
They did it, and we are going to pursue them for it. This tax has gone absolutely pear-shaped. I will watch with interest to see whether Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Mr Tanner field questions in the other place about the benefits of the ETS. Let us try them out. They want to talk about conviction; they want to talk about who is a risk. Let us see if they do that. Let us put the weight back on them. Let us see whether they actually go in and support you, Minister Wong, or whether they leave you high and dry.
I look forward to going around the seats of Dawson, the Hunter Valley and Flynn, and in marginal electorates, and explaining to them what the Labor Party has in mind for them. It is a moral issue of the Labor Party’s times. It is not the moral issue of our time; it is the moral issue of the Labor Party’s times. And it will personify the Labor Party’s times, as brief as those times will be. When the Labor Party’s times are over, so too will be the ETS. That is what is so important. When the Labor Party, the government of this nation, is finished, then that is the only time we can safely say that the ETS is finished. So we must finish the Labor Party’s role in government to finish the ETS. It is as simple as that.
But what you will see are the so-called halcyon days of the global crusade led by the Prime Minister as it all falls flat on its face after Copenhagen. We will see where this goes next. We will judge the mettle of Mr Swan, we will judge the mettle of Mr Tanner and we will judge the mettle of Mr Rudd to see if he truly is a man who knows where both of them are and whether he wants to go forward by coming into the chamber and prosecuting his case for the delivery of the ETS. This personifies his economic credentials. I am interested to see. But they will not. They will dwell on the puerile, they will dwell on the minimal. But they will not dwell on their major economic policy, the global issue, the moral issue of our times.
So I say to all people: judge them by what they do and judge them by how they act. Do not judge them by the vaudeville spectacle that is currently provided for us in the other place every day at question time. Judge the Labor Party by the ceiling insulation debacle. That is what we should judge them by. Ask yourself this question: if they could not successfully get fluffy stuff into ceilings without creating a national crisis that is going to cost tens of millions of dollars to fix, that ended up costing people’s lives and that has burned down in excess of 100 houses without this sort of calamity—watching the Labor Party is like the further escapades of Calamity Jane—how do you reckon we would be going under a Labor Party ETS? How do you think the world would now look under an ETS?
What an absolute farce. Even now they do not have the capacity, the intestinal fortitude, to walk into the chamber. If Mr Rudd is over the ETS he should walk in and say, ‘It is over; I am finishing it. I am not going forward with it.’ If he was a man of ticker, that is what he would do. But he will not do that. He plays this funny little game where he is sort of for it but he wants it to quietly die. It is really remarkable. This is what the people see. They are starting to encapsulate their view of Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Mr Tanner through their view of the ETS. They are saying: ‘That is who they are; they are the ETS—the extra tax system, the enormous tax system.’ The CPRS was initially the ‘cunning plan’ to get a double dissolution and ‘RS’ is what the economy would be if they got there. That is what it was all about. The polls were with them at that stage but now they have become something else. They have morphed—gecko-like. They have morphed into another form of creature.
—Chameleon-like!
—Chameleon. Well, it is not gecko; I was thinking of Mr Garrett’s shoulder. Yes, chameleon-like. A new species of chameleon is now developing. We will have this inquiry so that we can clearly spell out to the Australian people exactly who you are. We have to reveal all the chameleon-like tendencies, all the falsities and all the ridiculous propositions that have been put forward in this moral issue of our times. It is the biggest economic document—bigger than the GST—that has been foisted on the Australian people. We will show the Australian people the bullet that they have avoided. We know it is not going to go through. It is an absolute dog of a scheme. Everyone knows that now. We will show you what economic responsibility really is. If you want to see what irresponsibility is, it is Labor’s ETS.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-24,"—Support for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is dropping by the day. Every day there is another group coming out saying there is no need to rush this through recklessly. Look at what happens when this government rushes things through. Look at the batty batts program—rushing it through. It is embarrassing. Lives are at risk and up to $1 billion has been wasted, and all because you rushed it through. It is wise and prudent to take the time, especially when community support for a carbon pollution reduction scheme is dropping by the day. They are also getting nervous about this government being able to implement things. It is wise and prudent to use this time to look at the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and related bills through a Senate inquiry.
We have to also realise that this Senate has already agreed that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills will be considered in May. That is the earliest they are going to be considered. So why would you stand idly by and not support this Senate inquiry? Anyone who does not support this inquiry is not fair dinkum about making sure we are doing the right thing by the Australian public. These bills are scheduled to come back to the Senate in May. The Senate has agreed to that, so we should use this time wisely and prudently to look at these new bills. Rushing ahead is risky, especially with this government, as proven by the batty batts program. Look what happened with the NBN: 17 million bucks in a tender went belly up—and you are asking us to trust you on implementation. We are all getting nervous, so why not have the Senate look at these new bills to make sure that we are taking the time to consider the matter fully?  At the end of my speech, I will move the amendment which has already been circulated in the chamber. It says in part that the committee of this inquiry:
... must invite the Productivity Commission to make:
a detailed submission to the committee setting out viable alternative schemes to the CPRS and the cost and benefits under those schemes of achieving the targets that are contained in the bills ...
Let us look at other schemes. Let us have the Productivity Commission look at this rather than have the government saying, ‘Other schemes aren’t worthy.’ Subparagraph (b) of my amendment—I will not read the whole lot out as I will move the amendment at the end of my speech to add paragraph (4)—proposes that we look at ‘the potential costs to the Australian economy by committing to the targets contained in these bills before all other major world economies’, such as China, the United States of America, India and Russia, commit to targets that are lower than those that have been set out by the Rudd government. How will that impact on our economy? These are questions that need to be answered, and I think we must invite the Productivity Commission to provide a detailed submission on the matter.
I will be supporting this motion, albeit with the amendment that I have put forward, because it is wise and prudent to do so. It is not stalling the legislation, because the Senate has already agreed that the legislation is not coming up to be debated until May. So why do we not use this time prudently to have a Senate inquiry looking into the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and invite the Productivity Commission to look at two other details that I think this Senate needs to have answers to before we start debating the bills in May? I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“(4)   In undertaking the inquiry, the committee must invite the Productivity Commission to make:
a detailed submission to the committee setting out viable alternative schemes to the CPRS and the cost and benefits under those schemes of achieving the targets that are contained in the bills; and
a detailed submission to the committee setting out the potential costs to the Australian economy by committing to the targets contained in these bills before all other major world economies (including China, the United States of America, India and Russia) commit to at least the emission reduction targets, and before we know what those targets are, this detailed submission should also include the potential costs to the Australian economy if other major world economies do commit to lower emissions reduction targets and any impacts resulting from the reliance of other major economies on nuclear power sources”.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-02-24,"—What an extraordinary proposition from the opposition.
—Is Senator Wong closing the debate?
—No, Senator Boswell. It is not my motion; it is your motion. That means that I cannot close the debate. I would like to close the debate to send the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills off to an inquiry, because we have had this debate and all we had from Senator Joyce was a reiteration of the same set of conspiracy theories and, frankly, madness that we heard over a long period of time in what I think was the third longest debate in the Senate’s history—the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009.
There has been some talk about this being rushed. I say that we are in no danger whatsoever of being accused of rushing. We had 12 years of inaction under John Howard until he finally decided to adopt an emissions trading scheme as policy and this legislation has been before the Senate no fewer than four times. You might recall that the first time the opposition played procedural games so as not to have to debate it. What are they doing now? Exactly the same thing—more procedural games because they do not want the bills brought on. It is somewhat bizarre, because we have had a lot of hairy-chested noise and a lot of chest-thumping from the Leader of the Opposition. He keeps saying, ‘Bring it on!’ Yet here in the Senate chamber we saw the opposition seeking to delay yesterday and then successfully delaying debate today on this legislation until the next sitting.
While the Leader of the Opposition is saying, ‘Bring it on!’ and beating his chest, we have the opposition in the Senate wimping out because they do not want the debate. If they want the debate so much—if they want to do what Senator Joyce said and run the scare campaign they say they want to run—they should bring the debate on. But they are not doing that. They are playing procedural games deferring it until the May sittings, and now they want another inquiry.
For the information of the Senate, if this inquiry gets up it will be no less than the 15th inquiry into climate change since the Rudd government took office. There have been 15 inquiries. This is process gone mad. These are people who will do and say anything to avoid taking action on climate change. I would have more respect for the opposition if they could just reiterate what they believe, which is, as Mr Abbott said, ‘Climate change is absolute crap.’ Why don’t you just tell people that instead of playing these games in the Senate to avoid having the discussion?
While I am on the subject of some of the more remarkable things put forward in this debate, I comment as a side issue on the irony of Senator Joyce lecturing the Senate about economic risk. Senator Joyce is seen as such a liability by the coalition as the shadow minister for finance—and we know they are all lining up to take his job—that he cannot even get a question during question time on any issue to do with economics, presumably because he might mix up his millions, billions and trillions.
This matter has been before the Senate previously on four occasions. This would be the 15th inquiry into climate change since we took office. Senator Abetz says, somewhat grandiosely, ‘There are a lot of amendments.’ But he is talking about the amendments that we negotiated with the then Leader of the Opposition and Mr Macfarlane and that were endorsed in Senator Abetz’s party room. He is asking the Senate to go and do an inquiry into amendments that his party room supported before they tore down their leader. This is extraordinary. Didn’t you talk about it in your party room? You were certainly in there for many hours before you endorsed it, yet now you are going to send it off for another Senate inquiry just to make sure that we waste more taxpayers’ funds on more inquiries on an issue that you have already decided you are going to oppose. That is really the issue here: you are not referring this matter for inquiry because you actually want to find out anything. You are not referring it because you might change your minds or because you want to inquire. You have made your position absolutely clear to the extent that you have executed a leader so you do not have to vote for action on climate change. That is what you have done.
It is really quite an extraordinary abuse of process to be suggesting that there is any merit to this inquiry. We have had years of inquiry into the best way to reduce emissions in this country. Your own Prime Minister, John Howard, commissioned Peter Shergold to do a report through the Task Group on Emissions Trading. It reported whilst you were still in government and it said very clearly that the lowest cost way to reduce emissions, which is the key to dealing with climate change, is to introduce an emissions trading scheme. You went to the last election with that policy. You now have elected a man who says climate change is absolute crap. I disagree, but what you are doing is delaying debate in this place rather than simply saying, ‘Bring it on,’ having the debate and voting against the bills. I do not quite understand why it is that you would take this path.
There were a whole range of other matters, and I do not want to go into this in detail because we had a very long debate on the last occasions where many of these same issues were argued by the opposition over and over again. I remind senators on that side, when they accuse people on this side of being part of some bizarre conspiracy around the science of climate change, that even John Howard recognised the science. Margaret Thatcher recognised the science. The US Department of Defence has also indicated its view on climate change, which is that it does represent a significant threat. We know that emissions trading has been adopted in over 30 countries.
—It has not!
—It has been adopted in over 30 countries. I will take that interjection, Senator Boswell, because it would be useful if we could actually have some facts in this debate. Unfortunately, those on the other side are not interested in facts. You are not interested in the implications climate change has for our economy and our way of life. You are not interested in the risks that climate change poses to our agricultural sector.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—Senator Bernardi is well known as a man who denies the existence of climate change; he should think about what has happened in his home state of South Australia in recent years in terms of inflows into the Murray-Darling and the availability of water.
The reality is that those on the other side do not believe climate change is real. They run the Liberal Party these days. They have put forward a policy which is nothing more than a climate con job to get them through to the election, which is what you would expect from a party that is run by people who do not believe climate change is real. But what is really bizarre is that you have Mr Abbott beating his chest about ‘bringing it on’ at the same time as his senators are playing procedural games so as not to have the debate here, and now want the 15th inquiry, as I said, into climate change since the Rudd government came to power.
The government does not support this referral. It is just another delaying tactic from the opposition—people who, no matter what evidence is presented to them, currently wish not to act.
—Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think the minister would have to reflect on how this can be a delaying tactic when—
—That’s no point of order.
—Sorry, the Senate has already agreed that this legislation would not come back before May.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—There is no point of order.
—Senator Fielding, whose views on climate change are well known—
—Oh, nail him up!
—No. I will take that injection. Senator Johnston just said, ‘Nail him up.’ I have never used language like that. It is only those on that side who have used language like that.
—That’s what you use.
—You have never heard me using language like that. This is not an unknown tactic. When you wish to speak—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you. It is not an unknown tactic, is it: when people want to use the language of prejudice, they then accuse others of using it. The reality is that those are not words that I use, Senator; they are words you have used. It is true that Senator Fielding’s views on climate change are well known. I disagree with them—he is entitled to them, but I disagree with them. I think it is irresponsible to take this view, given the risk to Australia now and in the future.
—Oh, there’s a personal comment; there’s an attack.
—Order!
—There are some people in this chamber who do not really treat this chamber with much respect. What I was, I think, trying to point out before the interjection by the frontbencher representing the opposition is this: we wanted these bills brought on. Senator Fielding refers to the delay. I remind him that he delivered the delay with the opposition. He voted with the opposition to ensure these bills were delayed again, so it is a little disingenuous for him to come in here and talk about this issue of delay when he in fact ensured that the coalition’s delaying tactics worked. He should be upfront about that.
The government does not support this motion. This is a motion, again, to defer consideration. This is a motion to provide the 15th inquiry since we have come to government on a policy that was negotiated with and supported by your party room.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

—I acknowledge you have changed position. You now have elected a man who thinks climate change is absolute crap. That has made Senator Bernardi very happy. But the reality is that no amount of inquiry, no amount of discussion and no amount of debate is going to change your minds. So you have to wonder what is the real agenda behind yet another delaying attack from an opposition that has done nothing but oppose and delay action on climate change, both in government and, now, in opposition since last year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-02-24,"—The resolution that we are debating now is to refer the ETS, or the CPRS, to a committee. Senator Wong says we have done all that and we have had 15 inquiries. I suppose in some way she is right. But the reason we do need an inquiry is that the whole bill has changed. It fell to the ground in a heap of custard at Copenhagen. When Senator Wong went to Copenhagen with her 109 colleagues, or whoever she took over there—I suppose someone has to carry the hairdryer—
—Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I rise on a point of order. I find those sexist remarks unparliamentary and I would ask that the senator withdraw them. I have been in this Senate for quite some years and in the Tasmanian parliament for 10 years and I am over the fact that people can make disparaging remarks of that kind. I would seek that they be withdrawn.
—I withdraw. Because Senator Milne has asked me to withdraw, I will withdraw. I do have some regard for her. What I was saying to Senator Wong is that the whole bill has changed. The bill was based on the fact that Australia, Canada, the EU, the former Soviet Union, Japan and annex B countries would be in a scheme from 2010, with China and higher income developing countries being in the scheme from 2015. India and the middle-income countries would be in the scheme from 2020. And there would be full coverage—that is, everyone in an ETS, right around the world—from 2025. That is what the modelling was based on. I do not know how you were ever going to achieve it. I could never see it working. I sat back and thought, ‘This is going to be a disaster beyond all disasters,’ but I never thought it would be the disaster that it turned out to be.
What this parliament now has in front of it is a bill that has been modelled on the assumption that all the countries in the world would be involved in an ETS scheme by 2025. That clearly did not happen in Copenhagen. What happened in Copenhagen, as everyone knows, is that very little was achieved. What was achieved was that there was no agreement on mandatory targets, no process of verification of targets, no treaty and no timetable, and there was some vague commitment that the world would try, by all doing their own thing, to hold the temperatures at around two per cent. That was the outcome of Copenhagen and that is the agreement that the Labor Party signed off on. I put it to the Senate that the whole package of bills that is being offered to the parliament has changed. It changed at Copenhagen, because the modelling that was predicted was that all would be in it by 2025. The prediction that small business would be okay and would be reimbursed was on the presumption that overseas competitors would not have any advantage, because we would all be in a scheme. The prediction for pensioners was predicted on us all being in a scheme. We know that is not going to happen.
If you are going to present this legislation again to the parliament, you have to go back and remodel the predictions and the assumptions. The bill that you are putting before the parliament now and which we are referring to a committee has to be changed. You are putting up something now that is a fraud, a con, because you know it cannot work the way in which your modelling predicted. That is the reason that we should be sending it to a committee. I do not know which way the numbers will fall, but what I do know is that the legislation on the table is wrong. It is being presented to this parliament wrongly, because the assumptions are wrong.
Also, what Senator Wong signed up to was that we had to get the non-developed countries as part of a climate regime scheme. The world had to put $30 billion on the table between 2010 and 2012, and from 2012 until 2020 the world had to stump up with $100 billion. Senator Milne and I have continually asked Senator Wong: what is our share? We have not been told what our share is, unless Senator Milne has received some information that I have not received. Both of us have tried to find out what our share will be. That amount of money has to be referred to a Senate committee. What is our share of $30 billion for the lemon of a program that the government pushes forward? What is our proportion of $100 billion in 2020? How are we going to raise that money? Is it by tax or is it by some sort of levy? One of the proposals that the government supported was a tax or a levy on aviation and shipping fuel. This will further penalise our exports. These are the things that have to be presented to a committee so that we can get the information. I am sure that Senator Milne would agree with me. These are the things that the parliament must know before we proceed with debating legislation.
What we are debating is an entirely different bill to the one that was before Copenhagen, that assumed we would all be in one big happy party by 2025. We would all be in it—China, Russia, India, Brazil; we would all be one big happy family all joined up in an ETS. Well, it was never going to work; I could never see how it was going to work. I could never see how the world was all going to join together; I could never see how America was going to sign an ETS with a 10 per cent unemployment rate. It was just a Labor Party pipedream that could never happen. And it was exposed in Copenhagen.
Now you have the greatest lemon of a policy that has ever been presented—at least in my 30 years in this place. It started off that everyone was full of vigour and the people wanted it. They wanted it until they could see that they were going to be the only ones who were going to pay their insurance policy. I refer to some Galaxy polling that was done before Copenhagen. The polling said about 54 per cent did not want to do it until after Copenhagen; about 34 per cent wanted to do it straightaway. As the debate heated up people could see that they were going to be the only ones paying the insurance policy, and Australia would be the only one that would be involved in an ETS and the rest of the world were not going to be involved. And how close we came to that. How very, very close this nation came to the greatest disaster of all time; if we had put that legislation through. Senator Wong keeps using the 30 countries. Let me tell Senator Wong: yes, if she uses the EU as 30 countries—there are probably 27 or 28 countries in it—but because it is one collective economy, we would have been the only independent economy that would have been stupid enough, silly enough to actually vote. And how close we came! One vote and there was a change of leadership; one vote the other way and Australia was down the drain by $120 billion—and that is close. I hope the people who are listening to this realise just how close they came to Australia being saddled with a $120 billion tax, which was turned around by Tony Abbott and his colleagues. It was turned around, but it was such a close call.
You have to wonder. If you cannot sell $2 billion worth of batts and you are not marketing them, then you are just giving them away for virtually nothing. If you cannot do that, how are you going to run the most complicated, convoluted scheme that has ever been presented to the world—a world government scheme and everyone has to play their part? You can imagine how complicated that would be. And if you do not have the capacity to give $2 billion worth of batts away, you have absolutely no chance of ever coming to terms with an ETS.
The game is up. Senator Conroy understands that the game is up. Most of the hardheads in the Labor Party know that the game is up, but they cannot find the escape route. That is their problem. They cannot find an escape route. If they go with the Greens, they will get castigated. If they pull out, they will lose what we call the doctors’ wives votes, the soft leafy suburbs. So they are stuck. They would love to get out of it. If someone could give them a way out, if someone could release them from this $120 billion lemon that they have tied around their neck—
—A stinking cat!
—It is like a stinking cat tied around their neck and they cannot find a way to get rid of it.
It is a gold mine for us. We will go around every working-class seat and say: ‘Your jobs are on the line. You’ve got a choice. If you want to vote for Kevin Rudd, you’ll be voting for an ETS. You will be voting for a stinking cat that is going to cost you $120 billion, it’s going to put the industries that you work in—the mining industries, the aluminium industry, the steel industry, the glass industry, the cement industry—at risk and it’s going to put your jobs at risk. The government will make your industries anti-competitive. It was so before Copenhagen, but it is doubly so now.’ But the government are hell-bent on putting this legislation through. They come here and want to get it through. They want to get it through today. I would not vote for something that is not even a true reflection of what is in the bill. The bill is finished. They have to go back and remodel it, present their remodelling to the parliament and then ask the parliament to vote on something that is real. But they are presenting a fraud, a con to the parliament of Australia and they know it.
The modelling is wrong. Canada, United States, China, Russia—the big emitters—have said, ‘We’re not going to have a bar of this.’ And you could have said that before we even went to Copenhagen. How could America, with 10 per cent unemployment—it would probably be worse if it did not have such a huge defence force—vote for it? How could it get through congress? It just could not. It was never going to work. But those opposite believe they can get it through in some sneaky way in a form that is not really reflecting what is in the bill.
If the Labor Party want to go ahead with this—I cannot see how they can get out of it—then with Senator Joyce and Senator Bernardi and Senator ‘Whacker’ Williams, I will be out in the field. This is politics. We will be telling all of those blue-collar workers that Labor has ratted on them. The Labor people have ratted on the blue-collar worker because they want to keep the green section of their party happy!
—Like you ratted when you sold Telstra!
—If you want to talk about Telstra, we can do that on another date. We are talking about ratting on the blue-collar workers that you are supposed to represent. You are going to cost them their jobs; you are going to desert them. You just want to bring in a bit of subterfuge about Telstra—
—Subterfuge!
—Yes, it is subterfuge. We are debating the greatest cause of job losses in Australia, and it is hard to believe that it is the ALP that is doing it. They are doing it to their own blue-collar workers because they have probably made some pact with the soft, leafy suburb sections of their party. It is just a free kick in front of goal for the conservative forces in every working class suburb. I have seen the polls just falling away overnight. I indicated that in a Galaxy poll the figure had gone up to 60 per cent not wanting to do anything before Copenhagen. Those wanting to go ahead had fallen from 34 per cent in a poll a week before to 27 per cent. If you take the Greens out of that 27 per cent, and that is 12 per cent and going up and the government vote is going down, you end up with about 12 per cent support.
If we are going to go through this facade of presenting legislation to the parliament, then the Australian people want to know that what we are debating is a true and accurate reflection of what is in the bill. It is not, and it never was since Copenhagen. They also want to know where our share of the $30 billion is coming from, and the $100 billion we have to pay the non-developed countries. Until the government tells us these things, they are just not telling the truth. They are not telling the Australian people what it is all about. I have tried and tried with Senator Milne—we often do not agree on things; sometimes we do, as we do on this issue—to find out what our share of the $30 billion is, what our share of the $100 billion is and how we are going to fund it. It is not small bikkies; it is big bikkies. The government has to tell us these things. They have to tell the electorate. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. That is what you are trying to do by presenting this ETS bill. Your assumptions on small business, pensioners, overseas trade and everything else are wrong. This matter has to go to a committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-02-24,"—There are any number of questions that one could raise and should raise about the government’s ill-named, in fact deceitfully named, Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is a government that has clearly failed to level with the Australian people, because they bought the assumption that the Liberal Party and the coalition would walk willingly with them through this forest of economic disaster and deceit. They tried to deceive the Australian people by saying they were going to create green jobs and it was not going to have any adverse impact on the world; it was going to be picked up by all countries around the world, and Copenhagen was going to be a spectacular success.
I have to say that not all Labor members did that. They were very disciplined. But a number of people felt deeply uncomfortable with this. Although Minister Garrett’s judgement is absolutely flawed in regard to the installation of insulation, he also feels deeply uncomfortable because in his heart he is a deep green movement person. He knows this is not an environmental policy; it is an economic policy that is designed to grab $10 billion—that will pick the pockets of the Australian people to the tune of $10 billion—every year by targeting big business and then pretending that big business, or business, will not pass those costs on. But of course they have also ignored the impact on small business—the heart and soul, the very driving force, of our economy—who have had their pockets picked by Mr Rudd and his team of extremists.
