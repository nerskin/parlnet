"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2017-09-14,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (09:33):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill sets out amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 to enable to proprietary companies in Australia to access crowdsourced equity funding.


This will be a game changer, once again, for Australian start-ups and new small businesses.


This is yet another example of the Turnbull government getting on with the job and taking action now by backing-in businesses, getting the settings right to create jobs and help our economy transition.


The extension of Australia's crowdsourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies delivers on the announcement made in the 2017-18 budget and demonstrates the government's commitment to fostering a more innovative and creative Australian economy, by ensuring that start-ups and early-stage businesses can access the funding they need.


Facilitating access to crowdsourced equity is part of the government's agenda to develop a strong and vibrant fin-tech industry in Australia.


That is why this government introduced the crowdsourced equity funding for public companies framework late last year. Extending crowdsourced equity funding to private companies through this bill will enable more innovative companies and start-ups to obtain funding from a crowd of investors. In return for being able to have an unlimited number of crowdfunding shareholders, participating proprietary companies will have higher governance reporting obligations to protect the large number of investors they will be able to have.


Many of the features of the existing public company framework which the government introduced last year, such as the obligations of intermediaries and the process of making crowdfunding offers, will be the same for proprietary companies. This will reduce complexity for intermediaries, crowdfunding companies and investors.


We have consulted widely and have listened to entrepreneurs and businesses, who tell us that it can be difficult for innovative, early-stage businesses, who are often proprietary companies to access funding from traditional sources. Proprietary companies wanting to access equity crowdfunding will no longer have to convert to public company type, with its more onerous obligations. Instead, founders will be able to crowdfund while retaining the greater flexibility of the proprietary model.



Increasing the attractiveness of equity crowdfunding will also increase the pool of potential investments, giving investors the opportunity to share in the risks and successes of these growing businesses. Recognising that this extension is a new approach to the proprietary company framework in Australia, the government has balanced the importance of investor protection, transparency and good corporate governance standards with what can be significant costs of compliance.


This bill complements the Turnbull government's financial sector and innovation policies such as tax incentives for angel investors in start-ups and announcements in this year's budget including the open banking review currently underway; the development of an enhanced regulatory sandbox for new and innovative financial services; and changes to the tax treatment of digital currencies.


The government has consulted at length on this extension of this policy to proprietary companies, releasing a consultation paper in 2015 followed by industry roundtables in 2016. The government also released the draft legislation for public consultation in May 2017. Submissions expressed widespread support for the extension of the crowdsourced equity-funding framework to proprietary companies.


I would like to thank all of the stakeholders who participated in these consultations over the past two years. It is important that the regulatory framework for crowdsourced equity funding for proprietary companies operates effectively to maximise the benefits to businesses, intermediaries and investors. Stakeholder feedback has assisted with the development of a framework that achieves this. I would particularly like to thank the fin-tech Advisory Group that has been working closely with me on all of these issues, lead by Craig Dunn and his very willing and enthusiastic team, and who are making an enormous difference through their engagement with the Turnbull government.


I would now like to turn to the provisions of the bill.


This bill removes the regulatory barriers preventing eligible proprietary companies from accessing the crowdsourced equity-funding framework.


To ensure proprietary companies can effectively access the framework without breaching the 50 shareholder cap that currently applies to proprietary companies, investors who acquire shares through crowdfunding offers will not be counted towards the cap. Subsequent transfers by crowdfunding investors who on sell their shares will also be exempt if the company is not listed on a financial market. This will give crowdfunding investors flexibility to exit their investment without causing the company to inadvertently breach the shareholder cap and forcing it to convert to public company type.


Further, the government is very proud of the flexibility it has built into the regime. Proprietary companies with shareholders who acquire shares through a crowdfunding offer will not be subject to the takeovers rules. For founders contemplating crowdsourced equity funding, this will give them certainty that they can crowdfund and still seek further funding to grow the business without contravening the costly and complex takeover provisions. To ensure investors are protected, the bill includes a regulation making power to allow the government to respond quickly by imposing additional conditions on this exemption if required.


Acknowledging that proprietary companies that access crowdsourced equity funding will no longer be closely held, these companies will be required to comply with additional obligations to protect investors.


Proprietary companies with crowdfunding shareholders will be required to prepare financial reports in accordance with accounting standards, with financial statements to be audited once the company raises at least $3 million from crowdfunding offers. Financial transparency will allow investors to monitor progress of companies and make informed decisions about their investment.



Crowdfunding proprietary companies will be required to have a minimum of two directors, rather than the usual one director. This will provide greater transparency and certainty around succession planning. As proprietary companies that use crowdfunding will rely on public funding, the restrictions on related party transactions under part 2E of the Corporations Act 2001 will be extended to crowdfunding proprietary companies to ensure that individual investors have appropriate protections against the risk of fraud and bias from the transactions with related parties.


As the bill enables proprietary companies to access crowdsourced equity funding, the bill also removes the temporary concessions from certain public company reporting and governance obligations that were included in the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Act 2017. These concessions will be grandfathered for companies that register as or convert to public company status prior to the commencement of the extension of the framework to proprietary companies. However, to ensure consistency for those public companies eligible for the grandfathered concessions, the bill increases the audit threshold for eligible public companies from $1 million to $3 million.


The bill further improves the overall crowdsourced equity funding framework by reducing the withdrawal period after a company issues a supplementary or replacement offer document from one month to 14 days. A 14-day withdrawal period still gives investors adequate time to reconsider their investment, while providing greater certainty about the outcome of the offer for other potential investors and the company.


The extension of the crowdsourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies will take effect six months from the date the bill receives royal assent. The changes to the crowdsourced equity funding framework for public companies, excluding the removal of the corporate governance concessions, will commence on royal assent.


The 2017-18 budget provided the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with $4.5 million over four years to implement and monitor the extension of the framework. This funding will be recovered from regulated entities.


The government proposes to make regulations to support the operation of the measures in this bill.


Introducing this bill today delivers on the government's commitment to extend equity crowdfunding to proprietary companies. Unlocking a new source of funding delivers on our commitment to foster innovative economic activity and support the development of the Australian fin-tech sector.


Once again, I want to thank all of those who participated in this consultation to ensure that we are getting these measures right. I also particularly want to thank the Treasury officials, who have worked very hard on this over a long period of time, and have worked very constructively with industry, demonstrating, I think, an excellent relationship between Treasury and the corporate sector in getting these measures right.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (10:44):  I am pleased to speak on the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, which will boost the Australian economy, creating prosperity and jobs for hardworking Australians. And I'm pleased to see the Minister for Small Business here in the chamber. It is his complete, utter and entire focus—isn't it, Minister?—that we will create more jobs for hardworking Australians and make sure that businesses can do their very best for our nation.


This tax plan is about encouraging employers to invest in and grow their businesses, which ensures greater job security for workers, more employment and higher wages growth. By reducing the company tax rate, our government will give businesses the certainty they need to plan for long-term growth in Australia. This will unlock so much untapped potential for private sector investment, allowing us to better compete globally.


A high corporate tax rate ultimately hurts hardworking Australians, with the companies' tax burden falling on employees through lower real wages growth. With a tough global economic environment, the task falls to the Liberal and National coalition government to implement ambitious policies to boost our nation's economy. We have already passed—earlier this year—the first part of the enterprise tax plan, which lowered the rate for 3.2 million small and medium-sized businesses, employing over 6.5 million Australians, but we cannot stop there. This bill will extend that tax reduction to the remainder of Australian businesses before the rate is dropped to a more internationally competitive rate of 25 per cent in 2026-27. This will be the lowest corporate tax rate since the mid-1960s. And don't we need that! Don't our businesses and our workers need that. Australia has gone from having the ninth-lowest corporate tax rate out of developed economies in 2001 to having the equal fifth-highest today. That's a very disappointing result, which is why we are working hard to turn it around. It means that if a business is looking at identical projects in two countries, each with exactly the same return on investment, it will choose a country other than Australia because of our higher corporate tax rate, which is not the outcome that we want. Indeed, Treasury modelling has found that our current tax system is a drag on the economy. Based on this, we know that a more efficient tax system would help grow the economy, creating opportunities for all Australians.


This is part of our national economic plan. Along with our enterprise tax plan, the coalition government are opening up new markets in our region for Australian exporters through comprehensive free trade agreements. This is particularly important for our farmers. My mum and dad are farmers, so I know full well how important is lowering tariffs and charges on our agricultural products overseas. Education also is one of our major exports from Australia. I have Flinders University right in the heart of my electorate of Boothby. It's a very fine educational institution, and it's trying hard to grow its share of the international student market. The government are also investing $70 billion in productivity-enhancing infrastructure across Australia. I have been very lucky to see the results of some of this with the Darlington upgrade and the extension of the Tonsley rail line up to Flinders University, which is a key part of Flinders University's plan to build new student accommodation, in particular, to attract more international students. We are also, as a government, delivering on a comprehensive 20-year defence industry plan, which is critical for my home state of South Australia, and we're implementing significant reforms to improve competition and choice for Australian consumers. We have secured record funding for our schools and our hospitals. We're protecting Australia's revenue base through some of the world's toughest anti-tax-avoidance laws—we're cracking down on those companies who try their hardest to not pay tax here in Australia.


These policies are already delivering for the Australian people. Recently we've seen the highest rate of jobs growth in 10 years, along with the highest business confidence in 10 years. It's no coincidence that the last time we saw such promising figures was when Mr Howard was in government, along with Treasurer Peter Costello, who provided fantastic economic leadership for our nation. We had some very fine National Party leaders at the same time as well, didn't we, Minister for Small Business?




Mr McCormack:
  Indeed we did!




Ms FLINT:
  It is no coincidence that these figures bear a great degree of correlation. Some 240,000 jobs were created over the past financial year, and job advertisements are up by over 13 per cent. The latest jobs data reveals that 210,800 full-time jobs have been created in the past six months alone. This is the strongest full-time jobs growth since records began 40 years ago. It's a very impressive outcome, isn't it, Minister?



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Ms FLINT:
  Full-time employment growth is outperforming part-time growth, which is very positive news. In total, over 736,000 jobs have been created since the coalition government came to office, and over 80 per cent of these have been full-time. Add to this the fact that wages paid to employees rose by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter, retail trade rose 1.2 per cent and manufacturing output is at the highest level in 15 years and we can see how our coalition government policies are enhancing and accelerating our nation's economic recovery. Without a doubt, we can say that these achievements are a credit to and the result of strong Liberal Party and National Party government of the nation.


The national accounts data released last week reinforce the trend we've seen picking up under the coalition. Real growth in the economy was 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, more than double the 0.3 per cent in the March quarter. Based on these figures and other indications, the government will likely achieve a better than budgeted final year outcome for the underlying cash balance for the previous financial year. The largest contributor to growth in the last financial year was household consumption, which increased by 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter to be 2.6 per cent higher than a year ago. The government's investments in productive infrastructure are also creating solid growth, with new public final demand rising by 2.1 per cent, driven by an 8.6 per cent boost in government investment. Our $75 billion infrastructure investment will be used to build roads, railways, water infrastructure and other strategic projects, one of which is the grade separation of the rail line near Westfield Marion, in my electorate of Boothby, a problem that has been in existence for some 40 years. I am really pleased to have been able to deliver that for my local community.


Our defence industry plan is delivering for the economy, particularly in my home state of South Australia. Defence investment was up 26.3 per cent in the last quarter thanks to my government's prioritisation of the defence industry and national security.


When we take into account that this is only the beginning of implementing our National Economic Plan, that's when we can begin to realise and understand the sheer volume of untapped economic potential that my government is unlocking. But while the government unlock the economics of opportunity in Australia, our achievements are placed at risk by those opposite, who want to tax Australians into oblivion once again. While under the coalition all Australians are sharing in the benefits of this economic growth, those opposite, the Labor Party, would levy $150 billion of new taxes on Australians, with families and small businesses to bear the brunt of this tax pain. Under their tax plan, no Australian is safe. Everyone is in the sights of Labor's unprecedented tax grab—families, singles, retirees and, in particular, small businesses, which are the economic engine room of the nation. Under Labor's tax plan no Australian is safe; they really aren't.


The grim reality of a Labor government will be tax upon tax upon tax to pay for their insatiable appetite to spend the money of hardworking Australians. They are going after workers, savers, home owners, professionals and the small business owners of Australia. Let's have a look at few of Labor's policies. Their permanently higher top marginal tax rate will take about half of every dollar earned above an income level that is now just over twice the average weekly earnings—a wage which many middle-income-earning Australians aspire to. They have proposed a negative gearing tax grab on wage earners in middle Australia again. For example, a nurse on a wage of $50,000 a year who invests in property with $7,000 in annual net rental losses would under Labor face a whopping tax increase of 41 per cent. They have launched an attack on self-funded retirees with their planned ban on limited recourse borrowing arrangements. They have proposed to introduce a tax policy on trusts, which, again, is an attack on small businesses. The policy singles out as Labor enemies stay-at-home mums, students, doctors and accountants, hitting beneficiaries on $37,000 a year the hardest.


Labor would scrap and reverse our Enterprise Tax Plan, increasing taxes on the 3.2 million Australian small businesses that employ 6.5 million Australians. It is a lot of employees that these small businesses are responsible for, and most of them are, by definition, low or middle-income earners that the small businesses are supporting.


I'm interested to know whether those opposite really think that the politics of envy is going to propel them into government. While they stoke division and resentment in the Australian community they are doing our nation a disservice. There was a reason for the historic failure of socialism. When you're in government, if you pursue equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunity, the people suffer. The people in our community who are best able to contribute to our success as a nation will either lose their incentive to work hard to be successful or they'll leave Australia altogether to go overseas to work hard and be successful. We don't want a nation that's encouraged to be mediocre and to stagnate. 


Labor's policies will ultimately make it much harder for Australians to get ahead, but, you know, we're quite used to that from those opposite, unfortunately. It's been disappointing to see those opposite step back from their previous positions, where they did support cutting tax rates and encouraging our businesses to grow so that they were productive and employing as many Australians as possible. But, as we know, the Australian people are much smarter than those opposite give them credit for, which, I think, is why we see them not gaining much traction, particularly in this area. 


The Australian people know which party they can trust with the economy. They know that the Liberal Party and the Nationals, the coalition government, will not keep dipping into their incomes and their savings. We're here to support hardworking Australians, our small and medium businesses, our bigger businesses and the thousands and millions of Australians that they employ. Our government is committed to growing the economy and helping fund the services that Australians rely on now and into the future. I'm pleased to commend the government's bill to the House.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (10:57):  I do rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, but I really must respond to the member for Boothby. What a lot of rot from this alumnus of the IPA—that bunch of neo-Liberal right wingers who still believe absolutely in the failed policies of trickle-down economics. They somehow believe that if you give more money to the top end of town and give more money to the corporations and the CEOs, somehow, it will magically trickle down to the rest of the population. It hasn't worked in America for 40 years. The middle class in America has been gutted. It is non-existent now because of the failed policies of Reagan and Thatcher, and this mob over here wants to see them imported into Australia. We have one of the greatest societies, one of the greatest economies and one of the greatest countries on earth built on egalitarianism and built on a sense of a fair go. It was built on a fair industrial relations system and a fair sense of equity of income, and these guys want to tear it down because, somehow, they look at America and they actually like what they see. They like to see the middle class gutted, they like to see the billionaires become multibillionaires and they somehow think that's good for the rest of us. It hasn't worked. It just hasn't worked. The evidence is before your eyes.


The member for Boothby was talking about high taxes—what a cheek! I mean, the government has come into this place actually proposing higher taxes for Australians earning up to $87,000 a year, tax cuts for people earning more than $180,000 a year and tax cuts for corporations of up to $50 billion over 10 years.



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  It is $50 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. I will take the minister's interjection. Yes, I accept what he's saying. Well, it is $65 billion actually, when you take the total. Some $65 billion in tax cuts to corporations over the next 10 years is the government's grand plan. Why? Because they say it's going to be better for the economy. But their own figures show that if you give $65 billion back in tax to the big corporations, the net result for GDP—for growth in this country—will be an incredible, magnificent, rocketing 0.1 per cent over 10 years. That's their grand plan for economic growth in this country. There will be $65 billion in tax handouts to big banks and corporations and 0.1 per cent growth in GDP. What an absolute joke! They think they're the best economic managers that this country has to offer. I've got news for them: evidence says otherwise.


The member for Boothby—a goldmine of ridiculousness—said that if we don't give tax breaks to big corporations they will all lose the incentive to be here. That somehow there will be this big flood of companies leaving Australia because they will lose the incentive to be here. They will go somewhere else with their business. What a load of rubbish! There are countries in this world that charge companies a lot more tax than Australia. They manage to keep their companies and they manage to keep their corporations. Business will stay wherever they can make a profit, and every business knows that there are good profits to be made in Australia. It's a stable economy, it's a stable political system, and people have relatively good incomes. Despite the efforts of those opposite who want to cut incomes, cut penalty rates and increase taxes on middle Australia, Australia is a good place to do business. I'm pleased that the minister acknowledges 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth thanks to the policies implemented by Labor under Hawke and Keating. 


We all love a tax cut. I love a tax cut. Who doesn't love a tax cut? But you have tax cuts when you can afford them. How this mob over here can say: 'Oh, we can give $65 billion to big corporations and banks, but to pay for it we're going to take $3.8 billion over the next five years off universities. We're going to take billions of dollars out of schools. We're going to take money out of hospitals. We're going to take money out of infrastructure.' Honestly, the people of Australia want services and goods. They want a standard of living. They know they're not going to get it from a $65 billion handout to corporations and banks. 


Now let me get to the substance of this bill—having dealt with the member for Boothby's ridiculous contribution. I note that the bill comes before the House in an amended form following amendments moved by Labor in the Senate which were successful. The changes initiated by Labor will require a review of this bill's safe-harbour provisions after two years to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. That's important because, even with the best of intentions, we don't know where this is going to go so we need to review it after two years. We're pleased that the Senate agreed and that the government agreed to implement those amendments. 


This bill makes some significant changes to the way companies act when trading insolvent. It provides breathing space for responsible change in corporate structure or business practices to enable a business to get through tough times. Today, it's an unfortunate reality that announcing an intention to enter voluntary administration can be, in effect, the kiss of death for a struggling business. You go into voluntary administration in order to try and keep your business going, but that signals to the market that somehow you're in deep trouble. What happens of course is that suppliers stop supplying and customers stop buying. Voluntary administration is supposed to send a signal to the market that although a company is struggling, it's salvageable. Unfortunately, the very act of entering into it can set off a chain of events that can make matters worse, and that's an outcome in no-one's interest except the vultures who swoop in to devour the entrails. We see that happening all the time: companies go into voluntary administration and some joker comes in and swoops it up at a cheap price and carries on the business. That's not fair. 


Currently, companies must stop trading as soon as the directors believe they may be insolvent. That makes sense. You shouldn't be able to trade and take on new liabilities when you suspect that you don't have the means to pay your existing bills. But it's a rule that is so inflexible that, arguably, it can do more harm than good. This bill seeks to allow some flexibility with conditions, and the conditions are important. With safe harbour, this legislation will create a safe harbour for company directors from personal liability for trading while insolvent. A key condition is that directors must be honestly and diligently taking a course of action that is reasonably likely to lead to a better outcome for the company than the immediate appointment of an administrator or liquidator. The intent is sound. We all would much rather see a struggling business get back on its feet than close its doors. 


Labor's amendments, which the government has agreed to incorporate, will see the safe-harbour provision reviewed after two years to ensure there are no unforeseen consequences. That's a sensible measure, bringing together both flexibility and accountability. Importantly, safe harbour is not available where the company is failing to meet its obligations to pay its employees, including superannuation; where the company fails to meet its tax reporting obligations; and when a person fails to provide an administrator or liquidator with certain required information, such as a company's books.


So, while supportive of this bill, I am disappointed, however, that it fails to deal with the issue of phoenixing. Phoenixing occurs when a company's directors strip cash and assets from a company, liquidate the company and then reopen for business with a different ABN and different signage. Closing the business down in such a manner strips employees of their entitlements and creditors of their ability to sue for payment. Phoenixing rips off creditors and staff, but also the wider Australian community. A report earlier this year by the University of Melbourne and Monash University said that phoenixing companies, which cost the Australian economy billions of dollars a year, is too easy, too cheap, lucrative and largely invisible. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the cost to the economy at a staggering $3.2 billion, simply from companies that go bust and then start up again, having wiped off their obligations to their employees and their creditors.


I do note the news from this week, where the government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into finally taking action on phoenixing, four months—four months!—after Labor unveiled our own policy to tackle dodgy directors. Since May, this side of the House has been calling for the introduction of company director ID numbers, which make it easier for authorities to track the spivs who kill their companies and start up again. Director IDs are backed by the Productivity Commission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. It's taken the government four months, but it's reluctantly come on board—although not all the way. We note that penalties are still too low and that the government has failed to introduce an objective test for transactions that deprive hardworking and innocent employees of their entitlements. So, I acknowledge the announcement this week, but it's a shame the government had to be dragged into making the decision rather than coming to it early. And it's a shame that it did not take the opportunity to include antiphoenixing provisions in this bill.


Part 2 of this bill sets out new provisions to stop the enforcement of ipso facto clauses that are triggered when a company enters administration. An ipso facto clause creates a contractual right that allows one party to terminate or modify the operation of a contract upon the occurrence of some specific event. Currently, such rights may allow one party to terminate a contract because of the financial position of the company, even though the company is still meeting its obligations to that party. So, for example, if a company has a short-term lack of liquidity which leads directors to appoint a voluntary administrator, an ipso facto clause might allow a major supplier to cancel their contract even though the administered business is still meeting all its payment obligations to that supplier. Cancelling supply may then starve the business of the opportunity to continue to trade while it restructures, which then brings on a liquidation which may otherwise not have occurred. So the operation of such clauses may in fact destroy the ability of the business to restructure, destroy the value of the business and prevent the sale of the business as a going concern.


The regulation power under this bill includes an anti-avoidance mechanism to enable the government to respond to possible contractor agreements that are drafted or prepared in a way to circumvent its provisions. Regulations can carve out certain contracts from the application of these clauses. This amendment will not stop parties from terminating a contract with a company for any other reason, such as a breach involving nonpayment or nonperformance, so those rights are protected. This legislation, in theory, gives business, and particularly small business, a fighting chance of making its way through a tough time, utilising fresh eyes and fresh ideas and without stigma.


Of course, prevention is better than cure. Ideally, we should be doing more to encourage businesspeople to receive practical training in finance, employment responsibilities, resilience and adaptability. Stronger businesses are in everyone's best interests. Carl Gunther, New South Wales Head of Restructuring and National Turnaround Lead notes:


Whilst legislative changes proposed by government are a key element to reform, ultimately early intervention by company directors when indicators of financial distress arise is the best form of defence to claims of insolvent trading. Director's reluctance to call for help continues to result (sadly) in the high volumes of insolvencies in Australia and until this changes no amount of legislative reform will make a difference.


So it's pertinent to note that those opposite are making such training harder by cutting back on TAFE and continuing to encourage the failed privatisation of the training sector. We urge them in all sincerity to give a good, hard look to what they are doing to the TAFE and training sector in this country. Too many paid-up students have fallen victim to failed private organisations, and I still shake my head at a system that allowed Careers Australia to vacuum $40 million out of its own accounts, send them offshore and then, just months later, close the business down, claiming it had no cash. So today's legislation is a start, but we need to dig deeper.


This bill may indeed change the face of Australia's corporate culture. It may even give experienced directors more confidence to join start-up boards. Time will tell. We are cautiously optimistic, but our final position will be evidence based. The results of the review in two years will be instructive. This legislation is about business, and Labor is a friend of business—especially small business.



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  No, the chicken hawk can laugh, but Labor really is a friend of business and small business. The fact is we know small business is the engine of employment in this country and we are friends of small business. You can't go around calling corporations small businesses. It's just a nonsense. You can't go around calling Westpac and Commonwealth Bank small businesses.


We know small business runs on tight margins and we know times can get really tough, which is why we have an open mind about the merits of the legislation. Australia is home to 2.1 million small businesses and Tasmania home to 37,000 of them, a number of them in my electorate. They employ around 100,000 Tasmanians. They are vital, especially in regional communities like mine. I know it's almost a rite of passage for small business to criticise government, but the real threat to small business is big business, and it's time this government got on the side of small business and stopped protecting their big-business mates.

"Littleproud, David, MP",Nats,2017-09-14,"



Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa) (11:12):  It gives me great pleasure to arise this afternoon and speak in favour of this legislation, because it is the government's responsibility to set the environment and infrastructure around its people—not to get caught up in its lies but to put the environment and infrastructure around them to allow them to innovate, to grow and to invest. That's a government's responsibility. That's what we did back in March when we passed the first tranche of this legislation, passing tax cuts onto small businesses. It's quite interesting that the member for Lyons, the champion of small business, proclaims to know and understand it all. I challenge him and those opposite to understand and know what a small business is. Many on this side, including me, own a small business, have to pay the wages and the electricity, have to understand how to keep it open. Real representation is to understand what economic levers need to be pulled to ensure we get the growth and get the engine room of this nation moving. That's what we did back in March.


But no. These great champions of small business stood in our way and tried to stop it. The hypocrisy of them to come in here and say they are the champions of small business is nothing short of laughable. The reality is we are making the legislative changes. We are pulling the economic levers that are driving growth for small business. There are over 3.2 million small businesses that will take advantage of all of these cuts that we'll be undertaking. But it also ensures that we are going to get now a next level of investment.


Those opposite don't understand the flow of capital. We have to be competitive. When they take off their tinfoil hat with its simplistic understanding of economics—when they understand we are part of a global economy—they will have to understand that we are competing in a global economy and that that's a good thing for this nation. We have to be attractive to actually compete and attract the capital that we need to invest and to continue to see, whether it's a small business or a large business, that they are the engine room that employs people. Those opposite want to take umbrage at trickle-down economics and all that it may or may not be, but let me tell you: we are starting to see the benefits of this so-called trickle-down economics as we are pulling these levers right here and now. There were 240,000 new jobs created. That is real economic growth in our nation. We are seeing exports exponentially increase, particularly in the agricultural sector. There has been an increase of over 18 per cent in agricultural exports because of the environment we are putting around the Australian people. We are putting them in an environment where they are now part of a global economy, lo and behold.


Those opposite are yet to understand that we are part of the world and that it's a good thing because we have what the world wants here, and it's important that we engage the world. It's more important than ever that we engage the world, that we are part of it and that we compete in it. You have to have a competitive environment to be able to be part of that global economy. We've done that with the trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China. We continue to work on trade agreements in Indonesia and opening up greater export opportunities that are putting real wealth in the pockets of people across this nation, and particularly in my electorate of Maranoa, where we're seeing significant growth because of the trade agreements in the agricultural sector in particular. We are seeing people getting real returns. Four or five years ago they got $1.50 per kilo for their beef, and now they're getting $4 or $5 per kilo. That's an exponential increase in their income that flows through.


Talking about trickle-down economics, what happens is that it trickles through the economy when people have more disposable income. Those opposite wouldn't understand, but, when you are a small-business owner and you have an industry like the agricultural sector in your community, you need it to be strong because then more money comes into the business. If you invest in small business and business in this community, they reinvest through more employment and through greater competition. That's what this nation is about. It's about understanding how we fit in a global economy but also how we fit locally and how we can get money to trickle down not only to the Brisbanes, the Sydneys and the Melbournes but to the Romas, the Charlevilles and the Longreaches of this world. No matter your postcode, you are just as precious and just as important in this nation. That's something we should always protect, and that's why we must put an environment around our Australian people to allow them to prosper, to grow and to undertake it.


We must not be the big hand of government and think that we can spend our way out of this. This is the simplistic nature that the Labor Party continue to hold onto. They believe that, as soon as there's trouble, the only way is to spend our way out of it—to be the big hand of government. The reality is that we all have to pay for it at some point, and that's what they forget. They have a never-never scheme where they kick the can down the road. Unfortunately, the generations to come—my three young boys—will be the ones that will have to pay for that legacy of economic vandalism that we've seen time and time again from the Labor Party. They are not understanding how we fit in the world and how we need to have a competitive environment for the people we are here to represent.


If you have faith in our nation and its businesses, they will reinvest in our nation, and we will be where we need to be in our international rankings. When you look at our international tax competitiveness, we were formerly the ninth lowest, and now we're the fifth highest. The reality is that our competitive nature in a global economy has slipped exponentially. If you think that we are not competing with other jurisdictions with respect to tax, it's all about profitability—as the member for Lyons talked about, if they're making profits they're happy, but if they get bigger profits that's when they'll invest. It's understanding how business works. Unfortunately, those opposite haven't had a lot of experience in running businesses. They've been union hacks and political hacks, but they haven't had the responsibility of paying wages, paying electricity bills, paying their rates, understanding what it is to run a business—the responsibility not only to your staff but to your community. That's what we bring to the table in terms of pulling the economic levers that are going to generate the growth. We understand that, if we make the investment in our country, it will give an investment back—a great return.


These measures around international tax competitiveness are so important around the flow of capital. I've been an employee of a major corporate. I'm not saying that all of them are the most socially responsible, but the reality is that they are an important employer in this nation. They are a very important employer in this nation. As someone that has been employed by them and has seen retrenchments over time of some of those people I've worked closely with, I can assure the House that those businesses are no different to small businesses. If they cannot have the competitiveness that they need, they won't reinvest in their businesses and they won't reinvest in the human capital of each and every Australian in order to give them the opportunity to have a job.


There is the simplistic notion of class warfare, where big corporates are bad. Yes, they've got some work to do on some issues. But the reality is that we have to put the environment around them to ensure they are internationally competitive and that we attract the capital flows we need—and deserve—to continue to get the employment that we have to have in this nation. Lo and behold, funnily enough, the people who are employed by those corporates also pay tax. The reality is that the simplistic notion of class warfare that the Labor Party unleash at every opportunity just does not work. It is simplistic; it is politically great for them, but the reality is that our nation suffers. We as a nation are at a tipping point. We are $500 billion in debt. We have to pull the right economic levers now to ensure that we put in place a framework that drives growth for this nation.


It is also around infrastructure priorities that will increase the productivity of our nation. You do not have to look far for that. We are making a significant investment in roads and rail and telecommunications. The NBN will be rolled out across my electorate of Maranoa—nearly 43 per cent of Queensland—by 2018. These things are the tools of the 21st century, the tools we will need in order to take advantage of the trade agreements that we have put in place. There is the $220 million that we have put in place for the mobile phone blackspot program—again, tools of the 21st century that we need in order to take advantage of and engage in the global economy. We must understand that we are part of a world that is there to embrace us. It is an important thing that people in rural and regional Australia understand better than those opposite.


Before I was elected, I went out to a little town called Alpha. I visited a lady who had been in drought for the last six years. I went and did a feed run with her. We were driving around in her ute. She was getting a little emotional about the fact that she had not seen her husband for nearly 18 months because he was off working 700 kilometres away. I said to her, 'Do you really think there's a future in this?' She looked me in the eye and said: 'Mate, I don't even know your politics, but the only person who is important to me is the trade minister. When it rains, I know that all the work I've done over the last five or six years is going to be worth something to me. The cattle are going to get us out of this, and my husband is going to come home to me.' That was somebody in the depths of despair. She had been to the bottom and was still at the bottom. For her to acknowledge and understand our place in this world and the importance of the environment we put around our people is something I will never forget. That is the understanding that the Australian people have. If we empower them to do what they need to do then we will get the investment and the growth that we need.


We can also talk about inland rail—a corridor of commerce from Melbourne to Brisbane. It is going to open up regional Australia far more than ever before. We are going to get our products to the world more quickly. We have what the world wants. In fact, if you want to put the importance of trade agreements to the fore, we have a population of about 24 million people and we produce enough food for 75 million people. If we do not have trade agreements, we as a nation will not have rural and regional Australia.


You can couple that with the tax incentives that we have provided to small businesses. There are 25,000 small businesses in Maranoa that took advantage of the first tranche of this, which those opposite opposed. Those opposite opposed small businesses being able to get on and reinvest in their communities and in their businesses. Those are the types of things that have a real impact. We must understand that capital flow is so important—whether it be the family farm or at the corporate level. That is where real trickle-down economics comes to the fore. Those opposite should not be scared of that, because it works. And we are seeing that transcend now.


In all the data that is coming through, our growth is starting to get to a tipping point where the decisions that this government has made are having an exponential benefit in terms of where this nation will be in 10 or 15 years time. It is about the continuing investment that this government has proudly undertaken in the business environment and infrastructure. If you do that, if you make that case for investment, you will see private investment flow.


I'll give you an example: the Toowoomba bypass, a $1.6 billion investment that's being put in place now that will get the products of Maranoa to the world quicker, has been matched by the Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport. We now have an Australian export hub on our doorstep, where we have weekly cargo flights taking Maranoa product around the world, because we are putting the connectivity in place. There has been private investment: the owners of Wellcamp, private people, made that investment in the people of Queensland and regional Queensland, because we made the initial investment in the Inland Rail and the second range crossing. That's an important step to understand: if you have faith, if you have confidence, in the Australian people, they will respond. And the Wagner family, quite proudly, did. We should be proud of Australians—proud that, when we put the environment and infrastructure around them, they respond. And when they respond, that is a good thing for our nation. Never before have we seen such investment in the electorate of Maranoa, into connectivity: $500 million into the Warrego Highway, and into Inland Rail, $8.4 billion.


This is about connecting us to the real world. I plead with those opposite to put aside the politics, understand our place in the world and understand the importance of how we can interact with the world and how we can take advantage of the competitive advantage that we have with the world's best product. But we have to have an open mind. We have to understand that there is no quick or easy fix on this. You can't spend your way out of this. You have to have sensible policy that will ensure that we empower the people of this nation to go to the next level.


I'm proud to stand here supporting a government that understands small business, that understands the economy and that understands that, if we get these economic levers right, we will make this nation the nation that it deserves to be.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:26):  It's my privilege to follow the member for Lyons, in particular, who I thought made a very characteristically useful and considered contribution a little while ago. Even with the member who just spoke, there were parts of what he said—about trade in particular but other things as well—on which I find common ground. But we, on this side, obviously oppose this bill that we're talking about now, for the reasons that have been outlined so well by the member for Lyons, the member for McMahon and indeed all of the speakers on this side of the House.


If you were looking for one bill to sum up, in one piece of legislation, the approach of those opposite, this is it. In this one bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, we have all of the warped priorities, all of the Thatcherite fantasy, all of the trickle-down economics, and all of the wasted money and the fiscal vandalism which have characterised the last four years, and all of the showering of largesse on the top end of town while lecturing middle Australia about debt and deficit disasters. This is a $65 billion ram raid on the budget, which is to be handed directly to multinational corporations and the big four banks at the expense of people who work and who struggle in this country.


Those in this government—if you can believe it—through their policies tell us that they believe that multinational corporations pay too much tax, that people under $87,000 a year pay too little tax and that people get paid too much to work on Sundays. That is the summary of the economic policy of those opposite in this Turnbull government. You couldn't make this stuff up. In their arrogance, they want the Australian people to believe that they can't find $3.8 billion for universities, but they can find $65 billion for big companies in this country; they can't find a billion dollars to maintain the pensioner energy supplement, but they can find $65 billion to give to big business; they can't find the $17 billion for schools; and they can't find the $2.2 billion for GPs and allied health, or the $3 billion for apprentices and TAFE and vocational education, or the $1.6 billion they're cutting out of infrastructure, or the $500 million they're cutting out of the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, or the $300 million they're cutting out of dental, or the $171 million they're cutting from hospital services for veterans, or the $44 million a year they're cutting from homelessness funding.


They can't find any of that; that's too hard to find. That's all too expensive, but they can find $65 billion to give to big business in Australia, and that's what this bill is all about. It does say it all about those opposite; it ticks every box. It's unfair, for the reasons I've just outlined. It's unwise because it won't deliver the growth that we need in this country, the right kind of growth; indeed, it won't deliver much growth at all. And it's unaffordable, particularly at a time when those opposite have made such a mess of the budget that we have record gross debt in this country—high debt, growing, not a peak in sight—under those opposite, and they want to pretend that they are superior economic managers. There's never been more debt on the Commonwealth budget than there is today, and it's growing and there's no peak in sight.


We oppose this bill because, when we have weak growth, this is not the answer. We oppose this bill because, when we have skyrocketing debt, this fiscal vandalism will make the situation worse, not better. We oppose this bill because, when we have more and more people feeling, with some justification, that the rules of the economy are written to benefit others at their expense, this is a recipe for more division in our economy and in our society.


Let me go to some of the details of the claims that those opposite make. The first one, of course, is that this is the only way that we can get growth in our economy. When the government says that, it reminds me of that Johnny Lee song we were talking about before. The member for Herbert and the member for Lindsay were talking about that Johnny Lee song, which talks about 'lookin' for love in all the wrong places'. This government is looking for economic growth in all of the wrong places. There's a lyric in that song which reminds me of the Treasurer. Johnny Lee sings:


Playin' a fools game hopin' to win;


and tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.


That is the best summary of the economic approach from those opposite and the commentary from the Treasurer about economic growth. This is a government looking for growth in all the wrong places.


They want you to believe that the only way to grow the economy is to hand tens of billions of dollars to multinational corporations—a lot of that will go overseas—or to the big four banks, which get about $10 billion of that $65 billion, or by letting the wealthiest Australians choose how much tax they pay via trusts or by giving the biggest tax concessions to those who need them least. The government will have you believe that that's the only way to grow the economy. They just don't get it.


We understand on this side of the House—all of us do—that growth comes from working people having the money to spend and invest and from us deploying tax dollars in an intelligent way where they can do the most good to boost productivity and boost inclusive growth in our economy. Growth comes from giving people a stake in the growth that they help create, rewarding their efforts and their enterprise, ensuring people can participate meaningfully in our economy and in our society. It does not come from lower wages or higher taxes on working people or these tax cuts that we're discussing in this bill. Those opposite are from an alternative universe, where they think that, if you give $10 billion to four banks, to four companies, a $10 billion tax cut, miraculously, those banks will employ more people. The same goes for multinational corporations, where a lot of that tax cut benefit goes overseas.


We do have very serious challenges in our economy, and key among those is the growth challenge. We are all in the car for the right kind of economic growth, but in the national accounts in the last week or so we had some very disturbing figures that showed that we have weak annual growth, falling living standards and flatlining wages—all in that one data release from the ABS. We have annual growth with a one in front of it. The Treasurer wanders around expecting a pat on the back and a round of applause for annual growth with a one in front of it—1.8 per cent. Our economic growth over the year is lower than in Canada, the USA or New Zealand. It's lower than the OECD average. It's been less than two per cent annually for three of the last four quarters. That is the worst result since the global financial crisis.


Real net national disposable income per capita, the best measure of living standards, fell 1.4 per cent in the last quarter. Living standards are going backwards, and wages are flatlining. Average compensation per employee fell 0.1 per cent in the last quarter. Wages went backwards in the most recent national accounts. And economic growth is obviously still well below what we need to cut unemployment, put upward pressure on wages and boost demand in the economy.


Beyond those troubling national accounts figures, the workers' share of national income is at record lows and underemployment is at record highs. I'm conscious that a new set of data has come out while I've been on my feet, which I'll read with interest, but the trend for underemployment has been horrible: there has been record underemployment. People who need more work or more hours at work can't find them. The people-facing part of the economy is suffering. This bill and the government's approach to the economy will turbocharge those challenges, not address them. They are part of the problem, not part of the solution.


On the government's own figures about growth, the growth dividend from this bill we are discussing today—the $65 billion tax cut for big business—will be negligible at best: one per cent over 20 years. We're talking about one per cent in 20 years time. Those opposite go on and on about how this is crucial, this is the key, this is the secret sauce when it comes to getting growth in this economy. We are talking one per cent in 20 years. That's $2 a day in wages per person in 20 years time, on the Treasury modelling. That is what we're talking about here. This is their one-point plan. That will be the miraculous outcome of this one-point plan—so many bucks for so little bang.


The tax cuts in this bill are unfair for the reasons I've described and are unwise. They won't get the growth we need and they're also unaffordable. This is a $65 billion ram-raid on the budget. It's the single biggest piece of fiscal vandalism of the Abbott-Turnbull government. We have this mess in the budget, despite the fact that the government is actually raising something like $77 billion more in taxes in 2017-18 than was raised in 2012-13, the last year of the Labor government. Tax to GDP, which is the measure that we rely on to see how much tax is being paid in the economy, is higher for every year in the forward estimates in the most recent budget than it was in any year under the former Labor government. This government is taxing more than the former Labor government did and yet still we've got net debt at record levels for the next two years. We've got a deficit for this year 10 times bigger than was predicted in Joe Hockey's first budget. We've got half a trillion dollars in gross debt. That is the first time that has ever happened in Australian history: half a trillion dollars in gross debt! And gross debt doesn't even peak. It blows out to $725 billion over the medium term with no peak in sight. Gross debt continues to rise. The interest bill is about $5.5 billion, or $220 for every man, woman and child in this country. The coalition is racking up gross debt $1.4 billion a month faster than Labor, in good global economic conditions. We racked up debts lower than this government during a global financial crisis. Think about that. Debt is being racked up faster when we've got pretty good global conditions now than it was in the life of the former Labor government, which dealt with—successfully, I'm proud to say—the biggest synchronised downturn in the global economy since the 1930s. Think about that. It is a pretty extraordinary achievement for those opposite to rack up debt faster in good conditions than Australia did during the global financial crisis.


There is a whole range of numbers which go to the core of the incompetence of those opposite and the hypocrisy of lecturing people about debt and deficit disasters—all of those sorts of things—at the same time that, on their watch, debt and deficit have blown out substantially across all of those measures. No matter which way you carve it, the numbers don't lie. Gross debt, net debt, debt per person—on all of these measures, those opposite have made a mess of the budget. They would like us to pretend that handing $65 billion to multinational corporations and the big four banks in Australia will somehow be the answer to all of our challenges, when we've got anaemic growth and sky rocketing debt and deficit. This bill will be part of the problem and not part of the solution.


Under this government, you can understand why more and more Australians feel deeply frustrated that, no matter how hard they work, the economy doesn't work for them. They just can't get ahead no matter how hard they work. They do the right thing and try and provide for their families but they feel like the rules of the economy—with some justification—are written to benefit somebody else at their expense.


On this side of the House, we want the rules of the economy to accord with our values: we grow strongest when we grow together; if you work hard, you should be rewarded for it; if you fall behind or fall down, we will be there to help you up. That is a summary of the economic approach this side of the House takes to the Australian economy. That's why we have been announcing all these policies.


I give credit to the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow Assistant Treasurer and all of the colleagues. The policies that we've been announcing are so important to ensuring that the rules of the economy accord with our values. They are part of a larger purpose: to ensure that we can have inclusive growth, that we can have reward for effort in this country, and we can have a decent social safety net for those who fall down or fall behind.


The previous speaker, the member for Maranoa, and indeed a number of the speakers on that side of the House, are fond of saying in the media that our position on handing $65 billion to multinationals and the big four banks is somehow based on some kind of politics of envy or some kind of class war. But that argument, the argument they put over and over and over again, rests on a really tired, old, dishonest absurdity that pretends that the only way to maintain cohesion in this country is to give the biggest tax breaks to those who need them least or pay people less to work on weekends or give tax cuts to the top and tax hikes to the bottom or to shower largesse on the people who need it least in our economy. Theirs is a recipe for more division. It's damaging to the budget, to the economy and to society.


It's far more divisive to hack at the safety net or let the wealthiest people choose how much tax to pay or hand over tens of billions of dollars in company tax cuts at the same time as they lecture middle Australia about tightening their belts. This country is looking for economic growth. That growth will be found in decent incomes so that people can save and invest and provide for their families and in a new government which prioritises the actual drivers of growth and productivity and which recognises that the best growth in this country is people-powered and from the bottom up. Growth won't be found in this $65 billion tax cut or in the trickle-down economics that it represents. (Time expired)

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2017-09-14,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:42):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. We're talking about tax. Let's start with the comments of the shadow Treasurer on this matter in no less a publication than his Hearts & Minds, a somewhat grandly-titled publication of 2013. He started out by saying:


… it's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


And he is right. When the shadow Treasurer said that in Hearts & Minds back in 2013, he was right. He's often wrong—he's usually wrong—but, on this matter, he was right. He said:


At 30 per cent, our company tax rate is now above the OECD average … it is how the rate compares to that of our competitors that counts.


And he was right about that too. It's not overly complex when you think about it. If you're a company and you have a choice to invest in different places around the world, are you going to favour places where you have to pay a very high rate of tax or are you going to favour places where you pay a more competitive rate of tax? It's pretty obvious and it's set out in a very lucid fashion by the shadow Treasurer in Hearts & Minds. The opposition leader has also spoken at length on this issue. He did so in 2012 when he was the Assistant Treasurer. He spoke to ACOSS about company tax, and had some wise words for the ACOSS audience assembled on that day back in March of 2012. He said:


… corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


…


Reducing the corporate tax rate … sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages—thereby improving standards of living.


A very sensible analysis. He said:


And because reducing the company rate is an economic growth instrument—


he was right about that too—


reducing the corporate tax rate … is also an investment in the Australian people—including people who might now be on welfare and require the services of ACOSS members.


Helping companies to grow improves employment and is good for the economy and is good for those workers for whom new jobs are created. That was a very, very sensible position for the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer to take.


But, of course, now we see this very, very transparent campaign to demonise any large company as somehow bad for the nation. The terms 'big end of town' or 'top end of town', you will be interested to know, have been used in the parliament in the last year more than 300 times. That suggests an ongoing campaign by those opposite to try to convey the idea that large companies are bad for Australia. But the reality is that large companies employ about 4 million Australians including thousands and thousands of people who live in my electorate. I don't find, certainly in my community—and I suspect the same would be the case around Australia—a sense that people want large companies to exit our shores. To the contrary, what people want is for large companies to invest in Australia and to create the millions and millions of jobs that they do. That's appropriate, and that's why this government is so supportive of policies that create competitive company tax rates.


Of course we have already passed the first round of the enterprise tax bill, which was opposed by those opposite. Those opposite say that if a company has revenue of $2 million or more, it is a big company which should not receive corporate tax relief. That's what those opposite say. Those opposite think that if a company has turnover of $2 million, it means that it makes $2 million of profit. But, of course, it doesn't, because most companies might have a profit margin of maybe five per cent or six per cent—something like that. So a company that's turning over $2 million might be making about $100,000, which is about the average household income in Australia. Those opposite say that is a large company that should not be entitled to corporate tax relief, and they voted against it. They voted against tax relief for a small company in suburban Sydney with $2.1 million in revenue. That is just the reality. 




Ms Husar:
  Not in western Sydney. 




Dr CHALMERS:
  They think that is the right thing to do. They think that a company with $2 million of revenue is a large company that's not worthy of tax relief. The member for Lindsay was interjecting saying 'not in western Sydney' they don't have those companies, but, actually, we have thousands of them. A company that turns over $2 million in revenue is a very small business, but those opposite literally think that that is a large company and they voted against relief for a company with $2 million in revenue. It is an extraordinary policy, and it really does speak to the anti-investment, anti-success agenda of those opposite. 


The Leader of the Opposition recently said that in Australia there is a sense that your success in life is predetermined by your parents' income. That's just wrong. Every person in this place, and the vast majority of people around Australia, would say that their success in life has been overwhelmingly determined by their own efforts. That's what we believe on this side of the House. We believe very strongly in promoting innovation and investment and, basically, in backing people who get out there and make things happen. In the absence of that, the economy doesn't grow and we have a weaker economy and a weaker society. The strength of Australia—one of its many strengths—is the fact that people do take risks, people do invest and people do get out there and make things happen. That is why we are so supportive of corporate tax reform—to encourage people to invest more in this wonderful country. 


The enterprise tax plan part 2 that we are discussing today will bring tax relief to those businesses with turnover of more than $50 million. Those opposite have already voted against the enterprise tax bill No. 1. Presumably, they will now vote against enterprise tax bill No. 2. It is important to know that there are 3.85 million Australian employees who are employed in companies that will benefit from these provisions. They will benefit because the company will have greater incentive to invest in Australia. Those opposite say that shouldn't occur. They say that it's a giveaway to companies—which is instructive in itself because it implies that all of the money is the government's for the government to decide what to do with, when, in fact, the money has been generated by these companies and not by the government. The government is the one taking the money, not the other way around. We say: let those companies keep more of the money they have generated so that they can reinvest more in our society and create more jobs. That is self-evidently a good thing to do.


But it is important to reflect on the policies of those opposite when it comes to tax. It is the most anti-investment, anti-innovation agenda we have seen from the Labor Party for many decades. I want to briefly run through the list of all the problems they would present for investment in Australia if they were to become the government. One of the things that those opposite propose is that any form of investment in Australia be subject to a 50 per cent increase in capital gains tax when it is sold. Labor say they want to do that because of issues to do with the housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. But they propose that capital gains tax be increased by 50 per cent for absolutely everything. So if you invest in a factory, a farm, a technology company, a warehouse, if you help a friend by investing in a small business—a cafe, a small restaurant or whatever—you will pay 50 per cent more tax under Labor's so-called housing affordability policy.


This is a very important point. If somebody wants to build a factory in Western Sydney, of which there are many thousands, to create jobs in Western Sydney, why should they pay 50 per cent more tax? That is an extraordinarily bad policy. It has nothing to do with housing affordability. I would absolutely welcome from anyone in the opposition an explanation of the link between housing affordability and increasing by 50 per cent a tax on investment in a factory, a warehouse or any other job-creating area. Nobody in the opposition has ever articulated such a link—because there isn't one. The policy is that, to address housing affordability, capital gains tax will be increased by 50 per cent. But no-one in the opposition has ever explained why they decided to extend that to factories in Western Sydney, warehouses in regional Queensland and farms in Western Australia. On all of those things, when sold, there is a requirement to pay 50 per cent more tax under Labor's housing affordability policy. If someone would like to articulate why they have done that and how it is related to housing affordability, that would be very welcome. But they won't do that, because there is no link. The reason for this policy from those opposite is that it raises more revenue—which would mean the government would have more money. That is why they want to do it. It has absolutely nothing to do with housing affordability.


Another issue is Labor's policy with respect to negative gearing. Labor's policy is that people investing in an investment property should not be able to claim the cost of interest even though that has been possible in Australia for more than 100 years. For more than 100 years, you have been able to claim the cost of interest when investing in investment properties; that actually applies to any investment, although much of it is investment properties. Labor say you should not be able to do that. And then they say this will have no impact on the market, that all the people who invest in properties will continue to do so. They say the fact that property investors will not be able to claim an interest deduction will not have any impact on rent, because they will have exactly the same rental income; they will not increase rents even though the total cost of owning the property will be higher because they no longer have the ability to make use of negative gearing. So Labor say there will be no increase in rents under negative gearing, even though they acknowledge that the person who owns the investment property will have to pay more. The person who owns the investment property will have to pay more, but Labor say the person who owns the investment property will not pass on a dollar of that cost to any renter in Australia. That is an extraordinary and absurd policy, and that is why it is so important to continue to articulate in a very precise way the cost of that policy.


They also want people who earn $180,000 to pay one in two dollars to the government. If that isn't a disincentive to work hard, what is? That is an extraordinary impost.


They also say that the hundreds of thousands of Australian businesses who make use of trust structures and who have done so for many decades should not be allowed to do so. They say that it's only going to be affecting a very modest number of people. They say they have modelling from the Parliamentary Budget Office on this issue of how many Australians will be affected by Labor's policy of effectively abolishing the use of trusts by small business. We say: release the modelling. The Parliamentary Budget Office would be perfectly fine with those opposite releasing the modelling on what their attack on trusts will do to the small business sector. The Parliamentary Budget Office isn't stopping the Leader of the Opposition from releasing that modelling. The only person who is stopping the Leader of the Opposition from releasing the modelling is the Leader of the Opposition. He should do so. He should be very, very frank and say, 'This is the exact number of the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in Australia who will be affected by this attack on trusts.' They have the number and they have the modelling. It has been provided by the PBO. They should put it out there in the public domain if they are so confident in it.


From those opposite we hear an extraordinary litany of attacks on aspiration and attacks on investment, whether it's on negative gearing, capital gains, trusts, not supporting company tax cuts or attacking investment on a range of levels. They have an antisuccess, anti-investment and antigrowth agenda. On this side of parliament, we are unashamedly pro growth and unashamedly supportive of business investment. We will back businesses to invest in this country and to employ millions of Australians. We have already got the runs on the board with the first tranche of these enterprise tax cuts. This is a very important second step, and it should be supported by all members in the House.

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2017-09-14,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (10:44):  I am pleased to speak on the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, which will boost the Australian economy, creating prosperity and jobs for hardworking Australians. And I'm pleased to see the Minister for Small Business here in the chamber. It is his complete, utter and entire focus—isn't it, Minister?—that we will create more jobs for hardworking Australians and make sure that businesses can do their very best for our nation.


This tax plan is about encouraging employers to invest in and grow their businesses, which ensures greater job security for workers, more employment and higher wages growth. By reducing the company tax rate, our government will give businesses the certainty they need to plan for long-term growth in Australia. This will unlock so much untapped potential for private sector investment, allowing us to better compete globally.


A high corporate tax rate ultimately hurts hardworking Australians, with the companies' tax burden falling on employees through lower real wages growth. With a tough global economic environment, the task falls to the Liberal and National coalition government to implement ambitious policies to boost our nation's economy. We have already passed—earlier this year—the first part of the enterprise tax plan, which lowered the rate for 3.2 million small and medium-sized businesses, employing over 6.5 million Australians, but we cannot stop there. This bill will extend that tax reduction to the remainder of Australian businesses before the rate is dropped to a more internationally competitive rate of 25 per cent in 2026-27. This will be the lowest corporate tax rate since the mid-1960s. And don't we need that! Don't our businesses and our workers need that. Australia has gone from having the ninth-lowest corporate tax rate out of developed economies in 2001 to having the equal fifth-highest today. That's a very disappointing result, which is why we are working hard to turn it around. It means that if a business is looking at identical projects in two countries, each with exactly the same return on investment, it will choose a country other than Australia because of our higher corporate tax rate, which is not the outcome that we want. Indeed, Treasury modelling has found that our current tax system is a drag on the economy. Based on this, we know that a more efficient tax system would help grow the economy, creating opportunities for all Australians.


This is part of our national economic plan. Along with our enterprise tax plan, the coalition government are opening up new markets in our region for Australian exporters through comprehensive free trade agreements. This is particularly important for our farmers. My mum and dad are farmers, so I know full well how important is lowering tariffs and charges on our agricultural products overseas. Education also is one of our major exports from Australia. I have Flinders University right in the heart of my electorate of Boothby. It's a very fine educational institution, and it's trying hard to grow its share of the international student market. The government are also investing $70 billion in productivity-enhancing infrastructure across Australia. I have been very lucky to see the results of some of this with the Darlington upgrade and the extension of the Tonsley rail line up to Flinders University, which is a key part of Flinders University's plan to build new student accommodation, in particular, to attract more international students. We are also, as a government, delivering on a comprehensive 20-year defence industry plan, which is critical for my home state of South Australia, and we're implementing significant reforms to improve competition and choice for Australian consumers. We have secured record funding for our schools and our hospitals. We're protecting Australia's revenue base through some of the world's toughest anti-tax-avoidance laws—we're cracking down on those companies who try their hardest to not pay tax here in Australia.


These policies are already delivering for the Australian people. Recently we've seen the highest rate of jobs growth in 10 years, along with the highest business confidence in 10 years. It's no coincidence that the last time we saw such promising figures was when Mr Howard was in government, along with Treasurer Peter Costello, who provided fantastic economic leadership for our nation. We had some very fine National Party leaders at the same time as well, didn't we, Minister for Small Business?




Mr McCormack:
  Indeed we did!




Ms FLINT:
  It is no coincidence that these figures bear a great degree of correlation. Some 240,000 jobs were created over the past financial year, and job advertisements are up by over 13 per cent. The latest jobs data reveals that 210,800 full-time jobs have been created in the past six months alone. This is the strongest full-time jobs growth since records began 40 years ago. It's a very impressive outcome, isn't it, Minister?



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Ms FLINT:
  Full-time employment growth is outperforming part-time growth, which is very positive news. In total, over 736,000 jobs have been created since the coalition government came to office, and over 80 per cent of these have been full-time. Add to this the fact that wages paid to employees rose by 1.2 per cent in the June quarter, retail trade rose 1.2 per cent and manufacturing output is at the highest level in 15 years and we can see how our coalition government policies are enhancing and accelerating our nation's economic recovery. Without a doubt, we can say that these achievements are a credit to and the result of strong Liberal Party and National Party government of the nation.


The national accounts data released last week reinforce the trend we've seen picking up under the coalition. Real growth in the economy was 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, more than double the 0.3 per cent in the March quarter. Based on these figures and other indications, the government will likely achieve a better than budgeted final year outcome for the underlying cash balance for the previous financial year. The largest contributor to growth in the last financial year was household consumption, which increased by 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter to be 2.6 per cent higher than a year ago. The government's investments in productive infrastructure are also creating solid growth, with new public final demand rising by 2.1 per cent, driven by an 8.6 per cent boost in government investment. Our $75 billion infrastructure investment will be used to build roads, railways, water infrastructure and other strategic projects, one of which is the grade separation of the rail line near Westfield Marion, in my electorate of Boothby, a problem that has been in existence for some 40 years. I am really pleased to have been able to deliver that for my local community.


Our defence industry plan is delivering for the economy, particularly in my home state of South Australia. Defence investment was up 26.3 per cent in the last quarter thanks to my government's prioritisation of the defence industry and national security.


When we take into account that this is only the beginning of implementing our National Economic Plan, that's when we can begin to realise and understand the sheer volume of untapped economic potential that my government is unlocking. But while the government unlock the economics of opportunity in Australia, our achievements are placed at risk by those opposite, who want to tax Australians into oblivion once again. While under the coalition all Australians are sharing in the benefits of this economic growth, those opposite, the Labor Party, would levy $150 billion of new taxes on Australians, with families and small businesses to bear the brunt of this tax pain. Under their tax plan, no Australian is safe. Everyone is in the sights of Labor's unprecedented tax grab—families, singles, retirees and, in particular, small businesses, which are the economic engine room of the nation. Under Labor's tax plan no Australian is safe; they really aren't.


The grim reality of a Labor government will be tax upon tax upon tax to pay for their insatiable appetite to spend the money of hardworking Australians. They are going after workers, savers, home owners, professionals and the small business owners of Australia. Let's have a look at few of Labor's policies. Their permanently higher top marginal tax rate will take about half of every dollar earned above an income level that is now just over twice the average weekly earnings—a wage which many middle-income-earning Australians aspire to. They have proposed a negative gearing tax grab on wage earners in middle Australia again. For example, a nurse on a wage of $50,000 a year who invests in property with $7,000 in annual net rental losses would under Labor face a whopping tax increase of 41 per cent. They have launched an attack on self-funded retirees with their planned ban on limited recourse borrowing arrangements. They have proposed to introduce a tax policy on trusts, which, again, is an attack on small businesses. The policy singles out as Labor enemies stay-at-home mums, students, doctors and accountants, hitting beneficiaries on $37,000 a year the hardest.


Labor would scrap and reverse our Enterprise Tax Plan, increasing taxes on the 3.2 million Australian small businesses that employ 6.5 million Australians. It is a lot of employees that these small businesses are responsible for, and most of them are, by definition, low or middle-income earners that the small businesses are supporting.


I'm interested to know whether those opposite really think that the politics of envy is going to propel them into government. While they stoke division and resentment in the Australian community they are doing our nation a disservice. There was a reason for the historic failure of socialism. When you're in government, if you pursue equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunity, the people suffer. The people in our community who are best able to contribute to our success as a nation will either lose their incentive to work hard to be successful or they'll leave Australia altogether to go overseas to work hard and be successful. We don't want a nation that's encouraged to be mediocre and to stagnate. 


Labor's policies will ultimately make it much harder for Australians to get ahead, but, you know, we're quite used to that from those opposite, unfortunately. It's been disappointing to see those opposite step back from their previous positions, where they did support cutting tax rates and encouraging our businesses to grow so that they were productive and employing as many Australians as possible. But, as we know, the Australian people are much smarter than those opposite give them credit for, which, I think, is why we see them not gaining much traction, particularly in this area. 


The Australian people know which party they can trust with the economy. They know that the Liberal Party and the Nationals, the coalition government, will not keep dipping into their incomes and their savings. We're here to support hardworking Australians, our small and medium businesses, our bigger businesses and the thousands and millions of Australians that they employ. Our government is committed to growing the economy and helping fund the services that Australians rely on now and into the future. I'm pleased to commend the government's bill to the House.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (10:57):  I do rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, but I really must respond to the member for Boothby. What a lot of rot from this alumnus of the IPA—that bunch of neo-Liberal right wingers who still believe absolutely in the failed policies of trickle-down economics. They somehow believe that if you give more money to the top end of town and give more money to the corporations and the CEOs, somehow, it will magically trickle down to the rest of the population. It hasn't worked in America for 40 years. The middle class in America has been gutted. It is non-existent now because of the failed policies of Reagan and Thatcher, and this mob over here wants to see them imported into Australia. We have one of the greatest societies, one of the greatest economies and one of the greatest countries on earth built on egalitarianism and built on a sense of a fair go. It was built on a fair industrial relations system and a fair sense of equity of income, and these guys want to tear it down because, somehow, they look at America and they actually like what they see. They like to see the middle class gutted, they like to see the billionaires become multibillionaires and they somehow think that's good for the rest of us. It hasn't worked. It just hasn't worked. The evidence is before your eyes.


The member for Boothby was talking about high taxes—what a cheek! I mean, the government has come into this place actually proposing higher taxes for Australians earning up to $87,000 a year, tax cuts for people earning more than $180,000 a year and tax cuts for corporations of up to $50 billion over 10 years.



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  It is $50 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. I will take the minister's interjection. Yes, I accept what he's saying. Well, it is $65 billion actually, when you take the total. Some $65 billion in tax cuts to corporations over the next 10 years is the government's grand plan. Why? Because they say it's going to be better for the economy. But their own figures show that if you give $65 billion back in tax to the big corporations, the net result for GDP—for growth in this country—will be an incredible, magnificent, rocketing 0.1 per cent over 10 years. That's their grand plan for economic growth in this country. There will be $65 billion in tax handouts to big banks and corporations and 0.1 per cent growth in GDP. What an absolute joke! They think they're the best economic managers that this country has to offer. I've got news for them: evidence says otherwise.


The member for Boothby—a goldmine of ridiculousness—said that if we don't give tax breaks to big corporations they will all lose the incentive to be here. That somehow there will be this big flood of companies leaving Australia because they will lose the incentive to be here. They will go somewhere else with their business. What a load of rubbish! There are countries in this world that charge companies a lot more tax than Australia. They manage to keep their companies and they manage to keep their corporations. Business will stay wherever they can make a profit, and every business knows that there are good profits to be made in Australia. It's a stable economy, it's a stable political system, and people have relatively good incomes. Despite the efforts of those opposite who want to cut incomes, cut penalty rates and increase taxes on middle Australia, Australia is a good place to do business. I'm pleased that the minister acknowledges 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth thanks to the policies implemented by Labor under Hawke and Keating. 


We all love a tax cut. I love a tax cut. Who doesn't love a tax cut? But you have tax cuts when you can afford them. How this mob over here can say: 'Oh, we can give $65 billion to big corporations and banks, but to pay for it we're going to take $3.8 billion over the next five years off universities. We're going to take billions of dollars out of schools. We're going to take money out of hospitals. We're going to take money out of infrastructure.' Honestly, the people of Australia want services and goods. They want a standard of living. They know they're not going to get it from a $65 billion handout to corporations and banks. 


Now let me get to the substance of this bill—having dealt with the member for Boothby's ridiculous contribution. I note that the bill comes before the House in an amended form following amendments moved by Labor in the Senate which were successful. The changes initiated by Labor will require a review of this bill's safe-harbour provisions after two years to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. That's important because, even with the best of intentions, we don't know where this is going to go so we need to review it after two years. We're pleased that the Senate agreed and that the government agreed to implement those amendments. 


This bill makes some significant changes to the way companies act when trading insolvent. It provides breathing space for responsible change in corporate structure or business practices to enable a business to get through tough times. Today, it's an unfortunate reality that announcing an intention to enter voluntary administration can be, in effect, the kiss of death for a struggling business. You go into voluntary administration in order to try and keep your business going, but that signals to the market that somehow you're in deep trouble. What happens of course is that suppliers stop supplying and customers stop buying. Voluntary administration is supposed to send a signal to the market that although a company is struggling, it's salvageable. Unfortunately, the very act of entering into it can set off a chain of events that can make matters worse, and that's an outcome in no-one's interest except the vultures who swoop in to devour the entrails. We see that happening all the time: companies go into voluntary administration and some joker comes in and swoops it up at a cheap price and carries on the business. That's not fair. 


Currently, companies must stop trading as soon as the directors believe they may be insolvent. That makes sense. You shouldn't be able to trade and take on new liabilities when you suspect that you don't have the means to pay your existing bills. But it's a rule that is so inflexible that, arguably, it can do more harm than good. This bill seeks to allow some flexibility with conditions, and the conditions are important. With safe harbour, this legislation will create a safe harbour for company directors from personal liability for trading while insolvent. A key condition is that directors must be honestly and diligently taking a course of action that is reasonably likely to lead to a better outcome for the company than the immediate appointment of an administrator or liquidator. The intent is sound. We all would much rather see a struggling business get back on its feet than close its doors. 


Labor's amendments, which the government has agreed to incorporate, will see the safe-harbour provision reviewed after two years to ensure there are no unforeseen consequences. That's a sensible measure, bringing together both flexibility and accountability. Importantly, safe harbour is not available where the company is failing to meet its obligations to pay its employees, including superannuation; where the company fails to meet its tax reporting obligations; and when a person fails to provide an administrator or liquidator with certain required information, such as a company's books.


So, while supportive of this bill, I am disappointed, however, that it fails to deal with the issue of phoenixing. Phoenixing occurs when a company's directors strip cash and assets from a company, liquidate the company and then reopen for business with a different ABN and different signage. Closing the business down in such a manner strips employees of their entitlements and creditors of their ability to sue for payment. Phoenixing rips off creditors and staff, but also the wider Australian community. A report earlier this year by the University of Melbourne and Monash University said that phoenixing companies, which cost the Australian economy billions of dollars a year, is too easy, too cheap, lucrative and largely invisible. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the cost to the economy at a staggering $3.2 billion, simply from companies that go bust and then start up again, having wiped off their obligations to their employees and their creditors.


I do note the news from this week, where the government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into finally taking action on phoenixing, four months—four months!—after Labor unveiled our own policy to tackle dodgy directors. Since May, this side of the House has been calling for the introduction of company director ID numbers, which make it easier for authorities to track the spivs who kill their companies and start up again. Director IDs are backed by the Productivity Commission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. It's taken the government four months, but it's reluctantly come on board—although not all the way. We note that penalties are still too low and that the government has failed to introduce an objective test for transactions that deprive hardworking and innocent employees of their entitlements. So, I acknowledge the announcement this week, but it's a shame the government had to be dragged into making the decision rather than coming to it early. And it's a shame that it did not take the opportunity to include antiphoenixing provisions in this bill.


Part 2 of this bill sets out new provisions to stop the enforcement of ipso facto clauses that are triggered when a company enters administration. An ipso facto clause creates a contractual right that allows one party to terminate or modify the operation of a contract upon the occurrence of some specific event. Currently, such rights may allow one party to terminate a contract because of the financial position of the company, even though the company is still meeting its obligations to that party. So, for example, if a company has a short-term lack of liquidity which leads directors to appoint a voluntary administrator, an ipso facto clause might allow a major supplier to cancel their contract even though the administered business is still meeting all its payment obligations to that supplier. Cancelling supply may then starve the business of the opportunity to continue to trade while it restructures, which then brings on a liquidation which may otherwise not have occurred. So the operation of such clauses may in fact destroy the ability of the business to restructure, destroy the value of the business and prevent the sale of the business as a going concern.


The regulation power under this bill includes an anti-avoidance mechanism to enable the government to respond to possible contractor agreements that are drafted or prepared in a way to circumvent its provisions. Regulations can carve out certain contracts from the application of these clauses. This amendment will not stop parties from terminating a contract with a company for any other reason, such as a breach involving nonpayment or nonperformance, so those rights are protected. This legislation, in theory, gives business, and particularly small business, a fighting chance of making its way through a tough time, utilising fresh eyes and fresh ideas and without stigma.


Of course, prevention is better than cure. Ideally, we should be doing more to encourage businesspeople to receive practical training in finance, employment responsibilities, resilience and adaptability. Stronger businesses are in everyone's best interests. Carl Gunther, New South Wales Head of Restructuring and National Turnaround Lead notes:


Whilst legislative changes proposed by government are a key element to reform, ultimately early intervention by company directors when indicators of financial distress arise is the best form of defence to claims of insolvent trading. Director's reluctance to call for help continues to result (sadly) in the high volumes of insolvencies in Australia and until this changes no amount of legislative reform will make a difference.


So it's pertinent to note that those opposite are making such training harder by cutting back on TAFE and continuing to encourage the failed privatisation of the training sector. We urge them in all sincerity to give a good, hard look to what they are doing to the TAFE and training sector in this country. Too many paid-up students have fallen victim to failed private organisations, and I still shake my head at a system that allowed Careers Australia to vacuum $40 million out of its own accounts, send them offshore and then, just months later, close the business down, claiming it had no cash. So today's legislation is a start, but we need to dig deeper.


This bill may indeed change the face of Australia's corporate culture. It may even give experienced directors more confidence to join start-up boards. Time will tell. We are cautiously optimistic, but our final position will be evidence based. The results of the review in two years will be instructive. This legislation is about business, and Labor is a friend of business—especially small business.



Mr Littleproud interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  No, the chicken hawk can laugh, but Labor really is a friend of business and small business. The fact is we know small business is the engine of employment in this country and we are friends of small business. You can't go around calling corporations small businesses. It's just a nonsense. You can't go around calling Westpac and Commonwealth Bank small businesses.


We know small business runs on tight margins and we know times can get really tough, which is why we have an open mind about the merits of the legislation. Australia is home to 2.1 million small businesses and Tasmania home to 37,000 of them, a number of them in my electorate. They employ around 100,000 Tasmanians. They are vital, especially in regional communities like mine. I know it's almost a rite of passage for small business to criticise government, but the real threat to small business is big business, and it's time this government got on the side of small business and stopped protecting their big-business mates.

Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa) (11:12):  It gives me great pleasure to arise this afternoon and speak in favour of this legislation, because it is the government's responsibility to set the environment and infrastructure around its people—not to get caught up in its lies but to put the environment and infrastructure around them to allow them to innovate, to grow and to invest. That's a government's responsibility. That's what we did back in March when we passed the first tranche of this legislation, passing tax cuts onto small businesses. It's quite interesting that the member for Lyons, the champion of small business, proclaims to know and understand it all. I challenge him and those opposite to understand and know what a small business is. Many on this side, including me, own a small business, have to pay the wages and the electricity, have to understand how to keep it open. Real representation is to understand what economic levers need to be pulled to ensure we get the growth and get the engine room of this nation moving. That's what we did back in March.


But no. These great champions of small business stood in our way and tried to stop it. The hypocrisy of them to come in here and say they are the champions of small business is nothing short of laughable. The reality is we are making the legislative changes. We are pulling the economic levers that are driving growth for small business. There are over 3.2 million small businesses that will take advantage of all of these cuts that we'll be undertaking. But it also ensures that we are going to get now a next level of investment.


Those opposite don't understand the flow of capital. We have to be competitive. When they take off their tinfoil hat with its simplistic understanding of economics—when they understand we are part of a global economy—they will have to understand that we are competing in a global economy and that that's a good thing for this nation. We have to be attractive to actually compete and attract the capital that we need to invest and to continue to see, whether it's a small business or a large business, that they are the engine room that employs people. Those opposite want to take umbrage at trickle-down economics and all that it may or may not be, but let me tell you: we are starting to see the benefits of this so-called trickle-down economics as we are pulling these levers right here and now. There were 240,000 new jobs created. That is real economic growth in our nation. We are seeing exports exponentially increase, particularly in the agricultural sector. There has been an increase of over 18 per cent in agricultural exports because of the environment we are putting around the Australian people. We are putting them in an environment where they are now part of a global economy, lo and behold.


Those opposite are yet to understand that we are part of the world and that it's a good thing because we have what the world wants here, and it's important that we engage the world. It's more important than ever that we engage the world, that we are part of it and that we compete in it. You have to have a competitive environment to be able to be part of that global economy. We've done that with the trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China. We continue to work on trade agreements in Indonesia and opening up greater export opportunities that are putting real wealth in the pockets of people across this nation, and particularly in my electorate of Maranoa, where we're seeing significant growth because of the trade agreements in the agricultural sector in particular. We are seeing people getting real returns. Four or five years ago they got $1.50 per kilo for their beef, and now they're getting $4 or $5 per kilo. That's an exponential increase in their income that flows through.


Talking about trickle-down economics, what happens is that it trickles through the economy when people have more disposable income. Those opposite wouldn't understand, but, when you are a small-business owner and you have an industry like the agricultural sector in your community, you need it to be strong because then more money comes into the business. If you invest in small business and business in this community, they reinvest through more employment and through greater competition. That's what this nation is about. It's about understanding how we fit in a global economy but also how we fit locally and how we can get money to trickle down not only to the Brisbanes, the Sydneys and the Melbournes but to the Romas, the Charlevilles and the Longreaches of this world. No matter your postcode, you are just as precious and just as important in this nation. That's something we should always protect, and that's why we must put an environment around our Australian people to allow them to prosper, to grow and to undertake it.


We must not be the big hand of government and think that we can spend our way out of this. This is the simplistic nature that the Labor Party continue to hold onto. They believe that, as soon as there's trouble, the only way is to spend our way out of it—to be the big hand of government. The reality is that we all have to pay for it at some point, and that's what they forget. They have a never-never scheme where they kick the can down the road. Unfortunately, the generations to come—my three young boys—will be the ones that will have to pay for that legacy of economic vandalism that we've seen time and time again from the Labor Party. They are not understanding how we fit in the world and how we need to have a competitive environment for the people we are here to represent.


If you have faith in our nation and its businesses, they will reinvest in our nation, and we will be where we need to be in our international rankings. When you look at our international tax competitiveness, we were formerly the ninth lowest, and now we're the fifth highest. The reality is that our competitive nature in a global economy has slipped exponentially. If you think that we are not competing with other jurisdictions with respect to tax, it's all about profitability—as the member for Lyons talked about, if they're making profits they're happy, but if they get bigger profits that's when they'll invest. It's understanding how business works. Unfortunately, those opposite haven't had a lot of experience in running businesses. They've been union hacks and political hacks, but they haven't had the responsibility of paying wages, paying electricity bills, paying their rates, understanding what it is to run a business—the responsibility not only to your staff but to your community. That's what we bring to the table in terms of pulling the economic levers that are going to generate the growth. We understand that, if we make the investment in our country, it will give an investment back—a great return.


These measures around international tax competitiveness are so important around the flow of capital. I've been an employee of a major corporate. I'm not saying that all of them are the most socially responsible, but the reality is that they are an important employer in this nation. They are a very important employer in this nation. As someone that has been employed by them and has seen retrenchments over time of some of those people I've worked closely with, I can assure the House that those businesses are no different to small businesses. If they cannot have the competitiveness that they need, they won't reinvest in their businesses and they won't reinvest in the human capital of each and every Australian in order to give them the opportunity to have a job.


There is the simplistic notion of class warfare, where big corporates are bad. Yes, they've got some work to do on some issues. But the reality is that we have to put the environment around them to ensure they are internationally competitive and that we attract the capital flows we need—and deserve—to continue to get the employment that we have to have in this nation. Lo and behold, funnily enough, the people who are employed by those corporates also pay tax. The reality is that the simplistic notion of class warfare that the Labor Party unleash at every opportunity just does not work. It is simplistic; it is politically great for them, but the reality is that our nation suffers. We as a nation are at a tipping point. We are $500 billion in debt. We have to pull the right economic levers now to ensure that we put in place a framework that drives growth for this nation.


It is also around infrastructure priorities that will increase the productivity of our nation. You do not have to look far for that. We are making a significant investment in roads and rail and telecommunications. The NBN will be rolled out across my electorate of Maranoa—nearly 43 per cent of Queensland—by 2018. These things are the tools of the 21st century, the tools we will need in order to take advantage of the trade agreements that we have put in place. There is the $220 million that we have put in place for the mobile phone blackspot program—again, tools of the 21st century that we need in order to take advantage of and engage in the global economy. We must understand that we are part of a world that is there to embrace us. It is an important thing that people in rural and regional Australia understand better than those opposite.


Before I was elected, I went out to a little town called Alpha. I visited a lady who had been in drought for the last six years. I went and did a feed run with her. We were driving around in her ute. She was getting a little emotional about the fact that she had not seen her husband for nearly 18 months because he was off working 700 kilometres away. I said to her, 'Do you really think there's a future in this?' She looked me in the eye and said: 'Mate, I don't even know your politics, but the only person who is important to me is the trade minister. When it rains, I know that all the work I've done over the last five or six years is going to be worth something to me. The cattle are going to get us out of this, and my husband is going to come home to me.' That was somebody in the depths of despair. She had been to the bottom and was still at the bottom. For her to acknowledge and understand our place in this world and the importance of the environment we put around our people is something I will never forget. That is the understanding that the Australian people have. If we empower them to do what they need to do then we will get the investment and the growth that we need.


We can also talk about inland rail—a corridor of commerce from Melbourne to Brisbane. It is going to open up regional Australia far more than ever before. We are going to get our products to the world more quickly. We have what the world wants. In fact, if you want to put the importance of trade agreements to the fore, we have a population of about 24 million people and we produce enough food for 75 million people. If we do not have trade agreements, we as a nation will not have rural and regional Australia.


You can couple that with the tax incentives that we have provided to small businesses. There are 25,000 small businesses in Maranoa that took advantage of the first tranche of this, which those opposite opposed. Those opposite opposed small businesses being able to get on and reinvest in their communities and in their businesses. Those are the types of things that have a real impact. We must understand that capital flow is so important—whether it be the family farm or at the corporate level. That is where real trickle-down economics comes to the fore. Those opposite should not be scared of that, because it works. And we are seeing that transcend now.


In all the data that is coming through, our growth is starting to get to a tipping point where the decisions that this government has made are having an exponential benefit in terms of where this nation will be in 10 or 15 years time. It is about the continuing investment that this government has proudly undertaken in the business environment and infrastructure. If you do that, if you make that case for investment, you will see private investment flow.


I'll give you an example: the Toowoomba bypass, a $1.6 billion investment that's being put in place now that will get the products of Maranoa to the world quicker, has been matched by the Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport. We now have an Australian export hub on our doorstep, where we have weekly cargo flights taking Maranoa product around the world, because we are putting the connectivity in place. There has been private investment: the owners of Wellcamp, private people, made that investment in the people of Queensland and regional Queensland, because we made the initial investment in the Inland Rail and the second range crossing. That's an important step to understand: if you have faith, if you have confidence, in the Australian people, they will respond. And the Wagner family, quite proudly, did. We should be proud of Australians—proud that, when we put the environment and infrastructure around them, they respond. And when they respond, that is a good thing for our nation. Never before have we seen such investment in the electorate of Maranoa, into connectivity: $500 million into the Warrego Highway, and into Inland Rail, $8.4 billion.


This is about connecting us to the real world. I plead with those opposite to put aside the politics, understand our place in the world and understand the importance of how we can interact with the world and how we can take advantage of the competitive advantage that we have with the world's best product. But we have to have an open mind. We have to understand that there is no quick or easy fix on this. You can't spend your way out of this. You have to have sensible policy that will ensure that we empower the people of this nation to go to the next level.


I'm proud to stand here supporting a government that understands small business, that understands the economy and that understands that, if we get these economic levers right, we will make this nation the nation that it deserves to be.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (11:26):  It's my privilege to follow the member for Lyons, in particular, who I thought made a very characteristically useful and considered contribution a little while ago. Even with the member who just spoke, there were parts of what he said—about trade in particular but other things as well—on which I find common ground. But we, on this side, obviously oppose this bill that we're talking about now, for the reasons that have been outlined so well by the member for Lyons, the member for McMahon and indeed all of the speakers on this side of the House.


If you were looking for one bill to sum up, in one piece of legislation, the approach of those opposite, this is it. In this one bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, we have all of the warped priorities, all of the Thatcherite fantasy, all of the trickle-down economics, and all of the wasted money and the fiscal vandalism which have characterised the last four years, and all of the showering of largesse on the top end of town while lecturing middle Australia about debt and deficit disasters. This is a $65 billion ram raid on the budget, which is to be handed directly to multinational corporations and the big four banks at the expense of people who work and who struggle in this country.


Those in this government—if you can believe it—through their policies tell us that they believe that multinational corporations pay too much tax, that people under $87,000 a year pay too little tax and that people get paid too much to work on Sundays. That is the summary of the economic policy of those opposite in this Turnbull government. You couldn't make this stuff up. In their arrogance, they want the Australian people to believe that they can't find $3.8 billion for universities, but they can find $65 billion for big companies in this country; they can't find a billion dollars to maintain the pensioner energy supplement, but they can find $65 billion to give to big business; they can't find the $17 billion for schools; and they can't find the $2.2 billion for GPs and allied health, or the $3 billion for apprentices and TAFE and vocational education, or the $1.6 billion they're cutting out of infrastructure, or the $500 million they're cutting out of the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, or the $300 million they're cutting out of dental, or the $171 million they're cutting from hospital services for veterans, or the $44 million a year they're cutting from homelessness funding.


They can't find any of that; that's too hard to find. That's all too expensive, but they can find $65 billion to give to big business in Australia, and that's what this bill is all about. It does say it all about those opposite; it ticks every box. It's unfair, for the reasons I've just outlined. It's unwise because it won't deliver the growth that we need in this country, the right kind of growth; indeed, it won't deliver much growth at all. And it's unaffordable, particularly at a time when those opposite have made such a mess of the budget that we have record gross debt in this country—high debt, growing, not a peak in sight—under those opposite, and they want to pretend that they are superior economic managers. There's never been more debt on the Commonwealth budget than there is today, and it's growing and there's no peak in sight.


We oppose this bill because, when we have weak growth, this is not the answer. We oppose this bill because, when we have skyrocketing debt, this fiscal vandalism will make the situation worse, not better. We oppose this bill because, when we have more and more people feeling, with some justification, that the rules of the economy are written to benefit others at their expense, this is a recipe for more division in our economy and in our society.


Let me go to some of the details of the claims that those opposite make. The first one, of course, is that this is the only way that we can get growth in our economy. When the government says that, it reminds me of that Johnny Lee song we were talking about before. The member for Herbert and the member for Lindsay were talking about that Johnny Lee song, which talks about 'lookin' for love in all the wrong places'. This government is looking for economic growth in all of the wrong places. There's a lyric in that song which reminds me of the Treasurer. Johnny Lee sings:


Playin' a fools game hopin' to win;


and tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.


That is the best summary of the economic approach from those opposite and the commentary from the Treasurer about economic growth. This is a government looking for growth in all the wrong places.


They want you to believe that the only way to grow the economy is to hand tens of billions of dollars to multinational corporations—a lot of that will go overseas—or to the big four banks, which get about $10 billion of that $65 billion, or by letting the wealthiest Australians choose how much tax they pay via trusts or by giving the biggest tax concessions to those who need them least. The government will have you believe that that's the only way to grow the economy. They just don't get it.


We understand on this side of the House—all of us do—that growth comes from working people having the money to spend and invest and from us deploying tax dollars in an intelligent way where they can do the most good to boost productivity and boost inclusive growth in our economy. Growth comes from giving people a stake in the growth that they help create, rewarding their efforts and their enterprise, ensuring people can participate meaningfully in our economy and in our society. It does not come from lower wages or higher taxes on working people or these tax cuts that we're discussing in this bill. Those opposite are from an alternative universe, where they think that, if you give $10 billion to four banks, to four companies, a $10 billion tax cut, miraculously, those banks will employ more people. The same goes for multinational corporations, where a lot of that tax cut benefit goes overseas.


We do have very serious challenges in our economy, and key among those is the growth challenge. We are all in the car for the right kind of economic growth, but in the national accounts in the last week or so we had some very disturbing figures that showed that we have weak annual growth, falling living standards and flatlining wages—all in that one data release from the ABS. We have annual growth with a one in front of it. The Treasurer wanders around expecting a pat on the back and a round of applause for annual growth with a one in front of it—1.8 per cent. Our economic growth over the year is lower than in Canada, the USA or New Zealand. It's lower than the OECD average. It's been less than two per cent annually for three of the last four quarters. That is the worst result since the global financial crisis.


Real net national disposable income per capita, the best measure of living standards, fell 1.4 per cent in the last quarter. Living standards are going backwards, and wages are flatlining. Average compensation per employee fell 0.1 per cent in the last quarter. Wages went backwards in the most recent national accounts. And economic growth is obviously still well below what we need to cut unemployment, put upward pressure on wages and boost demand in the economy.


Beyond those troubling national accounts figures, the workers' share of national income is at record lows and underemployment is at record highs. I'm conscious that a new set of data has come out while I've been on my feet, which I'll read with interest, but the trend for underemployment has been horrible: there has been record underemployment. People who need more work or more hours at work can't find them. The people-facing part of the economy is suffering. This bill and the government's approach to the economy will turbocharge those challenges, not address them. They are part of the problem, not part of the solution.


On the government's own figures about growth, the growth dividend from this bill we are discussing today—the $65 billion tax cut for big business—will be negligible at best: one per cent over 20 years. We're talking about one per cent in 20 years time. Those opposite go on and on about how this is crucial, this is the key, this is the secret sauce when it comes to getting growth in this economy. We are talking one per cent in 20 years. That's $2 a day in wages per person in 20 years time, on the Treasury modelling. That is what we're talking about here. This is their one-point plan. That will be the miraculous outcome of this one-point plan—so many bucks for so little bang.


The tax cuts in this bill are unfair for the reasons I've described and are unwise. They won't get the growth we need and they're also unaffordable. This is a $65 billion ram-raid on the budget. It's the single biggest piece of fiscal vandalism of the Abbott-Turnbull government. We have this mess in the budget, despite the fact that the government is actually raising something like $77 billion more in taxes in 2017-18 than was raised in 2012-13, the last year of the Labor government. Tax to GDP, which is the measure that we rely on to see how much tax is being paid in the economy, is higher for every year in the forward estimates in the most recent budget than it was in any year under the former Labor government. This government is taxing more than the former Labor government did and yet still we've got net debt at record levels for the next two years. We've got a deficit for this year 10 times bigger than was predicted in Joe Hockey's first budget. We've got half a trillion dollars in gross debt. That is the first time that has ever happened in Australian history: half a trillion dollars in gross debt! And gross debt doesn't even peak. It blows out to $725 billion over the medium term with no peak in sight. Gross debt continues to rise. The interest bill is about $5.5 billion, or $220 for every man, woman and child in this country. The coalition is racking up gross debt $1.4 billion a month faster than Labor, in good global economic conditions. We racked up debts lower than this government during a global financial crisis. Think about that. Debt is being racked up faster when we've got pretty good global conditions now than it was in the life of the former Labor government, which dealt with—successfully, I'm proud to say—the biggest synchronised downturn in the global economy since the 1930s. Think about that. It is a pretty extraordinary achievement for those opposite to rack up debt faster in good conditions than Australia did during the global financial crisis.


There is a whole range of numbers which go to the core of the incompetence of those opposite and the hypocrisy of lecturing people about debt and deficit disasters—all of those sorts of things—at the same time that, on their watch, debt and deficit have blown out substantially across all of those measures. No matter which way you carve it, the numbers don't lie. Gross debt, net debt, debt per person—on all of these measures, those opposite have made a mess of the budget. They would like us to pretend that handing $65 billion to multinational corporations and the big four banks in Australia will somehow be the answer to all of our challenges, when we've got anaemic growth and sky rocketing debt and deficit. This bill will be part of the problem and not part of the solution.


Under this government, you can understand why more and more Australians feel deeply frustrated that, no matter how hard they work, the economy doesn't work for them. They just can't get ahead no matter how hard they work. They do the right thing and try and provide for their families but they feel like the rules of the economy—with some justification—are written to benefit somebody else at their expense.


On this side of the House, we want the rules of the economy to accord with our values: we grow strongest when we grow together; if you work hard, you should be rewarded for it; if you fall behind or fall down, we will be there to help you up. That is a summary of the economic approach this side of the House takes to the Australian economy. That's why we have been announcing all these policies.


I give credit to the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow Assistant Treasurer and all of the colleagues. The policies that we've been announcing are so important to ensuring that the rules of the economy accord with our values. They are part of a larger purpose: to ensure that we can have inclusive growth, that we can have reward for effort in this country, and we can have a decent social safety net for those who fall down or fall behind.


The previous speaker, the member for Maranoa, and indeed a number of the speakers on that side of the House, are fond of saying in the media that our position on handing $65 billion to multinationals and the big four banks is somehow based on some kind of politics of envy or some kind of class war. But that argument, the argument they put over and over and over again, rests on a really tired, old, dishonest absurdity that pretends that the only way to maintain cohesion in this country is to give the biggest tax breaks to those who need them least or pay people less to work on weekends or give tax cuts to the top and tax hikes to the bottom or to shower largesse on the people who need it least in our economy. Theirs is a recipe for more division. It's damaging to the budget, to the economy and to society.


It's far more divisive to hack at the safety net or let the wealthiest people choose how much tax to pay or hand over tens of billions of dollars in company tax cuts at the same time as they lecture middle Australia about tightening their belts. This country is looking for economic growth. That growth will be found in decent incomes so that people can save and invest and provide for their families and in a new government which prioritises the actual drivers of growth and productivity and which recognises that the best growth in this country is people-powered and from the bottom up. Growth won't be found in this $65 billion tax cut or in the trickle-down economics that it represents. (Time expired)

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2017-09-14,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:42):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. We're talking about tax. Let's start with the comments of the shadow Treasurer on this matter in no less a publication than his Hearts & Minds, a somewhat grandly-titled publication of 2013. He started out by saying:


… it's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


And he is right. When the shadow Treasurer said that in Hearts & Minds back in 2013, he was right. He's often wrong—he's usually wrong—but, on this matter, he was right. He said:


At 30 per cent, our company tax rate is now above the OECD average … it is how the rate compares to that of our competitors that counts.


And he was right about that too. It's not overly complex when you think about it. If you're a company and you have a choice to invest in different places around the world, are you going to favour places where you have to pay a very high rate of tax or are you going to favour places where you pay a more competitive rate of tax? It's pretty obvious and it's set out in a very lucid fashion by the shadow Treasurer in Hearts & Minds. The opposition leader has also spoken at length on this issue. He did so in 2012 when he was the Assistant Treasurer. He spoke to ACOSS about company tax, and had some wise words for the ACOSS audience assembled on that day back in March of 2012. He said:


… corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


…


Reducing the corporate tax rate … sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages—thereby improving standards of living.


A very sensible analysis. He said:


And because reducing the company rate is an economic growth instrument—


he was right about that too—


reducing the corporate tax rate … is also an investment in the Australian people—including people who might now be on welfare and require the services of ACOSS members.


Helping companies to grow improves employment and is good for the economy and is good for those workers for whom new jobs are created. That was a very, very sensible position for the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer to take.


But, of course, now we see this very, very transparent campaign to demonise any large company as somehow bad for the nation. The terms 'big end of town' or 'top end of town', you will be interested to know, have been used in the parliament in the last year more than 300 times. That suggests an ongoing campaign by those opposite to try to convey the idea that large companies are bad for Australia. But the reality is that large companies employ about 4 million Australians including thousands and thousands of people who live in my electorate. I don't find, certainly in my community—and I suspect the same would be the case around Australia—a sense that people want large companies to exit our shores. To the contrary, what people want is for large companies to invest in Australia and to create the millions and millions of jobs that they do. That's appropriate, and that's why this government is so supportive of policies that create competitive company tax rates.


Of course we have already passed the first round of the enterprise tax bill, which was opposed by those opposite. Those opposite say that if a company has revenue of $2 million or more, it is a big company which should not receive corporate tax relief. That's what those opposite say. Those opposite think that if a company has turnover of $2 million, it means that it makes $2 million of profit. But, of course, it doesn't, because most companies might have a profit margin of maybe five per cent or six per cent—something like that. So a company that's turning over $2 million might be making about $100,000, which is about the average household income in Australia. Those opposite say that is a large company that should not be entitled to corporate tax relief, and they voted against it. They voted against tax relief for a small company in suburban Sydney with $2.1 million in revenue. That is just the reality. 




Ms Husar:
  Not in western Sydney. 




Dr CHALMERS:
  They think that is the right thing to do. They think that a company with $2 million of revenue is a large company that's not worthy of tax relief. The member for Lindsay was interjecting saying 'not in western Sydney' they don't have those companies, but, actually, we have thousands of them. A company that turns over $2 million in revenue is a very small business, but those opposite literally think that that is a large company and they voted against relief for a company with $2 million in revenue. It is an extraordinary policy, and it really does speak to the anti-investment, anti-success agenda of those opposite. 


The Leader of the Opposition recently said that in Australia there is a sense that your success in life is predetermined by your parents' income. That's just wrong. Every person in this place, and the vast majority of people around Australia, would say that their success in life has been overwhelmingly determined by their own efforts. That's what we believe on this side of the House. We believe very strongly in promoting innovation and investment and, basically, in backing people who get out there and make things happen. In the absence of that, the economy doesn't grow and we have a weaker economy and a weaker society. The strength of Australia—one of its many strengths—is the fact that people do take risks, people do invest and people do get out there and make things happen. That is why we are so supportive of corporate tax reform—to encourage people to invest more in this wonderful country. 


The enterprise tax plan part 2 that we are discussing today will bring tax relief to those businesses with turnover of more than $50 million. Those opposite have already voted against the enterprise tax bill No. 1. Presumably, they will now vote against enterprise tax bill No. 2. It is important to know that there are 3.85 million Australian employees who are employed in companies that will benefit from these provisions. They will benefit because the company will have greater incentive to invest in Australia. Those opposite say that shouldn't occur. They say that it's a giveaway to companies—which is instructive in itself because it implies that all of the money is the government's for the government to decide what to do with, when, in fact, the money has been generated by these companies and not by the government. The government is the one taking the money, not the other way around. We say: let those companies keep more of the money they have generated so that they can reinvest more in our society and create more jobs. That is self-evidently a good thing to do.


But it is important to reflect on the policies of those opposite when it comes to tax. It is the most anti-investment, anti-innovation agenda we have seen from the Labor Party for many decades. I want to briefly run through the list of all the problems they would present for investment in Australia if they were to become the government. One of the things that those opposite propose is that any form of investment in Australia be subject to a 50 per cent increase in capital gains tax when it is sold. Labor say they want to do that because of issues to do with the housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. But they propose that capital gains tax be increased by 50 per cent for absolutely everything. So if you invest in a factory, a farm, a technology company, a warehouse, if you help a friend by investing in a small business—a cafe, a small restaurant or whatever—you will pay 50 per cent more tax under Labor's so-called housing affordability policy.


This is a very important point. If somebody wants to build a factory in Western Sydney, of which there are many thousands, to create jobs in Western Sydney, why should they pay 50 per cent more tax? That is an extraordinarily bad policy. It has nothing to do with housing affordability. I would absolutely welcome from anyone in the opposition an explanation of the link between housing affordability and increasing by 50 per cent a tax on investment in a factory, a warehouse or any other job-creating area. Nobody in the opposition has ever articulated such a link—because there isn't one. The policy is that, to address housing affordability, capital gains tax will be increased by 50 per cent. But no-one in the opposition has ever explained why they decided to extend that to factories in Western Sydney, warehouses in regional Queensland and farms in Western Australia. On all of those things, when sold, there is a requirement to pay 50 per cent more tax under Labor's housing affordability policy. If someone would like to articulate why they have done that and how it is related to housing affordability, that would be very welcome. But they won't do that, because there is no link. The reason for this policy from those opposite is that it raises more revenue—which would mean the government would have more money. That is why they want to do it. It has absolutely nothing to do with housing affordability.


Another issue is Labor's policy with respect to negative gearing. Labor's policy is that people investing in an investment property should not be able to claim the cost of interest even though that has been possible in Australia for more than 100 years. For more than 100 years, you have been able to claim the cost of interest when investing in investment properties; that actually applies to any investment, although much of it is investment properties. Labor say you should not be able to do that. And then they say this will have no impact on the market, that all the people who invest in properties will continue to do so. They say the fact that property investors will not be able to claim an interest deduction will not have any impact on rent, because they will have exactly the same rental income; they will not increase rents even though the total cost of owning the property will be higher because they no longer have the ability to make use of negative gearing. So Labor say there will be no increase in rents under negative gearing, even though they acknowledge that the person who owns the investment property will have to pay more. The person who owns the investment property will have to pay more, but Labor say the person who owns the investment property will not pass on a dollar of that cost to any renter in Australia. That is an extraordinary and absurd policy, and that is why it is so important to continue to articulate in a very precise way the cost of that policy.


They also want people who earn $180,000 to pay one in two dollars to the government. If that isn't a disincentive to work hard, what is? That is an extraordinary impost.


They also say that the hundreds of thousands of Australian businesses who make use of trust structures and who have done so for many decades should not be allowed to do so. They say that it's only going to be affecting a very modest number of people. They say they have modelling from the Parliamentary Budget Office on this issue of how many Australians will be affected by Labor's policy of effectively abolishing the use of trusts by small business. We say: release the modelling. The Parliamentary Budget Office would be perfectly fine with those opposite releasing the modelling on what their attack on trusts will do to the small business sector. The Parliamentary Budget Office isn't stopping the Leader of the Opposition from releasing that modelling. The only person who is stopping the Leader of the Opposition from releasing the modelling is the Leader of the Opposition. He should do so. He should be very, very frank and say, 'This is the exact number of the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in Australia who will be affected by this attack on trusts.' They have the number and they have the modelling. It has been provided by the PBO. They should put it out there in the public domain if they are so confident in it.


From those opposite we hear an extraordinary litany of attacks on aspiration and attacks on investment, whether it's on negative gearing, capital gains, trusts, not supporting company tax cuts or attacking investment on a range of levels. They have an antisuccess, anti-investment and antigrowth agenda. On this side of parliament, we are unashamedly pro growth and unashamedly supportive of business investment. We will back businesses to invest in this country and to employ millions of Australians. We have already got the runs on the board with the first tranche of these enterprise tax cuts. This is a very important second step, and it should be supported by all members in the House.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2017-09-14,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (12:00):  I move:


That this House condemns the Leader of the Opposition for deliberately misleading the Australian public on power prices.


Let's start with the claim. On Tuesday, the Leader of the Opposition stated, 'The research shows that the average power bills for a Sydney household have gone up by nearly $1,000.' On the same day in parliament he said to the Prime Minister:


What about the $1,000 extra that Sydney householders are paying on his watch?


It was a claim he repeated in the House yesterday. Yesterday his shadow spokesman on energy, the member for Port Adelaide, said in the House:


Since this government came into office power bills have gone up by $1,000 for the average Sydney household. That figure is based on data from the government's own Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission, reported in The Australian newspaper.


But The Australian newspaper never reported such a figure. It was concocted by the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition and was designed to mislead the Australian people. And again Labor members followed their Leader of the Opposition, repeating this $1,000 false claim. The member for Parramatta, the member for Shortland, the member for Kingsford Smith, the member for Lindsay, the member for Werriwa, the member for Wills, the member for Cunningham, the member for Hunter and the member for Blaxland all repeated this false claim.


And then Labor's false claim was repeated and used in the media. Last night, in Andrew Probyn's package on the ABC News, this $1,000 false claim was repeated to hundreds of thousands of Australians. But let me tell the House that the Leader of the Opposition's $1,000 claim for an electricity price increase for the average Sydney household is false, is dishonest and is designed to deliberately mislead the Australian people. It has wrongly asserted data from Australia's independent Australian Energy Regulator and was designed to deceive the Australian people.


This is what the independent Australian Energy Regulator has said in response to the claims from those opposite: '


The Australian Energy Regulator has not published any data outlining the price increases claimed in the article. The price increases in the article are inconsistent with the data published by the Australian Energy Regulator.'


This data suggests that prices have gone down in Sydney by 2.3 per cent from the end of 2013 to July 2017. I table the advice from the Australian Energy Regulator. Similarly, the independent Australian Energy Market Commission has stated in response to these claims: 'The Australian Energy Market Commission's figures cannot be the basis of the estimates of price increases published in The Australian article on 10 July 2017.' I table the advice from the Australian Energy Market Commission, which conflicts with the claims made by those opposite.


There we have it in black and white. The Leader of the Opposition, his energy spokesman and a host of frontbench and backbench colleagues have used the good names of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission, attributing to them data that never existed while cooking up on that side of the House a fake figure of a $1,000 increase in Sydney households designed to mislead the Australian people. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean, to apologise to the Australian people and to come into this House and correct the record.


We have seen this all before, because the Leader of the Opposition has a pathological pattern of behaviour to deceive, to falsify and to mislead the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition has a pathological pattern of behaviour to deceive, to falsify and to mislead the Australian people. It goes to the question of integrity, because the Leader of the Opposition is not fit to be Prime Minister of this country. He's not fit to be Prime Minister of the country. We all know about 'Mediscare'. Those opposite were prepared to deceive millions of Australian pensioners and the most vulnerable in our society with a lie, with a mistruth, with a false claim. If we hadn't exposed this $1,000 false claim from the Leader of the Opposition—



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  I remind the member for Shortland that he's not in his seat. You're not in your seat. Nor is the member for Lyons or the member for Cowan.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  who would know that millions of Australians may have gotten a text message attributed to the Australian Energy Regulator? It's just like what they did with the 'Mediscare' campaign.


The Leader of the Opposition's bad behaviour is not confined to 'Mediscare'. What about his bad behaviour with the workers of Clean Event? As a union boss, he sold out the workers to line the pockets of the unions. What about his efforts in getting $100,000 from the good workers of the unions and giving it to GetUp!? Money that came from the coal workers was given to GetUp! to close coal-fired power stations—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister will resume his seat. I call the Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Burke:
  I will just make a point of order briefly, if I may. This particular resolution, a resolution on notice condemning a member of parliament by direct resolution and claiming deliberately misleading, is a resolution rarely moved. When it's moved, the relevance rules are relatively strict. The minister has now strayed a long way from the subject of the motion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I call the minister. I have allowed him to continue.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  The Leader of the Opposition has a pathological pattern of behaviour to deceive, to falsify and to mislead the Australian people.


We know that he has concocted this $1,000 figure, he has taken the good name of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission and he has got the Labor members opposite to repeat this false claim and to mislead the Australian people. On the issue of rising energy prices, the public concern is genuine, but the Leader of the Opposition's concern is not genuine. When we came to government at the end of 2013, we inherited a mess. We inherited electricity prices that had increased by more than 100 per cent, and they had actually increased by more than that in Sydney. We immediately took action to abolish the carbon tax, and those opposite tried three times to stop us. But when the carbon tax was abolished, we saw the biggest single drop ever recorded, and we have the ACCC saying that Australian householders were, overall, $550 better off.


When we came to government, as I said to the House yesterday, the Australian Energy Regulator in their State of the energy market report shows that electricity bills for an average household in Sydney have varied from increasing by about $1 to falling by $473 in accordance with the latest data in May. Take, for example, Ausgrid: in 2013, their customers saw a 3.9 per cent increase; in 2014, they saw a 5.5 per cent decrease; in 2015, they saw a 6.6 per cent decrease; and, in 2016, they saw a 9.1 per cent increase. We know that Australian households are doing it tough. On 1 July this year, AGL increased average Sydney household bills by $296, Origin increased bills by $310 and EnergyAustralia increased bills by $320. The combined effect of these changes on the average Sydney household bill, since we came to office, means that the price for an average Sydney household varies from increasing by $321 to decreasing by $177. This is nowhere even close to the Labor Party's claim: a fabrication of $1,000. 



Mr Brian Mitchell interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  Order! I remind the member for Lyons that he is out of his seat. 




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  I table the AER's documentation indicating those numbers. We have taken action on a number of fronts to relieve the pressure on household power bills. The Prime Minister has taken action to provide more gas into the domestic market, action to rein in the power of the networks, action to get better deals for the retailers and action to keep existing coal-fired power stations going. These are all actions of a responsible government focused on affordable, reliable power. This contrasts with those opposite with a Leader of the Opposition who's not fit for government, a Leader of the Opposition who has misappropriated the good names of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission and a Leader of the Opposition who has come into this place and made up a figure—a false figure—of a thousand-dollar increase for average household power prices. The member for Port Adelaide should be ashamed of himself because he has made up a number and misled the House. The Labor Party has misled the House. The Labor Party has not produced one valid document to assert its statement is correct. 



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Hunter! The member for Hunter is defying the chair. Order! 




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  I will end where I started. The Leader of the Opposition has concocted the number of a thousand-dollar increase. He has used the good name of the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission. There is now documentation on the record contradicting and conflicting with the claims made by the Labor Party. Only this side of the House is focused on a more affordable and reliable system, and only the Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage or the conviction to come into this House, to be honest with the Australian people, to correct the record and to explain why he made up this false figure to mislead and deceive the Australian people.

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Leader of the Opposition</title>,MOTIONS,8,1,speech
"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (12:15):  Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, you can't imagine how pleased I am to take this debate, because they have got to be kidding! The last time we had overreach like this was when John Howard said that under Work Choices workers had never had it better. Remember that? Billboard after billboard destroyed his government because of that arrogance, that sense of being so out of touch that the government does not understand what is happening in households across the country. This motion exemplifies how arrogant and out of touch this government is.


The Minister for the Environment and Energy came into the parliament yesterday afternoon and effectively said to the 2½ million Sydney households, 'You've never had it so good.' He came into this House and said to 2½ million Sydney households that under the coalition government power prices have decreased by as much as $473. This minister said that $473 is the cash that Sydney households have in their pockets because of the cuts in their power bills under this government. Sydney households should be grateful for the bountiful sums that have flowed their way from reduced power bills under this minister and his predecessor. He said that with a straight face.


I do admit that the minister did concede that some Sydney households had experienced an increase in their power bills—an increase of $1. He said $1, not $1 per week but $1 per year over the whole of the long four years of this shocking government.


The member for Lindsay gave me a good suggestion earlier today. She said: 'Rather than have this debate in the rarefied atmosphere of Canberra, why don't you'—the minister—'join me in Penrith and have this debate? You can hear from Sydney households how grateful they are for the extra $473 that you say they have in reduced power bills. They'll be throwing rose petals your way, in your path, as you steam into Penrith to gracefully tell them how they've got reduced power bills.' I will tell you this: the member for Lindsay and other representatives of Sydney households on this side of parliament know what's happening in the real world of Sydney power bills. They know that under this government they are going up and up and up. Last year alone, according to The Sydney Morning Herald, they went up by $200 a year on average. As the minister belatedly admits, Sydney households are experiencing power bill increases this year of around 20 per cent. News.com.au says that, on average, for a Sydney household it is about $600 a year—but the minister didn't refer to that yesterday.


This is a government that is so out of touch that it thinks that Sydney households are experiencing a bounty of reduced power bills that are nothing but a fantasy. Perhaps that's why this minister for energy is supporting his Treasurer in cutting the energy supplement to 400,000 age pensioners, to 108,000 disability support pensioners, to 105,000 carers, to single parents and to other families on income support, because apparently their power bills are going down. They don't need the $550 energy supplement paid to the most vulnerable households in our community.


And it's not just households, because business after business has been walking the halls of this parliament over the last fortnight and talking about their energy price rises across the country, including in New South Wales. And we know the figures they're quoting: they're talking to the media and they're talking to members on this side about 70 per cent, 80 per cent, 90 per cent and even 100 per cent increases in their power contracts in New South Wales—all because of this government's stunning underperformance on energy policy.


Now, the reasons for this are very clear. Under this government, 4,000 megawatts of dispatchable power have been taken out of the system. Seven coal-fired power stations, equivalent to powering six million households, have been taken out of the system. I'd love the minister to get up and tell us how many megawatts of dispatchable power have been built in the more than four years of this government, because it's zero. It's absolutely zero! We had the Prime Minister boast about the 2,900 megawatts of gas-fired generation installed in the last decade. He didn't say it was all under the last Labor government, and that not a single megawatt of dispatchable power has been built in the long four years of this government.


But we also know that it's not just the Turnbull government that's let Sydney households down. We saw the ACCC in the paper again this morning, complaining about the Liberal state government's botched privatisation of New South Wales power generation, pushing power prices up for Sydney households, which are already having to suffer at the hands of this incompetent, out-of-touch government.


This government has plunged this country into the deepest energy crisis in living memory. To the minister, I say: power prices are not going down. They are not going down; they are going up and up and up under this government. For the first time in living memory, two-thirds of the nation is at risk of blackouts in coming summers because this government has built no dispatchable power generation, while 4,000 megawatts of dispatchable power has left the system on this government's watch.


It's not just dispatchable power and it's not just power prices: pollution is going up. One in three renewable energy jobs has been lost under this minister and under this government, because of their attacks on renewable energy. One in three jobs! Thousands of workers in renewable energy have lost their jobs because of this government's ideological attacks. And it's all the more unforgiveable because they actually have a blueprint to get the nation out of this deep hole. They have a blueprint to get the nation out of this hole: it's called the Finkel report, a report commissioned by the government itself from the Chief Scientist of Australia that recommends the clearest possible way forward. The clearest possible way forward is a clean energy target, one that's got the support of business and the support of state governments. The opposition has said that we'll constructively engage with them. But why isn't the clean energy target progressing? I wonder why the clean energy target is not progressing? Because two years ago we changed the Prime Minister, but we didn't actually change who runs this show. The member for Warringah runs this show! The member for Hughes has a pretty significant influence as well but is second to the member for Warringah, who really runs this show.


We've got article, after article, after article laying bare all the internal divisions of this sad and sorry government.

Mr BUTLER:
  Yesterday we got 'Turnbull retreats on clean energy'. He said this was the way forward, but no, he can't get his party room to do it. We saw yesterday, 'Abbott fuels push from backbench against clean target', proving again that you may have changed the Prime Minister two years ago but you didn't change who runs the show; you didn't change who's got a veto over policy, including climate and energy policy. It's still the member for Warringah who runs this show!

Mr BUTLER:
  I'll take that, Deputy Speaker. There are no limits to this government's arrogance. There are no limits to how out of touch this government and all on its backbench are. The Australian people know with power prices; they know that under this government they're going up and up. They know their wages are flat. They know that the Prime Minister is cutting the energy supplement. They know the government is giving tax cuts to millionaires and tax cuts to big business. They know that the government is making their kids pay more to go to university. I tell you what: they'll find this government out.


As an amendment to the proposition, I move:


That all words after ""condemns"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the Prime Minister for being so out of touch that his Government is telling the average Sydney household that since this Government was elected in 2013, their power bills have only gone up by $1 or gone down by more than $470 a year"".

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (12:51):  Mr Speaker, it is lovely that you are in the chair for a change and I'm not addressing the Deputy Speaker. It's nice to have you in here while I'm giving a speech!


I rise in support of my colleagues who are opposing the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. We have just spent an hour in this House debating something that is absolutely trivial and ridiculous—playing politics rather than spending an hour addressing one of the key issues affecting the hardworking men and women of Australia.


This bill we are talking about now will deliver companies with a turnover of more than $50 million a progressive tax cut to 25 per cent. This follows the Turnbull government's tax cuts to 25 per cent for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million and a tax cut bonanza for individuals, if they are millionaires, in the order of a $16,000 bonus. That's a $16,000 bonus for some of our wealthiest Australians. That's nice for them. I take nothing away from them; that's fine. But there are real stories and real people who actually need that and who could do with having access to tax cuts. We know that the OECD has already said that, when you give tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners, the rest of the nation benefits.


The forward estimates provided for this bill show that the Turnbull government will suck $600 million out of the bottom line over the forward estimates and $36.5 billion over the medium term from hardworking Australians. Let that just sink in: $36.5 billion over the medium term. For a government, a party and an outfit that ran around during the election and cried, 'Debt and deficit!' to anybody who would listen, to increase that kind of debt to our nation's bottom line is crazy. We've heard the figure: $36.5 billion. I actually still can't believe the numbers that have passed my lips, given the opportunities in our community where that money would be better spent and invested—and not just in my community but in the nation as a whole. This is $600 million that won't help all Australians. A trickle-down world just doesn't work.


Whatever happened to fairness? On budget night, we heard it was all going to be fair, but I don't know how stripping $600 million out of the budget for the forward estimates is actually going to be fair to anybody other than the people who are beneficiaries of it. And there are not too many beneficiaries of those cuts in my electorate, for example.


Whatever happened to ensuring we leave in this place in a better state than we found it in? As the member for Rankin pointed out in his speech, which was an hour ago—before the comedy hour that we just had—the Turnbull government's record stinks after four years. To suggest anything else is absolutely fanciful. They keep coming in here, and their favourite topic of the day is Labor, the unions and Bill Shorten, the opposition leader. They never talk about what they've done. They never talk about what they've invested in. They never talk about the opportunities that they're providing, or particularly the opportunities that they're not providing, to people in Western Sydney. Just take a look at the budget and you might see why.


The Turnbull government will deliver new record net debt for the next three years. That's a deficit for the 2017-18 years which is 10 times bigger than predicted in the Liberals' first budget—10 times!—and gross debt equivalent to $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. That is absolutely at the end of extremes. It's another gift from the Abbott-Turnbull outfit that the community is going to have to swallow.


Given what we know and what we already see, why would the people I represent in Lindsay think the Turnbull government could possibly understand the issues they face in Western Sydney? Those opposite have failed them abysmally, time and time again. When you consider the legislation before the House, you get an insight into how useless they actually are.


Yesterday we witnessed the embarrassing scene of a government gagging a debate over cuts to university funding and burdening students with more debt. These are cuts to education and universities—the future-proofing assets we should be investing in. The government is scalping universities with $4 billion worth of cuts, and ripping off another section of Australia and exposing more underfunding.


The Turnbull government thought it could slash funding the easiest in Western Sydney, with the largest university funding cut in New South Wales and the second-largest in Australia—just another kick in the guts for Western Sydney. The first and the second come from my electorate. The Turnbull government believes you have no right to a decent education and certainly not to a degree. The member for Banks over there told me about all the great warehousing opportunities that Western Sydney was allowed to have. Well, thanks very much. I've got enough warehouses now. What I'd really like is a few degree-qualified kids who can go into the jobs of the future. The government does want you to have a job, because it needs to raid your pockets. It's happy for us to work in warehouses; it's just not happy for us to get qualified. All this, just so that it can keep supporting the big end of town.


Western Sydney University is an unfortunate example of how this bill before us attacks the very fabric of what is right and what is decent. Western Sydney uni has been a leader in addressing educational inequality facing our community. It's a university where 60 per cent of the students are the first in their families to attend university—an amazing figure, and one that only goes to highlight what educational opportunity is actually about. Those in the government want to give these tax cuts to the big end of town on the backs of universities in Western Sydney. Western Sydney uni is home to 20 per cent of students who are considered of low economic status and 37 per cent of students who speak a language other than English at home. These are more than just statistics. These are realities that are changing Western Sydney. We are not one-dimensional stereotypes that wear high-vis vests and work in warehouses, thank you very much. Western Sydney is an area that is transitioning from a traditional jobs base to a more diverse and broad base. It is an area that wants to create and keep those jobs local. We can't rely on those people opposite to support them.


If this government is not cutting university funding and burdening students with debt, it is going to the other extreme and ruining apprenticeships and vocational training. We've had a 37 per cent drop in the number of apprentices in training in Lindsay. What does this government want Western Sydney to think? Do you want new jobs for the future? It appears not. There is nothing agile and innovative about making cuts to education to low socio-economic communities. Do you want more tradies? It also appears not. It's just a confused rabble of noise coming from the other side, and that last hour that we spent in here highlights that more than anything. Let me give you guys opposite some professional advice—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  Order! Remember you are addressing the chair when you use the term 'you'.




Ms HUSAR:
  Sure. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me give you some professional advice from the OECD, and you can pass it on to the Turnbull government if you like. The March OECD economic surveys: Australia notes the increasing concerns about inequality. It said:


Developing innovation-related skills will be important for the underprivileged and those displaced by economic restructuring and can help reduce gender wage gaps.


How about we talk about that? Let me remind those opposite: Western Sydney University has 20 per cent of its student body coming from low socio-economic backgrounds. Their female student body comprises 57 per cent of the student population. But wait—the OECD said more. The recommendations went on to say that growth could be bolstered through strong collaboration between business and research. Moreover, it recommended that Australia:


Put a greater weight … on collaboration in university funding and develop a more coordinated approach to industry placements for research students to strengthen the linkages between research and business sectors.


How does the Turnbull government deal with that recommendation? The Turnbull government will attempt to put an end to UWS's ability to partner with industry and government in proven job-creation programs. Really, in the face of such strong recommendations from such an esteemed organisation like the OECD, why is it that Western Sydney University will be jeopardised in the delivery of key collaborations and partnerships for start-ups, small to medium enterprises and future jobs and growth? It makes no sense to make these cuts at the expense of funding the university.


But that's not the end of it. The Turnbull government continues to make the wrong choices across all parts of Australia, robbing from the hardworking workers of Australia and giving to the rich and to the big end of town. Those in the government continue to tell themselves and us that they are the greatest economic managers this country has ever seen. But, taken as a whole, far from helping our communities this government has wreaked havoc on and terrified them as it continues, hell-bent, on its right-wing, trickle-down economic strategy. But we all know it doesn't work. By the time it trickles down to my community and electorate, all it will be is thin air.


Let's just have a look at Lindsay. I'm sad to say that the member for Banks has scuttled out of here, because he tried to tell me that there were so many businesses in my electorate that were going to benefit from these cuts to big multinational tax companies. Now, according to the ABS, Lindsay has 10,313 businesses operating right now. The vast majority of those businesses have a turnover of less than $2 million. A quarter turn over less than $50,000. So, when you look at businesses with $10 million or more of turnover, you'll find just 119 businesses out of 10,313 across Lindsay that may actually get something out of this. This is just over one per cent of businesses. They're not the businesses that are actually turning $50 million; they're just somewhere between $10 million and $50 million, and that is only a very, very small portion.


But the cuts that are coming as a result of this splash to big business actually affect more people in my electorate. The biggest factor in the trickle-down strategy is that they have to rob the workers—the penalty rates of all those young people; women, predominantly; students; pensioners and welfare recipients who want to get back on their feet—just to pay for it and to give handouts to big businesses. Every day here in parliament we are faced with legislation that just creates more and more disparity in our society. The people of Western Sydney want a government they can trust—a government that will invest in them and their futures. They do not want to be milked at every opportunity so that those opposite can pay for the bottomless pit that is corporate profit and corporate greed.


It is fanciful to think these changes are going to trickle down, when all we see is the reinforcement of inequality and the things that drive it. Economic and social disadvantage will be entrenched by this government, robbing people of opportunity. That is the legacy of this government, and I'm sad to say that it affects the people in my area—the community that I love and represent, and one of the hardest hit by these tax cuts, with disadvantages in schools and the university. It gives a tax break to the wealthy on the backs of every single student cohort across my electorate. And we haven't even got to the Nepean Hospital yet! We have a health system in distress and an underfunded Nepean Hospital that could do with some of the money that they are cutting just to give these corporate tax handouts to big businesses.


They have made affordable housing an impossible dream for more and more people because they refuse to take any action on it, and they have killed off any chance of saving when the cost of living just keeps rising but wages don't. But I suppose we can all just wait for the big end of town to open up their wallets. I'm sure those big banks and mining companies who are going to be the beneficiaries of these tax cuts are on the edge of their seats, they are waiting so much just to distribute their profits to the community! Well, let me tell you, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, I cannot see a time, or a world or an age in which we will live where the people who are being hurt by these tax cuts are actually going to be benefitted by any of them.


Try as I might to see what could possibly be a win for the people in Lindsay on this bill, I can only conclude that they get nothing out of this. Nothing—not one thing. And on the point of equality and disadvantage in Western Sydney, we know it all too well—all too well. I see the member for Parramatta here. She will know this, and when she speaks I'm sure that she will get up and talk about how unequally the people in Western Sydney get treated.


I'm going to point out to those opposite again, and again and again, the rip-offs and the rorts that are happening to the people of Western Sydney. This government has dudded us on education in Lindsay, with $23 million snatched from primary and secondary schools—schools that are at capacity and over capacity. We have university students slugged with higher fees, paying back their HELP debts at a much lower income threshold in the name of reducing debt. That is forgetting that these young men and women will now have the burden of paying off $50,000 debts while trying to enter the workforce and coming into that workforce at the ground level, whilst also seeking an independent lifestyle.


We see more and more focus on the casualisation of the workforce and more and more attacks on penalty rates. They're looking like they're going to come after a couple more awards yet, before they're actually finished having a go at people who earn penalty rates. We've got a housing crisis, and we've got an energy crisis. What we've just seen from the government is that they would rather spend an hour in here playing politics with energy than actually addressing it. It would have been nice to have that last hour actually debating some of the things that we could fix and we could change, but instead we saw an absolutely hopeless government playing politics.


Pensioners in Western Sydney have had their energy supplements scrapped. We've got energy prices out of control, and now they're scrapping the pensioners' energy supplement to pay for these big corporate tax cuts. From cradle to grave, under Malcolm Turnbull, you can expect to be having your pockets raided. The Turnbull government seem to only understand the value of a corporate dividend, which is no surprise given that he came out of Goldman Sachs, not from a hardworking western suburbs community.


How about those opposite start to try and understand the value of the society that they are actually meant to represent? We need investment in people and investment in services. How will this Prime Minister ever be able to have his 30-minute utopian villages that he crowed about last week in Erskine Park by cutting the services that those people out there rely on? The government claim they want to help people with the cost-of-living pressures. We just don't see that reflected in here. Young people are entitled, absolutely, to say: 'Yeah, right. Absolutely. Whatever.'


The government are increasing the cost of living and making everything harder to attain, not easier. With this bill, we see them giving more and more money to corporates, giving them a tax handout from this magic cash cow, increasing the country's debt to a whole new level that we've not seen before in this country on the backs of every single student group; the Nepean Hospital, in my electorate; the community legal centres that they helped defund; and children's education. They won't put any more money into stopping the national scourge that is domestic violence. They can't fund the universities. They certainly cannot find the money to support the people who need to be supported.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (12:51):  Mr Speaker, it is lovely that you are in the chair for a change and I'm not addressing the Deputy Speaker. It's nice to have you in here while I'm giving a speech!


I rise in support of my colleagues who are opposing the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. We have just spent an hour in this House debating something that is absolutely trivial and ridiculous—playing politics rather than spending an hour addressing one of the key issues affecting the hardworking men and women of Australia.


This bill we are talking about now will deliver companies with a turnover of more than $50 million a progressive tax cut to 25 per cent. This follows the Turnbull government's tax cuts to 25 per cent for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million and a tax cut bonanza for individuals, if they are millionaires, in the order of a $16,000 bonus. That's a $16,000 bonus for some of our wealthiest Australians. That's nice for them. I take nothing away from them; that's fine. But there are real stories and real people who actually need that and who could do with having access to tax cuts. We know that the OECD has already said that, when you give tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners, the rest of the nation benefits.


The forward estimates provided for this bill show that the Turnbull government will suck $600 million out of the bottom line over the forward estimates and $36.5 billion over the medium term from hardworking Australians. Let that just sink in: $36.5 billion over the medium term. For a government, a party and an outfit that ran around during the election and cried, 'Debt and deficit!' to anybody who would listen, to increase that kind of debt to our nation's bottom line is crazy. We've heard the figure: $36.5 billion. I actually still can't believe the numbers that have passed my lips, given the opportunities in our community where that money would be better spent and invested—and not just in my community but in the nation as a whole. This is $600 million that won't help all Australians. A trickle-down world just doesn't work.


Whatever happened to fairness? On budget night, we heard it was all going to be fair, but I don't know how stripping $600 million out of the budget for the forward estimates is actually going to be fair to anybody other than the people who are beneficiaries of it. And there are not too many beneficiaries of those cuts in my electorate, for example.


Whatever happened to ensuring we leave in this place in a better state than we found it in? As the member for Rankin pointed out in his speech, which was an hour ago—before the comedy hour that we just had—the Turnbull government's record stinks after four years. To suggest anything else is absolutely fanciful. They keep coming in here, and their favourite topic of the day is Labor, the unions and Bill Shorten, the opposition leader. They never talk about what they've done. They never talk about what they've invested in. They never talk about the opportunities that they're providing, or particularly the opportunities that they're not providing, to people in Western Sydney. Just take a look at the budget and you might see why.


The Turnbull government will deliver new record net debt for the next three years. That's a deficit for the 2017-18 years which is 10 times bigger than predicted in the Liberals' first budget—10 times!—and gross debt equivalent to $20,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. That is absolutely at the end of extremes. It's another gift from the Abbott-Turnbull outfit that the community is going to have to swallow.


Given what we know and what we already see, why would the people I represent in Lindsay think the Turnbull government could possibly understand the issues they face in Western Sydney? Those opposite have failed them abysmally, time and time again. When you consider the legislation before the House, you get an insight into how useless they actually are.


Yesterday we witnessed the embarrassing scene of a government gagging a debate over cuts to university funding and burdening students with more debt. These are cuts to education and universities—the future-proofing assets we should be investing in. The government is scalping universities with $4 billion worth of cuts, and ripping off another section of Australia and exposing more underfunding.


The Turnbull government thought it could slash funding the easiest in Western Sydney, with the largest university funding cut in New South Wales and the second-largest in Australia—just another kick in the guts for Western Sydney. The first and the second come from my electorate. The Turnbull government believes you have no right to a decent education and certainly not to a degree. The member for Banks over there told me about all the great warehousing opportunities that Western Sydney was allowed to have. Well, thanks very much. I've got enough warehouses now. What I'd really like is a few degree-qualified kids who can go into the jobs of the future. The government does want you to have a job, because it needs to raid your pockets. It's happy for us to work in warehouses; it's just not happy for us to get qualified. All this, just so that it can keep supporting the big end of town.


Western Sydney University is an unfortunate example of how this bill before us attacks the very fabric of what is right and what is decent. Western Sydney uni has been a leader in addressing educational inequality facing our community. It's a university where 60 per cent of the students are the first in their families to attend university—an amazing figure, and one that only goes to highlight what educational opportunity is actually about. Those in the government want to give these tax cuts to the big end of town on the backs of universities in Western Sydney. Western Sydney uni is home to 20 per cent of students who are considered of low economic status and 37 per cent of students who speak a language other than English at home. These are more than just statistics. These are realities that are changing Western Sydney. We are not one-dimensional stereotypes that wear high-vis vests and work in warehouses, thank you very much. Western Sydney is an area that is transitioning from a traditional jobs base to a more diverse and broad base. It is an area that wants to create and keep those jobs local. We can't rely on those people opposite to support them.


If this government is not cutting university funding and burdening students with debt, it is going to the other extreme and ruining apprenticeships and vocational training. We've had a 37 per cent drop in the number of apprentices in training in Lindsay. What does this government want Western Sydney to think? Do you want new jobs for the future? It appears not. There is nothing agile and innovative about making cuts to education to low socio-economic communities. Do you want more tradies? It also appears not.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (13:07):  Congratulations, Deputy Speaker Claydon. I spent some time on the Speaker's panel, and it's a great pleasure. One of the downsides of moving into the shadow assistant ministership is that I can't do that now.


The government talk about jobs and growth. They are the two words they use perhaps more than any other. I have struggled over the last four years to see evidence of any action which will actually drive jobs and growth. For the first three years under Prime Minister Abbott, I have to say, I saw the country essentially push the pause button on all the things that matter—on all the opportunities in the world and all the change that we have to undertake as a country. There was just a pause button for three years. Then, when Prime Minister Turnbull took that position, I had a moment of hope. It didn't last long, but I had a moment of hope because I honestly believed we could not continue with our finger on the pause button in the way we had under Prime Minister Abbott. Now here we are in the fifth year of the Abbott-Turnbull government, and the only thing I can see, the one-point plan that, according to the government, will drive jobs and growth is this big business tax cut. This is it. Of all of the things they could do, this is it—the one-point plan that we debate right here.


Essentially, it's a progressive tax cut that reduces to 25 per cent for businesses with a turnover of more than $50 million. It reaches that level in 2024-25. We will see a progressive reduction until 2024-25, when businesses with a turnover greater than $50 million will be on 25 per cent. It's a cost of $36.5 billion over the medium term. When you add that to the tax cuts for those below $50 million, it's $65 billion by 2025-26 and then multiple billions every year after that, when it fully kicks in. They talk about jobs and growth. This is their big plan, just this. But, by their own figures—and these are their figures; they're not mine—this tax cut will generate one per cent growth in 20 years time.


When Prime Minister Abbott was first elected, in his first couple of days he said, 'We're going to slow the pace down.' But I do not think that anyone would have expected that a government in this day and age, with the challenges that we face in terms of stagnating wage growth, general growth with a '1' in front of it and incredible increases in the underemployed, would be needing to slow the pace down to such an extent that we are looking at 20 years to get any benefit, even one per cent growth, from their one-point plan. This is all they have—one per cent growth in 20 years time or the equivalent of a $2 a day wage increase in 20 years time. That is their plan for jobs and growth. This is it. And then, of course, this dud of a policy will be built into the base, so every government that comes after this one will have that additional revenue drain out of the government budget in its bottom line. I am quite hopeful that this government will not be here in 2026—I suspect they will be gone long before that—but they have left an anchor around the neck of future governments with the bill they have presented today.


Since the election I have come in here, I have sat in caucus, I have gone through the bills we are debating and I have looked for anything that looked forward. I have some bills that trashed things, bills that cut things, bills that abolished things. But I haven't seen anything at all that genuinely attempted to stimulate the growth in their great 'jobs and growth' strategy. Nothing. They have blamed. They have misled. Even in their fifth year, anything that could possibly go wrong is still Labor's fault; we are the most powerful opposition ever! Five years down the track, the government has doubled the debt. But, somehow, it is still our problem. Electricity prices have risen enormously over the last four years. Somehow, that's our problem. Liddell, the coal-fired power station, will close in 2022. Somehow, that's our problem. Somehow, over the five years of this government, even in opposition we have managed to be responsible for all—which means they take no responsibility at all. Perhaps that is why they can come in here and sprout the words 'jobs and growth' and do nothing that actually achieves that.


The government—and I have said this once before, when I was talking about Treasurer Hockey—reminds me in many ways of a business that is going through tough times and cuts its marketing budget and inventory. So you walk past the shop and there isn't much there to buy; and you would know that what you have there is a business in its death throes, that is gradually winding itself down. This government reminds me of that. There is nothing to lead to jobs and growth—in fact, quite the opposite.


This bill will finally cut in in 2026. Looking ahead to what the country will need then, I am not sure the corporate tax rate is the thing that I would go to first. If we want to position our economy for 2026 and beyond, and we had $65 billion dollars to spend, what would you actually spend it on? Would it be this? That is the decision this government is making. We on this side say no, it's not the first priority. Funding for universities is essential. If you want this country to be competitive in 2026, we need to build the university and training sector for 2026. Yet this week we have seen this government vote to cut funding to universities to make it harder for people to make their way down that path to the jobs of the future.


You would also want really good high-speed fibre. You would want that not just so that people can enjoy the benefits of it but so Australian businesses in the technology space were able to compete with the rest of the world in that space. If you don't have a critical mass of high-speed fibre, you reduce the capacity of local tech companies to develop new products and grow in the way we need them to so that we can compete in 2026. What've we got instead? We've got a mishmash of technology that in some cases has download speeds that are miserable; and the upload speeds required for the Internet of Things, for example, are simply not there. The requirements of 2020, let alone 2026, are well beyond what this mishmash of technology will offer. The government of the day scrapped it because of its cost, yet it's prepared to put $65 billion into a tax cut for big business which will generate no more than one per cent growth over 20 years. I would bet that a real investment in high-quality fibre communications technology would give you a better bang for your buck than that.


We've seen this government cut the ground from under renewable energy, and we've seen investment in that area fall to incredible lows—a dramatic reduction in the amount of investment going into renewable energy, because of the uncertainty. Again, this is an area that you want to grow if you want to position this country for 2026, not just so that we can have cleaner power and contribute to emissions reduction but so that our businesses can be world leaders in the technology which is taking over the world. If you don't invest now, other countries and other businesses elsewhere will fill the space that we leave. We want our businesses to be world leaders, yet this government are not there at all; they've driven that sector backwards.


If you want to look to 2026, you have to understand that data is going to be the oil of 2026. We have a government siloing ours and selling it off to business in little sections—the cancer register to Telstra, for example. That's where you invest. Where is the investment from this government in making sure that Australia is one of the world leaders in big data, and the use of government data by businesses external to government exploiting data for the benefit of the community and for business growth? Where is the government's plan for that? There isn't one. There's no talk of it. There's nothing going on in that space. It's the same with fin-tech and reg-tech. We hear a few words every now and again—we heard some words early on from the Prime Minister—but there's very little going on in that space, from the government perspective. In fact, as you'll remember, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, in the early years the government actually lost its minister for science and its minister for innovation. They are back, fortunately, but for many years this government had them on pause.


Of course, if you want to position Australia for 2026, you have to worry about climate change. We've just seen massive storms, three cyclones in a row, hit the US. We've seen a flash drought, a term I'd never even heard used before—air that was so dry and so hot that it sucked the water out of the soil and in a few days created the conditions of long-term drought, and farmers lost their crops: a flash drought. We've had bushfires. We have a total fire ban in New South Wales now, in September. None of these things individually can be sheeted back to climate change, but the increase in their frequency can. You cannot position Australia for 2026 without addressing climate change and the needs of our environment. And that's before you start to talk about the extinction of species, and children who may never get to see some of the species that we take for granted. We must act on that.


We're looking at $65 billion for a tax cut which generates only a one per cent return in 20 years, versus cuts to education and our capacity to compete as workers and as thinkers in the knowledge economy; $65 billion in big business tax cuts for a one per cent growth in GDP over 20 years, against really good quality fibre that would allow our businesses to position themselves and compete in the new technology that is being developed around the world; $65 billion for a one per cent increase in GDP, against serious investment in renewable energy that would allow our businesses to own the patents that will drive down the use of fossil fuel power over the next decade. That is where this government should be going. If this government is serious about positioning Australia for 2026 but the best thing it can do is provide a tax cut of this magnitude for such little gain, then it really should think again.


We have stagnating wages. Wages growth is falling, and real wages fell in the last quarter. We have a government that's happy to see the cutting of penalty rates. We have a government that's actually happy to see the living standards and the spending capacity of middle Australia shrink. I know from my days as a small-business owner—and from talking to small businesses around Western Sydney—that what businesses actually need much more than a tax cut, even though they'll take it if you give it to them, is customers that are spending, and a secure investment environment so that banks and finance institutions will invest in them. That's what they need. They need certainty, investment capacity and customers that are confident, that have money to spend. 


When you reduce wages, when you cut the energy supplement from pensioners and when you pick away at the living standards of middle Australia, you actually damage small business. They might get their tax cut, but their profits won't be as high. And I tell you, when you ask any small business—or any big one, for that matter—whether they would rather have investment certainty, consumer confidence or growth in the number of customers, they will go for that. When offered nothing else, they'll take the tax cut. But, when you drive the wages of people down through cutting penalty rates, when you cut away at the safety net in the way this government has and when you ensure that a person graduating from university has a huge debt to pay off in those first early years, you do not drive growth and jobs forward; you actually drive it back. The thing that drives growth in an economy is the capacity for customers to pay, and investment certainty. 


We've got a government that lectures people about tax, when they're increasing the tax rate on working Australians. They're actually increasing the tax rate. Through these tax increases, they're taking money out of the pockets of businesses' customers and of families. Any Australian who earns more than $21,000 will pay more in tax if this government gets its way. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year more. If you're on $80,000, it's an extra $400. So, we've got a government that's reducing taxes for the big end of town, for virtually zero gain in the medium term. And, on the other hand, it is cutting the capacity of families and small businesses to do well. It's actually backwards. We know that many of the families that are getting these tax cuts spend all of their money. Give them that money, make sure they keep it, and they will spend it. It will flow through the economy a couple of times and eventually end up in the government's coffers. The plans this government has are completely inverted. We need to make sure, in 2026, that we're actually positioned for the future. This bill drives us backwards.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (13:22):  It's very pleasing to hear the member for Parramatta talk about drivers of jobs and growth. It was only a couple of hours ago that we heard some wonderful news from the Australian Bureau of Statistics: the figure for jobs growth in this nation in the last month was 54,200—substantially above what was predicted. All the economic experts predicted an increase of 20,000. We have had 54,200 new jobs created in this economy in the last month. What a vote of confidence by the business community in this coalition government. This is something we should be proud of. We've sometimes seen those ABS statistics vary a little bit. Sometimes they will be a little bit inconsistent. But, for the last several months, we've had continuing very, very strong job growth in this country. Although the headline unemployment rate number has stayed consistent, that is only because we've had a significant increase in the participation rate, up from 65.1 per cent to 65.3 per cent. This is good news. We heard this morning that the dollar has also surged on this news. 


The coalition is getting on with the work. We are getting on with driving growth in this economy and we are getting job growth happening. What we must always remember is that the 54,200 new jobs created in this economy over the last month were not created by governments or bureaucrats. They were created by private individuals putting their capital on the line and taking a risk, taking a business risk, taking the risk to put on a new employee. And that is exactly what the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 is about. This bill is about lowering the rate of corporate tax in this nation to incentivise people to continue to take that risk. 


Although we can be very satisfied with that rate of job growth in the last month, there is still a lot more work to do. We must make sure our nation is internationally competitive for those in the business community that we ask to go out there and put on new employees. We've got to give them an internationally competitive environment to play in, and we can't do that if we are burdening them with a higher rate of corporate tax than we see in other countries. Peter Costello, the former Treasurer, understood this. The shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, used to understand this. He actually wrote an entire book on the subject of the importance of lowering your corporate tax rate to incentivise business investment and get jobs growth happening.


But, sadly, today's Labor Party no longer believe in that. They no longer understand the importance of business having an international competitive playing field to compete on. So they are quite happy to see the corporate tax rate in this country well above OECD averages. They are prepared to see personal rates of tax in this country well above averages. How can we incentivise young Australians to stay in this country with Labor's policy of an almost 50 per cent rate? They want to have a top marginal tax rate of 49.5 per cent. That is the rate that they want against somewhere like Singapore or Hong Kong, with 15 or 17 per cent. That becomes a disincentive.



Dr Chalmers interjecting—




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  And the so-called tax increase, which I hear the member at the table bellowing about, is to finance the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We owe it to those disabled people—we have to owe it to them. We can all talk up a big game here about how we all support the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but we have to fund it. It would've been wonderful if we could've funded it from a budget surplus. It would've been wonderful if we could've funded it from additional growth. But the reality is: the only way that we can fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme is to ask everyone to contribute a little bit more through their Medicare levy—and we have Labor members coming in here representing that as a tax increase.


The member for Parramatta also went on about renewable energy and how important that is and the uncertainty that's facing it and how there's no investment in renewable energy. That's simply untrue. There's something like $7 billion being invested in renewable energy in this country today. But the problem is that it's being invested in importing containers of solar panels from China and importing foreign-made wind turbines. It is not the investment that we need. The investment in renewables should go into research and development, not into the rollout of the current technology. We have seen from the Australian Energy Market Operator's report that when we most need our electricity, in that time of peak demand, we can only rely on renewables for two per cent of their capacity. So the $7 billion of investment is doing nothing to fix the shortfall of generation capacity in this nation. It is doing nothing to encourage research and development in what we need.


What we really need to do is make sure that the investment is in the best areas of the economy, and the worst people to pick that—the worst people to decide how that should be—are government. We need to release the private sector to put their investment capital on the line, where they think it will do best. They will not always get it right. The majority of Australian businesses after several years, we know, will no longer be trading. But those few businesses that continue to grow and expand are the ones that will drive our economy forward in the future.


The other thing that we need to have international competitiveness on is not only our taxation system but the cost of energy. We've seen the policies of the Labor Party: a 50 per cent renewable energy target that will do nothing but drive up the cost of electricity even more than what it has been in this nation. We have seen the example from South Australia, the state that now has the proud title of having the world's highest electricity costs. It has pursued a policy of a 50 per cent renewable energy target, and what has it delivered? The world's highest electricity costs. How are we going to get business investment and job creation if we go down the track of putting in policies that the Labor Party want that will deliver such high, internationally uncompetitive electricity prices?

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (13:07):  Congratulations, Deputy Speaker Claydon. I spent some time on the Speaker's panel, and it's a great pleasure. One of the downsides of moving into the shadow assistant ministership is that I can't do that now.


The government talk about jobs and growth. They are the two words they use perhaps more than any other. I have struggled over the last four years to see evidence of any action which will actually drive jobs and growth. For the first three years under Prime Minister Abbott, I have to say, I saw the country essentially push the pause button on all the things that matter—on all the opportunities in the world and all the change that we have to undertake as a country. There was just a pause button for three years. Then, when Prime Minister Turnbull took that position, I had a moment of hope. It didn't last long, but I had a moment of hope because I honestly believed we could not continue with our finger on the pause button in the way we had under Prime Minister Abbott. Now here we are in the fifth year of the Abbott-Turnbull government, and the only thing I can see, the one-point plan that, according to the government, will drive jobs and growth is this big business tax cut. This is it. Of all of the things they could do, this is it—the one-point plan that we debate right here.


Essentially, it's a progressive tax cut that reduces to 25 per cent for businesses with a turnover of more than $50 million. It reaches that level in 2024-25. We will see a progressive reduction until 2024-25, when businesses with a turnover greater than $50 million will be on 25 per cent. It's a cost of $36.5 billion over the medium term. When you add that to the tax cuts for those below $50 million, it's $65 billion by 2025-26 and then multiple billions every year after that, when it fully kicks in. They talk about jobs and growth. This is their big plan, just this. But, by their own figures—and these are their figures; they're not mine—this tax cut will generate one per cent growth in 20 years time.


When Prime Minister Abbott was first elected, in his first couple of days he said, 'We're going to slow the pace down.' But I do not think that anyone would have expected that a government in this day and age, with the challenges that we face in terms of stagnating wage growth, general growth with a '1' in front of it and incredible increases in the underemployed, would be needing to slow the pace down to such an extent that we are looking at 20 years to get any benefit, even one per cent growth, from their one-point plan. This is all they have—one per cent growth in 20 years time or the equivalent of a $2 a day wage increase in 20 years time. That is their plan for jobs and growth. This is it. And then, of course, this dud of a policy will be built into the base, so every government that comes after this one will have that additional revenue drain out of the government budget in its bottom line. I am quite hopeful that this government will not be here in 2026—I suspect they will be gone long before that—but they have left an anchor around the neck of future governments with the bill they have presented today.


Since the election I have come in here, I have sat in caucus, I have gone through the bills we are debating and I have looked for anything that looked forward. I have some bills that trashed things, bills that cut things, bills that abolished things. But I haven't seen anything at all that genuinely attempted to stimulate the growth in their great 'jobs and growth' strategy. Nothing. They have blamed. They have misled. Even in their fifth year, anything that could possibly go wrong is still Labor's fault; we are the most powerful opposition ever! Five years down the track, the government has doubled the debt. But, somehow, it is still our problem. Electricity prices have risen enormously over the last four years. Somehow, that's our problem. Liddell, the coal-fired power station, will close in 2022. Somehow, that's our problem. Somehow, over the five years of this government, even in opposition we have managed to be responsible for all—which means they take no responsibility at all. Perhaps that is why they can come in here and sprout the words 'jobs and growth' and do nothing that actually achieves that.


The government—and I have said this once before, when I was talking about Treasurer Hockey—reminds me in many ways of a business that is going through tough times and cuts its marketing budget and inventory. So you walk past the shop and there isn't much there to buy; and you would know that what you have there is a business in its death throes, that is gradually winding itself down. This government reminds me of that. There is nothing to lead to jobs and growth—in fact, quite the opposite.


This bill will finally cut in in 2026. Looking ahead to what the country will need then, I am not sure the corporate tax rate is the thing that I would go to first. If we want to position our economy for 2026 and beyond, and we had $65 billion dollars to spend, what would you actually spend it on? Would it be this? That is the decision this government is making. We on this side say no, it's not the first priority. Funding for universities is essential. If you want this country to be competitive in 2026, we need to build the university and training sector for 2026. Yet this week we have seen this government vote to cut funding to universities to make it harder for people to make their way down that path to the jobs of the future.


You would also want really good high-speed fibre. You would want that not just so that people can enjoy the benefits of it but so Australian businesses in the technology space were able to compete with the rest of the world in that space. If you don't have a critical mass of high-speed fibre, you reduce the capacity of local tech companies to develop new products and grow in the way we need them to so that we can compete in 2026. What've we got instead? We've got a mishmash of technology that in some cases has download speeds that are miserable; and the upload speeds required for the Internet of Things, for example, are simply not there. The requirements of 2020, let alone 2026, are well beyond what this mishmash of technology will offer. The government of the day scrapped it because of its cost, yet it's prepared to put $65 billion into a tax cut for big business which will generate no more than one per cent growth over 20 years. I would bet that a real investment in high-quality fibre communications technology would give you a better bang for your buck than that.


We've seen this government cut the ground from under renewable energy, and we've seen investment in that area fall to incredible lows—a dramatic reduction in the amount of investment going into renewable energy, because of the uncertainty. Again, this is an area that you want to grow if you want to position this country for 2026, not just so that we can have cleaner power and contribute to emissions reduction but so that our businesses can be world leaders in the technology which is taking over the world. If you don't invest now, other countries and other businesses elsewhere will fill the space that we leave. We want our businesses to be world leaders, yet this government are not there at all; they've driven that sector backwards.


If you want to look to 2026, you have to understand that data is going to be the oil of 2026. We have a government siloing ours and selling it off to business in little sections—the cancer register to Telstra, for example. That's where you invest. Where is the investment from this government in making sure that Australia is one of the world leaders in big data, and the use of government data by businesses external to government exploiting data for the benefit of the community and for business growth? Where is the government's plan for that? There isn't one. There's no talk of it. There's nothing going on in that space. It's the same with fin-tech and reg-tech. We hear a few words every now and again—we heard some words early on from the Prime Minister—but there's very little going on in that space, from the government perspective. In fact, as you'll remember, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, in the early years the government actually lost its minister for science and its minister for innovation. They are back, fortunately, but for many years this government had them on pause.


Of course, if you want to position Australia for 2026, you have to worry about climate change. We've just seen massive storms, three cyclones in a row, hit the US. We've seen a flash drought, a term I'd never even heard used before—air that was so dry and so hot that it sucked the water out of the soil and in a few days created the conditions of long-term drought, and farmers lost their crops: a flash drought. We've had bushfires. We have a total fire ban in New South Wales now, in September. None of these things individually can be sheeted back to climate change, but the increase in their frequency can. You cannot position Australia for 2026 without addressing climate change and the needs of our environment. And that's before you start to talk about the extinction of species, and children who may never get to see some of the species that we take for granted. We must act on that.


We're looking at $65 billion for a tax cut which generates only a one per cent return in 20 years, versus cuts to education and our capacity to compete as workers and as thinkers in the knowledge economy; $65 billion in big business tax cuts for a one per cent growth in GDP over 20 years, against really good quality fibre that would allow our businesses to position themselves and compete in the new technology that is being developed around the world; $65 billion for a one per cent increase in GDP, against serious investment in renewable energy that would allow our businesses to own the patents that will drive down the use of fossil fuel power over the next decade. That is where this government should be going. If this government is serious about positioning Australia for 2026 but the best thing it can do is provide a tax cut of this magnitude for such little gain, then it really should think again.


We have stagnating wages. Wages growth is falling, and real wages fell in the last quarter. We have a government that's happy to see the cutting of penalty rates. We have a government that's actually happy to see the living standards and the spending capacity of middle Australia shrink. I know from my days as a small-business owner—and from talking to small businesses around Western Sydney—that what businesses actually need much more than a tax cut, even though they'll take it if you give it to them, is customers that are spending, and a secure investment environment so that banks and finance institutions will invest in them. That's what they need. They need certainty, investment capacity and customers that are confident, that have money to spend. 


When you reduce wages, when you cut the energy supplement from pensioners and when you pick away at the living standards of middle Australia, you actually damage small business. They might get their tax cut, but their profits won't be as high. And I tell you, when you ask any small business—or any big one, for that matter—whether they would rather have investment certainty, consumer confidence or growth in the number of customers, they will go for that.

The thing that drives growth in an economy is the capacity for customers to pay, and investment certainty. 


We've got a government that lectures people about tax, when they're increasing the tax rate on working Australians. They're actually increasing the tax rate. Through these tax increases, they're taking money out of the pockets of businesses' customers and of families. Any Australian who earns more than $21,000 will pay more in tax if this government gets its way. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year more. If you're on $80,000, it's an extra $400.

 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (13:30):  On behalf of Labor, I extend my best wishes to Jewish communities, who in the coming weeks will celebrate the holiest days in the Jewish calendar: Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Rosh Hashana, or Jewish new year, occurs on the first and second days in the Jewish month of Tishri and marks the beginning of the High Holy Days for Jewish people around the world. Over two days, Jewish families and communities unite in prayer to reflect on the past year and share blessings for a prosperous year ahead. Some of the unique rituals of Rosh Hashana are the blowing of the shofar, a ram's horn trumpet, repeatedly throughout the day; the lighting of candles in the evening; and the eating of sweet delicacies, to symbolise a fruitful and pleasant year ahead. Yom Kippur occurs on the 10th day after Rosh Hashana. It is the highest point in the Yamim Nora'im, or 10 days of awe.


For millions of Jewish people in Australia and around the world this is a period of self-reflection; atonement for sins; prayer; and charity. It's also a time to seek forgiveness for any wrongdoings against fellow human beings. I'm grateful for the contributions the Australian Jewish communities have made to the multicultural fabric of our nation through politics, business and the community.


On behalf of Labor, I wish everyone in the Australian Jewish community: 'Shanah tovah; may you enjoy peace and prosperity and be sealed in the book of life.'

AGL increased by $296; Origin increased by $310; Energy Australia increased by $320. But, if you look back in the years since we came to government, you see big drops—for example when we abolished the carbon tax. The member for Port Adelaide should know that, because he put out a newsletter. He put out his own newsletter, which said the decision to terminate the carbon tax will save the average family around $380. That is what he said.



Government members interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  What a genius. The Prime Minister knows that the ACCC has confirmed that the average Australian household has saved overall about $550 from the abolition of the carbon tax. We have said that power prices have increased, and we are working to do everything we can to put downward pressure on power prices. The Australian people are rightly concerned about rising power prices—but not the Leader of the Opposition.


Let's remind the House what the member for Port Adelaide said yesterday. He said the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission had produced data which indicated that the average Sydney household had seen their power prices increase by $1,000. Now we have tabled in the parliament statements from both the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Regulator contradicting the Labor Party. Labor have manipulated and deceived the Australian people by using data that never existed. It's up to the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Port Adelaide and the dozen other members opposite to come to the dispatch box to apologise to the Australian people and to set the record straight. The Australian people know that when the Labor Party was in office, power bills increased by over 100 per cent—that was the record. Labor is selling out blue-collar workers in order to win Green votes in the city, and only the Turnbull government will help create an affordable and reliable power system.

Can you, Minister, provide details of the government's plan to manage the closure of the regional processing centre on 31 October, as this week I've had numerous representations from my constituents, Rural Australians for Refugees, the UNHCR and the Red Cross seeking more information and a response from the government that shows we can both protect our borders and show compassion, mercy and justice?

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (14:21):  I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that it's a heartfelt question. On a number of occasions, the honourable member has made representations to me on behalf of children who are here on visas and people who are here on visas otherwise who may have illnesses and want an extended stay in Australia, and I acknowledge her compassion and the work that she does in this area. It's important to her and it's important to her community, and I'm very pleased to take the question from her today. 


I can inform the member that I met with Prime Minister O'Neill in Port Moresby on 1 September and we continued our case from the Australian government's perspective—that is, that we want to see the regional processing centre closed by 31 October. There are obviously a lot of details and logistics to be worked through, and some of the compound has already been dismantled, so that process will continue. Prime Minister O'Neill expressed to me that his government was intent on seeing the regional processing centre close as well. We have spoken with Prime Minister O'Neill and with my counterpart, the new minister Petrus Thomas, about the way in which the logistics could operate. That might include, for example, those people, who total about 200, who have been found not to be refugees being moved into an alternative place of detention away from the regional processing centre, given that they have no lawful claim to be in PNG. There are, in total, just under a hundred or so who have applied for packages to go back to their country of origin. We've had a record number of people who have taken up offers to return to their country of origin given that they don't have legitimate claims to make in PNG. There is capacity within the East Lorengau centre for about 400 people to be accommodated there, and we will work with the PNG government in helping them provide services to those people.


Going to the compassionate aspect and the spirit in which the member asked this question, we have to do it in a way where we don't see boats restart. What all of us recognise is that the threat of people smuggling has not gone away. Over the course of the last couple of years, with the success of Operation Sovereign Borders, we've had to turn back 31 boats, and we've done that in a way where we've seen no loss of life. All of us have seen the pictures and heard the accounts of the women and children being pulled from the water, and the half-eaten bodies and all of the graphic detail that goes with it. We've not presided over a death at sea under this government, and I don't intend to start now. That is the most compassionate response that we can provide. We aren't going to put ourselves into a position where we see boats restart. We've been very clear that if people on Manus Island or on Nauru have sought to come to our country by boat they will not ever settle permanently in this country. That's the message that the people smugglers need to continue to hear today.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (14:25):  I thank the member for Banks for his question and the great work he's doing as chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, contributing to the strong economic policies of the Turnbull government. Over the past four years, this government has been cleaning up the mess left behind by the Labor Party, whether it's what we just heard about from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection—turning around the border protection disasters of the previous government—cracking down on thuggish unions, making sure multinationals pay their fair share of tax, completing trade agreements that the others left idle or turning around our defence spending. We've been cleaning up the abhorrent mess left by the Labor Party.


But one area where we've had great success is that we've turned around the anaemic growth in jobs which was left to us by those opposite, which was about 1,800 a month. That is now 27,000 jobs every month. We have now had 11 consecutive months of jobs being created, and that is the longest run of consecutive monthly job growth in 23 years. We've had 800,000 and more get a job in this country in the last four years. More than 500,000 of those have got a job in the last two years, which has seen the unemployment rate drop by half of one per cent over that period of time. Fifty-four thousand people went out there and got a job in the month of August. But, importantly, part of that is that 40,000 of those were full-time, and 26,000 of those were young people. In the last six months, 63,000 young Australians have got a job. That is the strongest six-month gain in youth employment since the global financial crisis. Australians are getting a job. Young people are getting a job as well, which is incredibly important.


It's also worth noting that, over the last six months, a quarter of a million jobs have been created, and that is the strongest six-month gain since the Sydney Olympics 17 years ago, and that's an incredible achievement. Eighty per cent of the jobs that have been created in the past year have been full time, and that is the strongest growth in 6½ years. The number of people who are joining the labour force is up as well, and the level of underemployment is down on the latest figures, and underutilisation is down.



I'm asked about alternatives. The Leader of the Opposition has a plan to increase taxes on the Australian economy by more than $150 billion. The Leader of the Opposition, the shiftiest Leader of the Opposition we've seen in a very long time, if he slithers into the Lodge, is going to put a big, wet, soggy blanket on jobs. This government is delivering jobs. We are delivering jobs at record rates. Those opposite want to shut jobs in everything from the coal-fired power stations to the booming service industries, where we're growing exports. (Time expired)

The SPEAKER
 (15:25):  I wish to provide the House with an update on construction work that will begin soon on the House of Representatives' entrance here at Parliament House. Members will recall that a program of capital works to strengthen the perimeter security of Parliament House is being undertaken in response to the heightened threat environment. This work, of course, was agreed to by both houses in December of last year.


This work will cause significant disruption and affect access to the building at various times in the coming months, and so today I wanted to remind you of the impacts that will be felt in the next few weeks, including during the two upcoming October sitting weeks. Work on the House of Representatives entrance will begin on 18 September. This will involve work on the perimeter fence and the construction of a temporary entrance adjacent to the existing House of Representatives entrance.


The main impact you will notice during this early part of the work is there will be no vehicle access to the House of Representatives slip-road, including during the upcoming two October sitting weeks. To remind members: the slip-road is the road used by Comcar to drop members at the House of Representatives entrance. Comcar drop-offs and pick-ups for members will still be available on the House of Representatives side, in the members car park and on Parliament Drive. Members may also choose to use the slip-road on the Senate side of the building, which will be operating. You should contact the Sergeant-at-Arms' office if you have any questions about the arrangements.


The existing House of Representatives entrance will remain open for the time being; however, the media doorstop area on the House of Representatives side will be temporarily relocated to a House of Representatives courtyard. Members will be provided with a map indicating the location before the beginning of the next sitting fortnight.


The members and House of Representatives car parks will remain open, and access to the building will remain normal until mid-December via the internal stairs and car park lift as well as via the Parliament Drive stairs. From mid-December until late March 2018, the House of Representatives entrance and car park lift will be closed. Access to the building from all levels of the car parks will be by way of stairs and a walkway leading to the temporary entrance. The slip-road will be open for Comcar drop-offs and pick-ups at this time. At a later date, the Department of Parliamentary Services will provide further advice on access arrangements, including for users of disabled car spaces. The Parliament House entrance at the public entry and the ministerial wing will operate as normal.


I acknowledge this work is going to have an impact on us all. I ask members and their staff to be patient and courteous with the parliamentary officials who are there to assist them, and to prepare in advance for travelling to and from the building so that disruption and inconvenience is kept to a minimum. I thank all members for their understanding as this important work to improve the physical security of Parliament House is undertaken. I thank the House.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:29):  After that display during the last answer in question time by the Prime Minister, it is my sad authority to inform the Australian people that the transformation is complete: the member for Wentworth has now become the member for Warringah. Two years ago today, when question time finished, the member for Wentworth followed the member for Warringah out of the door, ready to seize the destiny denied to him by his predecessor. He followed him out the door, but what none of us realised when we watched him follow him out the door was that the member for Wentworth would follow the member for Warringah on every other issue from then onwards.


We have a weak Prime Minister. That is at the heart of the government's dysfunction—a Prime Minister who leads a government united by only one thing: their hatred of Labor, their dislike of the opposition and their dislike of unions. If you take that issue away, there is nothing left of this government. This is a government that can agree on nothing amongst themselves. I could talk today about the costly marriage equality survey—because they couldn't agree—and I could talk today about climate change. But nowhere is the dysfunction and the disunity of this government more on display than with energy prices.


I don't know if government MPs will go to the airport tonight and return to their electorates satisfied with their performance over the past two weeks. I can assure them that, whatever they think, Australians are not satisfied with the state of politics in this country. In the last two weeks, in energy policy in particular, we have seen why Australians are growing to hate politics in Australia. We see a disunity crippling the nation, crippling decision-making, and, most importantly for this parliament, crippling the trust that Australians have in our system. And we see a Prime Minister, who so desperately wanted the job, but, ever since getting the job, all he's wanted to do is hang on to the job and sacrifice every principle he ever stood for.


Two years ago the Prime Minister said to the people of Australia, 'There must be an end to policy on the run and captain's calls.' So the Prime Minister asked the Chief Scientist, who he personally appointed, to prepare a report. The Chief Scientist did the work and when the report came out the Prime Minister's initial reaction about the Clean Energy Target was, 'It has a lot of merit. We will look upon it favourably.' But one comment from the member for Warringah and all we have smelt is the burning rubber of the reversing tyres of the Prime Minister's car. How can it be that the Prime Minister asks the smartest person in the room to do the homework on energy prices, and then he gives to it the dumbest people in the room to mark the homework?


What world do they live in, this government of out-of-touch, unfair MPs? We had the energy minister—what an extraordinary spectacle—standing in parliament and essentially telling the Australian people, 'You've never had it better off when it comes to electricity prices.' It is now apparently the position of the government that, whenever the coalition's in charge, they are putting prices down but, whenever Labor is in charge, that isn't happening. The issue is that the energy minister has said that Australian families and businesses are paying nearly $500 less than they were four years ago. What parallel universe does the Turnbull government live in? The Australian people do not need an out-of-touch energy minister or Prime Minister telling them their power bills are going up. They see the proof every time they open them up. I thought it was a parallel universe in today's question time, as must the Australian people—those who still listen to question time. They must have wondered what on earth the Prime Minister was saying when somehow he said things are getting better. No, Prime Minister, on energy, things are getting worse.


Business knows the facts and individuals and families know the fact. Facts are stubborn things. Wholesale electricity prices have doubled under this government. New South Wales residents have been hit with power price increases of up to 20 per cent alone this year. CSR industrial company reported a 17 per cent increase in the cost of energy. Their bill will exceed $100 million—fact. BlueScope are increasing their energy bill, what they pay, by 75 per cent between 2016 and 2018—fact. And, if the Prime Minister doesn't believe any of that, he should take a day trip from Point Piper out to Parramatta and see how many people clap him on the back and say: 'Well done, old chap! Thank you for raising my electricity prices.' In fact, the Prime Minister should have a postal survey and find out what Australians think about electricity prices and gas prices. He loves the internet; he invented it. He should go on Facebook and see how many people press 'like' when asked whether their prices have gone up. I promise you I know what the result would be.


But instead of getting on with legislating a clean energy target, instead of pulling the trigger on the gas, instead of taking action, all we have seen from this government is schoolyard insults. And whatever happens, the human blame factory, which is now the coalition government, blames everyone else. It blames the states; it blames Labor; it blames previous administrations; it blames future administrations. It blames everybody. It blames the companies; it blames the unions. There is no-one in this country that this government hasn't blamed, except itself.


The fact of the matter is that the climate change and energy price political wars which have dogged this nation from 2007 have got manifestly worse since the coalition was elected in 2013. Anyone who knows anything about gas and energy prices knows that the problem in Australia is a lack of policy certainty. But the problem is that this Prime Minister is so weak that he can't follow the science, the evidence and the facts. Instead, he is tormented by his own bullies, those on the backbench, who insist that we must not change; we must not look at more renewable energy; we must not look at how we have a clean energy target. It is a sorry hallmark. And we see it in the Prime Minister's demeanour. Sure, he gets the odd juice, an energy bolt—he has a bit of Red Bull before he comes into parliament, and he turns red. But the normal and increasingly familiar demeanour of the Prime Minister is of a Prime Minister visibly shrinking and ageing in the job. This is not the job he thought it would be. This is not the job he signed up for. There are all these irritating facts. There is this opposition which doesn't immediately bow down in front of him. His backbench won't do as he says. And the world keeps changing. But of course his motto is: 'There go my people. I must follow them. I am their leader.'


This is a weak Prime Minister. The only thing this out-of-touch Prime Minister can do is tell people what isn't true. The truth is that power prices are going up. It was an unusual competition today to show who was more out of touch. We had the colt from Kooyong and the show pony from Point Piper. And the poor old Minister for the Environment and Energy, feeling a little emboldened, decided to trail his coat. Indeed, he was shredded by the member for Port Adelaide today. In the end, the leader of the government in the House of Reps had to gag their own motion. Mind you, to be fair to that proud son, the inheritor of the Menzian spirit in Kooyong—he loves to finish on a self-proclaimed quote—I'll give him points for this one. At the very end that proud son of Menzies stared valiantly across the dispatch box and declared, 'I end where I finish.' If only he could bring that compelling, laser-like logic to his portfolio!


But the real problem here is that we will have a four-week break from parliament when it rises today, and Australian families and businesses are rightly frustrated that we are no closer to any action on the energy crisis. The weakness of the Prime Minister masks the bigger problems: rising prices, lack of investment, shortages in power and increasing carbon pollution. Now, there's a mix of causes: privatisation and price gouging, gas supply, a dysfunctional national energy market and four years plus of doing nothing. This feasibility study of the Snowy—fair enough, but it won't generate an extra watt of power now; in fact, when it's done it won't generate an extra watt of power. Talking to the companies, getting them to redo their marketing strategy and send letters, doesn't generate any extra power. Australia needs a plan now.


Labor is prepared to offer Australians, in the spirit of compromise, a plan. This is what we want Australians to hear. We should pull the gas export trigger now. We should end the war on renewables, and we should have a clean energy target to help keep prices down.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (15:39):  The title of this MPI is 'The broken promises and failures of the government', and I thought I would talk today about the successes of the Turnbull government as a counter to that. I thought it would be a lot more compelling than the 10 minutes of attempted personal sledges and humour, which missed the mark most broadly, although there was a five-second plan at the end of it—almost. Four of the five seconds were filled with the plan.


Obviously, the most important job of a federal government is to keep its citizens safe. Since coming to office, the coalition has increased counterterrorism funding by $1.5 billion. Since September 2014 there have been 13 attempted major terrorism attacks, 74 people have been charged as a result of 31 counterterrorism operations, and 40 people have been convicted of terrorism offences. The coalition has invested more than $45 million over the past four years in programs to counter radicalisation and to remove online terrorist propaganda, more than triple that of the previous Labor government. We are talking about introducing laws where we can pull young, misguided children off planes. I have sat with the families of those affected when those laws weren't in place, and they have just been so disappointed they weren't, because they will never see their sons again.


What did we have under Labor in counterterrorism? It was a budget-cutting item. They cut 700 staff and $735 million from Customs over their six years. There was embarrassment for the member for Blaxland, who was the minister at the time, when the biggest ever catch of amphetamines was found in Regents Park in his electorate under his watch. Labor cut staff from Australia's federal law enforcement and border protection agencies, and under Labor we had record low investment in security of Australian citizens.


The second most important job of the federal government is to protect our borders. The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, each time he stands at this box, talks about the fact that the boats have stopped, and they are still stopped. Kids are out of detention. Seventeen detention centres are closed. There have been citizenship changes and 457 visa changes to protect the jobs of Australians.


Then you get to the economy, my favourite topic, which was completely neglected by the Leader of the Opposition. There were personal tax cuts delivered, and 500,000 middle income earners benefited from them.




Mr Hill:
  What are you doing with your tax cut?




Mr LAUNDY:
  There have been company tax cuts delivered that drive investment, profitability and employment. The member asked: what are we doing with our tax cuts? What are businesses doing with their tax cuts? My family, I would suggest, are doing what every business in this country is doing: reinvesting in their business, growing their business and employing more Australians. I will get to the results of it at the end. Thank you for asking.


You have free trade agreements. The Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources stood at the dispatch box today. There is a 39 per cent increase in the agricultural sector over the past five years. We have ChAFTA, the Japan-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Korean free trade agreement and updating of the Singapore free trade agreement, and you have results like this: chilled and frozen beef exports were $670 million in calendar year 2016, up fourfold from 2012—300 per cent. Sheepmeat exports were $240 million in calendar year 2016, more than double—100 per cent above—those of four years ago. Grape exports were $102 million, a sixfold increase. These are the sorts of results we are having at the back end: businesses growing their profitability and yet again employing more people.




Ms Flint:
  Employing more Australians.




Mr LAUNDY:
  Employing more Australians, as the member for Boothby knows in her electorate.


Then you have the ABCC—the Australian Building and Construction Commission—and the registered organisation and corrupting benefits legislation, making sure that the rule of law is in Australian workplaces and that unions operate with the same responsibility as company directors have and that, if payments are made to union officials, there is vision and transparency. Why? Because members pay their fees in good faith. They expect that their union leadership is representing them in good faith. If there are payments being received and they don't know about them, and they are going to outside organisations like GetUp! that are then campaigning against coalmines and coal workers' jobs, I don't think that is in good faith.


What are the Turnbull government doing for small business? There are tax cuts, as I've mentioned, and the instant asset write-off. We're working on competition reform. Again, those opposite are not in favour of competition reform. Why? Because it doesn't suit big business. And what's the relationship? It's big business and big unions in bed together, robbing low-paid workers. They do it through EBAs, and they're trying to do it through competition reform. 


We've lifted Labor's frozen Medicare rebate.


There is defence spending reform—again, a favourite budget item of those opposite through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. They cut it by 10 per cent, or $5.5 billion. It got to the lowest amount since 1938. We had not one ship built in the six years on their watch. We have announced a massive rollout, $200 billion worth, and there will be jobs galore in states like South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, as the supply chains that we need through the procurement lever that we use in government are backfilled, engaging with businesses from SMEs to large businesses. Primes are motivated to engage with Australian SMEs. Why? Again, it's because of profitability increases. Growth comes, and then more jobs.


There is $75 billion, as announced in the budget, on infrastructure spending; the country needs it. 


There are child care reforms starting next July. There is education reform, with Gonski 2.0. Again, you heard it in question time: there were 27 different agreements in the lead-up to the last election, with Labor running around the country offering different people different deals. Why? So they could have a political win. There was no structure, no thought in it, other than political expediency. That has been cleaned up by the minister for education. 


Those opposite came up with the idea—their idea; I give them full credit for it—of the NDIS, and there was bipartisan support. It is hard to budget what these things will cost in the longer term. These things grow. Forecasts are more inaccurate the longer they go. There have been funding shortfalls that have come on our watch. But, in our commitment to that initiative, we have found ways that we can fix those funding shortfalls.


Just today, the Turnbull government delivered the latest addition to No Jab, No Pay—there are 210,000 kids in stage 1 of this—to insist that parents vaccinate their kids for the safety of their children and the other children that they interact with, be it at child care or at school.


Media reforms were announced, passing late last night—long-needed reforms of laws that came into effect before there was the internet, and here they are.


What do you get at the end of all that? You get the economic statistics that the Treasurer announced today. You are talking about 800,000 jobs that have been created in the last five years—250,000 in the last 12 months. You are talking about 11 months of continuous job growth. And, of those 250,000 jobs, 80 per cent are full-time, arresting the trend that has unfolded historically, driven through the GFC, of the casualisation and underemployment problem in this country. You've got—




Ms Flint:
  Greater business confidence.




Mr LAUNDY:
  Exactly! Why have you got that? In 11 of the last 13 months, there has been an increase in full-time jobs, the greatest stretch we have had in that statistic in the past 23 years. Why have you got it? Because you've got a government that believes in business and its right to profit so that it can employ more people and so jobs will grow. What do you have opposite? You have a tax-and-spend mentality. We've seen it before. It doesn't work. For the Leader of the Opposition to come in here and attempt personal sledges and humour, and completely ignore the economy is the latest example of how out of touch he is.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:49):  It is a great thing for me that I've had the opportunity to speak today. I had hoped to speak earlier today during the motion that was moved by the Minister for the Environment and Energy but, sadly and kind of bizarrely, the government gagged its own urgency motion that was supposed to be criticising Labor. It was all going so well that they actually had to cut the debate short! If the Minister for the Environment and Energy had been in here, I would've advised him to rethink those great ideas he had after his third Tia Maria and milk after dinner, because what seems like a great idea at 11 o'clock at night after a few Tia Marias doesn't always bear examination first thing in the morning.


I'm glad I have the opportunity to speak now, having been thrown out a little earlier, because I really do want to talk about the broken promises and failures of the Turnbull government. I have a little confession to make: even I thought things would get better with the member for Wentworth in charge. You look at member for Warringah, the Neanderthal policies, the name-calling, the boorish negativity and you think, 'Oh God; anything has to be better than this, right?' We all thought that. We thought of 'leather jacket, ABC-loving, Q&A Malcolm', who was a supporter of climate change, marriage equality and who was doing something on the republic. We thought, 'This guy has to be better than the member for Warringah.' Oh my goodness, haven't we been disappointed! Because every single one the reasons that people thought the member for Wentworth would have to be better than the member for Warringah, he's given up on, walked away from, left behind and discarded—every single one. In 2012 he said:


I am always careful that the political positions I take are consistent with good policy. I would not want to be prime minister of Australia at any price—


No, not at any price, but we know the price: it was $1.7 million. He was very critical of the three-word-slogans of the member for Warringah. He's certainly had a productivity improvement; he has two-word slogans. He's 33 per cent more effective than the member for Warringah. He's gone from three-word slogans to 'jobs and growth', 'engineering and economics' and, my personal favourite, 'continuity and change'. That went so well!




Mr Falinski:
  'Jobs and growth' is three; shall we help you to count?




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  No, he did it with a little gesture, a little upsilon—




Mr Bowen:
  Ampersand.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  Yes, ampersand is the one. Again, he delivered on that. Continuity and change is the one he has delivered, because he changed everything he believed in to deliver continuity with the policies of the member for Warringah. The Prime Minister said:


I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.


That went well! In 2009 he wrote:



Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that on this vital issue of climate change we are not simply without a policy, without any prospect of having a credible policy but we are now without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted.



They're in their fifth year of government and they still don't have a policy. He continues to refuse to pull the gas trigger to keep more Australian gas in Australia. He continues to refuse to provide the certainty that would see more investment in renewables and storage. We know that, despite getting the cleverest person in Australia, Professor Finkel, to write a draft report, which said we had to do an emissions intensity scheme, the government said 'no, we can't really cope with that'. Professor Finkel says 'alright, I'll give you the second best thing: a clean energy target'. Despite everyone on this side of the House and most of the people on that side being prepared to compromise and work with them on that, and the same in the Senate, this little group of half-a-dozen or 10 people up here get to hold this whole parliament and this whole country to ransom, because the man who sits there isn't brave enough to stand up to them on climate change, on marriage equality, on the republic, on proper funding for the ABC. He's given that to One Nation as a trade-off for their support. (Time expired)

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (15:54):  I do greatly appreciate the compliment of being pointed to as one of the people that's running the country. I feel very privileged. I hope the people in the electorate of Mallee realise just how powerful this area of the parliament is. She pointed over in our direction, I think. I thought Ian was included there. We are certainly very, very powerful!


I want to just talk to the class of 2016 because there are some interesting people there. In the class of 2016, you're learning from the best. But when you're in opposition—for the class of 2016—you have to be an alternate government. We are in our fifth year. There is not one policy that I have heard this afternoon that says to the Australian people that you're an alternate government. Do the work. Now's the time to do the work, to prove to the Australian people that, if they vote for you, this is what you'll do. But you're not doing the work. You're sledging. Come on! This is about an alternate government, and all you can do is sledge instead of outlaying exactly what you're going to do.


In contrast—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  I remind members who are out of their place that they are being disorderly.




Mr BROAD:
  there are some people in this parliament who are doing the work. I want to run you through some of the work that we're doing. Essentially, you've got to create the economy that rewards endeavour and that rewards those who take risk. That's the economy that we're doing. I've got a little message for the people on the other side: you can't build the society you want unless—




Mr Hill:
  Look out; it's a message.




Mr BROAD:
  Yes, so listen to this, class of 2016. You're all ears! You can't do the things you want to do unless you've got the economy to pay for it. Do you know how you get the economy to pay for it? You encourage those who get up earlier in the morning and go to work. You encourage those who take a little bit of risk, and they've got to do a little bit better than others. We understand how to reward those who have a go.


I want to say that the people in my patch have benefited greatly from the free trade agreement. There's something we did: free trade agreements. Then, when you produce something, instead of getting $20 for it, you get $60 for it. That means more money. Do you know what that means? It means you might put on an apprentice. That apprentice might have a job, so you have a job. And that apprentice might save up and buy a ute. That means a car that's sold.


I want to tell you: this is how an economy runs. You start with maximising—Mr Shadow Treasurer, you're going to learn something. You start with maximising everything you produce. The next step though, of course, is that, when you create a free trade agreement, you get extra products. You've got to be able to get them to the market. You've got to be able to get your products to the market. Are you listening, class of 2016? So what you do is that you build a railway line. We've got table grapes; we've got stone fruit; we've got everything you could ever produce in the Mallee. How does it get to the market? On a railway line. Who's building the railway line?



A government member:  We are!




Mr BROAD:
  We are! We're building a big railway line. But this railway, at $240 million, is a big railway line with five trains a week, all full of great products produced in the Mallee. This is the sort of thing.


You know that, when you build the economy, then you've got an opportunity to look after those who you want to invest in. Who do we want to invest in? We want to invest in our children. Who has developed and delivered school funding for our children? I think it was our side. I heard a lot of talk on that side, but who delivered it? It's our side. Do you know that every school, and there are 119 schools in the electorate of Mallee, gets more? Every one of them gets more.


What we're hearing here is that I'm starting to lay out some of the fundamentals of running an economy. But all we've got from the other side continues to be sledging, not an alternate government, people of Australia. What I want to see from the class of 2016 are ideas, people! You're fresh; you're new. But do I hear ideas? I don't hear ideas. All we've got here this afternoon is a whole combination of talking about how the government hasn't delivered and how the government hasn't done that. But what are you going to do? Nothing! There is not one new idea amongst the class of 2016. You've learnt how to play the game. You've learned how to get yourselves thrown out of question time. But, if you want to be the alternate government, you need to come up with some alternate ideas to take to the Australian people to deliver better outcomes for everyday Australians.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:00):  Four years ago a Prime Minister was elected, and that Prime Minister promised an adrenaline rush to the economy on the government's election. He promised a return to budget surplus. That Prime Minister said that the budget would be fixed just by their very election. He said that the Liberal Party were like a fire truck turning up at an emergency. Two years later—two years ago today—that Prime Minister had to be cut down from office by his own side. What was the rationale for getting rid of that Prime Minister? A lack of economic leadership—that's what we were told by his friends, let alone what we thought of his performance as Prime Minister.


That new Prime Minister promised new economic leadership, fixing up the mistakes of his predecessor, the member for Warringah. What have we seen since then? We've seen the deficit for the last financial year in this year's budget more than triple since their first budget, and we've seen the deficit for this financial year in the budget blow out by more than 10 times what it was projected to be in their first budget. Debt has crashed through the half-a-trillion-dollar mark. I don't know if that's new economic leadership, but it's not the economic leadership the Australian people were looking for from that political party.


We were also promised, consistently, that they were a party of low tax. 'This is the party of low tax'—we still hear it today. We heard it from the member for Reid—not from the member for Mallee, because we didn't hear anything of substance from him. At least we heard the member for Reid say that they're a party of low tax. They are the party that introduced $20 billion worth of tax rises in the budget this year. What we did hear from the member for Mallee was: 'You've got to put out alternative policies. You've got to put your ideas forward to the Australian people.'



An opposition member:  He's an ideas man.




Mr BOWEN:
  Yes. I don't remember the $20 billion worth of tax rises being put forward by those members opposite before the election. They were announced after the election. But of course what the government believe in is different tax, not lower tax—different tax, taxing different people. They have legislation before the parliament, as part of that $20 billion worth of tax rises, to tax every Australian earning more than $21,000. That's their policy. That's their new economic leadership. In fact, the Treasurer's own budget papers show that the Liberals will have increased taxes for every Australian person—every man, woman and child—by $1,906. That is what a low-tax party apparently delivers. I'd hate to see what they would do if they had confessed that they were a high-tax party.


We are seeing tax to GDP go up every year on this Treasurer's watch and under the government's tutelage, and they dare to lecture us. They dare to lecture us—because they actually believe in tax rises. They believe in increasing the tax on every Australian earning more than $21,000. Well, $21,000 a year is not very much money. It's particularly not very much money when you have wages going backwards and when people are having their penalty rates cut. And what's the government's answer? Cut the penalty rates and increase their tax. That's what the government deliver. I don't remember that being promised at any election either. I don't remember hearing about those sorts of policies in 2013 or 2016.


Then we have the issue of the day: the impact on the Australian people and on Australian business of this government's complete lack of control of energy policy. We see this government lurch from one bad idea to the other. We're now told the answer to the energy crisis which is engulfing us today is to keep a 50-year-old coal-fired power station open in five years time. That's what we are told is the answer. AGL and energy companies are meant to make investment decisions when this government can't even deliver them a coherent policy framework in which they will make those investment decisions.


But it's all okay, because the Minister for the Environment and Energy tells us prices are down. The minister for energy's answers are like a Coles ad. 'Down, down,' he says. 'Prices are down,' he tells the House. He tells the Australian people: 'It's all okay. Mission accomplished. It's all good.' Well, the people of Sydney find this a considerable surprise. But we don't, because we know how out of touch this government is, led by the most out-of-touch Prime Minister in living memory. It's permeated down to the cabinet now, to the minister for energy, who says we have no crisis. 'What crisis?' he says. 'Prices are down,' he tells the Australian people. It takes more than the Frydenberg declaration to bring prices down. (Time expired)

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:05):  Well, I like 'the Frydenberg declaration'! I also like good MPIs, but this is a bad MPI. This motion is to MPIs what an organic soya tofu is to dessert. Labor, you have ruined my favourite meal of dinner. Bad Labor! So what we've got today—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr FALINSKI:
  Yes, I'm as confused by your energy policy as you are. I've got to say that, the last time the member for McMahon and I were getting lectured, it was by Yanis Varoufakis. I had the decency to argue with the guy. Clearly the member for McMahon took him seriously. You're not a serious economist in the Labor Party side until you've bankrupted at least one country and potentially a continent!




Mr Bowen:
  We all had better hair then!




Mr FALINSKI:
  We all had better hair. That's quite true, member for McMahon.


This MPI is coming from a party that gave us the pink batts and the school halls. It never gets old, Member for McMahon. Don't think we'll be forgetting about that soon. They cut defence spending and lost control of our borders. Twelve hundred people died at sea. Ten thousand children were in detention. And there were all the unfunded programs that they created. And now they've come up with diversions about changing the date on which we celebrate Australia Day. But they have come up with one job program. The job program they've come up with is one for engravers for all those statues that need to be rewritten around Australia!




Mr Butler:
  Who proposed that? Is that the best you've got?




Mr FALINSKI:
  Oh, I've got much better, but you'd have to listen, and you're not. 'When all that fails, we just make it up. That's what we do.' I can just see the tactics committee. 'What can we say today? I know what. We'll say that electricity prices in Sydney have gone up by $1,000 per household since the Liberals were in power.' It then turns out that, when we go off to the AER and say: 'What's actually happened here? Labor is telling us your figures are wrong,' the AER comes back and says, 'Some prices have gone up by a dollar and a lot went down by a few hundred dollars.' Why was that?


Of course, the people of New South Wales got an early taste of what Labor policymaking looks like when you set it free on energy markets. Under the Carr government, under Eddie Obeid, under Ian Macdonald—the man whose every friend had to have a coalmine—and, let's not forget, Joe Tripodi, we ended up with Sydney electricity prices per household going up 300 per cent. By the time we got into government, there was only one way for them to go down, member for McMahon, and that was the road of the coals. These guys think they understand policy and they seriously think the Australian people will trust them with fixing energy. Any single person who lives in New South Wales saw what the Labor Party did in government. 


In government we've cut taxes, we've signed free trade agreements, we've reduced regulation and we've reduced debt. Debt would have been more than double what it is now under us if we'd left you there. And we funded Gonski and NDIS. You guys couldn't do any of that. We've even lifted your Medicare levy freeze. We are the party of hope. You blokes are the party of nope.


And all of this has resulted in us creating 800,000 jobs since we got elected. On the very day that we can point to 800,000 jobs being created under this government, Labor decides to pull on this MPI. That's why it is the organic soya tofu dessert of the dinner party. Under the Turnbull government, almost 500,000 jobs have been created. We have seen 11 consecutive months of jobs being created. We have not seen a run that long in 23 years. This is the momentum that this government is building, and you guys should get out of the way and just say, 'Thank you'.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2017-09-14,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (16:10):  It is contributions like that that exemplify how long a sitting fortnight can be. That was just extraordinary! This MPI is a particular matter of public importance because it is two years ago today, as we said in question time, that the member for Wentworth defenestrated the member for Warringah on the promise of so much—so much of substance. But I think the thing that the now Prime Minister promised the Australian people wasn't so much specific policy, it was that there would be a change in the nature of politics. Constituents of our side of parliament as well, I'm sure, as that side of parliament felt a sense of relief that there had been a change. They felt that the member for Wentworth was promising to turn a new page in Australian politics, to bring politics back to the centre and to talk intelligently to the Australian people instead of talking to them in three-word slogans. When he made a promise, they thought he would keep the promise, because they remembered that in 2009 this was a fellow willing to lose his job as the Leader of the Opposition for a principle: standing up for effective action on climate change.


If there is one promise that the Australian people most associate with the member for Wentworth, now the Prime Minister, it is the promise he made in 2009 that, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am'. Of all the disappointments from this Prime Minister, of all the broken promises, it is that one that gets raised with this side of the House most often by the Australian people. It exemplifies, most starkly, the change in this man and the shrinking in the public profile of what the Australian people thought they had in the member for Wentworth. There are any number of policies around climate change that I could raise to exemplify that point, but it is particularly in energy policy that this Prime Minister has entirely subordinated his power as Prime Minister to the member for Warringah. It is so clear that the member for Warringah in different areas of policy, but most notably in this one, exercises an effective veto over this government. Two years ago they changed the Prime Minister, but the same bloke still controls the power. 


There are any number of aspects to this failure on energy policy. This country has been plunged into a deep energy crisis by this government. Prices are skyrocketing. Reliability is plummeting. The Energy Market Operator has warned that two-thirds of the country over coming summers will be at risk of blackouts. Over this government's time in power, seven coal-fired power stations have been closed. That is the amount of power equivalent to the demand from six million households. Yesterday, the Prime Minister boasted, 'Well, during the last decade, 2,900 megawatts of dispatchable gas-fired generation has been added.' He didn't add that every single one of those megawatts was added to the system under the last Labor government. When they saw that the member for Warringah was going to wreck the country's climate and energy policies, investment certainty fell off a cliff in this country. For that reason, we have not seen a single megawatt of dispatchable power added to the National Electricity Market in more than four years of this government. Four-thousand megawatts have gone out of the system under them. Not a single megawatt of dispatchable power has been added to the system by this government. 


And this government's got a blueprint. They've got a pathway out of this: a report commissioned by this government from their own chief scientist, supported by the states and supported by industry. We've said that we'll play a constructive role in negotiating around this report. But the member for Warringah still holds the whip hand. Two years on, you still know who controls this government. It's not the bloke who sits in this chair; it's the one who comes in late to question time every day and sits up there: the member for Warringah. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (16:15):  Well, we know what the member for Port Adelaide would offer the people of Australia if he ever became the energy minister of the Commonwealth: hiccups, you can bank on; confessions, you can bank on; a national electricity market modelled on that great experiment we're seeing underway in South Australia.


When I read the text of today's matter of public importance, I thought at first there might have been a spelling mistake in it. I thought they might have misspelled the name 'Queensland', or maybe the name 'Palaszczuk', and that what they actually wanted to talk about today was that Queensland Labor government—approaching a state election in a few weeks time or months time, possibly—failing to achieve anything at all in their three years in office. But, from listening to the opposition leader and those opposite, I have now come to the realisation that the opposition leader really wanted to set out his plan. I think 'parallel universe' was the phrase that I heard him use a couple of times in his speech—a parallel universe, where he wishes that all of those misleading lines he spouted were true, and where his Mediscare-type lines and his policy scares were somehow true.


No-one can put it better than the Prime Minister did just a few hours ago in this very place. He called out how crazy it is for this opposition to be moving this motion today—this motion about delivery of competent governance—at the same time as we've had such positive economic news. We've just had the numbers: 54,000 Australian jobs were created this month, 40,000 of them full-time. We are delivering when it comes to jobs and growth. I've got the numbers right here in front of me. Since the coalition government was elected in 2013, over 800,000 jobs have been created. Since Malcolm Turnbull became the Prime Minister of Australia, almost 500,000 jobs have been created. We've now seen 11 consecutive months of job creation. We've not seen a longer run of job creation in 23 years, and it shows the momentum that's currently building in Australia's labour market. Over the past six months, the first six months of this year, we've seen over a quarter of a million jobs created. That's the strongest six-month gain that we've seen in years and years—almost two decades. Eighty per cent of those jobs have been full time. We're seeing not only more jobs but also more Australians engaging in the labour market. So not only are we seeing the unemployment rate coming down; we're seeing the participation rate going up. In particular, I want to call out the female participation rate in Australia, which is now its highest on record. Today's numbers also show amazing figures for youth employment, because—while there's still a lot more to do, obviously—over the past six months, over 60,000 young Australians gained employment. That's the strongest gain in youth employment in this country since the GFC. These are amazing economic statistics that we're seeing. They are record numbers, and they're the sorts of numbers that we hope to see, as a result of our enterprise tax plan and our economic plan as we roll it out, in the better days ahead that we've been working so hard to achieve for all Australians. They're the sorts of results that we will continue to see as we further implement our economic plan.


In the 14 months since I was elected as part of this government as a new MP, we've delivered personal income tax cuts; we've delivered company tax cuts for small and medium businesses; we've delivered childcare reforms; we've unfrozen Labor's freeze on the Medicare rebate; and we've boosted schools funding and delivered the real Gonski. We've delivered massive free trade agreements that are unlocking huge potential for Australia in this region. Obviously, media reform today is just the latest example of this government getting on with the job and delivering. There's a litany—a long list—of other achievements there.


I did want to very quickly say that in Brisbane I'm working really hard to deliver on my election commitments as well. This week, constituents right around Brisbane will have received my first annual report, reporting on my work and my achievements in my first year of office. The people of Brisbane right now are seeing work happening on the Bruce Highway, on the M1, on the Inner City Bypass and on Kingsford Smith Drive. I had the Prime Minister in town late last year, when we delivered $10 million of extra funding to get the early planning work right for great future projects like the Cross River Rail and Brisbane's Metro project.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:20):  I think the member for Ballarat is going to miss it by two minutes, so I'll make the contribution. Today we have seen the transformation of a Prime Minister to the point where there is, in fact, nothing left. I remember when we had the very first couple of weeks of parliament after the 2013 election. The member for Warringah came in here with a clever little catchphrase—a name-calling exercise that he would engage in—for the Leader of the Opposition. This week we saw almost exactly the same game—almost exactly the same playbook of having a play on someone's name.


To think that this is the Prime Minister who said he was going to bring a more civilised debate. This is the Prime Minister who said he would be able to provide a more intelligent debate than the member for Warringah. Today and this whole week, we've seen it has actually become verbatim the exact same template. The economic policy is the same. The marriage equality policy is the same. The rhetoric is the same. Who would have thought the climate policy would also end up being exactly the same? Who would have thought that that leader who, years ago, crossed the floor to vote for Labor's energy policies would now stand there as Prime Minister, ridiculing Labor's energy policies? He's not just ridiculing Labor's policies now, but the exact policies that he had voted for.


This party has become so driven with chaos that they are in a situation where to do something about energy prices there are two actions they can take right now: they can act on the gas trigger, and they can act on a clean energy target. But they can't act on the gas trigger because we don't know if the Deputy Prime Minister is lawfully here, and they can't act on a clean energy target because the member for Warringah says they're not allowed to. He says they're not allowed to.


After the Finkel report came out, the leader of the government, the Prime Minister, gave all the reasons he thought the clean energy target was a good idea. He would go out there, backing it in, giving arguments as to why the clean energy target was the right way forward and the right solution. Then, on Tuesday, in one party room, the member for Warringah utters one sentence. Now, when we ask the Prime Minister, 'Does he support a clean energy target—yes or no?' he doesn't answer the question because he's no longer sure. He doesn't know what he will be told to believe. What he does know is that, whatever he's told to believe, he will believe it passionately. He will back it in. He will back in hard whatever he's told his beliefs are.


I was no fan of the member for Warringah. I was no fan of the member for Warringah as the previous Prime Minister, but at least we knew who we had. At least we knew who we had in that job, whereas now we've got somebody like a barrister with a brief, opening the folder and asking: 'Okay, what am I meant to argue today? What am I meant to believe today?' That's why, when they don't have any policies they can agree on, the only thing they can agree on is how much they hate the opposition. It doesn't matter what we ask, every answer is: 'This is how Labor is so bad. This is why we don't like Labor.'


It went to peak weirdness over that two-week break, when all of a sudden they decided to run this new argument that the Labor opposition was all about communism. We heard about Cuba, we heard about East Germany and we heard about the Berlin Wall. I've got to say, you've got to feel for the Russian revolutionaries. If only they knew that their whole battle was actually about reining in concessions on negative gearing. How would Castro's revolutionaries have felt if they knew that the whole struggle was actually about an extra half a per cent on the top marginal income tax rate?


.And yet these conspiracy theories are not being run by some random backbencher who they push out the door. No, these are people who used to be viewed as credible. The Minister for Finance is the one with the Berlin Wall conspiracy. The Minister for Foreign Affairs takes on the New Zealand conspiracy. And then, when they're finally asked a straight question about whether or not energy prices are going up or down in ordinary households, they claim they're going down. Well, I've got to say: go back to your electorates and run that argument. Go back to your electorates after this and ask.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:25):  It's great to hear from the member for Watson, the official king of chaos on the other side. We note that there was not one word about the economy, about jobs or about national security. He talked a lot about what Labor isn't. Mr Deputy Speaker, I'll tell you one thing that Labor isn't: there are no signs of the old Labor or the principles where the old Labor would stand up for blue-collar workers, would stand up for our manufacturers and would stand up for our coalminers. Where are the great old Labor figures of Hawke, Crean, Keating, Ferguson and Combet? Those great figures are embarrassed by what this mob has become. They are embarrassed!


Let us have a look at our record. We've made record investments to keep Australia safe, by investing in our national security and policing agencies. We are delivering record jobs growth: 800,000 jobs created in the last four years, reversing Labor's stagnating performance. Over the last 12 months the economy generated 325,000 new jobs, four times the rate of jobs growth compared with Labor's last year in office. We're investing in small businesses to grow jobs and confidence: we're cutting taxes, fixing our competition laws and providing the instant asset write-off. These are things that Labor used to believe in, but now it wants to drive up taxes and penalise Australia's two million small businesses.


We're stopping the rorts and corrupt payments, and restoring the rule of law on Australian building sites. We are stopping the dirty deals between big employers and big unions, like the shoppies union—of which the member for Watson is a member. He has not been prepared to stand up against those dirty, stinking deals which have seen young workers ripped off, lose their penalty rates altogether and even be paid under the award. We've introduced the ABCC to reinstate the rule of law on building sites around this country and to stop the likes of the CFMEU acting illegally and driving up the costs of construction. What a shame that members opposite won't take a leaf out of Bob Hawke's book and get rid of the CFMEU. They do not have the guts.


We've delivered record schools funding under the real Gonski—an increase of $23.5 billion, which Labor opposed. We're putting Australian jobs first. We're fixing our visa system. We've reversed Labor's horrific border protection policy failures, which saw 1,200 people die at sea and 10,000 children put behind bars.


And look at the Leader of the Opposition's record in Victoria. He's prevailed over several infrastructure investment disasters. There was the $4 billion regional rail link, a white elephant which now leaves commuters standing room only, and has treated the people of Geelong as second-class citizens. He never had the guts to stand up to Daniel Andrews when he abandoned the East West Link, at a cost of $1.24 billion, and all of those 7,000 blue-collar jobs—those blue-collar workers—a project he previously supported. And Labor's West Gate Tunnel Project has been exposed as a sham.


But nothing takes the cake like Labor's energy policy. Our government is driving down energy prices by reserving gas, holding the electricity companies to account, building Snowy Hydro 2.0, standing up for base-load power, standing up for coalminers and standing up for the coalmining industry. The Leader of the Opposition never had the guts to stand up for manufacturing workers in the La Trobe Valley and hold Daniel Andrews to account when he forced Hazelwood to close. Labor's record is absolutely appalling. (Time expired)

 (Solomon) (16:31):  I thank everyone for their patience while I get my phone sorted! Last night, I was very proud to co-host with Senator Nigel Scullion a bipartisan event called Facing North. I thank all those members of this House and the other place who attended. It was a very successful night, and I was very appreciative of everyone coming along, getting into the spirit of it and talking to the over 100 Territorians who flew down from Darwin and other places in the Territory to take part, promote the north and talk to parliamentarians about our vast capacity and our vast resources, a lot of which remain untapped—potential unfulfilled. In particular, I thank my parliamentary colleagues Warren Snowdon and Malarndirri McCarthy, as well as Senator Scullion, for working with me and with the other organisers, the Darwin Major Business Group and the Northern Territory government. It was great to have the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, here with his deputy and Treasurer, Nicole Manison. It is always fantastic to see our Territory colleagues down here because, with only four out of 226 parliamentarians, trying as we might and fighting as we must, working in a collegiate way with our colleagues, we need to be selling the Territory's message at every opportunity. So we did that last night in a big way.


I thank Ian Kew for his leadership in this area. Ian runs Northern Territory Airports but also chairs the Darwin Major Business Group. Along with many other captains of industry in the Northern Territory, characters from the Territory and successful cultural exports like Matty Wright, the Outback Wrangler, we put together a bit of an event last night that, hopefully, captured the imagination of people, not only because of their great fondness for the Territory but also because of a deeper appreciation of our most varied culture, landscape, characters, businesses and capacities. Territorians are an innovative bunch and we saw that last night. We saw it through the great displays there but also in the marvellous way in which the Karen Sheldon catering team, with those young Territorians, made amazing food from Territory products like buffalo, crocodile, magpie goose and pearl meat from the Paspaley company.


I thank the Paspaley company and the other sponsors for the assistance they gave us in putting together what was a cultured larrikin experience, epitomised by a chat that I had with Matty Wright on Sky News. He's a great export, in his third season of Outback Wrangler—he's hitting the States soon—and is a great ambassador for tourism to the Northern Territory. I want also to thank CapitalHill Advisory, particularly Catherine and Sarah, who did a wonderful job assisting us to put this quite complex event together. We had Green Ant Gin, which was made into wonderful cocktails. We had many and varied contributors to the event. CapitalHill Advisory did a fantastic job, so I just want to thank them.


Most of all, I want to thank the Territorians who came along. It's a long way to come down—as I know, looking to fly back home tonight—but for Territory businesses it's worth the trip down. The networking that we did last night will bear fruit into the future. I thank the House for the opportunity.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (10:00):  The idea of the Victorian parliament without Fiona Richardson is unthinkable. Indeed, the idea of the Labor Party without Fiona makes no sense at all, and the idea that Fiona will not be an indomitable part of the political world in which I live is just so hard to imagine. Throughout my life in politics, when a difficult issue has presented itself and rooms have become filled with differing voices and opinions, it's been a reflex to ask: what does Fiona think? Three weeks on from Fiona's death, I find myself still asking that question. 


The truth is that Fiona was a colossus on the stage of Victorian Labor, and she shared that stage with her husband and our colleague Steve Newnham. I first met Fiona back in the 1990s, working on resolutions that would go before the administrative committee of the Victorian ALP. Her mind was sharp; her attention to detail, absolute. There was more chance of the earth reversing its rotation than of Fiona missing a fact or making a mistake, and she argued her case with a fierce determination that left the rest of us feeling both inadequate and in awe. 


Yet the intimidating nature of her intellect did not extend to her personality, for she possessed a smile that could melt the coldest of exteriors; it changed moods. One flash of it and you knew that, no matter how deep the problem, it would all be okay. Fiona was friendly and warm and, because you so desperately wanted her on your side, inevitably you found yourself on hers. Fiona was a born leader. Fiona was also brave—so brave—and hers was not the faux bravery born of fundamentalism; it was so much better than that, because Fiona knew how to negotiate. She knew how to compromise. Fiona absolutely lived in the land of the real. Her willingness to risk her own fortunes in order to stand up for what she believed to be the right outcome was both compelling and outstanding. 


Fiona departs this world with a shining legacy. As the shadow transport minister, she can proudly claim to have been the author of the Andrews government's programs of removing level crossings. Watching the incredible episode of Australian Story focused on Fiona's own experience of family violence speaks to the power of her work as Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence. This is a terrible scourge in our society, and, when the battle against it is finally won, history will record Fiona's name as one of the greatest heroes in the struggle. For all this, it is her bravery that to me stands as her greatest political legacy—because being brave was not enough for Fiona; she wanted all of us to be brave with her. 


At a moment in time when my voice should have been louder, it was Fiona who exhorted me to use it. She challenged me to be better and assured me that it was possible to overcome the fear of bravery, and I can still hear her voice vividly. Over the last three weeks, as I've shared that story, I have learnt in turn that her exhortations were not just to me but extended to many of us. While we will never be as brave as her in supporting us and seeking to bring out the best in us, there is now an entire class of contemporary Labor politicians who owe our opportunity to her, and, hopefully, we will be better because of her. That is a profound legacy.


Despite all this, Fiona would say her biggest achievement was her family: her children, Marcus and Catherine, and her husband, Steve. She was utterly devoted to them, and their loss is so desperately sad. Most of all, our thoughts and love are with them. But, if there is any comfort in the face of Fiona's death far before her time, surely it is to be had in the knowledge that she made an enormous difference. Her life has mattered, her children carry her spirit, and her memory and her example will live on in all of us.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:02):  I know the chair made a speech yesterday on the tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport entitled Still waiting to be heard: Report on the inquiry into the hearing health and wellbeing of Australia, but I also rise today to speak on the committee's report. Yesterday, the chair of our committee, the member for North Sydney, said 3.6 million Australians experience hearing loss and balance disorders. I'm one of those people who has experienced and is still experiencing hearing loss, and I have a very deep and passionate interest in this inquiry because of my own hearing loss. I was very proud of the bipartisan work that was done by the committee, on both sides, including the 22 recommendations that the committee saw fit to table yesterday that we commend to the House. I'd like to thank all those who gave evidence—the many witnesses across the country that we saw, who provided evidence and submissions during the committee process—but I would like to especially thank the chair, the member for North Sydney, the members of the committee and the wonderful secretariat, including Stephanie Mikac and all the staff who did tremendous work in putting this report together and supporting us during the inquiry.  Our committee received evidence from around the country, from stakeholders, constituents and many others to produce this report.


Just before my election—my second election—as a member in 2007, I suffered an acute ear infection. Little did I know that this would lead to a nearly complete loss of hearing in my right ear. One of the groups that gave evidence was the Can:Do Group in Adelaide, which look after a whole range of things for people with hearing loss, speech loss and many, many other things. It's located in my electorate. I met with Judy Curran, the group general manager, and many others there who attended hearings and gave evidence. This is how fantastic some of the organisations that give support to people with hearing loss are. Even though I had been checked out completely by doctors and specialists who told me that nothing would work in my right ear—no hearing aid would work because it was the cochlea—they put together an amazing little piece of technology that has made such a difference to the quality of my life and that of many other people's lives. They came up with a little transmitter that transmits to the good ear to pick up things from the right. This is how amazing these people are. That's why this inquiry was so important. Can:Do and others who gave evidence are making a real difference to people in the community on a daily basis. 


I was particularly moved by some of the evidence provided by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I sincerely hope the committee's recommendations can be implemented to make a real difference. We heard that, in some remote areas, classrooms had been fitted with particular technology so all the children could hear well, because a lot of our Aboriginal communities have ear infections and suffer from hearing loss. Where classrooms were fitted with this particular technology, such as speakers placed all around the room, the education levels went through the roof over a very short period. So you can see how putting some resources into the schools can improve the lives of some of our Indigenous communities. That was one of our recommendations. 


All of the recommendations are important. I would like to go through a couple of them here today. The first recommendation is that the Department of Health, in collaboration with others, develop a national strategy to improve Aboriginal health in a coordinated way. We found out in this inquiry that, in some of our remote areas where people don't have access to services and have high numbers of Indigenous Australians, hearing loss was much higher as a percentage compared to the people in the rest of Australia. We really need to have a coordinated approach where those services, with follow-ups, are provided to those communities. 


The committee also recommended increasing resources for regional and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I just spoke about the technology that's required. This should include support to deaf Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to learn sign language as well. In the cities, there is access to learning how to sign, but in some of the remote areas there isn't the ability to have someone come in and teach the children who can't hear how to sign. 


Recommendation 6 is for the Department of Health to develop and implement an education and awareness-raising campaign focused on national hearing. You cover all the remote areas, all the schools, and have regular checks so you can pick up when someone is having a problem with hearing. Sometimes in children it's not picked up. We find there are checks done in the hospitals when they're first born, but hearing loss can come on a bit later. We heard stories from all around the country where parents couldn't quite work out what, but there was something not quite right, and then, at the age of two, three or maybe four, they discovered that the child had hearing loss. One of the things that the inquiry told us was that the sooner it's picked up the more quickly you can start putting services in place to ensure that that child has all that is required to be able to sign, and can get all the technology that is required. You find that, the earlier that happens, the better off that child's future will be. There was proof in the evidence we received from all over Australia that early intervention was very, very important. 


So, one of the recommendations I just spoke about includes ensuring that we have programs in place from very early on, monitored continuously throughout their school life, to pick up any issues or problems and tackling them to ensure that the child gets the services required for them to go on leading a normal life and that they do not fall behind in education because of a hearing loss. In addition, some of the prevention recommendations were that the Hearing Services Program and the National Acoustic Laboratories focus on the causes of balance disorders and potential treatment options, genetic and stem based treatments for hearing impairment, and research on the experiences of adults undergoing treatment. I'm also very proud of the recommendation to add hearing services delivered by the internet to the Medicare Benefits Scheme, an important step. A lot of these services now come through the internet. You can put earpieces on and do a test to see whether there are any problems with your hearing. Many people go to these apps, and if there's a problem they'll pick it up.


Something I was shocked to learn, through our many meetings and from listening to people, is that sign language is not part of basic translation services under the new scheme. You can imagine that if you needed an interpreter when you were in hospital or going through the courts, for any language—Vietnamese, Chinese, Greek or Italian—they'd all be available. But if you say, 'I want Auslan,' those services are not available. So we have a recommendation to ensure that the federal government works with state governments to provide interpreting services, which is very important. We take it for granted that if you can't speak English or you don't have a good command of the language then you get an interpreter and they tell you all about the health problems you're having when you're meeting your specialist in the hospital or having an operation. But what's the difference with Auslan? There is no difference. That is these people's language. They need interpreting services, and we made that clear in recommendation 20, which says that Auslan should be implemented immediately and that the government should work closely with state governments to ensure that it is implemented throughout the states for health and court cases, legal issues et cetera.


I want to make the point that a consortium of groups had withdrawn a proposal for purchasing Australian Hearing, and I suspect that was one of the reasons we had this particular inquiry—to look into a view that the government had about privatising Australian Hearing. I just want to make it clear that the committee remained concerned about the intentions in this area. One of the recommendations was to ensure that the government rule this out, and it has been ruled out, and I'm very pleased about that. But I'll certainly be keeping a very close eye on this and sincerely hope recommendation 21 is adopted. That recommendation talks about the government now not looking at privatising Australian Hearing.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (11:13):  For one weekend every September, the hamlet of St Albans, in the northernmost part of my electorate of Macquarie, becomes the hub of readers and writers, just as it has this year. The annual St Albans Writers' Festival, now in its third year, brings a world of writing to this village, which is in the heart the Macdonald Valley, originally home to the Dharug and Darkinung people and known to the locals as the forgotten valley—there's no mobile phone reception, and you take the ferry to get there. The last weekend that we had the writers' festival the program included Tom Keneally, Stan Grant, Caroline Baum, Fiona McFarlane and Hugh Mackay, as well as the director George Miller and food expert Simmone Logue. The festival has a commitment to emerging writers, and its program covers fiction, crime, history, art, social commentary, politics, food and travel writing. There's no easier place to rub shoulders with your favourite writer and chat over a coffee than the sponsored Saturday Paper marquee. It's an intimate festival, and battling crowds isn't a problem.


It's all possible thanks to the volunteer efforts of the residents of St Albans. In honour of their support, marquees in the gardens of the Settlers Arms Inn are named after the inn's wonderful owners and loyal festival sponsors, Gabrielle and Ian. The St Albans church also throws open its doors to host festival sessions. This is a true community event, and I was privileged to be at the opening night dinner not just as the local MP but also as a sponsor of the panel discussion 'The end of life' with writer Nikki Gemmell, GP Leah Kaminsky and Crown Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi. Congratulations to Catherine, Jonathan, Myra and every single volunteer and sponsor who made the third St Albans Writers' Festival such a success.


Blue Mountains residents have been aghast at the Liberal New South Wales government's decision to build new intercity trains that don't fit the tracks in the Blue Mountains and aren't designed with long-distance cold-climate commuting in mind. My colleague the state member for the Blue Mountains, Trish Doyle, has been incredible in taking this fight to the New South Wales government, who've decided that New South Wales trains should not be built in New South Wales, or anywhere else in Australia for that matter, but should go offshore.


The tender documents called for a train that can be operated with or without a train guard, so we also know that this is a back door to taking guards off our trains. If you're a parent of a young person travelling to or from the Blue Mountains or an elderly passenger or someone with a disability, you really appreciate the crucial role guards play on our 1½- to two-hour journeys. Add to this that it will take years to adapt the platforms to fit the wide-body South Korean trains on the 60 kilometres between Springwood and Lithgow. Plus, there's no plan to deal with the 10 tunnels between Lithgow and Bell. All this is the result of taking the cheapest option, not the best option. Where was the cost-benefit analysis of the flow-on jobs, training, investment and skill that could have been developed in the New South Wales economy from doing this big project? It's also likely that the maintenance contract, which has already been agreed, will involve overseas workers travelling to Australia to carry out the maintenance.


This is the wrong approach for our economy. We need a coordinated approach to train carriage construction and maintenance to ensure that an industry that employs 20,000 people around the country and represents $1.75 billion per year is not lost. Demand for public transport is high, and nationwide there are plans to spend over $26 billion on rail public transport projects within a decade. Our local manufacturers and their employees, including AMWU members, need a chance to compete. Because each state does its own thing, we see the Labor government in Victoria creating more than a thousand highly skilled local jobs with the state's single largest order of trains to be built in Victoria but then see New South Wales sending all their potential jobs offshore. The lack of national consistency undermines Australian jobs and leaves them vulnerable to state government actions. Without action, the current fragmented approach is putting our local industry at risk. It doesn't necessarily cost a lot of money to fix this problem; it just takes a commitment to Australian jobs—local Australian jobs—as our priority.
