Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1999-06-28,"—For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Brussels, Belgium, and a bilateral visit to Norway.
In April, I was pleased to lead the Australian delegation to the 101st Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Brussels and a bilateral visit to Norway. At the outset I wish to commend the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Jim McKiernan, and other members of the delegation—Mr Somlyay, Mrs Gallus, Mr Morris, Mr Causley and Senator Collins—for their hard work, assistance and support. In my 16 years in parliament I have participated on some fine delegations but none more cohesive and purposeful than this one.
Honourable members will be aware that over the years Australian delegations to the IPU, lead by former Speakers McLeay, Martin and Halverson, have made a significant contribution to the work of the IPU, participating in debates, chairing drafting committees to formulate final resolutions for adoption by the plenary session of the IPU and networking with parliamentary colleagues on matters of mutual interest. I can report to the House that this delegation has maintained the high level of commitment and contribution of past delegations, and this is particularly pleasing given the fact that most of the members of the delegation had not been to an IPU before, and its various committees, practices and procedures can be a mystery to the uninitiated.
I would particularly like to commend the work of Mr Neil Bessell, the Senior Clerk of 
 Committees in the Senate, whose organisation, authority and sensitivity to IPU matters and experience was invaluable to all committee members, and Mr Peter Gibson, the chief of staff in my office, for his support and assistance.
The report I have just tabled records in detail the work undertaken by the IPU and our contribution to its deliberations. The House should note that Senator McKiernan participated in the debate and chaired the drafting committee on nuclear proliferation and disarmament and Mr Somlyay chaired the drafting committee on highly indebted poor countries. The fact that Australians should chair two of the drafting committees was quite remarkable. In addition to that, the delegation submitted a memorandum and draft resolutions on nuclear proliferation and disarmament; Mr Causley participated in the debate on the problem of metropolitan areas; Mr Morris participated in the debate on the supplementary item added to the agenda on writing off the government debt of highly indebted poor countries; Mrs Gallus participated in the deliberations of the meeting of women parliamentarians; I made a speech to the IPU during its general debate on the situation in Kosovo and the plight of our aid workers in Yugoslavia; and, of some import, Senator Collins and I met with members of the Yugoslavia delegation, including the Speaker of the Yugoslavia Parliament.
In relation to this last matter, the IPU is often described as the world parliament of parliaments and is dedicated to dialogue and goodwill between nations. Accordingly, the delegation considered it essential that we seek a meeting with the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation to make the strongest possible representations for the release of the aid workers being detained in their country.
In keeping with past practice, I commend to the House that section of the committee's report dealing with the IPU Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians. Following the IPU at Brussels, the delegation flew to Tromso, 300 kilometres north of the Artic Circle, to begin its bilateral visit to Norway. The delegation's report again records in detail 
 the work undertaken in order to meet the aims and objectives of the visit.
In summary, I had the honour to be granted an audience with His Majesty King Harold V of Norway. The delegation as a whole was honoured to meet with the Prime Minister of Norway, the Foreign Minister of Norway, the President of the Storting, the President of the Lagting, the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, three ministers of state and several representatives of industry and trade. The report addresses the matters discussed at these various meetings. Most importantly, the delegation's report also attests to the warmth of the welcome, the level of interest and the mutual respect that underpins what is a mature and harmonious bilateral relationship between Australia and Norway.
During the delegation's visit, the comment was made on several occasions that, although Australia and Norway are at opposite ends of the globe, we have mutual interests and concerns and are both committed to the role of good international citizens. Notwithstanding these similarities in approach, I can assure the House that Australia's view on whaling is well known in Norway. Also, the delegation, and in particular the member for Page, raised on several occasions issues on trade liberalisation, the WTO and, in particular, subsidies for agriculture.
I wish to report our special appreciation of the Norwegian Storting, its President, Mrs Kirsti Kolle Grondahl, and the Vice President of the Lagting, Mr Svein Ludvigsen, for coordinating the delegation's excellent program and for the warm welcome and hospitality extended during its visit. The delegation also wishes to thank Mr Stephen Brady, the Australian Ambassador, and his staff for the excellent briefing papers on Norway provided on arrival and commends the Ambassador and staff for the outstanding assistance and advice provided during the visit. The Ambassador's support of the delegation was exemplary. I commend the delegation's report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Brussels, Belgium and a Bilateral Visit to Norway</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—Mr Speaker, I firstly join with you in expressing my appreciation of the personnel who assisted the delegation, particularly Mr 
 Bessell, and also our staff in the embassy in Stockholm and of course the recipients, the Norwegian parliament. I also place on the record a reiteration. I have made some remarks in the past about the role of the IPU and the fact that it offers a third level of international relations. In a world that is increasingly tribalising with people going back to smaller and smaller groups and, in many cases, smaller and smaller parliaments, I find the fact that they are communicating at this informal level very valuable as both a parliamentarian and as an Australian. It is very important that we play the role that we have developed over the years in the IPU which, whilst not recognised, is still fundamentally important.
I want particularly to refer to some remarks I included in the delegation report regarding education out of Norway. What we are experiencing here is really quite unprecedented in the fact that a First World country, a European country in particular, is now exporting huge numbers of students. In the current year, something like 11,000 Norwegian students will leave Norway to study overseas. Of that number, some 1,000 will come to Australia. That number is increasing around the world. The Norwegian government has a positive policy of internationalising its student body quite deliberately because it feels that there are great benefits to be obtained from that. Looking at Australian universities, we find that they are also internationalising more and more. This is not simply about trade and economics; it is also about the nature of universities, and it goes back many hundreds of years. Universities have always internationalised and the dimensions are very similar to what they were three or four hundred years ago.
Looking at it from our point of view as a country, there are really substantial benefits in the fact that European countries are moving down this path. There is a great danger that it will become Eurocentric and the students will stay within Europe, which, to be honest about Norwegian students, is the norm. Most of them stay in Europe and go to universities in other European countries. They are closer, it is simpler, they perhaps have more lan 
 guage familiarity and it is easier for them to be aware of what the universities are like in terms of quality. But a lot of Norwegian students are wishing to go overseas in a much more extensive way, whether it be to Canada, America or Australia. We are seeing that growth here.
My concerns about that are that we do not make it any easier as a country. We actually make it quite difficult. We have a panel of only three doctors, one of whom does not seem to be very responsive to students. If one imagines that 1,000 students a year may apply for a visa, normally within a very short time frame—a couple of weeks twice a year—that means that that panel of effectively two doctors is really not good enough. That is one aspect that needs to be looked at. In relation to fees, visas are incredibly expensive. An Australian visa costs something like four times what an American visa costs. Our medical requirements are quite extensive as well, even for short-stay students when other countries only apply those requirements to long-stay students. Looking at those aspects, there is great scope for internationalising our student body more.
I also want to mention briefly the fact that we visited the Arctic research centre in Tromso, Polaria. Scope for intergovernmental cooperation across Arctic-Antarctic research is not currently being explored. I would recommend very strongly that we as parliamentarians should be urging our governments to link up more closely. The potential for those two programs to help both our trade and international understanding are too good to be missed. I commend the report to members.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Brussels, Belgium and a Bilateral Visit to Norway</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—Mr Speaker, let me commence my comments on this delegation's report by congratulating you on your leadership of the delegation. It was, as you said, an extremely good delegation with much friendship within the group between Labor, Liberal and National parties. I think it was very much due to your leadership that the delegation achieved a lot both at the IPU conference itself and later in Norway. First of all, on the delegation to the IPU, Australia's representation was undoubtedly very good. We were extremely busy not only 
 in what is visible with what goes on during the speeches and committee meetings but also behind the scenes. I acknowledge the work that the member for Newcastle did in re-establishing alliances that he had made earlier at previous IPU meetings.
Unfortunately for myself and for some of the other members of the delegation, it was our first visit to the IPU, so we were only starting to form those networks which are so incredibly important at the IPU. I was very pleased to meet with the Cambodian delegation to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the prosecution of war criminals in Cambodia and how we could assist in facilitating that to go ahead by some actions of this parliament. I will not address that now but at a later date, but I certainly note that the Belgium parliament has already moved in an appropriate direction. We might follow in their footsteps.
I know that as parliamentarians we should tell everybody how hard we work on these delegations. Indeed, we worked extremely hard, but I might also say that the visit to Norway was an absolute pleasure. We could not have asked for better hosts than the Norwegians. We learnt how to skol properly at a dinner. I suspect our health was worse for it, but it did certainly add to our visit. We found that we had a lot in common with the Norwegians, and there are many opportunities for us to work on that friendship.
One thing that is of particular interest to me is the working holiday-maker visa. We have a scheme where we have bilateral agreements with seven countries on working holiday-makers. Norway is not one of those countries, but it clearly should be. Norwegians generally speak English, and that would allow them to come here and also young Australians to go there. I am keen that we work on an exchange of working holiday visas with Norway, and I will be following that up with Foreign Affairs. I have already followed that up with the Ambassador to Scandinavia, Mr Stephen Brady, who I congratulate on the work he is doing there. I would also like to mention his staff Jon Oyslebo and Aud Loen, and to acknowledge not only the staff in Norway but also the assistance we had from Neil Bessel, 
 Jeremy Webb—who was at the IPU with us from Foreign Affairs—and of course, Mr Speaker, your chief of staff, Peter Gibson.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Brussels, Belgium and a Bilateral Visit to Norway</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1999-06-28,"—It is a great pleasure for me to contribute to this report of the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Brussels and the bilateral visit to Norway. This is the first delegation that I have been able to be with since I came into federal parliament, and I found it a very invigorating experience. I was probably a little sceptical about going to a conference such as this when I set out, because it is a very big conference of some 1,300 delegates. I wondered what it might achieve, being so big and so diverse as far as the countries were concerned. It seemed to me that it might be a talkfest and would probably get no further than that. I have to say that I was impressed with the way that the IPU works. Some of the subjects were sensitive subjects, in particular the one that I spoke on, which is called urbanisation and  deals with the issues surrounding the continued urbanisation of our societies. It is almost code for population control, I might think. This is probably one of the biggest issues challenging the world at the present time and certainly one of the biggest issues that governments around the world have to consider.
The other issue that I thought would be very sensitive was Third World debt. When it was initially raised in the conference, it seemed to me it had the potential to divide the haves from the have-nots and that there could have been a great gulf. Admittedly, debt is debt and, if you are going to borrow money, it has to be repaid, but I was very impressed with the committee systems that were set up and the report that came back to the general convention. There was a lot of sense. People obviously took note that there were countries in terrible problems with debt and that it was probably impossible for them to repay it, but they also understood the fact that it was an issue that could not be ignored and that, if people were to borrow money, there was some responsibility about having government policies in place that ensured that that debt was repaid. The way the conference handled that was the issue that I was most 
 impressed with because it showed that a conference such as this could deal with those very important matters.
I found the visit to Norway a very enlightening experience. We sat down and talked to the Sami people—in their tent, in fact, and there are a few photographs to show that—over a cup of hot reindeer soup, which is their traditional food. Having served on the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund here in this parliament—the second parliament now—I found that some of the issues that were raised by the Sami people were exactly the same as those that are raised by our Aboriginal people. It was rather interesting to talk to them about those issues, because they are a very similar people to our Aboriginal people. They were nomadic; they followed the reindeer. Our Aboriginal people, within their bounds, roamed across the countryside as well. So it was a very interesting experience to sit down with those people and discuss with them the problems that they have.
Norway itself was rather fascinating. I was very pleased to get back and see the Viking ships. Coming from southern England, I suppose you always think that there may be a little bit of Viking blood in your veins. The Vikings were great explorers—and plunderers, you might say—right through that area. It was fascinating to have a look at their ships, the way they were designed and the seaworthiness of the vessels.
It was probably symptomatic of the way that we were received that we got an audience with the King and we met the Prime Minister. In fact, on the visit to Tromso in the north, we had Svein Ludvigsen, the President of the Lagting, with us, who took us to his home. I found it extremely hospitable that he would take us to his home to have lunch with him and his family. I found that extremely good. I would like to think that the fact that we also had the President of the Storting with us for a full day was quite impressive.
I would like to thank the people who supported us on the trip to Norway and Brussels, Neil Bessel and Ambassador Brady, but I mention especially Anne-Grete Nodeide. 
 I understand she has been our honorary ambassador in Norway for some years and now gets some support. The work that they put in to make sure that our visit was a success was certainly appreciated. I enjoyed the experience immensely.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Brussels, Belgium and a Bilateral Visit to Norway</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 22—Five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999 , together with the minutes of proceedings and the evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I point out that the title of this report as on the blue and on the Notice Paper  is somewhat wrong. It was originally called the Pine Gap Agreement and five treaties , but the Pine Gap Agreement is not part of this report. It has been postponed for a further hearing.
The report I have just tabled is the latest in the Treaties Committee's reviews of groups of treaties that have been tabled in this parliament from time to time. It is the fifth report we have tabled since March this year. In the 39th parliament, the Treaties Committee continues to deal with a very heavy workload.
The five treaties tabled on 11 May were as follows: a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India, a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Lithuania, a proposed Trade and Economic Relations Agreement with Fiji, amendments proposed to the constitution of the World Health Organisation and a proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Our review of these five treaties followed our standard practice. They were advertised nationally and we held two short public hearings in which we took evidence from officials in the appropriate government agencies.
Two treaties in this group raised some significant issues. The proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement, or 
 IPPA, with India is an important agreement with a significant trading partner of Australia's. The obvious comparison is with the IPPA with Pakistan, considered by the committee in its 15th report, which was tabled on 2 July last year. In that report, the committee drew attention to the nuclear tests under way in South Asia in 1998, adding that these tests had added `a considerable irritant' to the bilateral relationship with Pakistan.
Last year we recommended that ratification of the IPPA with Pakistan should be delayed until ministerial and other senior official contacts were resumed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised during our review of the proposed agreement with India that there had been some movement by both India and Pakistan to comply with some of the elements of the Security Council's resolution about nuclear testing. Therefore, in the current situation where the outcome of the fighting in Jammu and Kashmir is really not yet clear, we believe that little purpose would be served by delaying implementation of the proposed agreement with India.
During the negotiation of these agreements, Australia uses its own model text. In the case of this proposed agreement with India, there are a number of changes to the model text because India also has its preferred version. It was necessary to reconcile the two texts and, while some minor changes were required to our version, we think the proposed agreement is certainly consistent with our requirements to protect Australian investments.
The other significant agreement tabled on 11 May was the proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement, or MRA, with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In report No. 20, the committee reviewed a proposed MRA with the European Community, and we expressed some concerns about the understanding of the EU rules of origin and we hoped that the efforts of Australian companies to export goods assembled here would not be hampered by the new arrangements.
Implementation of this MRA has not been very smooth, with some considerable delays in finalising it after signature. In conjunction with the MRA for the European Union, this proposed agreement will ensure that uniform 
 conformity assessment provisions apply between the European economic area countries. New examination requirements are intended to ensure that free movement of Australian goods from particular product areas into and between those countries takes place.
The MRA deals with competence to test and to certify a specified range of products to meet domestic regulatory requirements. It will provide alternative mechanisms for importers over there and exporters from here to comply with regulatory requirements while hopefully avoiding delays and extra costs. So, when the proposed MRA is operating, one examination in Australia by conformity assessment bodies will suffice for both domestic markets here in Australia and export markets.
We have concerns about this proposed agreement which were highlighted by the position in which an Australian company, Nulite Systems International Pty Ltd, found itself in connection with this MRA with the European Community. This firm found out the hard way.
—Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
—If indeed my time has expired, I am happy to table the text of my remarks and, if necessary, find time later on in the parliamentary schedule to continue them myself. Is that acceptable to the chair?

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—This is the fifth report the Treaties Committee has tabled in this parliament, continuing the amount of work that this committee does. It continues to deal with the many treaties that come before the parliament and are tabled before the country and are tabled in the parliament. There is nothing of great significance in the treaties that are dealt with in the report that we are tabling today, though they have been given good consideration by the committee. The chairman has outlined the five treaties in some detail.
In the case of the proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India, the current fighting between India and Pakistan in Kashmir has its impacts on Australia's relationship with both of those countries—we took some action last year by cutting off some of our contact with them. I am very pleased, and it is reassuring to everybody, that those countries are coming a little closer on the nuclear question in relation to the UN position, and Australian measures have therefore been somewhat relaxed towards that end. It is hoped that both these governments of India and Pakistan will avoid using the emotive issue of Kashmir in their domestic politics which would lead only to a furthering depth in the dispute there.
The proposed IPPA with Lithuania was entered into for political reasons, to bring us together. We have strong contacts with the Baltic states and we want to strengthen those—that was the evidence put before us—and we will continue to do that. There are potential contacts in this region with the Soviet Union, but the committee would not want to overemphasise these opportunities. I do not think there is a lot of trading potential there in the future, and it may take a long time before there are any great opportunities to build up major dollar signs in our trading with this area. Having a better documented treaty in place will mean good relations and opportunities will arise.
The proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway raises issues concerning Australians seeking to export into the European market. We were concerned that the information that was given to us to implement this agreement may have been a little optimistic. There have been some difficulties in getting this agreement in place in the EU, and that is of concern to us.
Nulite Systems International is a firm that manufactures dental materials and, in connection with the agreement with the EU, it was inspected and passed to export to that market. They found that the Europeans, as they sometimes do, had a higher benchmark than us and that became a trade barrier, as such, to keeping products from our companies out. This was a very unfortunate thing to occur, 
 but it seems to have occurred on this occasion.
While the five treaties do not raise large issues, they have been examined and several matters have been documented in our report. The committee will continue to play that role into the future as other treaties come before us.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—I am pleased to associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Lyons. As members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, we continue to play a role in opening up the treaty process to those people in Australia who want to participate in it. They certainly have the opportunity to do that as a result of the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The matters contained in our 22nd report raise a few issues which were canvassed well by my colleagues, and all of our reports are important in the context of treaty making.
Some of the departments have suggested that the committee does not need to look at everything, that there are some standard agreements. I think, as a principle, the committee views it as important to check everything, because it is an obligation we have to both the parliament and the people.
The treaties committee gives those who want to comment on the process the opportunity to do so. The opportunity has existed only since the Howard government's reforms of 1996, and many citizens have taken the opportunity to comment on a variety of subjects. Most things are easy, but empowerment of the people is an important principle that we uphold. We are not gatekeepers in the sense that we are holding things back; we are gate-openers in our process.
There have been a number of inquiries in the last couple of months about a couple of matters. The matter known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the MAI, and the Fifth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services, or the GATS, has caused a number of interesting comments. It is worth noting that the fifth protocol does not affect ownership of Australian banks. There are a lot of false and deliberately misleading interpreta 
 tions being put around about that. The fifth protocol deals with doing business, not with ownership issues.
The committee deliberated in favour of the GATS because it reflects existing measures already in place in this country. It in fact complements government measures passed by parliament last year. The new Australian rules open up our nation to further benefits from additional international banking competition. That is a result of the rules passed in the parliament, not as a result of the GATS.
We have not given away any of our sovereign decision making capacity on these matters. Australia has made it clear that all of the commitments are subject to foreign investment policy and that foreign acquisitions remain subject to the national interest test under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975.
In my own electorate, banking services are now being provided from a number of different foreign banks, which is keeping the local banking sector a little more on their toes. I am sure most Australians would agree that the big four banks need that sort of shake-up from that sort of competition. The General Agreement on Trade in Services will help Australian companies also expand their business operations offshore. So the committee rightly deliberated in favour of that fifth protocol. As a nation, we have achieved some real market access opportunities for our exporters in creating extra jobs here and, by being a party to the fifth protocol, we were able to cement in an international forum some of the arrangements we hold dear in Australia.
I am sure many members have received correspondence on these matters. What concerns me as an active participant in the treaty committee's activities is the range of abuse and wild accusations that these particular matters have generated. People have a right to express their views on matters in the public domain, but accusations of treason and treachery delivered to members of the treaties committee do nothing for my stomach. We are doing our duty and, I think, compared to so many other nations in the world, you will not find a system more open and more offering as far as presenting the facts about inter 
 national arrangements to the people are concerned.
Treason is a serious matter and it is a serious accusation in any context. The problem in cases such as the MAI and the Fifth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services is that the committee has often been seen as part of the problem and, in view of its role, this is a dreadful irony. To object to every proposed treaty, as some people in our public debate might suggest, is madness. To suggest that it may impinge on our sovereignty is a matter of concern always, but how Australia would cope in a globalised world without these treaty arrangements and obligations between consenting states is not defined.
The treaties committee, on behalf of the parliament, empowers the people. It is an important process. We are part of the solution of opening up to public discussion matters that had not been well understood in the past. It is a process we take very seriously, and we will continue to do so on behalf of all members in this place.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—by leave—Before moving the motion to conclude the debate, I wish to make a few more remarks about the company Nulite Systems, which had some difficulty over one of these MRAs with the European Community. It found out the hard way that in the area of its products—which are non-metallic bio-material dental restoratives and associated products—the EU standards are considerably higher than Australia's. The firm incurred additional costs in having to arrange for another audit of its manufacturing processes to be done. Unfortunately, as a result of these experiences, the company will not be involved in exporting to the European market. As a committee, we are not in the position to adjudicate in detail one way or the other on this matter, but we do believe that the attitude taken by the responsible agencies towards Nulite Systems has been dismissive and that the firm is right to feel aggrieved about its treatment.
During the public hearing on 7 June, we were told that the proposed agreement will provide additional benefits at a minimal cost by extending the number of countries covered 
 by MRAs. Since regulations for the three countries concerned are identical to those applying in the EC, we were informed that Australian conformity assessment bodies will not have to incur additional costs or burdens in being designated under this proposed agreement. We trust that our concerns are groundless and that other firms will not find themselves in the same unhappy situation that Nulite Systems found itself in.
The amendments to the proposed constitution of the World Health Organisation are quite routine. The proposed trade and economic relations agreement with Fiji seeks to strengthen the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the two countries. We are an important market for Fiji.
While Australia has strong ties with all three Baltic states, sadly there is little trade with any of them. The proposed IPPA with Lithuania should encourage more bilateral trade and economic activity. We are not totally convinced by all of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's views on Lithuania's position as an entry point to the Russian CIS and other former Soviet bloc countries' markets in that region. But, if there are opportunities for Australia's exporters in this area, we hope that the IPPAs will assist them in their efforts. I commend the report to the House. I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 22—Five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999 , together with the minutes of proceedings and the evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I point out that the title of this report as on the blue and on the Notice Paper  is somewhat wrong. It was originally called the Pine Gap Agreement and five treaties , but the Pine Gap Agreement is not part of this report. It has been postponed for a further hearing.
The report I have just tabled is the latest in the Treaties Committee's reviews of groups of treaties that have been tabled in this parliament from time to time. It is the fifth report we have tabled since March this year. In the 39th parliament, the Treaties Committee continues to deal with a very heavy workload.
The five treaties tabled on 11 May were as follows: a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India, a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Lithuania, a proposed Trade and Economic Relations Agreement with Fiji, amendments proposed to the constitution of the World Health Organisation and a proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Our review of these five treaties followed our standard practice. They were advertised nationally and we held two short public hearings in which we took evidence from officials in the appropriate government agencies.
Two treaties in this group raised some significant issues. The proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement, or 
 IPPA, with India is an important agreement with a significant trading partner of Australia's. The obvious comparison is with the IPPA with Pakistan, considered by the committee in its 15th report, which was tabled on 2 July last year. In that report, the committee drew attention to the nuclear tests under way in South Asia in 1998, adding that these tests had added `a considerable irritant' to the bilateral relationship with Pakistan.
Last year we recommended that ratification of the IPPA with Pakistan should be delayed until ministerial and other senior official contacts were resumed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised during our review of the proposed agreement with India that there had been some movement by both India and Pakistan to comply with some of the elements of the Security Council's resolution about nuclear testing. Therefore, in the current situation where the outcome of the fighting in Jammu and Kashmir is really not yet clear, we believe that little purpose would be served by delaying implementation of the proposed agreement with India.
During the negotiation of these agreements, Australia uses its own model text. In the case of this proposed agreement with India, there are a number of changes to the model text because India also has its preferred version. It was necessary to reconcile the two texts and, while some minor changes were required to our version, we think the proposed agreement is certainly consistent with our requirements to protect Australian investments.
The other significant agreement tabled on 11 May was the proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement, or MRA, with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In report No. 20, the committee reviewed a proposed MRA with the European Community, and we expressed some concerns about the understanding of the EU rules of origin and we hoped that the efforts of Australian companies to export goods assembled here would not be hampered by the new arrangements.
Implementation of this MRA has not been very smooth, with some considerable delays in finalising it after signature. In conjunction with the MRA for the European Union, this proposed agreement will ensure that uniform 
 conformity assessment provisions apply between the European economic area countries. New examination requirements are intended to ensure that free movement of Australian goods from particular product areas into and between those countries takes place.
The MRA deals with competence to test and to certify a specified range of products to meet domestic regulatory requirements. It will provide alternative mechanisms for importers over there and exporters from here to comply with regulatory requirements while hopefully avoiding delays and extra costs. So, when the proposed MRA is operating, one examination in Australia by conformity assessment bodies will suffice for both domestic markets here in Australia and export markets.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 recognises the vital and growing role electronic information transmission plays in education, 
 research and business activity throughout Australia;
(2)	 further recognises that the availability of adequate capacity, high quality and appropriately priced bandwidth—for the electronic transmission of information—is an important strategic issue for the development of the information economy in Australia;
(3)	 notes that regional areas throughout Australia have a poorer electronic information infrastructure than metropolitan areas, and the gap is widening; and
(4)	 acknowledges the urgent need to provide affordable broadband electronic communications to Australia's regional centres and, in particular, to our regional universities.
First of all, I would like to thank Dr Ian Atkinson and Kent Adams from James Cook University for their assistance in preparing this speech. In that sense, this speech will be largely devoted specifically to James Cook University and how the poor infrastructure in regional Australia affects it. Even though this is merely a case in point, it underlines the case in general of what is happening throughout Australia. I think those who read and listen to this speech will understand how the current poor facilities relate not only to universities in regional Australia but also to the business world and how the business world is being held back.
James Cook University is the primary tertiary education provider in northern Queensland. It is a research institution of international significance, particularly with respect to issues of tropical and regional relevance. It plays a critical role in the regional economy of Australia. It has both a mission and an obligation to provide diverse curriculum for a relatively small student population, to produce graduates for the region's businesses and professions and to improve the region's low tertiary education participation rate.
In itself, JCU is part of the region's infrastructure. It is a community facility of considerable value and importance and is vital to the community's economically sustainable development. However, JCU has two main campuses that are over 400 kilometres apart and is remote from other major cities and, hence, remote from options to access and 
 utilise, either singularly or in partnership, the infrastructure enjoyed by metropolitan institutions. The impact of infrastructure deficiencies on JCU, particularly those of telecommunications, and costs affect its role as a vital part of its regional infrastructure. Many of those deficiencies likewise impact on the prospects for economic development of the region.
Universities are, in essence, generators, providers and users of information. Their capacity to produce and transmit knowledge is highly dependent on the means by which information is stored and disseminated. Invariably the regions have a poorer information infrastructure than metropolitan areas, and the gap is widening. For example, in its traditional mode, regional state and business libraries have been closed or downsized, and the options to form cooperative links with major libraries—such as state and university libraries—are severely limited by distance's tyranny. Regional university libraries are required to be more self-sufficient but on a smaller resource base. This is certainly the case with JCU.
Information transmission for the regions is becoming increasingly dependent on telecommunications, particularly via the Internet. The role of the Internet in teaching, research and general economic activity is now well established. It is absolutely critical not only for the continued wellbeing of a regional university—and hence for the region's key information resource—that Internet access in northern Queensland is adequate but also for the capacity of the region's community and businesses to fully participate in activities that rely on data transmission such as electronic commerce.
Australian universities pioneered the introduction of the Internet to Australia with the development of the Australian Academic and Research Network. AARNet, as it is called in shorthand terms, in its current form connects a single node or hub in each state at very high speed, and that is currently 155 megabits per second. In Queensland this hub is physically sited at the University of Queensland at St Lucia. Because of their physical proximity to the AARNet hub at UQ, universities in the southern corner of Queensland can connect to 
 the Internet at very high speeds—up to 34 megabits per second—by use of a microwave based communications system at modest capital and maintenance costs.
But JCU and Central Queensland University are a long way away from that hub. Indeed, JCU's campus in Cairns is 1,850 kilometres away, and Townsville is 1,450 kilometres away. The cost of getting communication over that distance is prohibitive. Currently what happens is that both JCU and Central Queensland University have to rely on an inadequate and saturated two megabits per second frame relay connection leased from Telstra.
A recent CISCO survey confirms that JCU—listen to this—has the lowest ratio of Internet bandwidth per staff-student of any Australian university. That is simply unacceptable. The cost of building microwave based communications infrastructure to Brisbane would be prohibitive for JCU. A preliminary estimate from a commercial vendor has indicated a conservative capital cost of $3½ million and an annual maintenance fee of $450,000 for a 34 megabits per second microwave connection running from Cairns to Brisbane via Townsville. That connection is available at very low charge for the southern Queensland universities but at a prohibitive cost for James Cook. Essentially, such a project would duplicate the microwave based communications infrastructure of Telstra over this region.
Alternatively, a 34 megabits per second connection from JCU's Cairns and Townsville campuses to the AARNet hub at UQ can be purchased from Telstra at a cost of $800,000 per annum. That is beyond JCU's budget, and certainly that cost would severely impact on JCU's ability to adequately resource its teaching and research programs. Alternate sources of government support for JCU and CQU have been exhaustively explored; namely, the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund and the DETYA Australian Partnership for High Performance Computing Program.
Consequently, the capacity of both JCU and Central Queensland University to fulfil its missions of teaching and research are at a significant disadvantage compared with the 
 institutions in the rest of Australia. The costs to opportunities available to regional universities come in many areas, including national competitive research grants; a range of options for basic, environmental, applied and industrial research; high performance computing; remote and electronic library access; teaching and learning; capacity to recruit and retain staff of high quality—and it goes on.
The list is not exhaustive but it indicates the range of activities that are increasingly being negatively impacted on by the absence of high-speed data connections. In effect, there is a significant distance based discrimination for the regional institutions that prevents them from full participation in new developments in teaching, learning and research that make significant demand of high bandwidth communications. Furthermore, many of these missed opportunities also apply to regional industries and businesses which cannot afford the very high charges required for high-speed connections. Without these broadband connections, their ability to compete or survive in the developing information based economy is seriously compromised.
The issue of staff recruitment and retention is particularly serious. The success of many strategic initiatives in northern Queensland is becoming increasingly reliant on the availability of underlying IT infrastructure. Examples of negative impacts that are already felt by businesses in North Queensland because of the absence of affordable high bandwidth communications include: high density imagery cannot be digitally transmitted outside the region—a major problem for environmental, multimedia and GIS bureaus—graphic designers cannot email digital files to separators in Brisbane; colour separations cannot be prepared for printing; engineers cannot work interactively on CAD-CAM based projects; and 3D computer simulation skills based at the Queensland Manufacturing Institute in Townsville cannot be accessed interactively by the Stereo Lithography Unit at the Queensland Manufacturing Institute in Brisbane.
Businesses wanting to participate in enterprise-wide knowledge management and electronic commerce—for example, sending images and data around the world to support 
 their products, teleconferencing, data transfer and product research access—cannot do this presently in North Queensland. Unless the region can get access to high-speed data transfer, national and international businesses will increasingly avoid the region. Any competitive advantages this region may have in terms of other features will be compromised without an effective modern communications system.
This motion seeks to address these particular problems. I believe that all Australians should have equal access to the bandwidth capacity that is necessary to do business and to look after education. I certainly support this motion.

The extent to which education has benefited cannot be overstated. Universities, schools and other educational institutions can share information, carry out research without boundaries, communicate internationally and raise efficiencies of administration. Through electronic information, students have the ability to work from home, research from any computer with an Internet connection and increase their exposure to the subject matter they are learning. Electronic information transmission has created the learning methods and expectations of the 21st century. The enhanced ability of our academics and scholars to access the world of thoughts and ideas has accelerated both global learning and understanding. These technologies have gone past the whizzbang and are now essential tools for modern learning. The ability to access electronic informa 
 tion is no longer so much a competitive advantage as the lack of access has become a recognisable impediment.
This reliance is growing at such a pace that the children of today cannot honestly comprehend how the rest of us managed without this technology in the past. Education and learning can be without bounds but only where information has the same criteria. In research as in business the information age is an inescapable reality. Whether we embrace them or not, new technologies are rushing towards us and forever altering the way we live and the way we do business. Business should embrace to a very large extent the opportunities provided by these new technologies. Many Australian businesses have already done this. Australian business now enjoys global markets, mobility of capital and the opportunity for international enterprise on a previously unimaginable scale. In fact, these new technologies go so far as to throw into question our traditional notions of the nation state as a business base. This is the challenge of new technologies but, for our sparsely populated island continent, this may be our opportunity.
Electronic transfer of information has created industries and markets in which Australia can compete free of many of our traditional disadvantages. Information industries do not require the capital that is often so hard to find for other industries. The globalisation of markets will liberate us from the suffocating effects of our small domestic markets. The tyranny of distance is eliminated now that we are all just one mouse-click away from each other. This technology can do good things for all Australians, but it will be particularly good for rural, regional and isolated Australia. The growing role of electronic information has liberated those parts of Australia previously trapped by isolation. Through information technologies there is a growing equity between the services, information and entertainment available to both our country cousins and their city counterparts.
But the rate of growth of these vital services for the bush is still trailing. This is a genuine problem. Whilst equity of access to the world is the hallmark of this new technology, unfortunately it is rendered meaningless 
 without equity of access within Australia. Only this equity will allow country Australia to be a fundamental part of the new Australia, let alone the rest of the world. This leads me to the second part of the motion:
(2)	 further recognises that the availability of adequate capacity, high quality and appropriately priced bandwidth—for the electronic transmission of information—is an important strategic issue for the development of the information economy in Australia;
The development of the information economy is vital to the future of Australia. We are isolated geographically but not electronically, and certainly not intellectually. Australia has always relied on its natural resources and the sheep's back for its wealth and growth but, as everyone would recognise today, that is no longer the case and it is certainly no longer enough.
The information age is shifting global demand for goods and services—global demand that we can satisfy. Countries without our natural resources are developing these new economies. Australia cannot lose ground in these early years while we subsist off historical and diminishing economies. This new age is still very much in its infancy. We can get on board now or we can dabble around while we remain resource reliant. If we do that, sooner rather than later we will find that we are poorly placed in the main game of global markets and the world economy. We must put into place today the strategies and policies that will see new industries, new business and new developments drive the Australian economy. Australia must harness our historical ability to overcome distance. We are a nation that has developed remote communities and provided remote services. After all, our country has perfected distance education through the School of the Air and open learning at our universities as well as the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Should we not then have something to contribute to a technology that has further broken down the need for face-to-face contact on a global level? These technologies are creating new economies that can be easily developed in any region with the initiative. The economies of the future are about things we have not even dreamed of 
 yet. The requirement is for an infrastructure system and national policy to ensure that it occurs at all and that it occurs equitably. Part (3) of this motion:
(3)	 notes that regional areas throughout Australia have a poorer electronic information infrastructure than metropolitan areas, and the gap is widening . . .
This reaffirms the importance of universal service obligations. Universal service obligations in communications infrastructure are part of what has ensured that everyone in this country gets the services they need at an affordable price throughout the entire country. This has been of particular benefit to people living in the bush. The cost for one connection to an outback property is vastly in excess of the connection of the same service in the city. But that does not mean that people in the bush should not have access to the same service and for the same cost. Universal service obligations must extend beyond fair access to a telephone line, to include the infrastructure required for the full employment of all of today's information technologies.
It is the role of government to ensure that these services are provided, maintained and kept up to date. Private enterprise cannot be expected to deliver universal service obligations at the same level as would government. The impact of these obligations on corporate profits would see the eventual neglect of this role and diminishing returns for the bush. Even if the government could successfully legislate for the provision of equitable services, perhaps from a privatised Telstra, the reality is that Telstra would be bound to provide today's telecommunication needs only as a universal service obligation. Tomorrow's information technologies would, however, be provided by a privatised Telstra at the market rate, if at all in some areas. Even now, too few regional Australians have access to a telephone genuinely capable of supporting modems and other basic electronic information equipment.
Australia's communication agency would have no incentive to initiate new services or technologies for isolated and rural communities whose number would not be commercially viable. Such services in regional communi 
 ties would lead only to public pressure to provide them at affordable rates well below the actual cost. Thus, tomorrow's technologies and tomorrow's services will be lost to the bush. Regional Australia needs to be confident that government will always keep central to decision making the provision of services to the bush that are of equal capacity and of equal value with city Australia. If this government place extra commercial pressure on Telstra by further sale, they will continue to erode that confidence. Instead, this government must recognise that the information technologies are as an important part of the social and economic life of regional Australia as they are in the major metropolitan centres and, to a very large degree, can be seen as even more so. Finally, part 4 of the motion:
(4)	 acknowledges the urgent need to provide affordable broadband electronic communications to Australia's regional centres and, in particular, to our regional universities.
The member for Herbert is to be commended for being supportive in his motion of both electronic communications and Australia's universities. I hope he will become an active voice of opposition in his party room when the rest of his colleagues continue to dismantle and destroy both of these services.
If the member supports electronic communications, then he must also reject the government's laws that will severely handicap and ultimately undermine local Internet industries. The government's online services amendments are an enormous imposition on our growing local Internet service providers. The impact on local service providers will be severe enough, though the legislation will go no way towards reducing the level of or access to inappropriate material on the Internet. If the member supports universities, then he also stands in contrast to the government. This government have savaged universities. They have cut university funding and associated research efforts. They have cut incentives for business investment and research and development. The education and training of scientists and engineers has been limited by the government's unhealthy decision to introduce differential rate HECS and impose a higher rate on students wishing to study science or engineering.

"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-06-28,"—I too would like to commend the member for Herbert for bringing this motion to the chamber for debate today, and also the member for Oxley. I was with him for most of his remarks, but he tended to lose me at the end. Australians have always been adept at taking up technology. It has been our hallmark for years. In the rate at which Australians have taken up mobile telephone technology, we now lead the world per capita, which reflects on the diverse geographic region and continent we are. Internet use worldwide is growing at a rate beyond comprehension. Between 1993 and 1997 the number of Internet hosts, that is, computers connected to the Internet, grew from one million to 20 million. By 2001 that figure is expected to rise to 120 million. So the technology uptake is well and truly with us.
The member for Oxley mentioned that these days youngsters wonder how we managed without this technology. There are some in the gallery who are probably more adept at using technology than we are. I recall my first introduction to a computer. It was in my first year at university. I will not say when, but it was a fair while ago when the size of the computer was about half the size of this chamber. We are now able to carry that sort of capacity around in our breast pocket. We need to ensure that the infrastructure is rolled out so that what we know will be a very high uptake by Australians can take place.
With respect to education, a few years ago the Mildura Aboriginal District Education Council were conducting a seminar on mud brick construction. MADEC, as they are referred to, conduct a lot of projects of assistance to Aboriginal communities and remote Australia. This was the first of a series of symposiums and seminars to ensure that there was expertise amongst the community. I remember sitting in a darkened room at their facility in Mildura with 70 participants from around Australia and New Zealand linked through a televideo conference hook-up to Professor Paul McHenry from the University of Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an expert in adobe construction. This was several years ago, but reflecting back on it in today's 
 terms it was a very primitive video conference with the use of telephone and video facsimile. Bandwidth is increasing. I think the point of the member for Herbert's motion is to ensure that it is rolled out to rural communities at a commensurate rate so that they do not get left behind. Their desire, certainly, to take up this technology is more than obvious to me.
Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, like many other members who represent rural regions across Australia, you have universities in your electorate. I have the same in Mildura. The facility I described at MADEC is now extending to La Trobe University and as recently as today there is some interest from Monash University wanting to promote access to university course information where the geography becomes completely irrelevant. To do that they need broadband facilities in the Sunraysia region. I am hoping that those universities at Mildura can keep pace with Southern Cross University up at Coffs Harbour so that education is provided to those rural people whom, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we represent. We are determined to ensure that the infrastructure of this technology is available to them. They have made conscious decisions about where they want to live in Australia. They have made a reasonable and generous contribution to the GDP by their involvement in primary production and they deserve the same sort of support in the provision of broadband technology as every other Australian enjoys who lives in provincial and metropolitan centres. I congratulate the member for Lindsay for bringing this motion to the attention of the House. I look forward to the ongoing roll-out and the uptake from people like MADEC in my region.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I support the motion of the honourable member for Herbert. The matter which the member raises affects all universities throughout Australia, including universities in my electorate of Lowe. Lowe is the home of the main campus of the Australian Catholic University. The ACU is a national university with two campuses located in Melbourne and campuses in Ballarat, Canberra and Brisbane. It is instructive to explain to this House the nature 
 of the problem that the member for Herbert refers to in his motion.
Australian universities pioneered the introduction of the Internet to Australia with the development of the Australian Academic and Research Network. AARNet was gradually developed to include Internet connection of all Australian universities. AARNet will also provide connection of voice services. This provides cost savings by providing university telephone services by microwave.
In 1995, the original AARNet infrastructure was sold to Telstra and the proceeds used to develop AARNet2. AARNet2 was based on Optus services that connected a single node or hub in each state at very high speed through the use of optic fibre technology. Now that AARNet2 is up and running, this provides a good bandwidth range between all universities in Australia. AARNet2 is a child of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and is about to be incorporated as a private company. Through the Optus deal, AARNet2, the amount of bandwidth is able to cope with demand.
For universities to connect to AARNet2, they need to provide their own `tails' to their regional network organisation. One RNO point exists in each state, made up of all universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Therefore, there are eight RNOs—one in each state and territory—which provide the Internet infrastructure in each state for all Australian universities.
The ACU has two campuses in Sydney. Therefore, one tail is required for each campus. Each campus had to build its own connection point. Funding for this upgrade in the ACU has come partly from the government as a special grant and partly from recurrent funding. A sum of $2.5 million was spent on microwave connection plus aided technology. Half this amount was paid by the ACU itself. Because the ACU campus at Strathfield is city based, this overhead is relatively inexpensive, but the cost rises as distance increases because more microwave relay points are required. Hills get in the way or space must be rented for existing space on towers or building rooftops. Thus, regional campus over 
 heads are badly affected by distance in terms of cost. For example, Charles Sturt University, with campuses in Bathurst, Wagga and Albury, has just gone through this exercise at great expense. James Cook University's problem is much worse, given the sheer distance between campuses—for example, between the Cairns campus and the Queensland RNO hub in Brisbane. James Cook University's alternative is to rent from a major carrier. The Telecommunications Act 1996 places restrictions on universities so that they can use AARNet only for university purposes. Only following a Senate inquiry was ministerial exemption pursuant to subsections 51(1) and 95(1) given in January 1998, allowing university students the right to have access to AARNet. Universities cannot go into partnership with commercial entities to develop high technology products or allow commercial interests to use AARNet.
The act introduced the concept of the `immediate circle'. Universities can allow only staff, and now students, to use AARNet on a position of `competitive neutrality'. This is a joke. This policy is a blight on universities and denies them the right to work with private enterprise. If universities could go into partnership with private enterprise, there would be a much larger financial pool available for funding infrastructure. Because private enterprise is statutorily denied from using AARNet, all network infrastructure must be funded either by the government or by the universities themselves. This lack of funding has not been such an issue for the big city universities but it is a big issue for the regional universities. The statutory obstruction in the Telecommunications Act has been a direct cause of the delay in providing broadband services to regional university campuses.
In the case of the University of Ballarat, a separate microwave facility was built requiring it to sell capacity to pay for this project. While this is of great benefit for the region, it has been a two-edged sword in that the University of Ballarat has had to assume commercial risk in such a venture. The only way the ACU Ballarat campus could afford a high-speed Internet connection was by leasing part of the University of Ballarat's service. 
 This is the only way the ACU campus in Ballarat could have made use of microwave technology.
The ministerial exemption is due to expire at the end of this year. This exemption from the ordinary operation of the act allows universities to operate AARNet for research purposes; otherwise the act requires universities to be carriers in their own right. Finally, I note that the TAFE institutions are excluded from access to AARNet. The Telecommunications Act shows itself to be the champion of telecommunications corporations, protecting their interests against the needs of students, and the needs of those with disabilities.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—May I say how pleasant it is not only to support the member for Herbert's motion but also to hear such positive statements from both sides of the House and to see a bipartisan approach to what is a very important issue. As we have heard, the universities in Australia are high intensity centres of information. They create information, they use information and they provide information. It is important that universities outside the capital cities have the ability to participate in this information transfer and the generation of information to the same degree as do the commonly classed sandstone universities.
A number of speakers have already aptly demonstrated the importance of data transfer and e-commerce and the very poor situation, in terms of our capabilities, that exists outside the capital cities. I find it ironic that the Internet is used in Australia by universities and has been developed by universities, and yet we have a situation where not all universities are able to use it equally. Capital city universities are, of course, at a distinct advantage, which sees them probably able to transfer data at even five times the rate of my local university, the University of Southern Queensland which, of course, had its data transfer capabilities upgraded substantially as a result of a $190,000 grant from the federal government. But, as I say, it is 20 per cent of the rate of capital city universities and, when we get up to the member for Herbert's area, 
 the situation deteriorates to an enormous degree.
In terms of the importance of this issue, I can only agree that to facilitate e-commerce and the transfer of information and to provide the opportunity for government to use the Internet to its maximum in serving the people of Australia, I support the member for Oxley's comments of a universal service obligation.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—Regardless of the position the community takes on the GST package, there is one part that cannot be justified by anyone, not even the Treasurer—that is the tax on literacy, the tax on education, the tax on books. I raise this issue because of a letter I received from a local author, Nick Earls. Nick has written three books: Zigzag , Bachelor Kisses  and Headgames . In his letter he reminds me of the promise made by the Australian Democrats before the last election. Back then the Democrats said that a tax on books was a tax on learning and literature and that they would not vote for a tax on books. They may have hidden in their offices during the vote on books, but it was their deal that ensured that it got through. The opposition will never forget this, nor will authors such as Nick Earls.
Nick Earls represents to some extent the book industry in Australia. He knows from overseas experience that the tax on books will have a negative impact on literacy and it will mean fewer books in the home. Not for those on the government benches—they will be comfortable and relaxed—but for the struggling families in my electorate it will be just another expense too far to reach. Of all the regressive policy contained in the GST ideology, a tax on literature will be written in 
 history as the worst. I just hope that those who are most affected by it will have the literacy skills to understand what it says. I have always believed that learning is a lifelong journey and that the journey is more important than the destination. That still remains true today, except most people will now be travelling in cattle class.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 recognises the importance of the efforts of the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition in working to obtain a debt free start in the new millennium for a billion people in impoverished countries;
(2)	 supports the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition's efforts to present a 370,000 signature petition to the G7 leaders meeting in Cologne on 19 June 1999; and
(3)	 supports the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition's efforts to encourage the G7 leaders to take effective steps to prevent high levels of debt building up again in impoverished countries.
I rise today in support of the efforts of the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition to encourage governments, in particular the leaders of the G7 countries, to address the issue of debt reduction and debt prevention in impoverished countries.
The Jubilee Debt 2000 Coalition is an international movement comprising a broad range of people and groups from over 40 countries. Their vision is for the alleviation of debt and the development of debt prevention strategies so those one billion people living in impoverished countries have the chance for a better life in the new millennium. The coalition has a social justice and a preventive outlook.
I have been approached by individual people and groups in the Stirling electorate and from other areas to take an interest in this issue, to support the efforts of the coalition in presenting a 370,000-signature petition to the 
 leaders of the G7 countries and its encouragement of the G7 leaders with debt prevention strategies for the future.
I was pleased to accept an invitation to participate in a forum in this House when the coalition displayed the 370,000-signature petition prior to its being sent overseas, for presentation to the G7 leaders on 19 June 1999 in Cologne, Germany. I was pleased to see and hear the bipartisan support and words for the coalition's efforts from members of this House and the Senate. The people and groups who contacted me have been very clear in stating the reasons why they think this is an important issue and why they think the coalition's efforts should be supported.
I will read out the concerns expressed in a letter I received that was signed by a number of people. It is one of many such letters and phone calls I have received at my electorate office. It said:
We are writing to express our concern about the enormous burden of debt on many Third World countries. The effects of this debt are felt most by the citizens of these countries—the poorest people in the world—as health and education budgets are increasingly diminished in an attempt to service it.
The letters points out that:
. . . through its participation in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Australia has a voice to lobby
-	 against the inhumanity of maintaining the fiction of repayment; and
-	 for incentives rather than punitive measures towards economic and political stability. Please help Australia use that voice.
As one of the many voices that has supported this issue, I agree that it is an appalling situation that over one billion people live in poverty with little access to the basics of life such as health services and immunisation programs, clean water, transport infrastructure, jobs and stable economies. It is tragic that debt repayment schemes have drained money and resources out of these countries and have kept the level of poverty so high. Due to spiralling interest rates in the 1970s and 1980s, some countries have actually repaid their debts more than once. Some countries are repaying $3 for every dollar that they borrowed.
The coalition strongly points out in its publications and letters that everyone loses from the effects of debt and that everyone benefits from the effects of debt forgiveness. We are diminished as human beings and as a community if we do not work with other countries to address the debt and poverty issues in Australia as well as in these impoverished Third World countries. Every child or adult who dies because of the lack of immunisation or basic health services or access to clean water is a loss to their family, their community, their country and the world.
Australia must raise its voice and make every effort in its spheres of influence to ensure the G7 leaders, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other mechanisms hear the concerns and solutions raised by the coalition. The leaders of the G7 countries, which are the world's richest countries, are to be commended for their decision to cut billions of dollars from Third World debt at their recent meeting in Cologne in Germany. Their support of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the official debt relief program, along with their messages to the world's poorest countries to undertake economic reforms, must also be commended.
It is pleasing to see that this government recognises that `unsustainable debt has been recognised as a constraint in the ability of poor countries to pursue sustainable development and alleviate poverty'—a statement made by Senator Hill in the Senate on 11 May this year. I look forward to seeing the government's continued support for initiatives such as the Jubilee Debt 2000 Coalition and for the development of additional strategies that will enable human and social development in some of the world's poorest nations. As citizens, and as a nation, we will all be enriched by these developments.
The people and groups who have contacted me consider that sympathetic consideration must also be given to a debt moratorium for poor countries which have been stricken by major natural disasters, such as is the case in Central America. I am sure that everyone, like me, was distressed by the terrible scenes portrayed in the media, particularly on TV, of the hurricane in Central America and was 
 appalled at the numbers of people who died, were injured or made homeless. But they would have been particularly distressed and appalled at the scenes where the relief facilities could not cope with the enormous number of people left homeless and in greater poverty because of that natural disaster. We have had many such disasters in the countries surrounding us, ranging from cyclones to earthquakes, to famine and disease.
In the interests of a fair go, Australians have always been interested not only in building up the infrastructure and wealth and benefits of this country but also in extending their generosity to less well-off places. In this tradition, I call on the House to support the coalition with every effort, with every resource and with every bit of energy they can put into helping to bring about solutions in these countries.
In this House we have always worked not only to build up the democratic processes in Australia but also to promote and build up the democratic processes in other countries. The Australian parliament recently sent 12 members and senators to the Indonesian elections as observers. This was a strategy to support and promote democratic institutions and infrastructure. If the countries around us are stable and the countries in the world are stable and if the democratic processes and institutions are strong, then the likelihood of wars breaking out—conflicts like we have seen in Kosovo—will be diminished. That is a goal I am sure everyone in this House wants to work towards. Third World debt—regarding the debt of the world's poorest countries as being an issue—must be addressed by this House. In support of the people of Australia who have asked for us to take this action, I commend their efforts to the House.

"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—Unsustainable debt makes it difficult for poor countries to pursue sustainable development and alleviate poverty. At the moment there are two initiatives happening globally—the 
 IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Jubilee Debt 2000 Coalition. Those two initiatives have similar goals but they have different strategies to achieve them. They are both concerned with the high levels of debt that we see in developing countries, in the HIPC, but they have different approaches to them.
Total external debt owed by the highly indebted poor countries increased from $US58 billion in 1980 to $US189 billion by 1990. It increased slowly in the last decade, so now it is about $US200 billion. On average those countries have about an 18 per cent annual debt service to exports ratio, and the World Bank feels that if countries have anything higher than a 20 per cent to 25 per cent service to exports ratio then they would be unable to service their debt. The reasons for the high levels of debt include large terms of trade losses since 1980, countries borrowing for consumption, low economic growth due to civil disturbances, weak governance, poor macroeconomic policies and poor human capital development compared with other countries.
The Jubilee 2000 project was launched in 1996. They reject the IMF-World Bank HIPC Initiative. They would like to cancel debt, including debt which cannot be serviced without placing a burden on impoverished people—debt already paid in real terms, debt incurred by repressive regimes, apartheid debt and apartheid related debt in southern Africa, the debt in Honduras and Nicaragua due to natural disasters, and also debt for improperly designed policies and projects.
The already established HIPC initiative does provide debt relief to countries that have demonstrated a commitment to structural reform and sound economic policies. Australia has committed $30.5 million to the HIPC initiative. In total, the Jubilee Coalition have already provided $6.1 billion in debt relief and they estimate that up to 26 highly indebted poor countries will have relief by the year 2000. There is also a review of this initiative going on which is due to report in September of this year.
The options that people are looking at for improving the HIPC initiative include deeper 
 and broader debt relief and relief higher than the Paris Club's 80 per cent ceiling. At present, they have mechanisms to forgive 80 per cent of the debt. They are also looking at shortening the period for a country to establish a track record for sound policies. The solution to looking at the debt of the highly indebted poor countries is likely to be more along the lines of this initiative—that is, looking at ways of improving it but making sure that there are conditions attached.
There are two problems with forgiving debt. One is the problem of moral hazard, in that you give no incentive for good policies. The second is that it is hard to attract foreign capital in the future if you have countries where the debt has been completely forgiven. We should also recognise that over the last decade the international financial community have introduced significant debt relief. They have had outright bilateral debt forgiveness; they have had buybacks of commercial debt. They have also had rescheduling of the debt. Despite that, new borrowing has led to increased outstanding debt.
Let us look at what Australia has done. Australia has already forgiven $195 million of Egypt's debt. We gave Vietnam $5 million to clear their arrears with the IMF. We gave Cambodia $2½ million to clear their arrears with the IMF. I think the Jubilee 2000 campaign has a good motivation, but I do have reservations about completely cancelling all HIPC debt because of, as I said before, the moral hazard and the problem of attracting foreign capital in the future. It also does affect the credit rating of lending agencies.
I would like to commend those Australians who have taken an active interest in Jubilee 2000, especially the 350,000 who have signed the petition. The effects on poor countries, especially in sub-Sahara and Africa and some countries in South America, of unmanageable debt are well known and have been extensively studied. International debt is a serious problem. Debt servicing reduces potential government expenditure on other goods and services in the community. The government fully supports finding a long-term solution to international debt.
As I said before, I support the HIPC initiative because it aims to reduce the debt burden of the heavily indebted poor countries subject to satisfactory economic and social policies—what is called conditionality in that they do have to modify their policies. The initiative aims to reduce the debt of the world's poorest countries to sustainable levels, subject to the pursuit of economic and social policies. I think that is the most credible way to reduce sustainable debt relief because it seeks to achieve a lasting solution to the debt problem. Unlike previous mechanisms, the initiative deals with debt in a comprehensive way by involving all creditors, including multilateral institutions. So far, as I said, the initiative has contributed $US6 billion in nominal debt service relief.
In addition to Australia's support for the HIPC initiative, Australia is a member of the Paris Club. The Paris Club is an informal group of 17 creditor countries which meets monthly to ensure a coordinated approach to the negotiation of debts rescheduling and, in some cases, write-downs on government to government debt in developing countries. The primary concern with debt relief is to ensure that any relief is sustainable and not counterproductive. A fundamental part of the solution to the debt problem and achieving long-term sustainable growth is the pursuit of sound economic and social policies and poverty alleviation.
Debt write-off may send the wrong signals to that country and other countries which are managing their international debt. This is the problem of moral hazard. By writing off debt, governments may not continue to pursue their responsibility of sound economic governance. This may cause another international debt problem some time in the future. It may also discourage creditors from providing further assistance and send the wrong signal to those countries that are managing their debts well and in a sustainable way. Debt relief must be provided in a way that supports good governance, especially if the burden of international debt is to be prevented from occurring again.
The World Bank and the IMF are conducting a two-phase review of their heavily indebted poor countries initiative with the aim 
 of maximising its effectiveness. Phase 1 addresses concerns about the current framework and phase 2 will allow a more in-depth consultation regarding the link between debt relief and social development. The review will take into account the recent Cologne initiative by the G8 countries to expand the heavily indebted poor countries initiative by providing broader, faster and deeper debt relief. It will be completed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in September.
As I said before, Australia has supported this initiative with the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, announcing an Australian contribution to the initiative of $30 million in June last year. By encouraging the HIPC review process, we also welcome the Cologne initiative by the G8 countries. In response to the motion that we are discussing, I commend the motivations which are behind the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition. I believe that the HIPC initiative from the IMF and World Bank is a more credible way of approaching international debt and avoiding the problems of moral hazard and the problems that poor countries would have attracting foreign capital in the future.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I am delighted to be able to rise in the House to speak on this motion proposed by the honourable member for Stirling. I congratulate her for raising this issue in this place, thereby focusing honourable members' minds and the minds of those listening to this broadcast on this crucial matter. Debt relief for Third World countries is a huge moral issue facing this world as we pass into the new millennium. I would like to place on the public record my support for the Jubilee 2000 campaign. As speakers have said, it is an international movement in over 40 countries advocating a debt-free start to the millennium for a billion people. Here in Australia, a coalition of over 40 non-government and church organisations are supporting this cause.
The issue of Third World poverty has been an interest of mine for a very long time—well before I entered this place in 1993. I am very pleased to say that there is in this parliament a dedicated group of members and senators—I 
 guess you could call us a poverty coalition—who are working not only in our electorates but also across the country in seeking to support endeavours that bring this issue to the nation's attention.
As previous speakers have said, the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition is working to obtain a debt-free start in the new millennium for a billion people in impoverished countries. For my part, it was pleasing to see media articles last week reported from the Washington Post  and from the Reuters news network on this very issue. It was pleasing that these articles spoke of the leaders from the group of seven rich countries agreeing to a landmark plan to ease the debt burden of the world's poorest countries. These seven countries have pledged to relieve poor countries of nearly three-quarters of a crushing load of their debt that, for decades, has frustrated them in their seemingly insurmountable task of climbing out of poverty.
This agreement is to forgive debt of up to $107 billion, which is an enormous amount of money. Most of us are unaware of just how crippling this debt really is. Over 50 countries throughout the world have debts that will never be paid back but continue to be paid daily with people's lives. In Zambia, for instance, every citizen currently owes the country's creditors $790. It does not sound like much for us, but that is more than twice that nation's average annual income.
Every year in these debt ridden countries, resources are being diverted from health, education and sanitation towards unproductive debt service. The United Nations Development Program in 1997 stated that 21 million children's lives could be saved if the money used for debt service was put back into health and education. The agreement in Cologne last week was seen by President Bill Clinton as:
. . . an historic step to help the world's poorest nations achieve sustained growth and independence while targeting new resources for poverty reduction, education and combating AIDS.
He went on to say:
It represents a sound, humane effort to promote widely shared prosperity.
Now that the G7 countries have bitten the bullet, one would hope that the World Bank 
 and the International Monetary Fund will move quickly to support the G7 initiatives. In my mind, for too long the World Bank and the IMF have dragged their heels over this issue, despite their HIPC initiatives. Debt sustainability is currently defined by the IMF and World Bank as being basically nothing more than reducing debts to a level at which debt service due equals debt service actually paid. Radical reforms by the IMF and the World Bank must follow the great news from the G7 initiative in Cologne if Jubilee 2000's goals are to be met. I commend the member for Stirling's motion to the House and would ask that all honourable members do what is in their power to support, in any way possible, the work of the Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—I would also like to congratulate the member for Stirling for raising this matter. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to it today. At a local level, my constituent organisation, the St Patrick's Parish Justice Group, including Dr Ray Watson and indeed the chair, Josie Micich, has been working hard to collect some 2,000 signatures from the Ballarat district in relation to the Jubilee 2000 initiative. Dr Watson wrote to me recently. Unfortunately, I could not attend one of its meetings because parliament was sitting. Dr Watson said:
At this stage we know that the 2000 signature target has been exceeded. Given the inherent difficulties in the process of first educating people prior to their signing, we are very pleased with this result.
I would just like to congratulate my constituent organisation on educating people in relation to this issue and on collecting some 2,000 signatures.
The issue is, of course, an extremely difficult one. I do not think there would be anyone in this House who likes to see or read about the problems faced by a number of countries throughout the world which have extraordinarily high and indeed unmanageable levels of debt. The ramifications of that debt level are quite obvious: ultimately, poverty and a standard of living that I do not think anyone in this House would like to see inflicted upon their fellow man. I think the 
 reasons behind the Jubilee 2000 campaign are very laudable. While I fully endorse and support everything the campaign is trying to do, the issue I have with Jubilee 2000 is its requested outcome. I would hope that the Cologne initiative will give the Jubilee 2000 people great heart. I think we need to accept the fact that past practices did not work. Past practices really just put debt on top of debt and incurred for those people poverty on top of poverty. That is quite obviously no solution at all, and it is not one that I would support in any way.
I hope that out of Cologne will come a realisation that, in relation to this whole issue, we have to have a very healthy dose of commonsense. I am sure that the member for Stirling would not want to encourage practices that would encourage further debt accumulation if what she is requesting were to occur, and I do not think that is the appropriate way either.
We need to accept that there is a problem, that that problem is recognised by hundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia and that many men and women have gone out and collected signatures from well-meaning people who share our concern in relation to the unmanageable debt levels of those of our fellow brothers and sisters throughout the world who are unable, through their own means, to address this. Most of it is governmental, and very few of the people who are wearing the outcomes of these high levels of debt are in a position to do anything about it.
I hope that Cologne does come up with some commonsense. I hope that we appreciate the fact that it is not about debt being repaid; it is about our being in a situation throughout the world to be able to encourage development and impact positively on the economic and social lives of many people in many countries throughout the world. My hope is that Jubilee 2000 has pricked a conscience that will lead the world leaders to sit down and look at an appropriate and achievable mechanism to address what I think is an appalling problem.
—Order! The debate is adjourned and the 
 resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Jubilee 2000 Debt Coalition</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise in this grievance debate today to answer accusations and innuendos that have been made by this government and in particular by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—and today by his friend who is bailing him out of the problems that he has got at the moment, namely the Prime Minister—trying to establish a link between 
 the recent arrival of illegal immigrants and the question of judicial review and deportation. Today during question time, the minister and the Prime Minister kept trying to connect judicial review—or, in simpler terms, the removal of people's ability to have their case heard in a court of law—with the current crisis of illegal immigrants. The fact is that the two have absolutely nothing to do with each other.
The majority of boat people—the illegal immigrants—are shipped back to their own country within usually four weeks under existing law. These are the facts straight out of the minister's own media statements. I will read snippets of some of the statements that the minister himself has been putting out on these issues. The first, dated 28 June 1999, is headed `Illegal boat people returned to China', and says:
The 60 illegal Chinese entrants who recently arrived at Scotts Head Beach near Coffs Harbour were returned to China last week, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.
Another one he issued on Thursday, 20 May 1999, is headed `More illegals arrive as smugglers target Australia', and says:
Mr Ruddock said that the Government was committed to returning people who had no legal right to be in Australia although it would continue to honour its international protection obligations.
Of the 340 illegal boat arrivals in 1997, some 272 or 80 per cent had been returned. Of the 200 illegal arrivals in 1998, some 159 or 80 per cent had been returned.
These people had no claim to be in Australia and were returned within weeks of having arrived illegally in Australia.
Another press release of Mr Ruddock, dated 28 June 1999, is headed `Cairns boat people victims of racket', and says:
26 people who beached their boat on Holloway's Beach, Cairns on 12 March this year were victims of an organised people smuggling racket, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.
Announcing their recent return to China, Mr Ruddock said the group—22 men and four women—had been constantly lied to by the operation's organisers and had paid dearly for their ill-fated journey.
It goes on to say:
Mr Ruddock said that so far this financial year, excluding yesterday's NSW arrival, 21 boats carrying 279 unauthorised arrivals arrived in Australia, including 170 Chinese. Most had since left Australia.
From his own mouth he tells us what the position is with these illegal boat arrivals. The minister must stop saying that without this so-called privative clause, stopping judicial review, which he is trying to introduce with the government—and now aided and abetted in a public campaign by the Prime Minister—he cannot send illegal immigrants back. That is what he is trying to say. It is just a plain untruth. It is designed to mask his own incompetence and the incompetence of the Minister for Justice and Customs in not sending a clear signal to those smuggling people into our country—that Australia is not open for business.
I will tell you why these people smugglers continue to smuggle people here: they think we are an easy target. Why do they think we are an easy target? I will tell you why. Not long ago we had the spectacle of a large ship that came down the coast of Queensland, beached at Holloways Beach near Cairns and went undetected. We then had the spectacle of another ship coming 2,000 kilometres down the east coast of Australia, beaching near Coffs Harbour and also going undetected. A multitude of these ships have been arriving over the last couple of months. Why are they arriving? It is because the people smugglers overseas see us as not being prepared to spend money and resources to ensure that these people are caught.
I want to say something shortly on what the Prime Minister had to say yesterday. The Prime Minister, fed up with this incompetence and doubletalk, has obviously decided to run the show himself, relieving both ministers of their responsibilities and implementing what the Labor Party has been suggesting for months, to the letter. A press release that I issued on 23 May 1999 headed `""Illegal immigrant problem quickly reaching crisis proportion"", says opposition' states:
Mr Sciacca continued his calls for the Government to increase intelligence gathering personnel at Australia's immigration posts around the World to 
 detect in particular organised people smuggling rackets, before  they set off for Australia.
Mr Sciacca said that by not providing adequate extra resources in both the coastal surveillance area and immigration intelligence gathering in overseas posts, the government is sending a message to the people smugglers that Australia is an easy target.
Then I go on to talk about the budget surplus. Another press release dated Thursday 27 May and headed `Opposition warns of national security threat over illegal boat arrivals' states:
Shadow Minister for Immigration, Con Sciacca today said the Government must now view the flood of illegal immigrants as a major crisis and a possible threat to national security, following the latest unauthorised landing between Weipa and Thursday Island.
Mr Sciacca said that this matter must now be placed at the top of the government's agenda and every available resource must be made available to both the Immigration Department and our coastline surveillance teams. `We must send a clear message to both the poor people being duped and to the people smugglers, that Australia is not  an easy target and they will be caught and sent back,' Mr Sciacca said.
The Labor Party is as tough as, if not tougher than, the government when it comes to illegal immigrants. The Labor Party is not about—this is the important point—taking away the right of people who are here legally to have their day in court. Throwing away the right of people to have their case heard in court, people who are here legally in the sense that they have obviously applied for asylum, to stop a few greedy lawyers from abusing the system is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Over the last few months the minister has been making extraordinary and absurd attacks on the judiciary, attacks which a minister of the Crown, who supposedly understands the concept of the separation of powers, has no right to make. This has been documented in a number of articles. A press release I issued on 7 December 1998 states:
`The minister is coming dangerously close to offending the doctrine of the separation of powers', Mr Sciacca said.
`It is unacceptable to have a Minister of the Crown launching such a concerted and deliberate attack on members of the Judiciary simply because he doesn't like some of their decisions. 

I have no doubt that Mr Ruddock is making these comments in an attempt to publicly sell the Government's decision to limit Judicial review from decisions of Immigration Tribunals to the Federal Court and the High Court.'
There is an outrage among humanitarian and refugee groups, among legal associations, among High Court judges and eminent jurists, when it comes to this minister's decisions, proposals and statements. I understand that including this privative clause could be in breach of our United Nations conventions on refugees. The minister is challenging the Constitution and the separation of powers. The courts in this country are, if you will, the independent watchdog of the politicians.
One of the submissions put to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was made by National Legal Aid, comprising eight associations of legal aid lawyers—not greedy lawyers, people who are rorting the system, as the minister says. I notice my friend opposite, the minister for financial deregulation. I am sure he will understand that lawyers are the custodians of the freedom of democracy of this country. I will only read the submission's conclusion:
One recurrent theme in a comparative analysis of the refugee determination procedure of Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom is that each jurisdiction maintains in some form, the right of judicial review of administrative decisions in relation to Convention applications for protection.
This submission has argued that in order to comply with our international obligations and with the requirements of the rule of law, Australia must strive towards a system fair and just in its determination of applications for refugee status and a system in which decisions are accountable and made according to the law. The scheme proposed in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill does not fit comply with those standards and therefore should not be implemented.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs should stop telling straight-out untruths. They should stop trying to connect illegal immigrants with judicial review. It has nothing whatsoever to do with it. I commend them for doing what they did yesterday; it is about time. All they did was to take exactly what the opposition have been saying and what I have been 
 saying for some time. I am sick and tired of straight-out lies from this government.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Illegal Immigrants</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1
"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—This is the third time this particular bill, the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1999 , has been introduced into this House. The member for Hindmarsh first introduced it in 1995, just before the 1996 election, and she reintroduced it in 1998, just before the 1998 election. Perhaps this time it will actually go forward to the Senate and come into effect; not, I have to say, that the bill coming into effect will make a staggering difference to the lives of those residents of Adelaide who live near Adelaide airport because it is not accompanied by any noise amelioration proposals. But I do think there is some justification for having legislated curfews, which is what this bill will achieve, as opposed to administrative ones. I think a good case can be made out that such an approach, even if it leaves much up to regulation and ministerial discretion, is potentially a more accountable and transparent way of doing things.
We have had quite a few debates in here recently—debates on the  Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Amendment Bill 1999 , for example, and on the diesel fuel bill—in which, I remember, we were told the detail would be filled in afterwards. At least this bill spells out, in an accountable way, what it seeks to achieve. To that extent, the member for Hindmarsh goes against the trend of things that are closed, secretive and patently unaccountable that we have seen building up in this place. But it does remain the case that no other airport in the country is being put forward as a candidate for a legislated curfew, and so an interesting question to ask is: why Adelaide airport? Is there something unique about Adelaide airport?
Mrs Gallus interjecting—
—No other one apart from Sydney, I would say to the member for Hindmarsh—sorry. But the point is Adelaide is quite different from Sydney. It is similar to Brisbane and similar to Perth. The question is: what is important and unique about Adelaide? You could ask the member for Griffith and the member for Lilley if they thought that, if they were to put up a similar bill applying to Brisbane airport, the government would extend the same courtesy to them in having the bill passed expeditiously.
Mrs Gallus interjecting—
—However, as we did last year, Labor will support this bill and, as Labor did last year, we will again move amendments to extend to Adelaide residents living near the airport the same level of insulation against noise currently being offered to residents of Sydney. The member for Hindmarsh interjected just a little while ago that Sydney has a legislated curfew, and the point Labor wants to make is that Sydney also has legislation on noise insulation and insulation is offered to residents there. We say that the two things go hand in hand.
This bill imposes a curfew on aircraft using Adelaide airport between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. There are in this bill a number of exceptions to that rule. There are curfew shoulder hours from 11 p.m. to midnight and from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. The main purpose of these shoulder hours is to provide some flexibility for inter 
 national flight schedules, and the operators of international aircraft may apply to the minister for permission to use Adelaide airport during these shoulder hours. The aircraft must be of the newer, quieter type known as chapter 3 aircraft, in accordance with standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
It is worth noting that Australia has already agreed to implement the ICAO program to phase out non-chapter 3 subsonic jet aircraft so it is not a particularly startling initiative in this particular bill, but it is welcome. Operators of low noise, heavy freight aircraft over 34 tonnes can apply to use the airport during the curfew period, subject to regulation limiting the number of takeoffs and landings during the curfew hours. These aircraft must comply with ICAO chapter 3 noise standards and they must also comply with the 90-95 rule. Under that rule, aircraft cannot exceed 90 decibels on takeoff and 95 decibels on landing. That should rule out DC9s, for example, using Adelaide airport during the curfew hours. I note that the member for Hindmarsh has changed her bill to leave the number of heavy freight movements entirely up to the minister. In the previous version of this bill, these movements were specifically limited to the number allowed by regulation—eight per week—and the number of movements by DC9s to four per week. I assume that the change comes about because of an expectation of increased demand for such flights, but it would be interesting to hear the explanation of the member for Hindmarsh for that point of difference between the last bill and this version of the bill. I also note that the previous bill came into effect within 28 days of receiving royal assent, whereas the current bill gives the government a period of up to six months in which to proclaim it.
There are also some further restrictions on aircraft once they have received permission to use the airport during the curfew. They must not use reverse thrust greater than idle upon landing, and they must use only runway 05/23—that is, they must approach and land from over the sea unless the weather conditions prevent them from doing so. Where flights do end up approaching over the city 
 and landing on runways other than 05/23, the operator of the aircraft must submit a report on the reasons for landing on that runway, including the prevailing wind conditions. The bill also requires Airservices Australia to provide the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Regional Services with a monthly report on flights that landed on runways other than 05/23 during the curfew shoulder hours or the curfew period.
Propeller driven aircraft and jet aircraft under 34 tonnes are also permitted to use the airport during the curfew period, provided they meet noise standards and, in the case of jets, they must comply with the 90-95 rule. There are also some exemptions for emergencies—for search and rescue missions, for medical emergencies, for disaster relief and for reasons of aircraft safety. So, in essence, there is still a fair amount of traffic that can come and go from the airport during the curfew period, and there is quite a lot left to regulations and to the discretion of the minister in terms of the numbers of international and heavy freight traffic that can come in. So not much is going to change out there in the real world. As I say, though, I think it is better to have a legislated curfew than an administrative one.
This bill leaves plenty of room for a greater number of international flights to access Adelaide airport during those shoulder hour periods. Labor does not have a problem with that, but it does raise the question of noise. We accept the need to balance the demand for access to airports for the transport of both people and goods, with the concerns of nearby communities. It is often very difficult—and many have found this to their cost—to strike a fair and reasonable balance between these two competing needs. But we have had this debate and, in many respects, we are back to square one here. That is why I foreshadowed that when we get to consideration of the bill in detail I will be moving amendments for noise insulation for people already affected by noise.
As my predecessor, Lindsay Tanner, pointed out when this bill was last debated, this legislative curfew, like the administrative one it replaces, does nothing to help those people 
 living near Adelaide airport who are already affected by noise. It really raises the question: why do we want curfews? It is because planes make a lot of noise. We want to restrict that noise to certain hours. If that noise is excessive, what are the rights to noise insulation of those people who live near airports? We have said in the past that what applies in Sydney should apply to all airports, and we see no reason to move from that position.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—Since I last spoke on the ACIS Administration Bill 1999 , to which the member for Fraser had moved an amendment, a couple of sitting days have elapsed. I was interrupted then just before question time, and during question time the Treasurer felt the need to attack me for calling for a Productivity Commission inquiry into the car industry. It seems that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, while he loves the Productivity Commission and indeed was instrumental in setting it up and drawing together various government bodies, including the Industry Commission, to constitute the new Productivity Commission—
—He doesn't want it to inquire into anything.
—The member for Rankin is exactly right. He does not want it to inquire into things that he thinks will cause him difficulty. Instead, he wants a quick and dirty 
 internal inquiry to decide what the tariff regime is going to be after the year 2005 and to decide what assistance the car industry is going to receive when the ACIS arrangements expire. They are called transitional arrangements—they have a cap on them of $2 billion, and they are going to expire in 2005. It is an heroic assumption to suggest that a quick and dirty internal inquiry, probably done by Treasury with as limited inputs as they can tolerate from Senator Minchin's department, will come out with the sorts of arrangements that the car industry will need post 2005.
The parliamentary secretary who was at the table last time I was speaking suggested that a full-scale inquiry would create uncertainty. I simply cannot see how a quick and dirty internal inquiry can do other than cause great uncertainty—people will not understand the process, people will not have the opportunity to make the sorts of inputs that you are able to in a proper inquiry, there will not be a draft report, there will not be the opportunity for feedback; it will just be whatever the government thinks is a convenient thing for it at the time. We do not know when they are going to do it. The industry will be left in a great deal of uncertainty by this refusal to have a proper full-scale inquiry into the car industry before there is any further phasing down in tariffs.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,22,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I understand the important point the member for Kingston was making. I do not want to dwell too much on the Treasurer's little performance in question time to which he responded, but the member for Kingston is absolutely correct. It was actually so odd it was bizarre, but it was part of a bizarre day that the Treasurer was having. What the member for Kingston is saying, what the opposition is saying, is that there should be a public inquiry, not a private one.
Why do we think this amendment to the  ACIS Administration Bill 1999  is necessary? Why are we talking about the fact that the government has created the ridiculous circumstance in which it is proposing an inquiry in 2005 into a scheme that expires in 2005 and therefore creates the threat of a hiatus? This 
 is not the height of fantasy. This is not our imagination. In a joint statement by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the then minister for industry, dated 5 June 1997, they set out at dot point three: `There will be a review in 2005.' What we are saying is: that is a crazy time to have the review.
I do not object to there being a review in 2005, if circumstances at that stage justify it—let us wait and see. What we are saying is: the parliament is being asked to approve a proposal for some changes which come into effect in 2005 and in this particular bill the implementation of a support measure, so-called transitional measure, which expires in 2005, and the only public information we have is a government commitment to have an inquiry in 2005. Yet when we pressed this point in the second reading debate and heard the parliamentary secretary respond, what did he say? He said, `We don't need an amendment about an inquiry because the government might have an inquiry anyway.' We do not actually know they will. Nobody knows what sort of inquiry it is. Nobody knows whether the parliament will receive the report from that inquiry. Nobody knows whether the public will get a chance to make submissions, whether the industry will get a chance to make submissions, whether the affected communities for this very important regionally based industry will get a chance to make submissions, whether the state governments, particularly of South Australia and Victoria, will get a chance to make submissions.
I think there is legitimate concern that, while we all know that the big players are going to get a chance to be heard, this is an industry where the extent of small and medium sized enterprise involvement is underestimated because everyone thinks of the automobile industry as the four car manufacturers. Of course they are very important players in the industry fundamental to, for example, the City of Geelong, as our colleague the member for Corio made clear in his speech on the second reading. But what about all the automobile parts manufacturers and the other service suppliers affected by this? It is necessary that we propose to have a proper inquiry before the scheme folds and before the tariff changes 
 take place so that all those views can be heard and an informed decision made.
The tariff is important because, while I think both sides of the House remain committed—I know we do, and I think it is the same for the government—to the 2010 APEC objective, the pace and timetable of achieving that are matters properly for informed judgment. But the most important thing is this: what is going to follow these transitional arrangements? How are these transitional arrangements going to continue beyond 2005? We do not want $2 billion of support after five years to just fall straight off the edge of the cliff to zero support, and that is what the parliament is being asked to vote for at the moment.
It is an unreasonable proposition. The amendment is one that the government could accept, except that it is so pig-headed. It is the `was not made here' syndrome. Because the opposition is proposing it, the government is now saying, `You don't need anything about an inquiry. We might have one and we'll tell you about it at the time. The form of it will be one that we'll decide when we're good and ready.' If there is a change of government, there will be an inquiry and it will be public. What we want is the parliament to ensure that, whether there is a change of government or not, that inquiry takes place.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,22,1
"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—I appreciate the contribution from the member for Fraser. However, the amendment is unacceptable to the government. The automotive industry requires certainty, not further reviews. We had a full Industry Commission inquiry into the automotive industry in 1996-97 to enable the government to take early decisions about post-2000 arrangements. This was to provide the industry with a stable framework in which it could plan its future. The government has brought forward a package of legislation which fully articulates these post-2000 arrangements and provides policy certainty past 2005. This encompasses the 10 per cent tariff from 2005 and the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. These measures were 
 developed as an integrated package and are fully supported by industry.
The tariff reduction in 2005 is in line with Australia's commitment to trade liberalisation and is a tangible step towards our APEC goal by the year 2010. It is important that we give full effect to the government's tariff decision now to give the industry time to adjust to the new tariff environment. Not to do so would be irresponsible and consign the industry to a future of additional uncertainty. A further review of the industry which may result in a late change to these tariff settings is, as the member for Hindmarsh pointed out, simply nonsense. It should not be underestimated how costly and distractive a review would be for the industry. This is not something to be embarked upon lightly.
The tariff settings and ACIS are an integrated package of measures to provide transitional assistance to help the automotive industry achieve a self-sustaining future in a more liberalised trade environment. Any review of tariff settings would also put in question the associated assistance arrangements. The industry must have certainty that ACIS will run until the end of 2005 and will not be subject to mid-term review which could undermine the very investments which ACIS is designed to encourage. Notwithstanding this, ACIS, like all Commonwealth programs, will still be subject to periodic evaluation to assess its performance against stated objectives without the uncertainty generated by another full-scale review of the entire industry.
It is important to remember that the industry was fully consulted prior to the government announcement in June 1997 and the industry agreed with the post-2000 measures outlined in that announcement. The government has continued to consult extensively with the industry during the further development of these arrangements, and the industry has given its full support to this legislative package proceeding in its current form. The government has created the right environment for growth and for the car industry, which is dynamic, productive, optimistic and outward looking. These policy settings give industry the certainty that it needs to plan for its 
 future. It supports employment in this important sector and I repeat that it goes forward with the full support of industry. We do not need another review in the near term.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,22,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I was not proposing to speak again. I thought I had made all the points, but that contribution was amazing. I feel really sorry for the minister. I do not criticise her. I am sure someone advised her to say all those silly things, but they cannot be consistent with the conclusion that she came to or with the things the parliamentary secretary said previously. But let us not worry about that; let us just think about this question of certainty.
What the government is saying is, `We are going to have a review in the middle term privately, but that won't in any way involve any question of uncertainty. But, if you have it in public, it will create great uncertainty.' The amount of uncertainty is precisely the same. We are dealing with ACIS now. This is a bill about the transitional arrangements. Even if the government has the view which the minister outlined with regard to the tariff changes which relate to the next bill and the next package of amendments, none of that is in any way a rational argument against having a review of the transitional arrangements.
Of course everybody knows they will continue to 2005. That is what the bill says. That is what we are all voting for. It is a question of whether we review it before it finishes. After 2003 is when the uncertainty will begin to emerge because people know that the support scheme is going to finish in two years. They will want to know what is going to happen after that—that is, four years from now. When people say, `What's going to happen after 2005?' when people do not know what is going to happen in two years, that is called uncertainty. That is exactly what we are seeking to avoid. If this policy continues, the government will shamefacedly get up and say, `Yes, well, of course there's going to be an inquiry because we want to know what's going to happen after 2005,' but they just do not want to admit it.
To say that an inquiry before ACIS expires creates uncertainty flies in the face of the English language. It cannot conceivably be an 
 argument against this measure. There may be some other argument—I do not know what it is—but it cannot be that it is going to create uncertainty in people about the future of ACIS, because it is going to do the exact opposite. There may be a flaw in this amendment, but I do not see it. I am interested to hear the argument, but it cannot be the one that the minister just put, and I feel sorry for whoever gave her the advice to say such a silly thing.
Amendment negatived.
Bill agreed to.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,22,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—This legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999 , is essentially in two parts. The first part relates to the company law review, and various consequential anti-avoidance amendments to the tax laws were made as a result of major changes made to the Corporations Law by the Company Law Review Act 1998. Amongst other things, that act abolished the concept of par value for shares and the associated terms of share premium, as well as making it easier for companies to return capital to shareholders. What is known as the tainting rule prevents companies disguising a profit distribution as a tax preferred capital distribution from the share capital account by first transferring profits into that account and then distributing from it.
A similar rule applied to share premium accounts before their abolition on 1 July last year because of the Company Law Review Act. In cases where the share premium account contained amounts other than share premiums, or the tainted share premium accounts, the share premium account was also treated as a profit account for taxation purposes. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and associated tax laws to ensure that the share capital tainting provisions are not triggered in inappropriate cir 
 cumstances. Broadly speaking, this is achieved by ensuring that: first, the share capital account does not become tainted by the merger of tainted share premiums with share capital unless the share capital account ceases to be more than the total of the tainted share premium account immediately before the merger; second, all debt for equity swap arrangements which should qualify for the exception to the tainting rule do so; and, third, the delayed crediting of share capital to the share capital account does not trigger the share tainting rule.
These amendments restrict the original anti-avoidance provisions to their intended scope. In effect, they are cleaning up unintended consequences which could have arisen from the original provisions where non-tax avoidance transactions would have been unfairly caught by the anti-avoidance provisions. The amendments are backdated to 1 July 1998, which is when the review act changes commenced. In addition, technical amendments are proposed to ensure that a technical defect in the commencement provisions for the original anti-avoidance legislation is remedied so that it does apply from 1 July last year as intended. Labor is supportive of this proposal.
The second part of the legislation relates to managed investment schemes. In order to provide better investor protection and more efficient management and regulation of collective investment schemes, the parliament passed the Managed Investments Act 1998 to regulate the industry, and Labor was supportive of that happening. The Managed Investments Act allows for a two-year transitional period from 1 July 1998 during which certain collective investment schemes in existence on that date must change to the new structure. Schemes which commence after 1 July 1998 are required to operate under the new rules and are not eligible for relief.
In addition to the change in a scheme structure, the Managed Investments Act requires substantial amendment of a scheme's trust deed. Without specific provisions in the law, schemes restructuring under the Managed Investments Act to comply with the new single responsible entity structure will incur a capital gains tax liability on all of the 
 unrealised gains contained within their asset portfolios. In addition, other unintended and unfair taxation liabilities would arise. The combination of these makes it undesirable for entities to restructure into the single responsible entity form, and this is said to be frustrating the aim of the Managed Investments Act.
The measures proposed in the bill will grant taxation relief where schemes make the necessary structural and operational changes in order to comply with the Managed Investments Act, thereby avoiding unintended taxation consequences arising, provided that the scheme, as administered, is the same kind of entity immediately before and immediately after making the changes, that the changes are made during the transitional period between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 2000 and that the scheme is registered in accordance with the Managed Investments Act.
Relief will also be granted in respect of changes to a trust deed not strictly required by the Managed Investments Act providing that the relevant criteria are met and that, in comparing the situation before and immediately after the changes, the changes do not create shifts in value between members or classes of members, the market value of members rights is not reduced and there has been no change in the membership of the scheme. There is no revenue consequence for these amendments as they simply remove windfall gains that would otherwise accrue to the Commonwealth. Once again, Labor is supportive of this aspect of the legislation.
I do want, however, to make a number of observations about the way in which the second part—the managed investments section—of the legislation operates. I have had the benefit of correspondence from Kerrie Kelly, the National Director of the Trustee Corporations Association of Australia, who has pointed out in correspondence to the opposition a number of points concerning the scope of the capital gains tax relief provided in the bill, which I think are worth drawing to the attention of the House and to the attention of the government.
The Trustee Corporations Association have advised the opposition, as I am sure they have 
 advised the government, that the bill does not extend capital gains tax relief to wholly owned trusts of an entity that will be involved in transition under the provisions contained in the Managed Investments Act—for example, subtrusts of head property trusts. They point out that this will have significant implications for Australian investors in property trusts as it is common for property trusts to use wholly owned subtrusts for the ownership of properties.
They point out that many fund managers are taking the opportunity provided by the legislative requirement for affected schemes to transition to a managed investments structure to simplify outdated trustee structures and remove outmoded business practices. Should the bill not be amended then, either Australian investors will personally incur the capital gains tax liability on their investment or they will be denied the benefits that could be obtained from their scheme restructuring.
The Trustee Corporations Association also go on to propose changes to recognise the right of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to extend the transition date of particular schemes beyond 30 June 2000. They note that their tax advisers, KPMG, had written to the Assistant Treasurer on 10 June concerning this issue seeking those amendments. At the time they wrote to the opposition, they had not received a response to their letter to the Assistant Treasurer. It is their belief that those amendments are not controversial and will benefit Australian investors in property trusts.
A significant speech was also made by Kerrie Kelly to a conference held on the issue of single responsible entities at the end of May. It makes a number of points about the operation of the single responsible entity regime, in particular the need for some legislative change. Kerrie Kelly pointed out that:
Even before the MIA was passed by Parliament, almost a year ago, we knew that CGT relief legislation was essential to providing ordinary Australian investors with certainty that they would NOT incur CGT on their restructured property and equity managed investments.
She said:
How did the Government address investors' legitimate concerns? Nearly a year later, on 12th March 1999, Assistant Treasurer Senator Rod Kemp announced by Press Release his intention to grant tax relief to funds restructuring to comply with the MIA. Legislation by Press Release  clearly falls outside of Australia's legislative process! Draft legislation, finally appeared on 13th May, in the form of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999 .
And then she says:
And what a convoluted piece of drafting it is; although it is certainly better than the year-long vacuum that preceded it! The legislation also gives little comfort to those schemes that have head and sub-trusts—those of you involved with such scheme structures, particularly property trusts, need to carefully consider this legislation as it does not give CGT relief to the sub-trusts!
She said:
With the potential amounts of capital gains tax payable by ordinary Australian investors in schemes such as property trusts, legal and taxation advisors will rightly be concerned to give careful advice to fund managers, trustees and investors until such time as the Bill is passed  by the Commonwealth parliament.
The implementation of the relief legislation continues to cause my members real concern. Indeed some trustees and fund managers are saying that schemes may not be able to transition until the CGT relief legislation is actually passed .
She also pointed to stamp duty as another unresolved issue and noted:
When the MIA legislation was introduced, we were told that the States would legislate to exempt managed investments schemes.
As a result of some of the states not having yet taken action to do this, she said:
It is worth remembering that the failure of governments to efficiently resolve capital gains tax and stamp duty problems associated with the MIA's introduction have been the major reasons nominated by fund managers for not moving more quickly to comply with the new MIA regime.
Let me quote her again:
Whilst the Federal Government has worked at a snail's-pace with respect to taxation relief associated with the transition to the new managed investments regime, the regulator has not been proactive in posing and then answering relevant questions about keeping investors informed.
So there are a series of concerns which the Trustee Corporations Association has outlined, and Kerrie Kelly said:
To an undue extent, the rules are being made `as we go along'.
I hope the government, having the benefit of those observations, does take them into account as this legislation proceeds through the parliament. I now wish to move an amendment to the second reading in the following terms:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading,
the House notes that in relation to taxation policy:
(1)	 the government has not achieved real tax reform in Australia, it has merely agreed to introduce an unfair GST;
(2)	 the new Howard/Lees GST will involve a massive tax mix switch which will hurt ordinary families, which is directly contrary to the balloted policy of the Australian Democrats;
(3)	 that the Howard/Lees deal will actually increase the tax on food in Australia;
(4)	 that ordinary people will now face a GST on top of state indirect taxes on bank accounts;
(5)	 the GST will be an administrative nightmare for Australia's one and a half million small businesses; and
(6)	 that the amended tax package is still unfair and will also damage the environment"".
In speaking to the amendment, we have had the opportunity to canvass a significant number of the implications of the GST as this debate has proceeded through the parliament, but there are a number of areas that continue to come to light, particularly in the wake of the deal struck between the Democrats and the government, which I think warrant some further attention. It is certainly my intention and that of other speakers in this debate to flesh out some of those issues and flush out some issues that have not yet received adequate public scrutiny. For example, one of the claims of the government has been that no group will be worse off under the GST. They started out by saying, `Nobody would be worse off under the GST.'
—Who said that?
—Prime Minister John Howard said, `Nobody would be worse off under the GST.'
—He said, `Never, ever.'
—He said that too. I think we have been able to comprehensively demonstrate that he is wrong and, as a result, recently I have noticed the rhetoric changing to, `This will be good for the nation'—
—That is also wrong.
—Yes, that is wrong too. But it is now, `This will be good for the nation,' as opposed to, `This will be good for you.' Nevertheless, I have had some information provided to me by Mr Kevin Swann concerning the GST compensation for a particular category of superannuants. He raises the situation of a group of superannuants who will receive no compensation for the extra GST costs through the proposed change to the tax system. The people he is pointing to are the lower income levels of those who receive a pension from a taxed superannuation fund and who are therefore entitled to a tax rebate of 15 per cent. That arises from act No. 105 of 1989 section 26. As he points out, those with a higher superannuation income are not affected.
But those with an income under $21,000 with no dependants and those with an income under about $29,000 with a dependent spouse will receive no increased take-home pay whatsoever under the new tax scheme because the rebates that they are already entitled to are greater than the total tax. This means they have absolutely zero extra dollars to spend on the higher cost of living which will arise as a consequence of the GST.
Mr Swann has provided to me relevant tables showing that  a single person with a $21,000 income from such a superannuation pension is presently entitled to $3,105 in total rebates. They are liable to pay tax of $3,060 presently, and $2,590 under the government's proposed income tax arrangements. But in each case, the rebates they are entitled to exceed the amount of tax they would have to pay, so they are in a situation where they do not have to pay tax on that income and, as a result, they will be getting absolutely no extra income to compensate them for the extra costs that arise from the GST.
Similarly, we see exactly the same thing being put in place for a couple with a $29,000 income from a single superannuation pension. Looking at the rebates to which they are entitled, including their spouse rebate, those rebates total in the order of $5,712—once again exceeding the tax which would be payable under either the existing regime or that proposed by the government. Therefore, they get absolutely no compensation under the revised tax scales, no extra money with which to meet the extra costs that will come with the GST.
The other area I turn to and wish to spend some time on involves the long-term impact of a tax on books. I would point out to the House that the Australian book industry has issued a joint statement—and when we are talking about the Australian book industry we are talking about the Australian Society of Authors, the Australian Booksellers Association, the Australian Publishers Association and the Printing Industries Association of Australia—saying:
. . . while the Democrats are negotiating in good faith about a short-term `compensation' package, our concerns about the long-term impact of the proposed tax have not been addressed at all.
It continues:
The Australian public should not be comforted by talk of so-called compensation. Book prices will rise no matter what short-term initiatives are pursued. The Australian public should not be misled by claims that the majority of books are going to be cheaper. This is just not true. The majority of books are purchased by individuals who will pay more for those books.
The industry has called on the Democrats to rethink their support for the tax on books. It states:
The net benefit to government of $26.4 million is nothing compared with the money that will have to be spent offsetting the long-term impact of this tax in the community, across the education sector and in the book industry. The economic arguments just don't add up.
I have here correspondence from Senator Allison, an Australian Democrat senator for Victoria—
—For now.
—For the time being at least—from someone who has written 
 to her expressing concern about a GST on books. She says—and it may entertain the House to hear this:
We fought hard to gain an exemption from the GST on books and it was a major disappointment to us that the Government would not, in the end, agree.
It just makes you wonder who is calling the shots here. When the government is in the minority in the Senate but able to say, `We will not agree to the removal of the GST on books,' it makes you wonder who makes the decisions.
I have the benefit of the response from the educational publishers to the statements put out by the Democrats in defence of their position of support for the government's introduction of a GST on books. The points made by the educational publishers are as follows:
The effect of a manufacturing bounty on the retail price of books is likely to be significantly less than the 10% suggested. (The manufacturing component of an educational book is normally between 12% and 18% of the selling price.) The introduction of a bounty of 10% on the manufacturing cost would result in a retail price reduction of 2% at the most.
Eighty percent of educational books sold in Australia are locally originated. However, fewer than 20% of these books are printed in Australia. Because of this, the proposed reintroduction of the bounty will benefit fewer than 20% of educational titles.
The publishers also note:
Currently 41% of books are educational books. Fewer than 50% of these are purchased by educational institutions, which are eligible to claim a rebate on the GST. The majority of educational books are purchased by students and parents who will have to pay GST. Purchases by institutions will undoubtedly increase due to their favoured position compared with that of individual buyers. This will seriously reduce individual ownership of educational books and will result in fewer books being published and sold.
Individual buyers of educational books will not be able to claim back the GST. University students, TAFE students and parents of schools students will be paying 10% more than eligible institutions. Part of the $240 million package should be used to compensate individual buyers and to encourage personal ownership of text books and other educational resources. At the very least, institutions which onsell books to individual students should be GST exempt for these transactions. 

Let us turn to the comments made by the Democrats in defence of their position on a GST on books and make the following observations. They express disappointment that the government would not agree to taking the GST off books, but the real issue is: why did the Democrats agree to it? Firstly, the Democrats had no need to make this concession. After all, it is the government's task to bring forward legislation which accommodates the concerns of the electorate. The government had failed to gain a mandate to implement its own proposal; the Democrats, on the other hand, had a quite specific mandate whereby they had given the electorate clear commitments that they would not support a GST on books—and they were honour bound to keep those commitments.
Secondly, the Democrats said, `The government has given a three-year commitment to the book industry.' What on earth is the basis for the claim that the impact of the GST will last for only three years? Since when did these disincentives have a shelf life of just 36 months? Clearly, by providing this token assistance, the government and the Democrats are conceding that the GST will dampen demand for books. What guarantees can the Democrats provide that the subsidy will flow on to reduce book prices? What kinds of realistic enforcement procedures does Senator Allison envisage? Why should we believe that the proposed assistance will keep Australian made books at the current prices or slightly lower? What modelling have we seen to arrive at the figures which the government uses? What guarantee do we have that the government will honour its commitments in this regard beyond the current year let alone the life of a new parliament?
—None at all.
—Indeed, none at all. Thirdly, the Democrats claim that the price of Australian made books will fall relative to imported books. It is fascinating to ask: precisely when did this government become an advocate of protectionism and when can we expect this new policy to flow on to other endangered industries? If the government wants to impose a tariff on imported books, contrary to that commitment 
 it provides in other circumstances to level playing fields, it ought to do that openly and up front.
What entertains me is that, any time we have a debate about bounties and industry support of a general character, the government says that these things are absolutely of no benefit. Then it comes into the House and says, `We are going to look after the book industry and protect it from a GST by putting a bounty on it.' The same thing happens with the issue of price control. The government always comes into the House and says that price controls do not work, but when it comes to the GST it says, `We are going to give the ACCC extra powers to engage in price monitoring to make sure that there is no profiteering as a result of the GST.'
The Democrats also claim that the cost of overseas books will be contained by the removal of embedded wholesale taxes. What precisely are these taxes? Australian booksellers who import books pay the wholesale price direct to the overseas distributor. Who imposes or collects a tax on that—the US government? How would the impact of the 10 per cent be reduced unless someone somewhere rebated five per cent of the retail price to the bookseller?
Are the government and the Democrats seriously asking us to believe that some overseas taxing authority which currently levies an embedded wholesale tax of unspecified proportions is going to waive that tax because the Australian government has imposed one of its own? Clearly, that is nonsense. The realistic conclusion to draw from the agreement is that the government believes that there is significant revenue to be obtained from a GST on books. The Democrats made all manner of commitments about the fact that they would stand firm on these issues. As recently as 15 May, Senator Lees said:
The government knows exactly where we stand on food, on tourism, on books, health and education. It is all there in our report after the Senate committee was finished, and Mr Costello has my number.
Again, we find Senator Allison, as recently as 17 May, urging the government to replace the $2.5 billion of GST related cuts to diesel taxes for business with a cut to payroll tax. I 
 find it all fascinating, given the definitive nature of the Democrats' non-negotiable pre-election promises. Their policy on truth in political advertising states:
Australians deserve much better political advertising standards. The Australian Democrats believe that legislation is necessary to prevent false or misleading political advertising. This would help to restore trust in politicians and the political system.
Why Controls are needed over Political Advertising
.	 as elections are one of the key accountability mechanisms in our system of government, it is important that advertisements purporting to state `facts' are legally required to do so accurately;
.	 the private sector is already required by law not to engage in misleading or deceptive conduct by the Trade Practices Act , why should politicians be any different?
.	 the perception of politicians as being untrustworthy is one of the most serious threats to the legitimacy and integrity of our democracy.
That is certainly correct, but the Democrats have only added to that perception of politicians being untrustworthy by going to the election with all manner of undertakings concerning a GST and then engaging in a shabby and dishonest deal with the government in which they have comprehensively been stitched up and have come out very much the worse off.
We see that during the debate in the Senate the Democrats moved amendments in relation to education supplies, books, complementary medicine, disability services, therapeutic goods, private health insurance, spectacles, public health goods, credit unions, food, local government, inbound tourism, public transport, renewable energy and energy efficiency supplies, diesel fuel credits, fuel efficient vehicles, housing and renovations, charities—you name it, they moved an amendment to it. They then come back into the parliament and want to hold their heads up, having entered into a shabby deal as a result of which Australians will be worse off. Australians will remember only too well once the GST comes in just who it was that visited the GST on them and will respond accordingly at the ballot box next time. I urge the House to support the amendment.
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.
Debate (on motion by Mr Slipper) adjourned.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 7) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—It is with considerable pleasure that, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I welcome the arrival of the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  before the House. It represents for us a further step towards a goal that we on this side of the House have long cherished: an Australian republic. One of the people with whom I intend to discuss this bill—he is out of the country at the moment—is former Prime Minister Paul Keating. Whilst his political party had the republican issue on the agenda for a long time, he gave it legs and life with a vigorous and, ultimately, extremely well-informed and perspicacious advocacy not just of the fact of a republic but also of a structure for it.
At the outset, let me congratulate the government on conforming substantially to the recommendations of the 1998 Constitutional Convention and also for the presentation of these bills as exposure drafts for public comment. I have already addressed the issues of concern that Labor has with this bill in a letter to the Prime Minister after the exposure draft bill was released. I note that the views I expressed to him have not been picked up in the bill but I believe they can be adequately addressed in the context of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. Let me now state Labor's intention to cooperate with the government in producing the best possible bill. All of our suggestions should be taken in that spirit.
I want to mention the long title of the bill in a bit of detail here tonight because it is its 
 long title which will rest in the minds of average Australian electors as they contemplate their vote and ultimately cast it. Currently this reads:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with a President chosen by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.
That is a good title but it could be better. Our concern is that this title does not sufficiently capture the essence of the proposed alteration to the Constitution, namely, the replacement of the British monarch with an Australian citizen as our head of state. Nor does it, in our view, sufficiently describe the full process of selection of the new head of state. That process includes the public nomination procedure and the requirement for a special majority of a joint sitting of the parliament. These were important features of the compromise model recommended by the Constitutional Convention. We submit that a more appropriate title would be:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to provide for an Australian citizen chosen from nominations submitted by the people and approved by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament to replace the British monarch as Australia's head of state.
That is only slightly longer, but it is entirely descriptive of the process and its significance—the calling home of the Australian Constitution. We are constantly given reminders of how important that is—how important it is to bring our symbols in tune with our reality. If we ever needed any convincing of it, the High Court gave us another reason the other day, when it determined that the nation of origin of our head of state was in fact a foreign power. Many people can have arguments with the High Court's interpretation of that, but they set down with absolute clarity that the person that we call our head of state is not an Australian citizen and the relationship with the power of which she is both citizen and head of state is a relationship similar to that with any other of the nations from which Australians originate.
It is important that there is a proper reflection of that fact—that change in the title. It is also important to point out the role that the 
 people have in that process—the fact that they can make nominations for the position—and the fact that it has to be approved by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the Commonwealth parliament. We are going to have many important arguments during this referendum campaign. In many ways those arguments are going to be conducted at, if you like, a fairly elite level. I have absolute confidence that the Australian people know what they want in this regard: they want to change the arrangements for our head of state.
Arguments about dismissal procedures and about two-thirds or whatever are going to be dominating the airwaves, but will probably be of far less significance to the average voter than that fundamental underpinning sentiment which I believe is very much out there. Nevertheless, some will be influenced by that currency of debate, and it is important that they have the clearest possible view in their minds of what it is that they are voting on and what changes they mean.
The bill's long title—as I meant to say at the outset and it is the reason why I have been belabouring the point—is the wording of the actual referendum question. Our amendment is not enormously longer than the current long title. It is more faithful, however, to the Constitutional Convention's wishes and, as I said, more informative to the voters.
Our support for this bill springs from our longstanding ambition for an Australian republic. I said in my first major address of this year, the day before Australia Day, that this is the year for ambition in constitutional reform. I spoke then of what had been a century of confounding Australian constitutional conservatism. It strikes me as strange that a nation founded in such a flush of constitutional optimism at the turn of the century should have proved so reluctant in its first full century of nationhood to use the mechanisms for constitutional change born of that optimistic spirit.
We were the great democratic innovators of the 19th century. South Australia gave women the vote in 1894, also becoming the first parliament anywhere in the world to admit women as members and the only parliament to admit women as members on the vote of 
 people who did not think women should have the vote at all. The story of the franchise and ultimately the determination that women should be members of parliament in South Australia is a very interesting one. The initial proposition was for female suffrage but not for female membership. The anti-female suffrage members moved an amendment to add to female suffrage female membership. The consequence was that both were passed and their ambitions in that regard were frustrated. The National Party had early origins!
South Australia also pioneered the use of ballot papers printed with candidates' names and vacant boxes next to them in the 1858 Legislative Council election. The first elections anywhere in the world to be conducted by secret ballot were held for the Victorian Legislative Council in 1865. Those same elections also saw the first polling booths in the world designed for the purpose—by a Melbourne lawyer, Henry Chapman. Australia also pioneered the preferential voting system when Queensland introduced what they then called `contingent voting' in 1892.
Taken together, all this democratic and constitutional zeal last century paints a picture of an innovative, confident and rapidly evolving polity. Strange, then, that we should have been so conservative in the intervening century. The past century's record of Australian constitutional reform has indeed been well short of dazzling. This year's referendum on the republic will be the 43rd question put to the Australian people this century. Only eight have been successful. I pledge to this House again today, as I have before, that my Labor colleagues and I will lend the referendum's yes case all the energies we can muster. We also extend our hand to those of our colleagues on the other side of the parliament who support an Australian republic. I say to them that a successful referendum depends on their advocacy as much as, if not more than, it depends on ours.
But I do believe the gains will be considerable for us as a people if we pass it. Firstly, all our national symbols will be truly national. I was in an interesting debate recently before a forum that I would not normally appear before: the senior girls of the 
 Methodist Ladies College in the seat of Curtin—Ms Bishop's electorate—in Western Australia. My appearance there was occasioned by the fact that I was ambushed by their politics class at a play. They insisted that I should come along, and I agreed to speak to them about the republic. They also got the local member for Curtin to speak because they thought she would be a monarchist and, despite an equivocal first nine minutes, the last minute was with us. So she was unsatisfactory from that point of view.
The monarchists did not turn up at all, but the republicans did produce a chap. The folk were interested in the speech of the member for Curtin and my speech, but I have to say, in all honesty, there was a gradual decline in fascination. And then this republican spokesperson had a flash of genius. Obviously finding it hard to get his point across, he sought a practical example, and he said this, `It's just like this, you see. Supposing the senior girl, the school captain, of Methodist Ladies College, were not a student at Methodist Ladies College at all. Suppose she were the school captain of St Hilda's, down the road. Suppose she appeared every Monday morning at the gate of Methodist Ladies College, pinned a Methodist Ladies College badge on her shirt as she went in, otherwise attired in St Hilda's uniform, gave the assembly and left forthwith, taking her badge off as she went out the gate.' There was an audible gasp. The principal of Methodist Ladies College was impressed. She said, `That was the worst school you could have chosen as an example.'
We have a great deal more affection for the schools from which we originated, but the point is absolutely clear: at this stage of our historical progress how could we possibly say to the rest of the world that we have made an active choice that chose somebody from another nation to be our head of state? There are many penalties to be paid if we do not win in this referendum, which is another reason why we take this awesomely seriously. Not least would be the tabloids in London on the day after. You could guarantee `The Aussies cannot cut the paper. The Aussies cannot do it alone'. I am an attendee at these 
 cricket matches from time to time, and there is no group of barrackers I love more than the `Barmy Army'. But don't the Barmy Army take a waddy to us, take the mickey out of us, when they get up there and sing `God Save the Queen, she's your Queen too' and so on? Through the process there is total mockery of Australian national symbols as derivatives. It is always an interesting exercise for those who have to stand alongside them. They are the games that people play at sports, but they have a deeper symbolism for all of that.
For us to be in the situation where we have a Constitution `in continuation', if you like, is to a degree explicable both to ourselves and to the world around us. For us, 100 years on from the Federation of Australia, to make a determination to sustain somebody else other than an Australian as our head of state is unthinkable. The consequences of such an act—and I do not rule out the possibility; if this referendum succeeds there will have been eight successful referendums in 43—are not an encouraging start for this. I do not underestimate that difficulty, but I do think that, at the end of the day, the majority of our fellow Australians will see the impossibility of a no vote in this situation and the national humiliation involved. They will not feel good about themselves—they know that—if they wake up the next day and find that the situation is as it was before; only this time we, not the founders, would be responsible for it.
I also hope very much that if we get this referendum through—and I firmly believe we will, because there has been solid support for a long time now for an Australian head of state—there will be other benefits. We will start to use our Constitution properly. I have to say that I think, by accident, our political opponents have not hit on a bad mechanism with this Constitutional Convention. I am at the moment reading a book by Alan Clark on the history of the British Conservative Party, talking about Baldwin's approach to the difficulties of an argument between free trade and protection. It was suggested from opposition that perhaps they needed a referendum. As Alan Clark points out, a referendum is the solution sought by those in a political party who know that they cannot control the inter 
 nal debate but must say something, and that has been replicated on a number of occasions in British constitutional history.
For `referendum' in our case—which has, of course, a substantial constitutional meaning—read `Constitutional Convention'. The Constitutional Convention proved a useful body before which to put a series of problems to be nutted through by the delegates from a broader base than even this well and broadly based parliament can provide, to generate a fascination in the rest of the community with the things that they considered. A republic is interesting, but there are other issues that are interesting as well. We have gone for work-around after work-around on our Constitution; we have never done what the founders suggested, based on that experience of failure of referendums. We have had the latest example of that failure from attempting a work-around—the collapse recently of the cross-vesting of judicial authority between the Commonwealth and the states. That was disastrous. It was a very sensible outcome, well supported by all sides of Australian politics, but the High Court said, `Forget it.'
The High Court is getting increasingly interesting in its interpretations of the powers in the Constitution and increasingly unwilling to accept a pragmatic outcome. It did not accept a pragmatic outcome in relation to the question of the states' authority to raise certain excises. It did not accept a pragmatic outcome on cross-vesting. In a different context, it was prepared to overturn what had been the prevailing land tenure system in relation to native title without necessarily answering every question you could conceivably want it to answer on that subject.
We all may well have views about all of this, but it indicates that the High Court is saying to this parliament, `If you want to change the Constitution, you change it in the way the founders said you should change it. Don't try to impose on us one of your work-arounds which we find in some way inimical to a reasonable reading of various aspects of the Constitution.' When you actually sit down, read the Constitution and see so many dead-letter elements, so many impracticalities and so many features of it out of date in the 
 way in which Australia actually operates, there is a complete lack of representation of the actual structure of government contained in that Constitution. Unless we start to make this Constitution user-friendly, there are plenty of opportunities for interesting future interpretations by the High Court. There is only one way to make it user-friendly. The parliaments have to get to grips with how you structure a referendum debate to produce an outcome that allows us to be a mature nation in the handling of our own constitutional affairs.
As I said, I did not much like the way the Constitutional Convention was structured—and I still would not have the same sort of structure for a future Constitutional Convention—but the process itself is a good one to put issues before. Every few years, you could put before it, say, the proposition of the powers of the Senate or the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. These are issues which are critical to the long-term future of our nation and a decent government in this country. If we start down the road of this republic, I do believe that not only will we get ourselves a starting point in the Constitution of which we can be proud but every Australian child can aspire to be an Australian head of state. Every Australian child, no matter what their religious or cultural background, can aspire to become a head of state who is not under any constraint in regard to that.
I am an Anglican. I feel at least satisfied in the current constitutional arrangements in one aspect, and that is that there is an Anglican up there running the show. I have to concede that I am now in a decreasing minority as far as this community is concerned. Not even at that level can the majority of Australians see a representative character. And that has its own integrity and value, no matter whether you want to change another darn thing in the Constitution or not. But, if you do think that there are other things that ought to change, we may be starting to hit on a process that is effectively maturing in our constitutional arrangements. I talked about work-arounds legislatively; there are also work-arounds in voting terms. I talk about the Senate. Govern 
 ments—whether they are ours or those of our political opponents—rail constantly against the powers of the Senate and constantly their solution is to seek some way of rorting the vote to change that. Instead of rorting the vote, change the powers. That would be a far more sensible way of dealing with that particular problem.
There is one group in particular that I do want to appeal to tonight in regard to all of this—a group that I feel needs to look at this not as a static singular event in an unchanging Constitution but as part of a dynamic process. They are the ones who describe themselves effectively as the direct election republicans. I can understand their frustration with constitutional conservatism. I ask them only to consider: if they, in coalition with the monarchists, defeat this year's referendum where will we be?
Firstly, we will not be anywhere they want us to be. This is not an attack on these people. Probably a substantial portion of my party are direct election republicans. Maybe if you scratched all members of my party, most of them would be direct election republicans. I think you would find quite a lot would be of that persuasion. But what is the point of defeating this? Would that particular view be advanced by the defeat of this proposition? No, it would not be. The consequence of the defeat of this proposition would be, for the first week or two, massive national humiliation and, secondly, a marked reluctance on the part of political parties for some considerable time to place the issue again before the Australian people. There is a knowledge on the part of those who lead the political process that, if you are going to go much further than the minimal change model, you have to have a convention not only about the character and origins of the head of state but also effectively on the powers of the head of state and the relationship of the head of state to the parliamentary process. A considerable amount of detail would be required.
It may be that at the end of the day you decide to deprive that person of any powers and put them in the situation of the Irish President. But it would have to be said that that would be a substantial retreat from the 
 current powers of the Governor-General. That in itself would contain its own argument as to whether or not that was an intelligent political course to pursue. There would be no option but to engage. It would be virtually impossible to arrive at a direct election president with the conventions that will be in place under this constitutional arrangement. It would be impossible to arrive at that position. You would have to either advance the definition a considerable way towards entrenching substantial power in the hands of the president or retreat them a considerable way to eliminate all powers in the hands of the president.
So you would not arrive quickly at a conclusion for another referendum that would necessarily reflect the views of the direct election advocates. Furthermore, in moving over to that, you inarguably lose virtually all of the conservative side of politics. One or two take a slightly more opportunist view. Peter Reith can be relied on to disagree with Peter Costello. Peter Costello declared his hand too early. But the point, nevertheless, is that you would find very few on the conservative side of Australian politics who would support that. So you have a complexity of arguments—and the direct election republicans need to contemplate this—related to the powers, combined with confronting the most vigorous argument from the Right in Australian politics, broadly defined, about making any change at all while you did it. I have to tell you that there would be very few Labor Prime Ministers who would pull on that particular debate with any form of cheerfulness at all. Furthermore, the process which gives hope to all of those who want to have in place a capacity for constitutional debate and, therefore, change would also have been massively set back.
A much more intelligent approach from a direct electionist would be this—and I know it is the position that has been adopted by the state Labor leaders, most of whom turned very much to the direct election model; they thoroughly understand the political dynamic associated with this and they understand this—pass this, give the Australian people a user-friendly view of their Constitution, and 
 the Australian people will start to address those issues at more leisure out of a heated environment and may well start to arrive at the conclusions that they would want them to arrive at about how their president should be appointed. That is something, really, for them to contemplate.
There are very few people whom I know who are direct election advocates who are not also fascinated by the totality of the processes of constitutional change. They are interested in more than just electing presidents; they are interested in modernising the Australian Constitution. They must not take actions which make that process of constitutional change infinitely harder in this country. If we do not carry this referendum we may well render our polity comatose on the Constitution for yet another century. In many ways Australian democracy was frozen, set in aspic, at the end of the 19th century. You would have to ask the serious question today, given the record of our last 100 years as opposed to the 100 years prior to that: if the 100 years prior to our federation did not culminate in the Federation but in something else, would we now be federating today?
What would have been the consequences of that in 1939 or, more particularly, in 1941? Which states would have been neutral? Which nation would the United States and the other powers have responded to when we were under threat? Which state would have declared neutrality when it realised it was affected by those consequences? Could we, as 18 million people occupying this territory—as a people, as opposed to a nation—have continued with confidence to occupy this territory in the way in which we want it occupied into the next century if we had not federated? Probably that eventuality that I mentioned never would have occurred. We may not have survived in a structure that we can recognise now as the Australia that we know and love.
But we have to be prepared to modernise our Constitution. I do think that we are moving into an optimistic era. Australians do feel good about themselves. Australians in many ways have rendered themselves independent from political processes that they find 
 unfortunate, unacceptable. They are much more confident these days about themselves as a people—where they have come from; where they are going. The nature of politics at a new millennium and a new century often reflects that optimism. I do believe that people in this country are going to be reaching out for new things, for changes in our society over the course of the next year or two. They are going to be focusing on many interesting features both of our society and of its structures.
Those who want to put a complete agenda before the Australian people have to address all levels of what I believe is going to be a hunger for reform. This is a great starting point. I hope the government considers seriously the changes that we propose to their proposal, because they are put forward in the best spirit. I look forward to joining those of my Liberal and National Party compatriots who are republicans on the hustings over the course of the next few months.
Debate (on motion by Miss Jackie Kelly) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999  taken in isolation is not particularly remarkable. The two amendments it contains are consequential and provide minor amendments to existing legislation. The first deals with tainted share capital accounts. The amendments contained in the bill constitute concessions to ensure that share capital rules in the income tax law are not triggered in inappropriate circumstances. The changes to the Corporations Law that came into place in 1998 as an anti-avoidance measure dealt with tainted share capital. Under the existing law, tainted share capital legislation is aimed at preventing capital distributions being treated more concessionally than the distribution of profit. However, this law could in certain circumstances have unintended consequences.
The first amendment contained in this bill introduces concessions which will provide, firstly, that the share capital account does not automatically become tainted by the merger of tainted share premiums with share capital; secondly, that debt for equity swaps do not trigger the tainting rule; and, thirdly, that the delayed crediting of share capital to the share capital account does not trigger the tainting rule.
The second amendment involves a restructuring of management investment schemes in such a way as to provide eligibility for transitional tax relief for schemes which become registered under the Managed Investments Act 1998. You will remember that this act was introduced to clarify the division of responsibility between a scheme's management company and its trustee. This amendment will provide relief from any unintended consequences, particularly with respect to capital gains tax being paid on gains realised as part of the restructuring process. Specifically, relief will be given to funds which were in existence as trusts on 1 July 1998 so that they are not penalised by the tax consequences of complying with the Managed Investments Act. The amendment includes a number of provisions which ensure the original intention of the 1998 act are in fact achieved.
The two amendments which form this legislation simply deal with minor changes to the current legislation. On their own, they may not break new ground. However, and more significantly, they are part of a much broader package of measures already introduced by this government. These measures embody significant reforms to which this government is committed. This government is determined to pursue policies of reform which will bring benefits to all Australians. This approach stands in stark contrast to the no-policy, no-direction and no-hope approach of the opposition.
This legislation reflects three areas in which this commitment to reform is evident. Firstly, this government has vigorously pursued tax reform. Already, we have enacted policies on a number of fronts to remove tax minimisation opportunities formerly available to high wealth individuals. For example, the govern 
 ment has introduced measures to address dividends disguised as company loans, misuse of charitable trusts, the distribution of funds overseas, the problem of trading in trust losses, the creation of artificial capital losses, the franking credit trading and dividend streaming, tax minimisation through luxury car leases, to prevent the exploitation of infrastructure borrowings for tax avoidance purposes, to prevent the abuse of R&D syndication and the problem of taxation of foreign sourced income. It is important to remember that many of these tax avoidance measures existed throughout the 13 years of Labor and went unaddressed by Labor during that time. This government in three years has enacted a number of pieces of legislation to reduce, to restrict and to control these anti-avoidance measures.
Further, the historic tax reform package passed today in the Senate will address other flaws which the current tax law had allowed high wealth individuals to exploit. The legislation includes taxing trusts like companies from the 2000-01 income year under the proposed redesigned company tax arrangement and would prevent all taxpayers, including high wealth individuals, from accessing profit tax free from trusts. This is an important measure aimed at reducing tax minimisation. The legislation also includes measures to prevent tax avoidance by the use of foreign trusts. Not only does it address these areas of tax avoidance but it tackles many other problems in the current tax system. It dismantles the unworkable tax system which had plagued the country for decades.
The historic tax legislation passed today in the Senate delivers a number of benefits for Australian people. It delivers tax reform which will sweep aside the vast range of indirect taxes, particularly those burdensome to small business. It will sweep aside the range of wholesale sales tax ranging from rates of 12 per cent to 22 per cent and from 35 per cent up to 45 per cent. It is tax reform which will deliver $12 billion in income tax cuts to Australian workers. It is tax reform which will bring particular relief to low and middle income families. It is tax reform which will reduce the cost of exports by $4½ 
 billion and reduce business costs by $10 billion, thereby stimulating growth and generation of jobs. It is tax reform which will provide a guaranteed source of revenue for state governments to enable them to provide the essential services that they found so hard to provide. It is tax reform which restores real incentives for Australian workers.
It is important that the Australian people realise that Labor fought tooth and nail to block these reforms. Labor fought tooth and nail to hold on to an outdated, inefficient, unfair, inequitable job destroying taxation system. Fortunately for the people of Australia, today Labor has been defeated and from today that ramshackle, inefficient, unfair tax system will be swept aside.
The Labor amendment proposed by the member for Wills prior to the interruption of this debate is laughable. It simply illustrates that Labor cannot accept the fact that they were totally sidelined in this debate. They cannot accept the fact that they dealt themselves out of the debate. They cannot accept the fact that they have become irrelevant in this greatest reform of taxation this century in this country. They cannot accept the fact that again they have shown themselves to be negative, backward looking and lacking in policy directions. All they have shown is that they want to keep a system that imposes massive burdens through a hidden sales tax system and burdens that are totally unfair, inefficient and restrictive on business.
I was amused to hear the member for Wills having the hide, in introducing his amendment, to talk about the fact of no compensation. This was a tax system that under Labor was raised every time they had an opportunity with absolutely no compensation—no tax cuts, no compensation for lower and middle income earners, retirees and pensioners. And yet they secretly and surreptitiously went around raising sales tax rates wherever they could, for instance, rises across the board of two per cent in 1993—from 10 to 12 per cent, 20 to 22 per cent and 30 to 32 per cent—with no compensation.
The only possible purpose there can be for the amendment of the member for Wills is for them to hide their own embarrassment at the 
 fact that this legislation, which will deliver significant improvements to the Australian people, has passed through the Senate today without Labor having anything constructive to say or add to Australia's tax reform.
The second aspect of this government's commitment to reform, which I believe is illustrated with this taxation laws amendment bill with the two amendments it contains, is its desire to promote and encourage share ownership in Australia. This government is determined to see as many Australians as possible, directly or indirectly through partnership in managed trusts and managed investment schemes, to be part owners in Australia's business. Australia already has the second highest level of per capita share ownership in the world. This has obvious benefits for the individuals involved and obvious benefits for the nation as a whole.
It encourages people to save thereby helping to reverse our alarming low level of national savings and it encourages individuals to more effectively provide for their own retirement. It provides the opportunity for more people to share materially in Australia's growing wealth. It will provide more Australians with a sense of ownership in Australia's economic activity and Australia's future. It is sad to see that members opposite are opposed to seeing Australians becoming greater holders of shares, becoming greater sharers in Australia's business wealth. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has recently announced funding of a four-month study of share ownership in Australia which will hopefully lead to measures to further encourage share ownership in this country.
Thirdly, this amendment legislation illustrates this government's commitment to seizing the opportunities that exist for Australia to become a centre for global financial services. Australia has enormous potential in this area. We have many natural advantages. First, Australia has a democratic political system and a strong reliable legal framework which provides security and certainty for all players. Secondly, Australia has a sturdy regulatory environment which brings confidence to the financial sector and minimises destabilising fluctuations. This framework 
 provides ample but not excessive regulation thereby optimising the balance between protection and opportunity for service providers, for users and investors alike. This is a strong and timely contrast to the instability we have seen in our region, much of which was caused by the structural weaknesses in their financial system and their inadequate regulatory framework. Australia's strength in this regard must make Australia an immensely attractive proposition for financial services.
Thirdly, Australia's skilled work force covering a range of support professions—accountants, actuaries, settlement staff, brokers, investment advisers, et cetera—and covering a wide range of language skills provides a valuable resource which is not replicated anywhere else in this region. Fourthly, Australia has a number of other assets—reasonable costed office accommodation, state-of-the-art telecommunications, an ideal location in a time zone between Europe and North America and an appealing location for international executives to live. These clear, competitive advantages provide Australia with enormous potential. If properly exploited, the benefits will flow to export income generation, to job creation, to economic growth and to Australian living standards generally.
Already financial services employ some 350,000 employees and generate close to 15 per cent of GDP in this country. Even if growth of just two per cent can be achieved through seizing these opportunities, another estimated $8 billion per annum could be added to GDP and some 50,000 to 70,000 jobs created. Further, an equally exciting factor is the addition of another growth area to our export markets. The decline in terms of trade experienced by commodity producers in past decades and difficulties competing with low wage cost manufacturers have been softened by Australia's growth in service exports in past decades, notably in areas such as tourism and education. The export of financial services will allow for further diversification into another growth industry, allowing Australia to maximise the benefits by value adding with our high quality human skills and educated work force.
The coalition government is keen to capitalise on the opportunities to remove impediments to genuine investments. The coalition government is keen to create the right regulatory framework to encourage this growth industry. The coalition government is keen to provide a positive economic environment to see that these benefits materialise. This government has already done much to improve the framework for the financial sector. Some credit, I have to say, is due to the former government in their earlier years only when they did introduce some valuable structural reform. They occurred in those years before Labor lost interest in reform, in those years before Labor lost any commitment to sound economic management, in those years before Labor regressed into a policy coma from which they have not yet emerged.
In addition to the measures such as the Managed Investment Act, which does help by clarifying the lines of responsibility for investment managers and strengthening the managed investment sector, this government has undertaken a number of other significant measures to assist the financial services sector—the Wallis inquiry, a full inquiry into the financial sector with a number of worthwhile outcomes; the creation of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, one central financial prudential authority which increases  the efficiency, consistency and certainty of regulatory processes in this country; the extension of the Australian Securities Commission to now include consumer responsibility for financial services; and the creation of the payment system board.
Secondly, in what has been dubbed Wallis 2, the government has recently passed legislation to transfer regulatory responsibility for corporate governance and for prudential arrangements in relation to a number of non-bank financial intermediaries from state governments to the federal government. These include building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. This will again improve the consistency and reduce the duplication of prudential supervision.
Thirdly, the government has legislation in the Senate—the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 —which will significantly 
 encourage the development of a centre for global services in Australia by extending the offshore banking unit to include funds management and insurance, by abolishing interest withholding tax for government bonds, by increasing competition in the funds management sector by allowing US investment managers to compete with domestic funds, and by relieving some inappropriate thin capitalisation rules.
In another important step, the Prime Minister has recently announced the formation of a specialist task force with representatives from both the public and private sector to assist in the development of the centre for global financial services. This has been reinforced with an allocation of $7 million over the next two years to facilitate this process.
Even more recently, Australia has just been invited to join the Financial Stability Forum. This follows the announcement by the G7 heads of government at their recent economic summit that the Financial Stability Forum should be broadened to include significant financial centres—significant financial centres, that is, such as Australia. This move is a recognition of the significant contribution that Australia has made to international financial reform issues since the onset of the Asian financial crisis. It also reaffirms Australia's growing importance as a centre for global financial services.
In all, this government's policy initiatives to date show its commitment to seeing that Australia benefits by the full development of its potential. This legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7), while in itself only containing technical amendments, is part of this government's broader program of fiscal and financial reform. This government's program and commitment to fiscal and financial reform is a program which will increase growth, it is a program which will stimulate exports, it is a program which will generate jobs and it is a program which will improve living standards for all Australians.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 7) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I wish to speak to the Labor amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999 . Today is a black day for Australia, for today 
 the coalition government has conspired with the Democrats to pass through the Senate an unfair tax that will inflict a new burst of inequality on our once egalitarian society. I do not come to the debate simply as a loyal member of the parliamentary Labor Party, though I am that. I have been an active opponent of the GST for 14 years. Not long after gaining my PhD in economics from the Australian National University, I found myself locked in a battle against the GST. That was in 1985. I was economic adviser to then finance minister Senator Peter Walsh, and Treasurer Keating had proposed a GST for Australia.
Having studied a lot of taxation theory for my PhD, I questioned the economic merits of a GST. There is very little in economic theory that argues for a uniform rate of tax on all goods and services. Yes, economists argue for a taxation system that is neutral in its effects on consumption and investment, but a broadly based consumption tax is not a neutral tax. I could go on today about the theory of optimal taxation and explain why a GST is not an optimal tax, but this is not the occasion for economic theory. I simply point out that, if the GST were to be so good for the economy, why has Treasury been unwilling or unable to estimate the rise in living standards from the GST, the extra jobs, the extra growth, the improvement in the balance of payments and the increase in national savings from taxing consumption rather than income? The answer is because the economic impacts of the GST are at best negligible and at worst highly damaging.
I take the opportunity to commend Professor Peter Dixon of Monash University for the objectivity of his analysis of the GST which he correctly describes as job destroying. Professor Dixon has been able to identify the folly of a GST for Australia's long-term economic future. The GST will penalise Australia's modern labour-intensive export industries, tourism and education as long-term world prices are rising, and will reward our traditional export industries, mainly mining, whose long-term world prices are falling. The resulting adverse shift in our terms of trade will result in a reduction in average Australian 
 living standards, a remarkable achievement for the Prime Minister's great tax adventure and the Treasurer's new tax for a new century.
This analysis ignores the compliance costs associated with the GST which have been independently estimated at $1 billion a year, and that is before the compliance nightmare on main street agreed to by the government and Democrats is taken into account. Even the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Chris Murphy, under the most optimistic assumptions which include no compliance costs, has estimated the economic benefits of the GST at just 65c per person per week. These negligible benefits, not enough to run one university, would not materialise for six to 10 years. It is a pity that our other colleagues in the economics profession did not see it in their interests to go beyond chanting the GST mantra and examine rigorously the economic evidence against this tax, both theoretical and empirical.
But back to 1985. As a staffer in Peter Walsh's office, I worked on the GST with my thesis supervisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, who at that time was Bob Hawke's economic adviser. Ross was not in the GST cart, mainly because of its effects on wages and the economy at large. I also collaborated against the GST with Senator Peter Cook and another Labor staffer with whom I played volleyball, now Senator Stephen Conroy. I argued against the GST at public functions in Canberra. On one occasion at the Australian National University I argued against three young Treasury economists—Dr Ken Henry, Dr Martin Parkinson, who is now at the IMF, and Mr David Hudson, who is now my bother-in-law. I have since forgiven him.
At the July 1985 tax summit, the GST was defeated. Two functions were held that night. One was a wake hosted by Paul Keating for Treasury officials. I do not think I was invited. The other was a celebration hosted by ACOSS, who, God bless them in those days, were implacably opposed to a GST. I could not stay for the ACOSS celebration because I had to rush to Sydney to see my mother in hospital. She died that night.
Some 14 years later as a newly elected parliamentarian I was given the opportunity again of working to defeat the GST. When Senator Harradine said `I cannot', I thought we had saved Australia from the GST once and for all. But I had misjudged the capriciousness of those Democrats who were prepared to sacrifice the living standards of ordinary Australians for their place in the sun. I do, however, congratulate Senators Stott Despoja and Bartlett for their principled stand.
I want to spend the rest of my time today explaining why this is such a black day for the nation. Australia has become a much more unequal society over the last 30 years. Income distribution in Australia is now more unequal than in the United States, Britain, Germany, France and most other developed countries. Inequality would have been much worse had it not been for Bob Hawke's much maligned child poverty pledge. The family payments associated with that pledge have lifted thousands of children out of poverty, but the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. As Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter point out from their groundbreaking geographic analysis of unemployment:
. . . one half of Australia does not know how the other half lives . . . the poor are increasingly living together in one set of neighbourhoods and the rich in another set. The economic gap is widening.
Driving this widening inequality in Australia are the huge rewards from the information age to those who have the necessary skills to cash in on it and the huge penalties for those who do not. State schools in disadvantaged areas of suburban and regional Australia lack the resources to develop the literacy, numeracy and IT skills needed by students to compete for jobs in the information age. Thirty years ago, a young person leaving school at the age of 15 could obtain a trade and aspire to a reasonable standard of living. But in the information age of the new millennium, a child leaving school at 15 is likely to be condemned to a life of unemployment interspersed with casual, low-paid work. And yet, more than one-third of all students in government schools do not complete high school. That is more than 60,000 young Australians every year facing a high risk of unemployment in the information age.
A major review of active labour market programs was conducted for the OECD countries in 1998 by John Martin. He found dismal results of training programs for young people, pointing to the need for much earlier intervention at primary school and even preschool. The review states:
The evidence from Canadian and US evaluations suggest that the biggest payoffs for disadvantaged youths come from early interventions. This involves not only intensive efforts to boost their performance in primary and secondary schooling and reduce drop-out rates, it also reaches back to early childhood including the preschool period.
The limited empirical evidence that is available suggests that early childhood interventions of high quality can have lasting effects upon the employment and earnings prospects of disadvantaged children. It is also important to target support not only at the youngsters themselves but also their families and local communities. It cannot be over-emphasised that if young people leave the schooling system without qualifications and a good grounding in the 3Rs, it is well nigh impossible for labour market programs to overcome these handicaps later on.
In other words, if governments fail to fund adequately early intervention programs and basic literacy and numeracy in state primary schools, they will condemn more than 60,000 young Australians every year to a life of insecurity, low incomes and welfare dependency. And now, the parents of children attending those schools will have to bear additional costs of education. GST relief for private school fees will not be of any benefit to children attending state schools in disadvantaged areas. Parents of children in poorer neighbourhoods must pay GST on school uniforms, shoes, books, stationery and public transport. So too will parents of children living in affluent areas, but they will get the biggest cuts in personal income tax. That is why we need to be clear about the purpose of the government's plan to introduce a new $28 billion indirect tax.
Conservative governments do not introduce new taxes equivalent to five per cent of the nation's GDP because they support bigger government and increased social spending to promote equality of opportunity. This would be completely out of character for the Howard government, which has slashed $800 million 
 from education already. No, the GST is not designed to finance the social investments that will make Australia the land of equal opportunity in the next century. It is designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to shift Australia's taxation base towards indirect tax, allowing higher income earners to pay less tax overall. The conservatives and the Commonwealth Treasury hold the view that, in the information age, those equipped with the requisite skills are highly internationally mobile and that an important factor in their decisions as to where they will live and work is their marginal rate of income tax. The conservative argument is that, to retain and attract the highly skilled in the information age, the higher marginal rates of income tax must be reduced and the tax system shifted over to the taxation of consumption rather than income.
The conservative dream goes on to reduce the role of the federal government to a few national functions such as defence and foreign affairs. Education will become exclusively a state responsibility, with the Commonwealth forfeiting any role in ensuring the adequacy of funding for schools in disadvantaged areas. Along the way, election strategies for the conservatives can be based on offering cuts in the higher marginal rates of income tax. After all, Mr Howard went to the 1987 election promising big income tax cuts, but his disastrous double-counting error exposed the fact that he could not afford them. He went to the 1998 election promising huge personal income tax cuts for high income earners—up to $170 a week for top corporate executives. Don't believe the fallacy that the GST revenue, by going to the states, is not funding income tax cuts for high income earners. The same day the GST starts reaping its revenue, untied grants to the states will be abolished, saving the Commonwealth $18 billion a year. This, and raiding the surplus, is how the government is paying for its income tax cuts.
We on the Labor side support income tax cuts but do not agree with the government that the bulk of them should go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. After all, Labor adjusted the income tax scales seven times in 13 years, returning bracket creep to taxpayers. 
 Yet the present government has failed to adjust them even once. It now says that handing back the proceeds of bracket creep it has accumulated since coming to office is conditional upon the introduction of a GST. Labor delivered tax cuts without a GST; why can't the coalition? 
The truth is that the real Howard government agenda is to withdraw Commonwealth involvement in education, health and social services—and that requires a GST. The full extent of this agenda will become clear following the so-called transition period with the states. From that time onwards, it is open to a conservative federal government to begin cutting the tied grants to the states—the specific purpose payments. These are used to fund such basic services as literacy and numeracy programs, higher education, vocational training, public hospitals, anti-drug programs, disability services, support for homeless young people, public housing and suicide prevention programs. These programs cost the Commonwealth $17 billion a year.
Commonwealth officials made it quite clear to their state counterparts at the recent Premiers Conference that there were no guarantees about maintaining these tied grants beyond the transition period. Therefore, tied grants will be at the top of any Department of Finance and Administration hit list for spending cuts, and conservative governments would accept the department's advice. The argument in a coalition cabinet room would run something like this: `The states have the big new GST growth tax, so they can afford to provide these services from now on. We never get the political credit for these programs anyway, because state politicians always make the announcements.' A conservative government would seek these savings to fund further cuts in income tax at the top. Treasurer Costello said as much on 30 May on a television program when he said:
I would want that top rate—
which is 47c—
out to be multiples of average weekly earnings.
Meanwhile, the states will already have fully allocated their GST revenue. They will not have money sloshing around to fill the hole left by Commonwealth cuts to specific pur 
 pose payments. Then the pressure will come on to increase the GST rate or to remove the partial food exemption. This time there will not be extra compensation for low income earners and pensioners, which was precisely the New Zealand experience.
Over time, conservative governments will snip holes in the compensation safety net, allowing more and more disadvantaged people to fall through. Those who are vulnerable to any withdrawal of compensatory benefits will be left worse off. Already, under their most optimistic assumptions, Professors Warren and Harding, often quoted by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, find that self-funded retiree couples on about $20,000 a year will be worse off under the Howard-Lees package. This completely contradicts the often repeated claims of the government and Senator Lees that no-one will be worse off under their deal.
What of those who are supposed to be better off? A single person earning $20,000 would gain, at most, 94c a week. A couple just setting out with a combined income of $30,000 a year would get a maximum of $2.34 a week. These are the battling young Australians. These are the under 30s whom Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, said he would be championing, the generation Xers. So we have a couple, just married, earning a combined income of $30,000 a year getting a maximum of $2.34 a week.
This completely ignores the compliance costs for industry estimated at more than $1 billion, and of course industry will do its level best to pass those compliance costs on to consumers. Therefore, these estimates are a very real underestimate of the true impact of the tax package on low income earners. Let us look at age pensioners. They will get a couple of dollars a week, if they are lucky.
The tragedy of the GST is that it will accelerate Australia's journey along the path of inequality. As conservative governments seek election and re-election on the basis of promised further cuts in higher marginal rates of income tax, Commonwealth payments to the states for education and other vital services in disadvantaged areas will be pared away and Australia will lose forever the sense of a fair go—that egalitarian streak that had 
 been in us for the first 200 years of European settlement.
As the ardent supporters of the GST in the media and the corporate world line up for their big income tax cuts, they will not ask how the other half of Australians live because they have never known them. Their children will never sit next to theirs in school or compete with them for the very best jobs the nation can offer.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 7) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise in support of the amendment moved by the opposition to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999 . This is a historic week in the fiscal history of our Federation. It is historic because this week the parliament is about to pass into law the single most regressive set of changes to the nation's taxation system in our history. It is historic because never before in our history has Australian business had transferred to it so massive a compliance burden. It is equally historic because all this is happening without the government having advanced a single shred of evidence that their tax package will in any way advance our national economic welfare or in any way advance our national social welfare.
We are told instead to embark upon this national taxation odyssey on trust and trust alone. Those opposite call it reform; I call it regression. Those opposite have made the fundamental mistake of confusing change for reform. Change this certainly is but reform it certainly is not. It is change in the wrong direction. While the Howard government marches boldly back in the direction of the 1950s when the Europeans first introduced consumption taxes, the Europeans themselves today are trying desperately to rid themselves of this taxation millstone as they embark upon a new century.
It is very easy to mindlessly chant the mantra of economic reform. Those opposite now do it with almost religious fervour—if not religious fervour, then at least ideological fervour because the mainstream churches have abandoned them midstream and expressed their profound reservations about the taxation package before the nation.
—That's not true.
—At least most of them are chanting the mantra of the GST because there are still among them some political hardheads who know that this is not only of dubious value to the nation but also of political kamikaze value to themselves. All those government backbenchers out there in marginal seats donning their white headbands as they jump into the fray to defend that which is indefensible, to defend a tax which will create 1.5 million taxation agencies for the Australian Taxation Office from the ranks of Australian small business, and do so less than 12 months before the introduction of this tax on 1 July 2000.
Of course, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are telling the troops day in and day out in this place that all this is in the cause of reform. Have they ever taken the time to advance the case as to just how this economy is to be reformed by this new $33 billion tax? Have they ever taken the time to explain to the nation how much the economy will additionally grow by as a consequence of this tax? Have they taken the time to explain just how much employment will grow by as a consequence of this tax?
Have they taken any time to explain how much inflation will increase by as a consequence of this tax? Have they taken any time to explain just to what extent the existing revenue structure of the nation is somehow incapable of delivering adequate revenues for the future? Have they taken time to explain just how these measures will impact on the already substantial gap between rich and poor? No, they have taken no such time at all. They have failed to explain any of these things.
Why have they failed to do so? Because they know that this package will not result in additional growth in the economy. They know that it will not result in additional growth in employment. They know that it will only result in an increase in inflation. They know that there is no fundamental fault with the existing revenue system which cannot be fixed within existing structures. They know that, as a consequence of this, they will treble the compliance burden for Australian small business. They know what its consequences 
 will be for the future of Commonwealth-state relations. And they know fundamentally that this will result in an unfair system.
But if it is all these things, why would you want to do it? The same question was asked by Professor Dixon of the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University. He said, `If it delivers all these downsides, why would you wish to introduce it?' A very good question indeed.
I would posit that there are a number of reasons why you would do this. The first is that this whole strategy was conceived as a political distraction strategy; second, in its essence, this tax package is a wealth redistribution strategy; and, third, in the end, it became a political face-saving device for a Prime Minister and Treasurer who became hopelessly dug in.
Turning briefly to the first reason—that is, that it was all one huge political diversion strategy in the first place. Let us cast our minds back to the events of 1997. The government was in diabolical political trouble, with the issue of nursing homes being brought to this parliament's attention by the member for Jagajaga. That issue blew up in the government's face day by day. The introduction of unlimited up-front nursing home fees, including the requirement that seniors sell their own homes to pay for those up-front fees, reflected in a true way the bleak Dickensian view of human charity which so much characterises the social policies of this government.
The upshot? A government collapsing in the opinion polls and out of left field—or, should I say, out of right field?—what do we have charging in on the white charger? The GST, the perfect agenda shift. How we have all forgotten the Prime Minister's resounding proclamations going into the 1996 election that there would never, ever be a GST under his prime ministership. That was prior to the 1996 election. `We have learnt from the social experiment,' said the current Prime Minister, `from that great feral abacus, Dr Hewson, that a GST in fact is not good for the country, it is not good for the economy, it is not good for the society, and not on my nelly will we 
 ever have one.' That was good, honest John Howard at the time. How things changed.
The rest of course is history. Remember that the date on which this package was released to the nation was 13 August 1998, two weeks before the election was called. Yet those opposite have the audacity, almost on a daily basis in this place, to complain to those of us who occupy the opposition benches that 2½ years out from the next election we should be producing in detail our approach to tax policy and economic policy. I would simply ask those opposite to reflect upon the timing of their own pronouncements in the lead-up to the 1998 election. Their policy was just produced on the eve of that election, leaving barely any time at all for public scrutiny.
However, I would predict in the full sweep of history that this will prove to be the end of this government—just as, in international experience, the introduction of a tax of this nature proved to be the destruction of the Canadian conservatives, it provided the basis for fundamental political damage to the Japanese LDP and, in Australia at the last election, it reduced what was a record majority for the Howard government to shreds. Nineteen seats were lost out of the 25 needed for a change in government. It was the most appalling performance by a first-term government in the history of the Australian Federation.
We come to the second reason why we have this package before us tonight to pass into the law of the Commonwealth tomorrow and over the next several days. Having committed themselves to a political strategy which lost them such a large number of seats in the election, the government were then faced with their underlying rationale for this scheme they call reform. If we recall, no arguments had been advanced as to why this taxation scheme represented any net benefit to the nation. The economic case had not been made. The social welfare case had not been made. So what was its real rationale?
Its real rationale is that this tax, in its essence, is a wealth redistribution tax of massive proportions. It is a redistribution tax which takes the taxation burden in a direction 
 which advantages the rich and penalises those on low and middle incomes. This is not the Robin Hood tax; it is the Sheriff of Nottingham tax. It is an income transfer tax. It penalises low and middle income earners. It penalises pensioners. It penalises those on fixed incomes. It penalises small business through this monstrous compliance burden which is about to be imposed on them. But it rewards those at the top end of the income scale.
This tax rewards the traditional constituency of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is a fundamental assault on the doctrine of progressivity that has characterised the income taxation system of this country since the war, and it replaces that principle of progressivity with a simple and stark principle of regressivity.
At the heart of this proposal, we have at stake a debate about the future of the Australian nation. We have our past which has been characterised by a sense of fairness, an ethos which has governed this country for 1½ centuries, and its prospective replacement by a new ethos of unrestrained greed. We have the replacement of Henry Lawson as a national icon by a new icon called Gordon Gecko. We have a new, brutal view of the world that says that the only path to maximising national economic performance is one which maximises national economic inequality.
This brings us to the third reason. The government hit the solid brickwall represented by Senator Harradine before turning to that wobbly wave of marshmallow otherwise known as the Australian Democrats. ANTS mark 1, the first package, the first variant thereof, was dead in the water. How then to move to ANTS mark 2 without having egg, cake, chicken, lettuce and doughnuts spread all over your face? Answer: total amnesia.
Remember, we have already had one dose of amnesia in this debate when, just prior to the 1996 election, the Prime Minister stated that `never, ever, ever' would he ever introduce a consumption tax to this country. But now we have a second dose of amnesia, this one particularly characterised by the remarks of the Treasurer. Let us look at the robust policy consistency of the Treasurer on this 
 point—his courageous pursuit of principle, his unswerving dedication to good policy and not grubby compromise with lesser outcomes. Let us look at the Treasurer's statements of 12 May 1999 at the National Press Club, where he said:
Well look I've had numbers of meetings with the Democrats and I have tried to progress negotiations with them. [But] . . . their position is . . . a position which the Government cannot accept. That opens up $5 billion in the whole package.
That is $5 billion which then could not be delivered but which mysteriously overnight can be.
Let us go to the Treasurer's remarks of 21 April 1999, in his doorstop interview at Treasury Place in Melbourne, where he said:
You really want a tax system where we're employing people sticking thermometers into chickens to try and run a tax system—it's nightmare on Main Street. It is not real life. They've made it to try and sort of get some brownie points. It won't work.
Now apparently it does work, and the only thing that has changed is the fact that two or three months have gone by. Turning to more of the Treasurer's remarks, also of 21 April, he said:
. . . unlike the Democrat position which really is a recipe for, well, a nightmare. A small business nightmare . . . the government will stick to its position.
What was a nightmare just a couple of months ago apparently is a very pleasant dream today—at least in the Treasurer's reasoning.
Again, looking at more of the Treasurer's statements of 21 April, he said:
. . . if you exclude food and I think that costs 5 billion dollars. They're talking about another five billion dollars of compensation I think. Let me make this clear, to do that would be to put the budget in deficit, would be to risk Australia's prospects, it could put pressure on interest rates and the economic consequences of that for Australia would be very bad . . .
A prognosis of doom, it seems, barely two or three months ago—but one which apparently is entirely compatible with rational and proper economic management a few months later.
For a further episode in the record of consistency on the Treasurer's part on the 
 architecture of the tax package, we turn to his statements of 30 March 1999, where he said:
If you exclude food from GST, you are going to have tax inspectors running around trying to see whether the chocolate on a gingerbread man is bigger than the eyes, trying to determine whether it is food or a snack. You are going to have tax inspectors putting thermometers into pies to see whether they are fresh or takeaway.
Now it seems our beloved Treasurer is quite happy to dispense tens of thousands of thermometers, one to every officer of the Australian Taxation Office, to go out there and do their duty for queen, empire and the taxation collection system of the country.
We have the Treasurer's statements of 19 February this year, where he said:
Excluding food would lead to nightmare compliance costs and efficiency and simplicity losses—
compliance costs and efficiency and simplicity losses, it seems, which the Treasurer is now apparently happy to have the small businesses of this country bear.
Finally, there are his remarks of 19 August 1998. When asked the question, `Is there any circumstance in which you would consider exempting food from the GST?' his answer is an unequivocal no. The no of yesterday is the yes of today.
So which Peter Costello do we believe? Do we believe the Peter Costello of 19 August, the Peter Costello of 19 February, the Peter Costello of 30 March, the Peter Costello of 21 April, the Peter Costello of 12 May; or do we believe the Peter Costello that did the dirty deed with the Democrats? Do we believe the chameleon who struts and frets his hour upon the stage in question time in this place, or do we believe the Treasurer whose words are recorded in the documents I have referred to this evening? No wonder the public of this nation holds the political class of this nation in such fundamental contempt.
So what is it that brings us to this last sordid compromise that we will face in this House tomorrow and during the remainder of this week? It could be described as the ANTS mark 67 package, replete with Democrat pike and twist. This latest and final variant of the package is a double disaster. It has all the downside of ANTS mark 1, but now we also 
 have a total compliance nightmare for the 1.5 million small business taxation points that have been created under it.
If we look at the verdict which has been delivered on this package by Professor Dixon of the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University—and this is the most recent package agreed on with the Democrats—he says:
As with the original ANTS package, the Democrats' changes now being hastily adopted by the Government have not been subject to rigorous economic analysis. Preliminary work at the Centre of Policy Studies using the MONASH model suggests that these changes will not generate jobs in the long run and will leave a significant risk of employment reduction in the short run. Nor will they help Australia's service exports or improve the terms of trade. They are likely to increase compliance costs substantially. Even ignoring compliance costs, the MONASH results indicate that the Democrats' changes will reduce Australia's overall economic welfare by about 0.3 per cent (approximately $1 billion a year).
If this is the government's definition of policy success, I would hate to encounter what it would describe as a policy disaster.
We are, however, not just looking at the verdict of the academic economists. We are looking at the verdict of the Australian community as a whole, the people who jump on to their telephones and ring us in our electorate offices across the length and breadth of this nation to express to us their point of view about how this new package will impact on them. I have here a letter, just one of the many my office has received recently—as many other members would have received recently. This particular letter is from the Melbourne City Mission, and it describes in great detail the impact of the GST on charitable organisations such as Melbourne City Mission.
We have received letters also from the New South Wales P&C Association, concerning the impact of the GST on books. That association stated:
The compromise decision by the Federal Government and the Australian Democrats to place a GST on books jeopardises the literacy development of Australian children.
It went on to say:
It is quite obvious that neither the Government nor the Democrats looked at the issues surrounding 
 books in their recent compromise deal. There was no attention given to the impact on literacy, education or parents and their efforts to engender a love of reading in their children.
We have had in this place in the last couple of days the most extraordinary illustration of what I can only describe as an active act of policy fraudulence on the part of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Today in response to a question from the member for Bendigo about the impact of the GST on books, the Treasurer again implied that the impact would not be great at all. The reality is that there is a price gap today between the purchase of most books from your local bookstore and Internet purchases. The reason why Australians are buying more through the Internet is not because of some quixotic interest in electronic commerce but because it is cheaper. The imposition of this new tax will make it doubly cheaper to purchase items through the Internet, which will deliver a body blow to the Australian book industry. You do not have to be a Rhodes scholar to work that out. What we have had in this place is an entirely thespian performance by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth trying to convince us that that difference does not exist at all. He stands condemned by it.
This is a dark day in the history of the Federation; it is a dark day in the fiscal history of the Federation. In a decade's time we will look back and wonder why this country did it—why we imposed this burden on jobs, why we imposed the burden on pensioners and why we imposed this burden on the country at large.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-28,"—At the outset, I would like to thank all participants for their contributions to this second reading debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1999 . It is unfortunate that, owing to the wide definition of the title of the bill, every time a taxation laws amendment bill comes before the parliament we seem to reargue the question of whether Australia should have a new tax system as we approach the next millennium. Honourable members would recall that prior to the election last year the Prime Minister announced that, if the coali 
 tion government received a further mandate, we would bring about a new tax system as we approached the next millennium. He said that a new tax system would deliver real and genuine tax reform to Australian taxpayers which was in the national interest.
 Speaker after speaker from the Labor Party have risen in the chamber and indicated quite clearly that they have no plan and no regard for the national interest. They are all about criticising the fact that this government received a mandate from the Australian people. The tax package delivers a complete abolition of Labor's inefficient and outdated wholesale sales tax which sees an enormous number of items charged at varying and irrational rates. There are presently seven rates ranging from zero per cent through to 45 per cent, with 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent and 41 per cent on the way through. Examples of these goods include: household cleaning goods, toys, fruit juice, cordials and soft drinks being taxed at 12 per cent; CDs being taxed at 22 per cent; TVs and video cameras at 32 per cent—and so this irrational list goes on.
 The member for Griffith suggested there is nothing wrong with Australia's current tax system. It is very clear that the people of Australia voted for tax reform. They voted for a new tax system which, following the legislation's passage, will see basic food being GST free; 80 per cent of Australians paying no more than 30 per cent tax; and pensions, allowances and benefits increasing by four per cent. Pensioner compensation arrangements will be two per cent above the CPI. Labor put up taxes but never compensated those affected.
 We also know that the Labor Party promised time and time again that they were not going to sell government assets, yet they came into the parliament after an election and broke their promises. This government is seeking to implement the promises it gave to the Australian people prior to the last poll, yet we find that the Labor Party have done absolutely everything they can to frustrate the will of the Australian people as expressed in the election result of October last year.
 States and territories will receive all of the revenue from the GST. There will also be reductions in diesel fuel prices which will benefit the cost of transport throughout Australia. The list of benefits goes on. Many benefits are opposed by the Labor Party. That is why they are completely and totally irrelevant as far as this debate is concerned. They seek to criticise what they perceive as being anomalies. There will not be anomalies when the legislation is implemented because the legislation will be efficient. If Labor do claim there are anomalies, then the fact is they are responsible for frustrating the government's attempts to bring in the system as we originally announced it.
In summing up I would like to outline the two measures contained in this bill. The first of these measures will make a number of changes to the share capital account tainting rules of the income tax law to ensure that those rules are not triggered in inappropriate circumstances. These concessional amendments will provide that the share capital account does not automatically become tainted by the merger of tainted share premiums with share capital, debt for equity swaps do not trigger the tainting rule, and the delayed crediting of share capital to the share capital account does not trigger the tainting rule.
The second measure will provide tax relief from any unintended tax consequences arising on a managed investment scheme restructuring for the purposes of the Managed Investments Act 1998. That act makes important changes to the regulation of managed investment funds to ensure greater accountability of fund managers to investors. Under that act funds will be required to undergo some restructuring. The relief is provided as a practical measure because the underlying entity remains the same. These amendments are good news for the managed investment industry and their investors.
The member for Wills referred to tax on food in his contribution to this debate. Basic food, of course, will be GST free. The Labor Party likes to chant that tax is largely not on food at the moment. The simple fact of the matter is that many food items in the super 
 markets are subjected to tax and, in any event, the wholesale sales tax is embedded in all items—even those technically exempt from tax—through the cost of transportation, the cost of packaging, the cost of printing and so on. So the Labor Party is being quite hypocritical here.
Also in the Labor Party amendment, which the government opposes, it referred to the tax mix switch claim. The Labor Party is the party which has increased both direct and indirect taxes, so it is absolutely hypocritical coming into the chamber and criticising the government's reforms. The member for Wills also saw fit to criticise the time lag between the Managed Investments Act and the announcement of tax relief. Again, I want to clarify the situation for the record. The Assistant Treasurer issued a media release on 27 July 1998 stating that capital gains tax relief would be provided. There was extensive consultation with the investment bodies to see what further relief was required, and then the Assistant Treasurer issued a further press release on 12 March 1999 detailing the further relief proposed by this bill. So the government's response, far from being dilatory, has indeed been quite swift.
The member for Wills referred to the matter of stamp duty relief for the purposes of restructuring for the purposes of the Managed Investments Act. Anyone who understands our constitutional system in Australia will know that stamp duty is a matter for the states and territories. However, the Commonwealth is continuing to encourage the states and territories to keep to their commitments to ensure there is no stamp duty consequence as a result of a restructure required under the Managed Investments Act. Discussions with respect to this matter are continuing.
The member for Wills also made the most amazing suggestion that legislation by press release is contrary to Australia's legislative regime and traditions. It is obvious that, when a government has announced—and all governments have done it—that as from a certain date the law will be changed, this is not retrospectivity. This is giving notice to the people that as from a certain date the law will be altered. What this government has done is 
 quite reasonable and fair and no different from what has been the tradition in this country.
The member for Macquarie, however, made a most competent and capable contribution. He praised the government's achievements and reform credentials. I would recommend that those honourable members opposite read the speech of the member for Macquarie. He pointed out that we are achieving genuine tax reform and he referred to many other initiatives of the government.
Criticism has also been made of the government's environmental achievements. This government is the greenest government in Australia's history. We are spending an extra billion dollars for initiatives with respect to greenhouse gases and urban air quality. This government deserves the praise of the Australian people not only for the initiatives which we have brought in as a result of our tax plan but also because of what we have achieved through the Natural Heritage Trust, which sees well over $1 billion invested in Australia's largest environmental program in history. This government is determined to pass our environment on to future generations in a much better state than the state which we inherited when we took over government.
This is real and important legislation. It is sad that every time a bill in relation to taxation comes into the parliament the Labor Party proceeds with the same tired old arguments. It is about time that the Labor Party recognised that it has no tax plan, it has no tax policies and it has run out of ideas. Member after member over there continues to write books making suggestions to the Leader of the Opposition, who has now cancelled his overseas trip because he needs to consult with the Australian people. That is a real and meaningful acceptance by the opposition that they are out of touch. They have dealt themselves out of the equation on tax reform. This government stood up prior to the last election. We said what we were going to do. We received a mandate from the Australian people. I would ask the House to support the bills currently before the chamber.
Amendment negatived.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise tonight to speak about the very tragic and serious situation of women and girls in Afghanistan. Historically they have been discriminated against, but since 1992 their status has deteriorated rapidly. The situation has worsened significantly since the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 1996 and the implementation of severe social strictures. Women were immediately forbidden to work outside the home and were denied access to health and education. This is despite their involvement with the Taliban militia in fighting the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan. US Senator Barbara Boxer said to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee this year:
Today, under Taliban rule, women in Afghanistan cannot work outside the home, attend school, or even wear shoes that make a noise when they walk. They must wear a head-to-toe covering called a burga. Parents cannot teach their daughters to read, or take their little girls to male doctors. Women have been stoned to death, beaten, and otherwise abused for `breaking' these harsh laws.
She continued:
This intolerable treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan has continued despite repeated international requests that the Taliban restore their rights. We cannot in good conscience watch in silence what is happening in Afghanistan. Afghan women will continue to suffer at the hand of the Taliban unless the rest of the world presses for change.
Reports from within Afghanistan and from refugee camps in neighbouring Pakistan are alarming. I should just say that it is estimated that over a million people are living in these refugee camps in Pakistan. Many women and girls are suffering chronic depression and 
 anxiety. Some are managing to escape to neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, while others are choosing a more tragic and permanent form of escape in suicide. There are credible reports of women swallowing detergent or pesticide, or even setting fire to themselves. The USIA Washington File  said:
Womens and girls access to medical services and hospitals have been drastically reduced. Although they are allowed to receive emergency care in all Kabul hospitals and non emergency care in a few, women have died because male doctors were not allowed to treat them. Many of them suffered easily treatable ailments. The lack of ready access to medical facilities that do exist is further impacted by shortages of medicine and equipment.
Of course, if young girls are not allowed to learn to read, let alone study further, the next generation of women doctors is certainly in doubt. As well as the restriction on access to medical services, women's health is affected by the poverty enforced on them by loss of income. Tens of thousands of war widows are the sole providers in their families and, when they are not able to work, they are forced to beg to feed themselves and their children. Both widows and their children are suffering malnutrition and some have starved to death.
The Taliban has restricted education for girls, particularly in Kabul. Girls over eight years of age cannot attend formal schools and parents are forbidden to teach daughters to read at home. For some of the women who fled Afghanistan there was the possibility of continuing an education in refugee universities in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar. Unfortunately, in August 1998 the Pakistani government shut down these universities, alleging that they were operating illegally. These schools taught more than 1,000 female students in separate buildings. The Pakistani government claimed that the education offered was substandard and was business oriented. However, human rights activists  claim the closures were part of a joint campaign on the part of the Pakistani government and its Taliban allies to force the refugees to return to Afghanistan. Pakistan wants to access the lucrative trade route through Afghanistan to Central Asia and, as a result, human rights officials claim, the Taliban have virtually 
 been given a free hand to root out opposition within the refugee community.
I would like to conclude by saying that the United States government has condemned Taliban policies publicly. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, during her visit to a refugee camp in Pakistan, described the Taliban treatment of women as `despicable'. She said:
We are opposed to their approach to human rights, to their despicable treatment of women and children, and their lack of respect for human dignity, in a way more reminiscent of the past than the future.
I believe that we here in Australia and people throughout the international community cannot allow these terrible crimes against women and girls to continue with impunity. We must do everything within our power to stop what is happening to women in Afghanistan. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Afghanistan: Women and Girls</title>,Adjournment,28,1
