"Grace, Elizabeth, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—As a member of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, I wish to inform the House of the committee's review of the audit report No. 33 of 1996-97 on the administration of the Family Court of Australia. I particularly wish to comment on the effect that frequent review processes have on the delivery of services by the court.
It is a fact that the business of the Family Court of Australia directly impacts upon approximately 100,000 adults and about 150,000 children per year. The core of the court's business is processing applications for dissolution of marriage and the resolution of related matters, including property settlements 
 and custody of children. All of these issues are very personally sensitive ones for individuals involved and, largely because of this, the court's operations have been subject to unusually intense scrutiny in the 21 years of its existence.
Audit report No. 33 did not examine the legal functions of the court. To do so would be an infringement of the principle of the separation of powers of the executive, legislature and judiciary. The audit was confined to the examination of administrative matters, which nonetheless are a major element of the service provided by the court. It is right and proper that, in discharging our duty to provide good, open and transparent government, the operations of the Family Court are examined from time to time to assure the court's clientele and the general public that public funding spent in this area is used in a manner that maximises quality, efficiency and effectiveness of service provided by the court.
In general, the audit resulted in a number of recommendations for finetuning in a managerial sense. These recommendations related to corporate planning, performance measurement, decision making processes, organisational structure, internal procedures and information technology.
The House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs supports adoption of the recommendations. However, 
 I wish to draw attention to a concern expressed by the court's representatives which is shared by the committee. The large number of frequent investigations into the Family Court's operations has had the effect of diverting resources away from the court's key functions and compromising its ability to provide a high level of service. In the financial year 1996-97, the Family Court was subject to 18 internal and external reviews, excluding audit reviews. Although individual investigations may be well intentioned, such a high rate of review must raise a question of the cost benefits involved.
The benefits of reviews and audits are that some constructive recommendations can be made, such as those previously mentioned in respect of audit report No. 33 of 1996-97. But large numbers of specific inquiries, limited in their terms of reference, by their very nature take a less than wide-angled view of the overall picture. What can result is a situation where it becomes difficult to see the wood for the trees.
The House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has observed, for example, that an audit can fail to make due reference to major issues. It is these major issues that affect the ability of the court to fulfil its primary goal of producing desirable outcomes for clients. For example, the major issue of trialling integrated client services at the Parramatta Registry to limit the number of attendances of clients at court and the question of the most appropriate location of the primary dispute resolution services received only a brief acknowledgment in the audit process. The question then arises as to what is the most effective way of addressing both the routine procedural issues and the broader strategic direction to provide the highest standard of accountability for the functions of the court, and indeed other public institutions.
Devolving responsibility does not mean that the government's responsibility for control has to be subverted. Management is still accountable for decisions and actions, must submit to routine audit procedures and should not be immune to prudent inquiry. In addition to the questionable benefits of frequent review 
 procedures, there are considerable financial costs and significant costs to service provision when large amounts of time and human resources are diverted to satisfying each review process. Furthermore, the insecurity experienced by staff is not conducive to the efficient provision of the best quality service. It is the committee's view that a balance between accountability through bureaucratic intervention and autonomous operation has not been maintained in recent years. There has been an overworking of the former at the cost of the latter and the balance needs to be re-struck.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I am pleased to speak on the Auditor-General's audit report No. 33 of 1996-97 on the administration of the Family Court of Australia. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Grace), has mentioned, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee did some good work in its review of the Auditor-General's audit report No. 33, which is one of two arising from the inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court.
It is a matter of regret to me that there has been no report of this parliament which really looks at the issue of contact and brings forward recommendations that would provide satisfaction to both parents. I think that is a very glaring omission from this parliament.
I note that the chief executive of the Family Court has drawn attention to the number of inquiries into the Family Court, particularly its administration. Mr Glare deserves some commendation in that he has survived each and every inquiry, but I believe that, as the Family Court moves further away from the original principles established in family law some 20 years ago, we are going to see this constant call for inquiries. I have been involved in one of the inquiries but, unhappily, not the review of this audit. There was also an earlier parliamentary inquiry chaired by Senator Jim McKiernan.
Without disputing the good work done by the various committees, I do believe that we have lacked a clarity of focus about what really needs to be done to change it. The most glaring statistic has already been mentioned: 
 100,000 parents approach the court each year, and this involves 150,000 children. Therein lies the biggest problem associated with the Family Court, and that is that we actually need to remove people from the court process.
In the past I have spoken about a no-frills family tribunal, and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has talked about a commission of the family. In Western Australia, because it still has its own court, we have the opportunity to trial a new tribunal in family law matters which is based on the Guardianship Board, the Small Claims Tribunal and the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. The hallmarks of these tribunals are that they are in very modest accommodation, they do not purport to be courts and there is no legal representation. The overwhelming majority of matters can be brought before the tribunal and both parties can have an opportunity to agree on those things that they can agree on but have a decision arbitrated. Without such a tribunal, I do not think we are ever going to get very close to solving the issues surrounding contact that bedevil the family law area. The tribunals are accessible, low cost and can be very immediate. I think there is a lot of merit in looking at that.
In relation to counselling—and I know that the committee will be bringing down a report later on—one of the outstanding failures of the Family Court is the provision of reconciliation counselling, and this is in stark contrast to the New Zealand family court. In other words, it only provides counselling when the relationship or the marriage is dead. When you look at what the Commonwealth is spending on family law—something close to a quarter of a billion dollars—you see that we need to be spending money further up the relationship tree. There is no good in parents agreeing to seek counselling about their marriage or relationship and then having to wait three or four months before they can make the appointment. (Extension of time granted)
A real test of success in the family law area involves a couple of things, and I do not think that either political party has come to family law in recent times with particularly clean hands. We need to provide a tribunal that 
 people can go to so that justice and their rights are not only there in theory but also able to be exercised. The Brandy case presents some difficulties but, happily, Western Australia allows for at least a pilot scheme to be undertaken, and I would commend that to the Attorney-General.
I am very much in favour of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, but things like mediation are not always appropriate for every couple. I am certainly not seeking to abolish the court, but I do think we need to truncate its reach where it deals with those who want to slog it out with lots of money. Issues of sexual assault or domestic violence also need to be escalated into the Family Court very quickly. I am afraid for Mr Glare and the Family Court that while ever we fail to provide reasonable access to the court or mechanisms, there will be constant calls for inquiries.
Last but not least, I am a firm advocate of lifting the lid on Family Court hearings. Section 121 of the Family Law Act provides for the Family Court—unlike any other court in this land apart from the Children's Court—absolute secrecy. We need to take that away. After all, it only serves to protect the wealthy, the prominent and, dare I say, the politicians in this country. It has had a disastrous effect on  people's understanding of the court and its processes. I would urge all members of this House to support the removal of section 121, which requires that there be no publicity of Family Court proceedings.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—Once again I have listened very carefully to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has just resumed his seat, and his experience and wisdom in this area are not to be gainsaid. We need to listen to the voices of those who are questioning the role of the Family Court and the role that it is taking in society, given the extraordinarily large number of litigants who come before it every year and the effect of the Family Court's judgments upon those litigants.
There certainly is a need to open up the court. I believe that section 121 should be repealed. As I was thinking of making my remarks today, I was reminded of the decision 
 of Scott v. Scott in the House of Lords, which is the seminal decision on the fact that justice should be done in public. It is important, not only for the proper functioning of a court that it be done, but for the interests of justice. There should only be very exceptional circumstances before the doors are closed in relation to the administration of justice in any court. It is as well to recall the principles of the House of Lords in Scott v. Scott.
The constant inquiries that are referred to by my friend who has just resumed his seat and others really beg the question: why is it that we have these constant inquiries? I believe it is because the Family Court is seen my many litigants to have failed in many respects. I refer to the fact that, while there are some very good, experienced, competent and diligent judges, unfortunately there are some within the structure that leave litigants somewhat gasping for breath. My experience both in legal practice and subsequently as a member highlights that fact.
In my view, the court suffers from an inferiority complex. It lacks respect from the legal profession because it fails to properly respect itself. That is a real problem. I believe it arises from the cases that come before it where orders of the court are flagrantly breached and nothing happens to the person breaching those orders. I know from experience in the Supreme Court that a breach of Supreme Court orders is treated very seriously. People who breach those orders wilfully and flagrantly are dealt with severely, because the court must send a message to the community that its orders must be obeyed.
For example, take the case of Sid Brown: he had an order from the Family Court in relation to contact with his child. His ex-wife had previously been convicted of attempted abduction of the young child, who was four years of age, and had been given a bond. Recently, in total disregard of the orders of the court, Mrs Brown moved house and changed her child's school. She moved about 100 kilometres away without notifying Mr Brown. Of course, by this stage after many appearances in the court, Mr Brown's funds were totally exhausted. He made an application for contempt. He came before the judicial 
 registrar, who said, `There are a number of options. I could send her to gaol, fine her, put her on community service or on a bond. But most probably I will do nothing.' That sows the seeds of contempt for the court from the community when the court cannot uphold its own processes, and a court will not earn the respect of the community until it does.
The same thing occurs when there are delays in the court with judgments. In the same case Mr Brown had to wait eight months and 20 days to get a judgment in a custody hearing a couple of years ago. This was in relation to a young child, and it is scandalous. (Extension of time granted) That particular case involved a very young child and custody and the whole situation changed in that eight months. In fact, the application for custody was made two years prior to the judgment being given. When it comes to questions of status quo, how could you possibly say that Mr Brown had a fair hearing in that case?
A constituent of mine, Mrs Meech, was defrauded on a property settlement and similarly had to wait six months after many letters to the particular judge, Mr Justice Underhill. He has now retired and the legal profession will not mourn his passing. He took six months to deliver a decision in relation to a case where assets were dissipated. The end result was that Mrs Meech, whose funds were likewise exhausted, ultimately lodged an appeal and a settlement was reached.
There can be no respect for a system that accepts these sorts of delays. Why are there delays? Are there delays because allegations are made to the court and the courts are tied up in cases that really should not be there? As my friend the member for Chifley said, there are matters that should not be in the court; they should be somewhere else.
There also has to be some combined disincentive for some people to make false allegations in relation to child abuse. Time and time again—and in the profession they call it the atomic bomb—the allegation of child abuse is made and immediately all rights of the father to see the child are suspended and the system is tied up. In the case of Garry 
 Parmenter, he has not seen his son for something approaching two years. The allegations have been found to be untrue and unsubstantiated, yet the system is still tied up investigating all this material. In this case there has been a suggestion by an expert of parroting in relation to the child, and the person making the allegation will just walk out of the court and there will be no disincentive.
Indeed, the great playwright and barrister John Mortimer in a book, an autobiographical work, that he wrote not too many years ago said that, when he was practising in the family jurisdiction in the sixties and seventies, in contested divorce applications every conceivable allegation would be made from leaving a ring around the bath to leaving dirty socks lying around—all those sorts of things—but you would never hear an allegation of child abuse when, had it been present, it would have been a very, very serious allegation. But so often now it is the first allegation. It is used frequently as a weapon to cause problems for fathers who are trying to get access to their children.
Consequently, the whole system which we are talking about with this audit report, is bogged down by the making of what are so often unsubstantiated and outrageous allegations. What happens in the system is that all of the litigants suffer because of it.
Really, we have to start there. And I believe that we have to bring the public into the situation not only as a spectator in the back of the court, but also, I firmly believe, in juries. I firmly believe that the jury process is the one that gets the public into the court, into the process. Believe you me, the criminal jury is one area of law that we have not changed; over hundreds of years of experience, that system is still there. And yet more and more the civil courts have moved away from it.
I ask this question: should we really start thinking about bringing the public back into it, getting these decisions on custody—rather than in eight months—in a few days, the time in which a jury would give them? Let us get commonsense into it, as opposed to all of the experts who are profiting and the huge costs to litigants in these matter.
Overall, we have to look to the background of these things. But also we have to be sensible about the way we approach the administration of justice. We also have to be forward looking and not be bogged down in the past with any pre-existing and preconceived ideas. We need to change this system: it needs to be made much more user friendly, and litigants need to get justice. I believe that in many cases now they are not getting justice.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 condemns the failure of the Treasurer to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor bank fees and charges;
(2)	 condemns the Treasurer for permitting the banks to massively increase fees and charges for battlers and pensioner bank customers; 

(3)	 regrets that the Treasurer has allowed the banks to abandon affordable banking for battlers and pensioners in favour of maintaining or increasing bank profits; and
(4)	 notes with regret the Treasurer's priority of encouraging billion dollar profits for the banks and multi-million dollar salaries for banking executives at the expense of the ordinary customers of the banks.
The first thing I wanted to point out to the House is that the banks are a key institution in our society, if not an essential institution. I cannot think of any person who can survive very well without using the services of a bank. I have always thought that the prime purpose of banks—the most important one, not one that they share exclusively on their own—is to husband the nation's savings. We have heard a lot in this House about the importance of increasing national  savings, both private national savings and, of course, public national savings.
No-one can go and set up a bank; they need to obtain a banking licence. I think we need to ask ourselves, setting aside the prudential and fiduciary responsibilities of the banks, `What comes with that banking licence?'. There is no such requirement in the legislation for what we might call community service obligations. Are there a minimum number of branches that are required to be maintained? Do banks need to reach out to every nook and cranny throughout the Commonwealth? I note that the Parliamentary Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration is looking at the reach of banks in rural and regional Australia. I welcome that, and I look forward to its report. There is also an issue about the urban poor and the reach there. I hope that the committee will not be deflected from giving some attention to those people.
I suppose one might ask: are banks such a poor financial proposition that it is grossly unfair for members of the House to talk about issues such as community service obligations? I will give a few figures on bank profitability. In 1993 the ANZ Bank made $247 million, while in 1997 it made $1.02 billion. In 1993 the Commonwealth Bank made $443 million, while in  1997 it made $1.08 billion. In 1993 NAB made $1.13 billion, while in 1997 it 
 made $2.2 billion. In 1993 Westpac made $39 million and $1.29 billion in 1997. In other words, banks are amongst some of the profitable, if not the most profitable, undertakings in this Commonwealth. I do not have a particular objection to that if they are meeting their customers' requirements. I do not think that is the case.
When we were in government in 1994 we instituted a PSA inquiry into the fees and charges that banks were levelling, particularly for pensioners and their poorer customers. I think it is an absolute matter of regret, if not shame, that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, refuses to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake a 1998 inquiry. In other words, the Treasurer is quite satisfied with the way the banks are operating, particularly in relation to pensioners and ordinary customers—particularly the poorer customers.
If a pensioner wants to avoid using a bank, we require them to use a bank. We insist that their social security benefit cheque be placed into a bank. I am sure honourable members will recall a series of negotiations where all workers were required to give up cash being paid out to them on payday and have that money put into a bank. In other words, people do not have freedom of choice in terms of receiving cash or a cheque in the mail. It has to be put into a bank.
What is happening with fees and charges? There are some very good examples. I am indebted to Choice magazine for giving them to me. A customer with a medium use of their bank account who keeps a low balance will lose between $49 per year and as much as $130 per year. We have to bear in mind that these are the people who can least afford to meet these charges. In comparison, a person with a medium balance and a high use will only lose between $6 and $25 per year, while the person who holds a high bank balance with a medium use would earn, not lose, $95 to $235 per year. Where is the equity in all that?
It is not as if we have a range of consumer protection at work or an intense level of competition. How often have members of parliament heard those words `competition 
 solves everything'? In fact, in this industry it does not. Although the banks are complaining bitterly about the inroads, for example, that Aussie Home Loans and RAMS are making into their housing market, they still operate with some of the highest profits not just of corporations but by worldwide standards.
The margins are very high. But this government has allowed banks to increase their fees in a way ordinary people and pensioners cannot retaliate against. It is not a question of shopping around, because by and large they all charge the same exorbitant fees. If you are a pensioner you are not going to be better off by shopping around with banks. If you are a worker with a low deposit you are not going to be better off shopping around the banks because you are not going to do any good.
People might say, `Well, we have the Banking Ombudsman scheme.' Indeed, it is pleasing to see that we do have the Banking Ombudsman scheme. In the last year he has suffered a 30 per cent increase in complaints, but the ombudsman cannot rule on the level of fees and charges. He can rule as to whether they have been appropriately placed or made, but he cannot rule as to whether they are too high.
I say that what we need to do is to stop having the banks pay, as the ANZ does to its recently recruited chief executive, $2 million a year in annual salary plus options. I think we need to say that when banks get a licence it is a licence to print money, that there are obligations over and above good corporate citizenship, that the market place has failed to protect ordinary workers and pensioners and that we need to do something about it.
The National Farmers Federation is much in the news. Apparently, they have a multi-million dollar fighting fund. Let me say to the House: I am disappointed that not once has the National Farmers Federation approached me or any of my colleagues to see why we cannot have a bank farm debt mediation bill, which has been successfully operating, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, in your state and my state for some time. They will not spend one of those National Farmers Federation dollars to save one farmer being thrown out of his farm. 
I have never been approached by the National Farmers Federation saying, `We're concerned about how rural and regional Australia is losing its banking infrastructure.' It seems to me that if you want to be a successful bank you do what ANZ has done—say to 1,700 workers, `Goodbye. We'll close a few more branches and we'll increase our bottom line.' Their bottom line, again, was $1.02 billion in 1997. Are they going to better that in 1998? Is the Commonwealth, NAB or Westpac going to better it by declining to provide services to people and by failing to have charges that ordinary people can cope with? (Time expired)

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—I must admit that while listening to the member for Chifley (Mr Price) the more I heard the more confused I became because I really could not understand what he was speaking about. He has a motion before the House and he started off by saying, `I believe banks are an essential service,' or something close to it. After he said he understood why banks had to make profits, he then turned around and complained bitterly about the fact that they do make profits and spent most of his speech attacking the banks. Yet in his opening remarks he tried to have two bob each way and said, `I'm not really going to attack them; they're really not bad people, but . . . '.
I do not have any brief with the banks, but I do find that whole approach very confusing. His suggestion seemed to be, as far as I could understand it, that we should have another inquiry. He talked about the inquiry when Labor was in power, yet we did not see a hell of a lot happen with that. You will remember when Mr Willis said back in 1995, `I'll direct the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor' and so on. We have been through all  that.
If you want to talk about inquiries, I think one of the most successful inquiries that has been held in recent years, which parallels some that were held in earlier years, is the Wallis inquiry into financial systems. That 
 was one that was initiated by the current Treasurer (Mr Costello), whom I think the member for Chifley wanted to attack in his motion but did not mention much of during his speech. What that was all about was how we do in fact introduce competition. I have to say to my friend the member for Chifley: competition is working because, as you rightly pointed out, home mortgage rates have come down far more than official interest rates have come down. That is because competition has provided a much better, more efficient service to consumers. The consumers have been the winners. That is exactly what has come out of it.
If we look at some of his other comments, he said that we have to use a bank. Credit unions are also offering a very good service, and a lot of people are turning to credit unions because, under this government, we have allowed credit unions to issue cheques in their own right, which allows them to expand the range of services they are offering. This ensures that people do get an alternative, a choice. That is what competition is, my friend. That is giving people a real choice.
When I look at the whole motion that has been put, I think it has breathtaking hypocrisy. After 13 years in government, having not addressed any of these issues, he comes into this parliament and starts crying about it as though we do not already have monitoring going on. We know already that the ACCC and the Reserve Bank are monitoring the charges in bank fees. We already know that if there is any anti-competitive measures going on between the banks the ACCC can investigate that. It is already there.
We have to give full marks to the Treasurer and to the government, because by increasing competition we have ensured that consumers have benefited. I have mentioned already what is happening with the home mortgage rates. I wonder why he has not fully noticed all that. I think you also have to notice that, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry, we are going to see further competition introduced. As Wallis has pointed out in his report, Australia's financial systems are about mid-range in world terms and there are effectively savings 
 of around 10 per cent of the full cost of operating our financial systems—savings of around $4 billion a year that can be had if we go down the path of opening up the system to further competition. I think the member has to remember that, by bringing in that competition, the government is benefiting consumers. We are already seeing some of the technological innovations—like EFTPOS, phone banking and ATMs—also cutting costs.
I do not carry any brief for the banks. I think at times they have done some remarkably silly things, and I have said so publicly as recently as last week. Today 3AW reported what I would call another silly little move: a bank in East Kew in Melbourne is now charging non-account customers to get notes changed into 20-cent coins or whatever to pay for a telephone call or put in a parking meter. I must admit that, when I hear those sorts of stories, I think the banks cannot help themselves sometimes.
I was equally horrified when the Australian Bankers Association chose to publicise some fairly useful material when making a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, which I chair. I believe the deputy, the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), will be speaking shortly. The Bankers Association chose to present this information at Penshurst about three days after the National Bank had announced it would close its branch there. I thought that was unbelievable timing, but such is the way some banks do operate.
What horrified me even more was that, in relation to another branch that was being closed at the same time at Macarthur, just south of Hamilton, it has been revealed that the Moyne Shire Council had a contract with the National Bank after tendering for banking services. Part of that contract said quite clearly that the services would continue to be provided in, amongst other places, Macarthur. That shows quite clearly that the banks really do not understand what it is to provide a reasonable service to customers.
I would like to expand a bit on some of the work the committee is doing. I think it is undertaking a very worthwhile role. I see 
 another committee member has come into the chamber. I think all members realise that we will do some very good work in looking for alternative ways of providing banking services in regional and remote Australia. We want to see how we can ensure that people who cannot use or access some of the new technologies can still access some of what we would call the more traditional services that people in larger centres take for granted.
In this vein, the committee was most heartened last week to hear, in a meeting with the ANZ Bank, its new CEO, Mr John McFarlane, take on the concerns of the committee and come up with a very positive approach. He pointed out that he accepts that the market will not solve on its own the problem of providing services in regional and remote areas. He is prepared to look at innovative solutions that would include cooperating with the government and other financial institutions, which I think is a very significant statement. He also put forward a very positive attitude in getting involved on a national scale with GiroPost. I think the committee understood that would include addressing some of the difficulties the banks have had in the past where they may have been cooperating with GiroPost in competition with one of their own branches.
Mr McFarlane also showed that he is keen to help develop an environment that will help the committee address its inquiry terms of reference that look beyond the concerns of each major bank. Most importantly, he suggested we can address the needs of the community by having the major banks collectively trying to work towards solutions. To hear all that is a big breakthrough. Mr McFarlane went on to talk about his own experiences in Scotland with mobile banking. I think all members of the committee were very impressed with what they heard that day. I call on the CEOs of the other major banks to take up that challenge and join the committee in working towards seeing whether we can find ways of solving some of these problems facing regional Australia and probably some suburban areas too.
In conclusion, while the mover of this motion can criticise the banks certainly in 
 some areas, I think parts of that competition cannot be taken in isolation as the overall positive effects of competition have benefited the community greatly. Consumers have been the big winners. Instead of condemning the Treasurer with this miserable motion, its mover should be praising the Treasurer for providing a more competitive environment, for bringing about much lower home mortgages and lower overall banking costs and, importantly, allowing new players into the game, which will further benefit consumers in an area that we all know is vital and essential in everyday lives.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Banking</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—As much as it was a privilege for me to second this motion submitted by the member for Chifley (Mr Price), I am equally and obviously a bit disturbed by some of the comments made by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who, whilst he has done a fair and decent job as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I think on this occasion has made comments which serve no greater role than as the banks' official apologist.
I challenge the member for Wannon to circulate the speech he just made to parts of his own world—in Timboon, Simpson or Macarthur—where banks have closed and monitor the response of his constituents. They might agree that in many areas the committee which he chairs, and which I have the honour to also be a member of, has done some good work but I think we would have done much better work had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) thrown the committee more than a few crumbs as a result of the Wallis inquiry.
The member for Wannon cites the Wallis inquiry as being a major inquiry into bank activity, but he fails to mention that no consumer protection at all is cited within the outcome of the Wallis inquiry. If Mr Costello does, as I am sure he has already done, accept the Wallis report and recommendation that government keep out of fees and charges, he will—and he already has effectively—be telling banks to go for their lives. Those banks have already been jacking up their fees to make up for the money that they are losing 
 on their housing margins when faced with competition from the new home lenders. They have now been given the green light to push those fees and charges even further.
The member for Wannon knows that these regressive bank fees and charges should be the subject of government scrutiny and government control. But, under this government, these rising fees and charges have just been ignored. In fact the Treasurer has given a green light to banks charging more and more for basic services. Your average Australian is being charged a substantial amount of money for what is a basic need. This government has indeed turned its back on the battlers. Two years ago today it promised to govern for all Australians.
Under Labor the banks were pressured into providing a no-frills account where over the counter transactions were free. This helped people on low incomes such as pensioners and students. But banks of course are again putting up these charges. Choice magazine, in an often quoted article from March 1997, stated:
Banks are systematically raising existing fees and charges. They're also coming up with new charges that hit every aspect of your transactions. And they're making some fees harder to avoid. The fees and charges are also confusing, as each financial institution has its own particular combination, making comparison very difficult.
This article is from a year ago, yet fees and charges in this regard continue to rise. The people hit hardest are those on lower incomes. The facts and figures cited by the member for Chifley are worth repeating. He said that that same Choice  article found that a low bank account balance, usually under $500, would attract bank fees from anywhere between $49 and a staggering $139. Mr Costello tells us that competition under these Wallis reforms will lead to lower bank charges and fees. But there has been no evidence of this. There has been no evidence of this in my part of the world. There has been no evidence of this in Horsham or Hamilton. There has been no evidence of this anywhere. Low income people are still paying far too much for a service that they cannot afford to be without.
—It's regressive.
—Competition is not going to fix that problem. It is regressive, as the member for Chifley has said. I urge the Treasurer to re-examine the Wallis report in light of these submissions. It is time that the government did come good on its promise to govern for all of us. The Treasurer does need to act to restore the ACCC's role in monitoring bank fees and charges. He needs to accept that this blind faith in the markets will not result in the sort of equitable and just society that he suggests it might.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Banking</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—I am delighted to have this opportunity this afternoon. I am a bit surprised that my old friend the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has introduced this particular motion. He is normally a pretty level-headed bloke. He has it pretty well switched on. If I recall correctly, he was a champion of the old Bob Hawke, wasn't he; a Bob Hawke champion absolutely to the death. What was one of the first things that Hawkey got Keating to do for him? Deregulate the banking sector. Why? So that—
—Other way around—Keating did it for Hawke.
—As I recall, Mr Hawke was Prime Minister. Mr Keating was a young, green, new Treasurer in his 20s.
—He's aged, then!
—The point of the fact is that it was your side of politics that deregulated the banking industry and said, `We've got to have competition.' But you really did not do much with it, did you? You left the four majors in place. We got four from an amalgamation of about six, I think it was. Instead of letting other players really come in and compete with over the counter banking, you let it stay static.
The member for Chifley in this motion talks about increasing fees and charges for battlers and pensioner bank customers. I would have thought, if the member for Chifley cared about the battlers and the pensioners, that he would care about the fact that today interest rates are around six per cent or seven per cent—not 27 per cent. I can recall what you lot did to the whole blessed business sector as 
 well as private individuals when, in order to do something about the recession we had to have, you put the interest rates up to 27 per cent. I tell you what: you killed the goose, dead as a blessed doornail, and set in train your own demise. The battlers and the pensioners like the lower interest rates. Why? Because they are the ones that are borrowing the money. They are not putting it up there to get the interest back, are they?
I have no brief for the big banks. I think they need more competition. I agree with you. I think the fact that we are allowing the community co-ops now to issue cheques for their own accounts is absolutely brilliant policy. It will put more pressure on banks. The mortgage originators have put incredible pressure on the banks. They have helped push interest rates down and down. That helps the battlers; that helps the pensioners; that helps everybody on low incomes. It does not help the high income earners. He has it all wrong.
I apologise to the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). The member for Wannon called this a miserable motion. I would not put it quite in those terms. I think it is a bit silly, but I would not say it was absolutely miserable. The member for Wannon described this whole issue as one of hypocrisy. That is fair enough. The member for Chifley `notes with regret the Treasurer's priority of encouraging billion dollar profits for the banks and multi-million dollar salaries for banking executives at the expense of the ordinary customers of the banks'. What a lot of rubbish that is. Whoever said that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was encouraging multiple billion dollar profits? Of course the Treasurer wants the banking sector to be profitable. What do you want? Do you want the banks to go into liquidation? Do you want another government regulator, another government bureaucracy, to tell the banks where they can set the levels of their fees and charges and what levels of interest rates we will have in the country? Is that the kind of re-regulation you would like to do? This is the new Labor Party, isn't it, going back to old issues.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I speak today about the new job market—the creation of Dr Kemp's ugly ideological values. I suggest that he is interested more in commercial values than in community values and people. The new system is bizarre, nonsensical and illogical. Dr Kemp boasts that he has set up a seamless service for the unemployed. Instead of a one-stop shop it would be best to describe the new system as the `new job shop hop' as the unemployed hop around from one provider to another. The unemployed will be forced to go from one provider to another, and on and on. They will have to register with each provider because no one provider will have access to all job vacancies.
 Out in Campbelltown and Liverpool in Sydney, around Logan and Browns Plains in Brisbane, or out around Cranbourne in Melbourne where public transport is poor and often costly, job shop hoping will consume time and limited finances, apart from being a demoralising exercise. An unemployed storeman will have to register separately with every job broker who has a storeman's job on their books. Just the travelling around between job brokers when you are trying to live off the dole will be an inordinate cost. I know it is not of concern to the government.
Dr Kemp's lie that he has created a seamless system will come back to haunt him.
—Order! The honourable member for Batman will withdraw that remark.
—Dr Kemp's suggestion that he has created a seamless system will come back to haunt him as the unemployed and their families realise that the Kemp system costs job seekers. It is another tall story.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—It has not been a secret at any time that the request for an opinion came from the minister, in this case the

The Commonwealth indicated that, if the need arose in the course of the hearing, counsel would be on instructions and confirming that that was the case. It was therefore known on all fronts before the date of the hearing before Justice Callinan.
Let me just say that there have been some rather strange assertions made. There has been no attempt to cover up anything. There has been no conspiracy of any sort. The Commonwealth has consistently taken the position that whether Justice Callinan sat on the case was a matter for him and the court. It remained the position until he determined to withdraw.

—Senator Bolkus, the shadow Attorney-General, and the member for Banks seem to have taken a different view and have put that view abroad in the media. I simply reject it. I invite them to have a look at what they are doing. The High Court has heard the case, Justice Callinan has withdrawn and the remaining six judges will determine the case.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—by leave—I am pleased to be able to report to members briefly on the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, which was held in Old Parliament House from 2 to 13 February 1998. As members will be aware, the convention was held to consider three questions: whether or not Australia should become a republic; which republic model should be put to the voters to consider against the current system of government; and in what time frame and under what circumstances any change might be considered.
The Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair MP and the Hon. Barry Jones AO, MP presided as Chairman 
 and Deputy Chairman respectively. They performed these roles with flair, distinction, good humour and great style, and I congratulate both of them. I thank them on behalf of all the people who took part in the convention and on behalf of the many hundreds of thousands—indeed, millions—of Australians who observed the proceedings.
The holding of the convention fulfilled an election commitment that I gave to the Australian people prior to the last election.	 Before that election it was clear that, just as many in the community felt that our present system works well, there was widespread support for the idea of Australia becoming a republic. That is why I made the promise that I did to the Australian voters that a convention would be held in our first term of government. I am proud to say that the convention was conducted in a very constructive fashion, and I feel privileged to have been the Prime Minister responsible for the establishment of the convention.
May I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation to my predecessor as leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, for his initial proposal that, if the coalition were elected to government, a constitutional convention should be held. I think it ought to be a matter of record in this speech that I make to this parliament on the Constitutional Convention that the original impetus for the holding of the Convention was the proposal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was the Leader of the Opposition. I congratulate him for the germ of an extremely good idea which has come to very constructive fruition.
My government has enormous confidence in the capacity of Australians to debate this issue with vigour and civility. The convention comprised of a diverse group of Australians. Half of the Convention's 152 delegates were appointed by the government. The appointments represented a broad cross-section of Australian society and a wide diversity of skills and experience. They also reflected the government's commitment to ensure that women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 people, young Australians and local government were represented. 
It has been said before, but it bears repetition, that one of the outstanding characteristics of the convention was the eloquent, compelling and, on occasions, quite uplifting contributions of the young Australian delegates who took part in the convention. The other 76 delegates were elected by the Australian people. These delegates were chosen from the 609 candidates who stood for election last year. I am sure members will agree that the elected delegates also carried themselves in a manner that did the Australian public which elected them extremely proud. That such a diverse group of people could work together constructively to bring us to a useful outcome speaks volumes for the strength of Australia's democracy.
The convention engaged the public as well as the delegates. Some 6.75 million copies of the public information materials prepared by the government to increase the community's understanding of the issues were published in 68 metropolitan and regional newspapers. Over 1,000 submissions from members of the public to delegates have been received, and there were around 125,000 hits recorded on the Internet home page. During the convention, something like 17,500 visitors moved through the public galleries to see this historic event. I know that much of the rest of the Australian public, as well as many interested overseas observers, were watching and listening to the extensive television and radio coverage of the convention proceedings.	In my opening address to the convention I said:
Whatever may be our views on the threshold issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic and whatever form we might believe any such republic should take, we owe it to ourselves and to the rest of the Australian people to conduct this Convention in an open, positive and constructive fashion.
I am very pleased to report that the convention achieved that objective.
The majority of the convention supported in principle Australia becoming a republic. Of the republican models, the `bipartisan appointment of the president' model, as it became known, clearly had the greatest support. The convention voted overwhelmingly in favour 
 of a resolution that a referendum be held to test that model against the existing system. The convention also recommended that, if the referendum to be held in 1999 results in support for a republic, the new republic should come into effect by 1 January 2001. As I indicated in my opening address to the convention, that is very much the government's view—that if we are to become a republic then the relevant commencement date should be 1 January 2001 and, equally, if we are not, then that particular event will be celebrated without the debate raging at that particular time.
I believe that the convention has spoken very clearly. It is the intention of my government if it is returned at the next election to hold the referendum before the end of 1999. I have asked the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to bring forward a proposal for consideration by the government on the necessary processes leading to the referendum. The final decision about whether Australia becomes a republic will be put firmly in the hands of the Australian people, as it should be, and in the hands of no-one else.
I table the communique of the Constitutional Convention and inform members that a full report on the proceedings of the convention will be published very soon.
Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed:
That the House take note of the papers.
Motion (by Mr Reith)—by leave—agreed to:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding seven minutes.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,9,1,speech
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—I hope this means that we will not be coming back for debate on a subsequent occasion, because it is pretty darned unfair—everyone else gets 15 minutes and the Leader of the Opposition gets seven. I know the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) just got seven, but every other person in this place would get 15. I will leave that to one side.
I also join the Prime Minister in the thanks that he gave to the presiding officers of the Constitutional Convention. Before the history 
 of this recedes into the deep, dark mists of time, let me also place on record that the overjoyed response that the Prime Minister had to the convention and to the processes that established the convention were not there in his heart for the bulk of the last 12 to 18 months. We are as thoroughly aware as he—because sometimes from time to time we were involved in conversations on the matter with his staff and with the relevant ministers—that this was not an agenda that the Prime Minister wanted to see advanced; nor was it a convention that he wished to see take place, at least not with elected members. Nevertheless, we arrived at the conclusion and the convention was held.
I must say I think the convention did those who participated in it proud in the way in which they conducted the deliberations for the people who were represented there. It is without question the best representation of indigenous Australians that we have seen and without question the best representation of young people, many of whom got themselves there by that elective process and made a really major contribution to the deliberations. They exhibited a level of sophisticated thinking and patriotism—sophisticated thinking about the politics of this nation and patriotism which gave you a sense that the country will be in good hands, indeed maybe even better hands, when we move on from this place.
The convention, however, is simply a process to an end. The end is the completion of bringing home the Australian constitution. I do not think it is sufficient for the government simply to have a view that they will find themselves in a situation of being some sort of midwife for the proposal, that they will assist at the birth—or not, as the case may be—and essentially be a neutral party to the process by which the constitution is changed. That is not good enough for anyone who knows anything about Australian politics. Anyone who knows anything about Australian politics knows that neutrality on the part of government in constitutional change is negativity. There is no evading that. Neutrality is negativity. There is absolutely no evading that point. 
If this proposition is to have any sort of chance at all—at least on one time of asking, and particularly given that what is emerging is a non-elected presidency—then it will require the active support of the political leadership of the nation. If the Prime Minister wants to get credit for this exercise, then the Prime Minister must join us on the hustings—we hope, of course, as Leader of the Opposition—when this matter is finally placed before the Australian people.	We on this side of the House are very well aware that we have to take a risk with the processes we have put forward which we think are essential—and I believe the Liberal Party agrees—for the good governance of the nation. We have to, in a sense, swim against the tide—the tide which is overwhelmingly in favour of an elected president.
It is the misfortune of those who advocate change in the Australian constitution in favour of the majority position established at the Constitutional Convention that we look a bit out of sorts with the elective character of the Australian nation. If we had been deciding at the time that these matters were first considered by the Australian people back in the 1890s as to what sort of process should see the appointment of a head of state, then those who advocated a parliamentary Westminster system versus an American or even Irish or French constitutional model in terms of a directly elected president would not have had the disadvantage of appearing to be arguing some form of elitist proposal. Both would have been seen as equally viable within the context of an Australian democratic process then being put in place.
So we take a risk, and the risk we take is because we think this is the best mechanism for avoiding a change to a Westminster system that we love. But, if we are not joined in the trenches by the leadership of the Liberal Party, and probably also by the leadership of the National Party, that will not be the form that the Australian constitutional change takes.
Let us be clear about this: even if it is lost next time around, it will not leave the Australian agenda. You could not see those young people at that conference and assume that it 
 would leave the Australian agenda merely for the loss the first time around. What a loss the first time around means is that, in all likelihood, the next time of asking would see serious consideration being given to an elected president, which would change fundamentally the nature of the Australian constitution. That would be unavoidable.
If the Prime Minister of this country is to show leadership on this issue and not just skirt around the edges—and isolated he was by his supporters, I might say, at that Constitutional Convention—he must decide, given that this is now going to the Australian people, that he must enter the lists in favour of the changes that the convention he established recommended. Many of his colleagues will, though many were disappointed that the monarchists did not produce a situation there where they had produced what was the so-called McGarvie model or ultra minimalist model at the time—and back scenery work was done quite intensively by government members at the time to try to produce that. But, despite that fact, there is an obligation, I think, on those who want to midwife this process or put the proposition forward if they happen to be in government to actually be supportive of it.
We, of course, hope and believe that it will be us who put that referendum forward. But if that is not to be the case, if that referendum is to have any chance of passage at all, the Prime Minister will need a leap of leadership that we have not so far seen from him. But I join him, nevertheless, in congratulating the delegates for a great performance on their part, again congratulating two very good presiding officers for the role that they played and congratulating my deputy on the resolutions committee and those who worked with him, like the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who produced an orderly conference and did very well indeed with it.

"Hicks, Noel, MP",NP,1998-03-02,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes the terrible damage being done to Australians, particularly young Australians, by the present street drug epidemic;
(2)	 deplores the fact that in Australia it is estimated one out of two teenagers have experimented with marijuana compared with one in 20 in Sweden;
(3)	 recognises that marijuana is a mind altering drug; and
(4)	 calls on all Australian governments to implement the federal Government's strategy which is similar to that operating in Sweden to fight the street drug epidemic.
The tragic events in Sydney late last week that resulted in the death of a young police 
 man, Constable Forsyth, and serious injury to his colleague Probationary Constable Jason Semples can be directly sheeted home to the street drug tragedy that is enveloping our country. I am sure my parliamentary colleagues would join me in extending our sympathy to Mrs Forsyth and her young family at the tragedy that has befallen them. This tragedy is one of many that occur almost daily in this country because of the scourge of illicit drugs, and as citizens we are well aware of drug related tragedies and their impact on many Australian families.
In my own electorate in the last few days there have been a number of arrests as a result of inspection of vehicles that were stopped for other offences. I assume these incidents were unrelated, but on every occasion the people arrested were carrying substantial amounts of marijuana and other drugs. One person carried a replica pistol. One person when brought before the courts said that he smoked marijuana to relieve stress. One would wonder what stress other drivers on the road would feel if they knew he was under the influence of a mind bending drug. Needless to say, in most cases the drug couriers get off with what I would call a slap on the wrist.
The discovery of drugs in the possession of people whose cars are stopped by police for unrelated matters is a common occurrence on the highway linking Adelaide and Sydney, and anecdotal evidence indicates this. This has drastically increased since the use of marijuana has been decriminalised in South Australia. Adelaide has long been regarded as an important source for the supply of marijuana, now in real effect grown legally, which is constantly being carried across to the eastern states to be traded for amphetamines which are readily available in Australia's largest cities. No doubt the amphetamines will return to Adelaide and further west. Drug dealers are regularly running the gauntlet of police on the Sturt and Hume highways, and although the police do a great job of making arrests no doubt a large majority of dealers escape detection and are able to ply their deadly trade.
The above incidents, certainly one more serious than the others, give some indication of why I join with many people throughout Australia who are saying that enough is enough in relation to the importation, distribution and use of street drugs. We were warned in the past what would happen if the nation were to go soft on drugs, and we have gone soft. Living as I do in Griffith, New South Wales—a name people would know—I would like to pay a special tribute to the late Don Mackay, who paid the supreme sacrifice to save his community and his nation from this scourge. It is important that this battle be continued.
Even allowing for that, we have a headline in the Canberra Times `Nation of dope smokers: report'. It says:
The level of cannabis abuse in Australia is among the highest in the world, according to the United Nations' drug agency, the International Narcotics Board.
The board voiced concerns yesterday about the rapidly rising level of amphetamines abuse by Australia's young people and of the volume of heroin continually pouring into the country.
Among the most feared of all the amphetamine derivatives was the popular party drug ecstasy.
""Substantial amounts of ecstasy and other hallucinogens, including LSD, are being smuggled into Australia mainly from countries in Europe,"" the report said.
The board said the battle to combat illicit drugs world-wide was being undermined by a culture of ""drug-friendliness"", in which dangerous illicit drugs were portrayed as acceptable or glamorous.
One of the problems the community faces is that many people believe drugs like marijuana are not harmful, and I have heard of one mother who does not mind her son smoking marijuana because she thinks it is less harmful than tobacco smoking.
The question of drug abuse is a broad subject full of complexities, but one thing I am sure of is that the policy of harm minimisation that has been the government's policy until recently—which begins with the premise that people are going to take drugs anyway so let us teach young Australians how to take drugs safely and hence minimise the harm they may afflict—is ludicrous and obviously has caused great social harm. I 
 therefore welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) late last year that he would introduce a get tough on drugs campaign. I also welcome the Prime Minister's announcement today of an additional vote of $8.9 million for the Australian Federal Police, who are in the front line in our fight against drug importation and distribution. As Professor Lucy Sullivan from the University of New South Wales states:
Harm minimisation does not mean the minimisation of the harm caused by drugs. It means legislation on the grounds that the harm of drug users going to court is greater than the individual and social harm of unrestricted drug use.
Most thinking people would know this attitude has got us into the situation we face at the moment, where street drugs, especially marijuana, are readily available and one out of two Australian teenagers have tried it. The truth of the matter, although many will not admit it, is that no street drug is safe.
While the term `street drug' can cover other substances, such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and designer drugs to name a few, all of which can have a deadly effect, the most readily available is marijuana or pot. We are all aware that people who smoke pot or marijuana vigorously defend its use. They point out that it is no worse than smoking cigarettes, and the unfortunate thing is that most of them believe it. I understand that there are presently about 10,000 documented studies on marijuana, most of them with adverse findings. But, unfortunately, many of these studies have been outdated and invalidated because of the more intoxicating mixtures that are cultivated and processed today such as the hybrid called skunk.
There is no doubt that cigarettes aggravate many existing health problems as well as harming the healthy person. Comparative studies show both types of smoke possess many of the same compounds, the difference being that tobacco contains nicotine while marijuana contains cannabinoids. Benzpyrenes, well known cancer causing agents produced in the burning process, are 70 per cent more abundant in marijuana smoke than in smoke for high tar cigarettes. There is no study that suggests tobacco is responsible for impairment of memory, personality, driving 
 ability and the physiology of reproduction. The same unfortunately cannot be said of marijuana.
I am one who is extremely concerned that there is a strong connection between the increasing use of street drugs and the ever increasing number of suicides, particularly among the young. The interrelationship between schizophrenic events and the use of marijuana has already been determined. It is my belief that the only way to handle the street drug menace is by getting tough and adopting the Swedish model—Sweden being a country where only one in 20 young people have tried marijuana against one in two in Australia.
Having watched Australian society over the past 20 years and witnessed the spread of the use of street drugs, I do not like what I see. Governments, in going soft on drugs, have ensured that the use of these drugs has spread, as the ill-informed South Australia and Canberra experiments will prove. I do not know about my parliamentary colleagues, but I do not want my taxi driver, bus driver, doctor, bank adviser and so on to be high on some mind-bending substance when my family and I are dealing with them and depending on them.
It is indisputable that if you legalise or decriminalise any activity you will encourage its wider use. I dread the thought of living in a nation of drug addicts. That is why the least option we can take is that taken by Sweden, which is that of a drug free society. I refer to a Swedish National Institute of Public Health publication, which under the heading of `A Drug-Free Society' states:
A drug-free society is a high objective expressing society's attitude to narcotic drugs: we do not accept the integration of narcotic drugs in society, and our aim is a society in which drug abuse remains a socially unaccepted form of behaviour, a society in which drug abuse remains a marginal phenomenon.
A drug-free society is a vision expressing optimism and a positive view of humanity: the onslaught of drugs can be restrained, and drug abusers can be rehabilitated.
That recently published vivid photo of an infant child alongside his comatose drug-addict mother saying, `Get up, Mummy! Get 
 up, Mummy!' says it all. The Swedish National Institute of Public Health also states:
Drug policy is a part of social policy, the aim of which is to give everybody in Sweden a basic measure of security through a system of general benefits. The restrictive focus of Swedish drug policy is part of this general approach of the idea that everybody is entitled to a decent life and that no groups are excluded from participation in society.
I ask the House: what sort of a life does this young child have when his mother is comatose and cannot get up? The war against street drugs has to be fought on many fronts—in the courts, by education and by rehabilitation. We cannot go soft on the issue if we do not want a major national disaster on our hands. Time is fast running out.
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drugs</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) has placed an important matter before the House, and for that we should be grateful. I would have thought, though, that he could have provided the House with greater information about the implementation of the Swedish strategy. In part (4) of his motion he calls on our government to implement the program in place in Sweden. I am sure all members would support the vision of a society free of drug abuse, but it would have been good to hear some information as to how that particular vision is being realised in Sweden—what sort of combination of community programs, punishment and rehabilitation is being implemented in that nation.
I also thought it was somewhat inconsistent for the member for Riverina to criticise marijuana as a street drug when he is also criticising the South Australian laws. The whole purpose of the decriminalisation of marijuana for personal use in South Australia is to prevent marijuana becoming a street drug, to avoid the trafficking of marijuana on the streets of that particular state. Personal use and cultivation in moderate amounts does not need to be a criminal offence.
Apparently the figures show that there is no correlation between that particular law and marijuana use in South Australia. Surveys have shown that five per cent to 10 per cent of marijuana users in other states say that their use is motivated by the fact that the drug is regarded as illegal—that is, it is an act of social rebellion that causes them to engage in marijuana use. You take that away in South Australia and apparently the figure does not show any correlation. It is often argued that correlation does not equal cause. In this case, we do not even have the correlation on which to hang the sort of argument that was being advanced by the member for Riverina.
It is hard to sustain an argument that there is a domino theory in drug use, particularly when in the motion marijuana is described as a `mind altering drug'. If that is the argument and the member for Riverina is going to be consistent, surely he would be arguing for alcohol to be outlawed in Australia. Alcohol is certainly a mind altering drug. If there is a domino theory whereby alcohol use would lead to marijuana use, surely the member for Riverina and his supporters in this matter should have been consistent enough to call for the outlawing of alcohol. So there are some problems in that particular presentation.
We need to have close regard for the right balance of policies. I heard a speaker last Friday talking about youth issues, describing the way in which Western society seems to have a habit every decade of finding a new fad answer to youth problems. One decade it is the call for more punishment—the call for government to enact tougher laws. The next decade it is a big drive for community based answers to youth alienation and drug abuse. The decade after that it is often a big focus on market driven policies, producing jobs and meaningful employment for young people. The truth is we should not be engaging in a fad response. We should not be engaging in just one aspect of a drug policy response. We need an integrated approach that gets the balance right between community connection and responsibility, between the right type of laws to minimise drug abuse in our society and, of course, the creation of jobs and meaningful activity for young Australians.
It is very important to get the balance right. There is no doubt that the link between unemployment and drugs represents a social disease that needs to be attacked by government. I can tell some terrible stories to the House about some of the street crime and associated drug problems in my electorate, particularly in Campbelltown. There is a street in Englorie Park where 15 homes in a six-month period were all broken into mainly by young people, according to the sighting that was made as they ran away. The suspicion, of course, is that drugs is a big part of that law and order problem. We need to ensure that if young people are not in school they have some employment opportunities available to them, that there is an integrated approach by government recognising the problem of youth unemployment and its connection with drug abuse.
We need to get the balance right on the punishment question. I do not subscribe to the domino theory on these drug policy issues. I think the South Australians got it right when they decriminalised the personal use of marijuana. They have taken marijuana off the streets as much as possible and recognised that it can be used in sensible practices that do not lead to more serious drug use and abuse.
On the question of punishment and law making and the way in which drug addicts are treated by society, I should mention that during the parliamentary recess I had the opportunity to visit Odyssey House in my electorate and talk to some of the residents there. I was very struck by their stories. I do not think it is possible to get a full appreciation of drug related questions in our society unless you talk to people who have that personal experience.
I asked one of the residents there—he was somewhat of a spokesperson for the group—what would be the one policy change that he would make if he was the government for a day. The answer is one that I am happy to pass on to the House, even though it is perhaps not one that my side of politics readily embraces. His answer was that he would close down all the youth refugees. I said, `Hang on, why would you do that?' He 
 said, `The truth is that if young people find comfort and solace in youth refuges and they are not made to face up to heroin addiction, they will not find it within themselves to deal with their problem. The first step is to reach the bottom, take pride in oneself and try to pull oneself out of the problem of heroin addiction. That does not come from being comforted in the first instance; it comes from being forced to face up to the difficulty.' I thought that was a valid point to make.
We should not have a situation where heroin addicts are able to avoid their personal responsibility for facing up to the addiction. Once they face up to the problem—that is the important first step that is embraced by Odyssey House—we need support mechanisms. We do need government and community to play a supporting role but, without that personal responsibility and that first step in facing up to the problem, it is very hard to see how such a serious addiction can be overcome. I am interested to learn more. I will be visiting Odyssey House in my electorate and other parts of the country more often as I consider these policy matters.
We do need systems of public support. At Odyssey House it is based on individuals facing up to their dilemma and then trying to engage much more in a sense of community. I think that is very important. That is the third leg of effective policy. There must be job generation for young Australians and there must be the appropriate balance of law and public and private responsibility but we also need to build a greater sense of social belonging because in the end serious drug abuse is a form of escapism. It is a form of escapism for those who feel alienated from our society, who feel left out and who feel far too challenged and pressured by the lifestyle of our modern and at times difficult society.
We must consider as policy makers the means by which a greater sense of social belonging can be imparted to young Australians. A lot of the answers lie in youth and community development, giving young people a greater role to play at the local level. A lot of the answers lie in school and employment policy. 
I am interested in the arguments I hear as shadow education minister about the need to cater for diverse youth needs and diverse youth learning inclinations. There is no one form of intelligence among young people. As they go through secondary school, they have a diverse set of learning needs and habits. The role of secondary schooling should be to ensure that every young Australian engages in a positive learning experience and that they have their learning needs customised and provided for by government to make sure that they can each engage in that positive learning experience. If they do that at ages 13 and 14, there is a stronger chance that they will value education and go on to higher educational attainment at ages 17 through to 20. So catering for diverse youth needs and developing programs that provide this stronger sense of social belonging is a very important part of the policy approach.
I despair frequently when I listen to some of the reaction on talkback radio encouraged by some of the talkback radio hosts, that the only answer in this issue is tougher punishment. I am disappointed when I hear the member for Riverina say that his answer is tougher punishment. The right balance on law making is important but we must also ensure that young Australians have a sense of social belonging, they are recognised for their achievements and they are recognised for their role in the community. A big part of that is the social recognition and connection that comes out of employment, to do more in this vexed area of youth unemployment and to rethink the relationship between state and community to make sure that young Australians do have a stronger sense of social recognition and connectedness as they live through those difficult adolescent years.
Tougher punishment in isolation is not the answer. There needs to be a fuller and more considered approach by government. Maybe some of the solutions do lie in the implementation of the Swedish model. Perhaps on another occasion the member for Riverina can give the House more information in that regard—perhaps at the end of this debate in his summing up. I would urge other members of the House to consider the full policy scope 
 in this area, to take a balanced view and to make sure that we do not fall into the trap of advocating tougher punishment alone.
Consideration interrupted.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drugs</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—The estimated annual consumption of cannabis in Australia is 120,000 kilograms. The industry is estimated to be worth in excess of $2 billion a year and, in contrast, seizures by enforcement agencies are around $55 million a year. In 1994 the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland estimated that in that 
 state the value of the cannabis crop was $652 million, second in value as a cash crop only to sugar. Last week the United Nations, reporting on drug use in Australia, said that Australia was the biggest user of cannabis in the world.
The progress of the national drug strategy, which reviewed Australia's national drug strategy throughout last year, found amongst other things the following: 10 per cent of 16-year-olds smoke cannabis at least weekly; use amongst teenagers has increased from 20.8 per cent in 1988 to 28.4 per cent in 1995—that is for 14- to 19-year-olds; and 50 per cent of 14- to 19-year-olds last year were offered cannabis, 40 per cent have smoked it at least once in the past and 25 per cent smoked it in the last year alone.
Cannabis is a fat soluble drug that contains 421 chemicals and causes all the problems associated with smoking and considerably more. You are six times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia if you are a cannabis smoker. One-third of all patients forcibly admitted to psychiatric institutions in Australia last year were in need of detention because of a marijuana induced relapse. This is not, contrary to what some people may think, a safe or benign drug.
The critical question though is: why do people take drugs at all? The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) made some extremely important and I think valid points on this. Why is it that people seek the escapism of taking a drug to provide them with the excitement that they feel is otherwise lacking in their day-to-day lives? You can open a newspaper or turn on a television or a radio in any part of the country on any day of the week and you are confronted with evidence of a society that is failing—of which the very high level of cannabis use is but one symptom. We have amongst the highest suicide rates of young people in the developed world. We have a debate about euthanasia and what everyone's attitude is to that. We had the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last year making a video in anticipation of her death. Death and the discussion of it and preoccupation with it are symptoms of societies generally that are failing. Gambling is elevated to the 
 status of religion in many parts of the country. We have also engaged in a race debate. We have a widening gap between those who have extreme wealth and those who live in extreme poverty.
The thematic currency for drug use, despair and self-destructive behaviour amongst young people is that, in many of our actions and attitudes, we have failed to transmit a sense of belonging and the sense of meaningful purpose to the next generation who, in many cases, feel that the only thing they have to believe in is themselves and that they live in a society—as Richard Eckersley, social policy analyst for the CSIRO, has observed—where progress and a belief in progress is central to our culture. Yet, for the fist time in many generations, the current generation of young people do not face a future which will automatically guarantee them a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by their parents. In fact, many of them know that they will struggle to achieve it.
Yet, every day in this place we talk about growth as if it is an altar upon which we worship. The imagery of success and the values to which many young people are still tethered are that success is acquiring a BMW, having a mobile phone, doing very well at school and having fashionable clothing and many of the things which the reality of life will cruelly short change them with. The price of our shallowness is being paid by our children. The problem is not that they have not learnt our values; it is that they have. Then we wonder why the level of drug use is so high in Australia.
If we cannot keep drugs out of prisons, I question how we will be able to possibly keep drugs out of schools, train stations or any of the other places where people consume them. Like the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), I do not think we should be legalising these products, but I certainly think we need a much broader approach to this issue than simply enforcement. It is about education, it is about cultural values, it is about rebuilding. As Hugh Mackay has said, the most important challenge this nation faces is to rebuild a sense of community.
What we need to understand is that the most important resource we have is that of our personal relationships, and on the eve of the new millennium what we need most is one another. Many young people feel, as I said, that the only thing they have to believe in is themselves. We need to increasingly look for opportunities to make them feel that they are a part of a society that cares for them and that will provide for them. We need to feel that we are a nation that has strategic vision—a sense of who we are, where we are going, how we relate to one another and, most importantly, what is necessary to get there.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—At the outset, I would like to agree with the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) on one thing in his motion: there is terrible damage being done to Australians, particularly our young Australians, by drugs. Around 600 young and not so young Australians will die this year as a result of heroin use. Longitudinal studies suggest that this is about two to three per cent of heroin users who will die each year—or about one every 16 hours. The death rate from IV drug use is increasing as a result of increases in the availability and purity of heroin.
The costs of drug use in our community are not just in loss of life. Costs also arise from medical treatment for overdoses and other conditions such as HIV infection and hepatitis which can result from drug use. It is estimated that every hour in Australia an IV drug user contracts hepatitis and 18,000 addicts are receiving methadone treatment with even more on the waiting lists. There is a community cost from criminal activity associated with drug use. There are law enforcement and judicial costs. Drug law enforcement cost Australians $500 million in 1996. There is also a loss of quality in life—not just for the drug users themselves but for their families and friends.
This is the point at which my views on this subject diverge from those of the member for Riverina and where they become more in line with both the member for Bradfield (Dr 
 Nelson) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). How do we as a parliament and as a society address the issue of the huge social costs of drug use? I would suggest that hardline rhetoric about enforcement is not the solution.
The motion suggests a push for an increasingly restrictive drug policy like that operating currently in Sweden. The key elements of this policy currently make it a criminal offence to consume, possess, supply, produce, acquire with a view to supplying, transport or store narcotic drugs. In addition, anyone who puts a supplier in touch with a buyer can be charged with promoting drug trading. Police are also legally able to confiscate drug paraphernalia such as syringes and needles and smoking devices such as bongs and pipes.
While no-one would argue that suppliers of narcotics should not be dealt with seriously by law enforcement authorities, the Swedish experience, like that of Australia, has been that the vast majority of offences are minor cannabis offences. In Sweden in 1991, of the 7,600 indicted for drug offences, 57 per cent were for minor cannabis offences. To make a comparison with Australia, in 1996-97, 29,000 kilograms of cannabis were seized by police, and 69,136 arrests were made. Cannabis accounted for a massive 81 per cent of drug offences in Australia last year.
The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence highlighted in its report released in January that the enormous resources being used by police to enforce current marijuana laws could be much better spent on tackling more serious drug and crime problems. The chair of the ABCI, Victorian Police Commissioner Neil Comrie, has stated that law enforcement efforts—

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The issue I want to talk about tonight is becoming a very serious matter for many Australian families. These are families who are struggling following this government's progressive dismantling of assistance to people with disabilities. We have a situation now in Australia where levels of unmet need for disability services are rising. Some 13,500 people with severe and profound disabilities do not get the accommodation services that they need, about 30,000 people with disabilities do not get the help with employment assistance that they need and 7,700 people with severe and profound disabilities are cared for by parents who are aged over 65. The important point about these figures that everybody needs to be aware of is that these people are people with severe and profound disabilities who do not have decent accommodation or who are living with parents who are getting much older. The need in accommodation services alone has been costed at $275 million by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
What has been the government's response to this increasing need? The government's response has been as follows. First of all, they cut $174 million from the disability services budget over the last two budgets. So, in the 
 face of this dire need, what do this government do? They cut $174 million from the budget. They did not even have the decency to tell people with disabilities that they were cutting the budget, preferring to call the lion's share of the cuts `efficiency dividends'. These efficiency dividends are in fact, of course, significant cuts.
Secondly, this government has failed to sign the Commonwealth-state disability agreements after three token offers which the states and territories have found very easy to reject. This failure has put disability services into limbo, unable to plan for the future, existing from month to month. This is because the states and territories know that the Commonwealth offer goes nowhere near meeting the needs that have been outlined above. The National Council on Intellectual Disability condemned and rejected outright the latest offer made by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) last week to the states and territories, calling it a totally inadequate offer and saying this:
Given the Prime Minister's recent promise, [the National Council on Intellectual Disability] strongly criticises the Federal Government for its insult to people with disability and their families that this offer represents.
The next area where the government is taking cuts out of those families that have children with disabilities is that the government is taking the child disability allowance away from families. About 8,000 children, according to Senate estimates last week, will lose the child disability allowance as a result of the government changing the definition of who is disabled. After June 1998, when the new assessment tables come in, the government has budgeted for savings of $25.3 million in the 1998-99 financial year alone. In one year alone $25 million will be taken off children with a disability. It has also abolished the position of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner.
Most important of all is what the government is doing to people with disabilities who are trying to get work. The unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than double what it is for the rest of the population. To give people with disabilities the same chances for jobs and decent wages that other 
 Australians have, there used to be specific labour market programs specifically designed to meet their needs. These were called the disability reform panels, and they were successful. The latest review of them showed that clearly. Once again, what has this government done? This government has abolished them. It has abolished something that worked and replaced it with an experiment: the new labour market arrangements that come into place in May this year. What this will mean for people with disabilities who are trying to get back to work is still unclear. But what does seem to be clear is that it will be left up to people with disabilities to find their own way through what will be a much more complicated maze of employment support.
I make a final point as far as this litany of reduction in support by this government and failure to support people with disabilities is concerned. Late last year we saw the government trying to take away the mobility allowance from people with intellectual disabilities who attend independent living skills centres. This was never announced; it just happened. Gradually the phone calls started coming in and then more and more phone calls and letters were coming in from people saying that they had lost their mobility allowance. This meant that people were not going to be able to afford to pay for the transport that was required to get them to these independent living centres. Fortunately, as a result of considerable pressure on the government, this latest attack on people with disabilities was headed off. It is pleasing to be able to say that mobility allowance looks safe for the moment. Nevertheless, given the litany of attacks that people with disabilities have suffered under this government, nobody could be too sure.
The 1980s, I am pleased to say, was a period of considerable reform in the disability area. The Disability Services Act was passed in 1986, followed by the first Commonwealth-state disability agreement and then the Disability Discrimination Act. It was a period when we spoke regularly about the breaking down of barriers. But what this government is doing is progressively erecting the barriers for people with disabilities again and again. 
 Each budget cut translates into putting one more barrier up, until we find that over a period we are back to where we started from in the late 1970s. The least the government could do is finalise agreements with the states which provide a decent level of funding to the states to ensure that, particularly in the area of accommodation, a decent amount and a decent quality of accommodation could be provided for people with disabilities. These are people who are currently not receiving adequate accommodation support, particularly those families where ageing relatives—people over the age of 65—are caring for adult offspring with serious disabilities.
If this government walks away—as it seems to be planning to do—from the multilateral agreement that has up until now existed between the Commonwealth and the states and negotiates a variety of deals with the states, we will effectively have the demolition of another plank in disability reform, the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. If we see the demolition of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement, we will also see the loss of the capacity of the Commonwealth to require each of the states to pass legislation that mirrors the Commonwealth legislation. That will mean that we will no longer have a consistent national rights oriented framework for disability services.
What we face, as a result of this government's budget cuts to those with disabilities and the government's incapacity to negotiate a new agreement with the states over disabilities, is the loss of a national agreement and the loss of any adequate support for people who need decent accommodation. It is a backward step for those who need the government's support and a shameful mark against a government that has shown its true colours in its lack of support for the most disadvantaged in our community: those with severe and profound disabilities.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Grievance Debate,13,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—This is really a sad occasion because we have here a second debate on a bill that should never have been introduced. It was a result of a broken election promise by the government. It is unfair. It is a tawdry little political exercise. The sadness is that, if the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  is passed and it achieves the objectives its advocates claim, the benefit to this community will be very low.
Most of us think the benefit will be nil, but let us assume that there will be some. What we know is that the net benefit to the community overall economically will be very low, and there is no claim that there will be a social benefit. But even if that claim is incorrect some individuals—some Australians—will lose enormously.
Even if the claims of the advocates are correct about the benefits—and I will come in a moment to why we think that is extremely dubious—there can be no denying that this bill, if it is passed, will mean that some Australians will lose out in one of the most fundamental of ways: they will lose their 
 security in their job. It will take away their rights.
—It will not.
—It will take away their rights, rights you promised they would keep.
—You know it's not true.
—You know it is true. The then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then shadow minister who is now the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) both said before the election that, if you are dismissed unfairly, you should have a right of appeal—said without qualification. They explicitly said, `There will not be such exemptions,' but now they are breaking that promise in a way that is very unfair.
Why when the report that triggered this government proposal did not recommend this course of action? A major report into the needs of small business was trumpeted. It recommended some good things, but it did not recommend an unfair dismissal exemption for small business. It said there should be a review of it in about 12 months time, which would be getting on towards now, but it did not recommend an unfair dismissal exemption for small business.
The government got the report, clearly felt that its response did not have much political oomph, so decided it needed to add some. So it delved back into its box of political tricks and said, `This trick worked pretty well in 1995. We had a great campaign about unfair dismissals in 1995. Let's try it again.' Political history—not just political history but military history and all sorts of history—is littered with people trying to revisit their former glories: `I had a great victory three years ago. Let's see if we can do it all again when the circumstances are entirely different.' They thought, `We can create another unfair dismissal campaign,' and `I'—the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business—`might just, as an aside, advance my leadership aspirations over those of the Treasurer because I can be a hero to the back bench again, leading the assault against unfair dismissals, and perhaps nobody will notice that I promised before the election that we 
 wouldn't do it. Perhaps nobody will notice that the Prime Minister promised before the election that we wouldn't do it.'
That is the genesis of this, but now we have a second stage. We now have this back as one of four potential double dissolution triggers. Why have we got it back in that form? Because the government want to mask their desire to have a double dissolution election about Wik. They want to create three other apparent causes and catalysts of any double dissolution so that they can say, `No, this is not just an election about race; this is an election about these four very fundamental issues,' when we all know, and every Australian who is studying the events knows, that the government is deliberately setting out on a course to have a double dissolution about Wik and this is designed to disguise that stark, unpleasant, unpalatable reality.	That is why we are now having this second debate about a bill which should never have been here the first time.
We do not want to have a double dissolution on this bill, for two reasons. Firstly, it gives this mask to the stark reality of the government's plans with regard to Wik and, secondly, there is the too awful to contemplate possibility that if, heaven forbid, this government were re-elected they might be able to pass this bill in its entirety at a joint sitting. The difficulty for us is there is not much room to compromise on this bill: this is something you are for or against. There are not many graduations and there is not much fine print on Wik. There have been lots of amendments—a very substantial amount of compromise—which the government have deliberately rejected. Here there is not much room to compromise. You either think that people have a right to an appeal or you do not. You cannot say, `We will give them back half the right,' or, `They will have three-quarters of the right.' They have either got the right to appeal or they have not.
So, notwithstanding that political analysis, notwithstanding that it is arguably perhaps not even in our political interest to do it, we continue to oppose this legislation for one simple reason: it is wrong. This government's legislation says that people can be sacked 
 even if that is harsh, unjust or unreasonable. What this government is saying, and wants us to agree to, is that the objective circumstances can be that your dismissal is harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and we are supposed to say, `But it doesn't matter.' People in Australia today have the right of appeal in those circumstances. Law-abiding, tax paying Australian working people currently have a right of appeal in those circumstances, and the government thinks we might come in here in fear of a double dissolution and say that we agree to taking that right away from them, that they should not have it.
Why have people got that right? We will get trumpeted all this stuff about Labor's unfair dismissal laws and how difficult they were for job creation in small business. I want, if I get time, to say something about the accuracy or otherwise of those reports. But it does not matter if it was true in 1995; we are dealing here with the amendments to the government's laws, to John Howard's law, to Peter Reith's law—to the law which they said is a fair go all round, that swept away the old laws and put in place a fair go all round. If it was a fair go all round in 1996 when the government passed it, why isn't it a fair go all round now? They stood up and trumpeted that this was a major reform which was fair and balanced in the interests of employers and employees. They said that less than 12 months before they introduced this bill to say, `We thought it was a fair go all round in 1996 but now it is not. It is a fair go part way round. It is a fair go unless you work for small business. It is a fair go unless you happen to be an employee of an enterprise that employs fewer than 15 people.'
I do not think Australians ever thought that that concept of a fair go, which is a pretty traditional Australian concept, was something that was an optional extra that we give to some and take away from others. A fair go is not something for the government to hand out and say, `Well, we will redistribute a fair go, and we will give all of it to you here and none of it to you there.' Australians think that if something is a fair go then everybody ought to have it, not just some. There will be a growing number of people, employees of 
 small business, whose dismissal is demonstrably harsh, unjust or unreasonable who will have no remedy, no right of appeal. If that happens to you today, you have a right of appeal. If this bill passes, that right will be taken away. What an achievement. I am sure they are all very proud it. I am sure they are going around the electorate telling all their constituents, `I've just done something wonderful. I've taken a basic right of yours away. Why? Because I thought there might be a vote in it.' What an achievement. These are the rights of what will become hundreds of thousands of Australians, rights they have, rights this parliament gave them, rights this government gave them less them 18 months ago, and now they are saying that these rights only belong to some people.
—You keep saying that, but it is wrong.
—It is absolutely right, and you know it is right, or you should. They have got the right and you are taking it away. Will they have the right after this passes?
—They will have rights. Of course they will.
—That is exactly the misleading statement I hoped you would make. The government continues to pretend that there is protection because the law protects people from being discriminated against. That is the explanation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, and his parliamentary secretary, poor little pathetic thing that he is, is parroting that argument. I tell you that that does not protect anybody from being dismissed if it is harsh, unjust or unreasonable—there is zero protection. What it says to a young woman is this: if you are dismissed on discriminatory grounds because you are a woman, you have got a right of appeal. That is true. But if you are sexually harassed and dismissed for that reason, you have got no right of appeal.
—That is wrong.
—It is not wrong. Let me give you some other examples. There are plenty around. A woman was dismissed because the employer said, `A condition of your employment is that you have to enter 
 into this arrangement which is a rip-off of the tax system.' She said no and she was dismissed. She was reinstated under the old law; she would have no right of appeal under this. A worker was told by his employer to sack a pregnant subordinate. He said, `No, this is a most unreasonable thing you are asking me to do and I will not do it,' and he was sacked. He was reinstated under the old law; under the new one he would have no right of appeal. There was an employee about whom it was found, when there was a hearing, that the allegation under which they had been dismissed was entirely unsubstantiated. They took an appeal and they were reinstated; they would have had no right of appeal under this law. We had an employee who was dismissed when his wife told a boss that he was off sick and he had cancer. He would have no right of appeal under this.
—Oh, come on. They have got other avenues.
—These are actual cases. There was the employee who was dismissed because he refused to certify that an unroadworthy vehicle was roadworthy. He said, `No, that is not right. That car is not roadworthy,' and he was dismissed. The parliamentary secretary keeps saying that they have other avenues, and that is not true, unless he means the common law, unless we are going back to the 19th century. So what we have got to do is get lawyers and go to the courts, because there is no other provision for appeal for people who work for small business if they are dismissed in circumstances that are harsh, unreasonable or unfair.
If there is another right, what is the principal provision in there for, and what was the problem in 1995? If, irrespective of the laws we introduced in 1995, everybody had other rights of appeal, where was the problem? Of course they do not. It is just a travesty that someone could come in here purporting to represent the government on the front bench and pretend, contrary to the facts, that there are other avenues, because not even the minister has ever pretended.
There is no other right of appeal here. It has been granted and it was given in legislation introduced by the previous government. 
 Continued and confirmed. Not exactly in the way we would like, but that is beside the point. This new system of giving people a so-called fair go all round was passed by this parliament, and that right has been taken away. For hundreds of thousands of workers, it is the plain fact of the case. Employees can be dismissed for the worst of reasons—for the most harsh and unreasonable of reasons—but if they are given four weeks notice it is all okay. We do not think that is a fair go all round. I do not think Australians will think it is a fair go all round, and trying to pretend, contrary to the facts, that there is some alternative will not help. It will simply expose the weakness of the case. If you have to make up a defence, it means the real one is not very strong.
This is something that goes to the very core of the lives of thousands of Australians and the households that depend on them. Australian families fundamentally depend on the job that the principal breadwinner has. Sometimes now, in more and more families, there are two breadwinners but in most of them one is a predominant breadwinner. The gender of that predominant breadwinner is now not so apparent—it varies among households—but that predominant breadwinner is the core of the economic and social fabric of most Australian families. The security they have in their job is fundamental to the security they have as a family, and it is not something that should be meddled with. It is a very sad thing that this parliament is being asked to do and, as seriously as we have contemplated the options here, at the end of the day we cannot do this. Even this government promised that these are rights that employees should have. They made it absolutely clear that they felt at the last election that this was a very reasonable right for them to have.
On 20 February 1996, before the election, the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said that the redrafted system of unfair dismissals would not contain any exemptions. It would not contain those exemptions, he said. That was almost two years ago. I suppose the Australian worker should have guessed it was not a core promise, but we did not know about this distinction be 
 tween core and non-core promises at the time and we thought they meant it. On 28 February 1996 the minister said:
Look, our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.
I looked and I turned it upside down. Where are the parentheses that say `unless you work for a small business'? It is not there. It was never said. If that is not authority enough, because it is only the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and perhaps his word is not very well worth taking, let us look at the then Leader of the Opposition—the now Prime Minister, who said:
I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.
Do you want to hear that again:
I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.
—Who said that?
—That was the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, and it must be true because he said it to John Laws. We did not realise that in parentheses we should have read `unless that capricious employer employs fewer than 15 employees'. We know that most employers are not capricious, but we know that some are. If there were none, we would not have had the successful cases of the type that I just read to the House, and there are many. Most employers are not like that. As with most employees, most employers are decent, hardworking Australians trying to get on with their jobs and trying to create jobs for others. This law is about the others. Most laws are about the others—about the few who do not act reasonably. That is why we have laws: to regulate such people. I thought perhaps the now Prime Minister was caught off guard and that he meant to say something more qualified. But he said to Keith Conlon:
I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed. 

That is two goes, but they were both talkback radio and perhaps you do not measure your words as carefully as you might on talkback radio—although you would have thought a leader of a party who has been in federal politics for 20-odd years would probably do that. I thought, `We have got to get to something more substantial and more researched.' So I went to his headland speeches. They were pretty serious stuff. He wrote them all out and distributed them to everybody, and I guess he meant us to take them seriously, or we thought so at the time. He said:
Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.
Where in all that should the Australian worker have believed that it meant `unless you work for some small business'? Where was the qualification to the very fine articulation of principle with which I have no quibble? We did have some quibble about the way the government went about it, but the government won in the parliament and their system is in place. The principles that the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and the now Prime Minister articulated are fine principles, and we still support them. It is a pity that they did not mean them when they said them. It is a blatant breach of a promise. Any worker would have been entitled to think that—stated five times that I have quoted, and there are more if you want to go and look for them—this might have been a core promise.
`Okay,' you say, `it's just the Labor Party going on about the concern that this government is being unfair to workers. What about the employers?' The thing about this bill, and all such discriminatory bills, is that it is unfair to the decent employers as well because they have to compete with people who can now get away with the shonky practices. Most of the employers are decent employers. They never get caught up in this system. They do not have this problem. They have their staff with them for a long time. We all know workplaces like that in our own electorates. There are tens, dozens—hundreds of them. I suspect we all know because we see in our 
 electorate offices the people who suffer from the small number who are not in that category. Why should those decent employers who do the right things have to compete with the shonky operators? It is typical of what happens when you allow free play for the unreasonable few: they get an unfair advantage over the reasonable majority.
The last point I want to make goes to this question of whether this social price that I think is serious for many individuals and many families justified by the leap in employment will take place if we see this change. If there were going to be a great leap in employment, everybody would have to contemplate whether it was a price worth paying. You then get a cost-benefit analysis. It is a high price for some individuals but perhaps worth paying. But we can effectively measure that, because the government said that the previous unfair dismissal laws were really bad for business and they cost lots of jobs. They said at the time that the previous unfair dismissal laws were holding back enthusiastic employers from taking on workers because they were deterred by the unfair dismissal laws. In surveys taken, Recruitment Solutions said that 90 per cent of employers were not affected in their employment decisions by the existence of unfair dismissal laws, and Morgan and Banks said that at least 80 per cent of small businesses did not believe the existence of the unfair dismissal law adversely affected their decisions to employ new staff. The figure of 90 per cent is pretty high—you would like it to be 100—but of course it must be higher now because those surveys were taken under the previous government's laws, under the so-called Brereton laws. If you think your laws are so much better, then it must be more than 90 per cent now.
—You know the result of the Yellow Pages survey.
—Yes. Five per cent of small business are concerned about industrial laws in toto. That was the February 1997 Yellow Pages survey: five per cent of small businesses are concerned about industrial laws but 84 per cent are concerned that the lack of government action has failed to get the 
 economy moving. So that is the Yellow Pages. I remember that. I just quoted it.
—That is not right.
—Yes, you do not like that one. Selective quoting of documents—you really ought to do a bit of research before you come in. I know you are the parliamentary secretary, but that does not take you any—
—You are very selective in the way you use the facts.
—I just quoted them. If you do not like the facts—make them up. I understand that is a fairly traditional role here.
Let us have a look at this bill to change the unfair dismissal laws. The history is that there was no leap in employment when they were changed last time. The one state unqualified by state complication to the operation of the changed unfair dismissal laws is Victoria because there is no competing state system. Coincidental with the change of unfair dismissal laws, the rate of employment fell.
I do not argue cause and effect. I think it shows there was no leap. There was no suppressed enthusiasm for employment which burst forth when the previous unfair dismissal laws went. Nobody saw it anywhere in Australia. So we have not had that leap in employment, yet we have a proposed exemption which is blatantly inconsistent with the government's pre-election guarantees. That will only add to the prevailing sense of job insecurity, which does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of their merit, merely on the coincidence of your employment contract, which is fundamentally unfair to employees and to decent employers.
Australians today have what the Prime Minister promised they would have—not exactly what we wanted them to have but what the Prime Minister promised they would have—and that is the right of appeal if they are unfairly dismissed. We do not believe that right should be taken away from them, so notwithstanding the political context which I outlined at the beginning we will continue to oppose this legislation.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity tonight to be 
 the first government speaker in this Autumn session of parliament in 1998 to speak in defence of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] . This bill was first introduced in the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997 and passed on 28 August in the same year but, unfortunately, was rejected by the Senate on 21 October 1997.
The government is determined and committed to ensure that its small business unfair dismissal bill passes into law and, with that in mind, reintroduced this bill to the House of Representatives on 26 November 1997. Debate on the bill has now resumed in this chamber today, 2 March 1998.
The purpose of the bill is to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to exempt small businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the act. Only those employees who are hired after the commencement of this bill will be affected and the proposed law will not affect employees' rights in unlawful dismissal. I think that is an important point after some of the comments from the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan).
This is a very important point because `unfair dismissal' refers to those situations where an employer's conduct in bringing the employment to an end can be characterised as harsh, unjust or unreasonable. Unlawful, as opposed to unfair, dismissal—and I think the member for Canberra misses the point sometimes—includes dismissal for discriminatory reasons—and I believe I heard him say that workers would not have rights to appeal against discriminatory reasons—such as sexual preference, age, union membership, family responsibilities.
—Pregnancy.
—Pregnancy. It is also unlawful to dismiss a worker because they engaged in protected—that is, lawful—industrial action in negotiating a new certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement. None of these protections will be removed by the passing of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill.
The Howard government was elected in March 1996, two years ago today, with a 
 clear policy commitment to small business to further reform the federal termination laws. This is what small business wanted from the Howard government—and this is what the Howard government is going to deliver to small businesses and their workers. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was introduced on 23 May and was enacted into law, with amendments, on 31 December. The changes contained within this bill are necessary to ensure the continuing growth of employment in the small business area.
This is not an attack on workers. This is a positive initiative to allow small businesses to employ more employees with certainty and confidence. The present uncertainty that prevails throughout the small business industry over concerns about unfair dismissal cases is a hindrance to those seeking work. The changes contained within this bill are consistent with the government's stated policy—a policy which we took to the election, a policy which we fully announced prior to the last election and a policy which was endorsed overwhelmingly by the Australian community.
This bill reflects the special burdens that are carried by small business in defending unfair dismissal claims. Most small businesses do not have the time nor the resources to defend extensive unfair dismissal cases. In many cases, small businesses are owner operated—husband and wife or family businesses employing one, two or three employees. They do not have the resources of larger companies—personnel managers, barristers, qualified industrial relations people—to deal with unfair dismissal claims.
I know, speaking from experience as a small business operator, the concerns that one has when putting on new employees. My last business was a small general store and service station operating successfully on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Whilst only being a small business, we employed 12 casual people from our local community—and that was providing considerable work in our small village. When faced with the possibility of putting someone else on, it was always a concern of mine that I could be faced with an unfair dismissal case. In fact, there were many 
 times in our business when I needed to put additional employees on and I did not do so simply because of those concerns; instead, we battled on with the people we had and did the extra work ourselves rather than put an extra person on the books.
There has been much discussion in the national media over recent times about the possibility of a double dissolution. I noticed that the member for Canberra seemed to raise some sort of political analogy today that this was basically a smokescreen—that the government did not really want us to notice that we wanted to go to a double dissolution on the Wik legislation, on sensible land management for all Australians, and that this was just going to be a cover that we were trying to slip through.
The unfair dismissal amendments are important to the people of Australia, they are important to small business and they are important to the people who want work. Most importantly, they are important to this government. We are determined to see these amendments put back to the parliament; put back to the Senate. We do not want to go to a double dissolution on this issue, but we certainly are determined to get these amendments through.
If this 
	 Workplace Relations Amendment Bill
is rejected by the Senate again, it will be the first trigger for a double dissolution. The government, in reintroducing the bill, as I said before, does not want an election over this issue. It wants to see this problem rectified for small business and for those who are seeking work with small businesses.
The message from small business organisations throughout Australia is loud and clear. When the bill was reintroduced into the chamber last session by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, he quoted Rob Bastian of the Council for Small Business Organisations as saying that small business would be able to create an extra 50,000 jobs if this bill goes through the Senate. The Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce said that for the opposition to claim that there was not independent research proving business concerns over this issue is nonsense. It shows just how little attention they have paid to the 
 needs and concerns of the small business community.
The government commissioned its own research through the Yellow Pages Small Business Survey which, of course, is the largest economic survey of small businesses in Australia and covers some 1,200 small businesses. Seventy-nine per cent of proprietors of small businesses said that they would be better off if exempted from unfair dismissal laws; 33 per cent of those small businesses said that they would be more likely to recruit new employees had there been an exemption in 1996 and 1997; and 38 per cent of small businesses said that they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the current unfair dismissal laws.
The passage of this bill has the support of many small business organisations including COSBOA, the Federal Federation of Business and Professional Women, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Business Chamber, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Tasmanian Small Business Round Table and the micro-business consultative group. Of course it has the support of small business groups, because they want to get on with the job and they want to employ more people. The message is coming through loud and clear from small business: allow this bill to go through and allow them to employ more Australians.
The Labor Party and the Democrats claim that they are concerned about unemployment in this country. Yet they are the ones who presided over one million unemployed in Australia and took unemployment to over 11 per cent in this country—something that they very conveniently forget and hope that the Australian community will forget. It is something that I am going to ensure they do not forget about, because we do not want to go back to that situation again.
Now they are actively seeking to stop the passage of this legislation which will help small business employ more people and reduce unemployment levels. The trend unemployment in Australia now is 8.1 per 
 cent. It is still very serious. It is still a major issue. It is something that we are working to address, but it is the lowest unemployment rate that we have had in this country for seven years. We never hear that coming from the opposition. We never hear them say that we are doing something about unemployment. It is something that they were not able to do.
It is hypocritical for the Labor Party and the Democrats to block this bill. My electorate of Robertson is made up of thousands of small businesses—family businesses and partnerships all employing under 15 employees and all looking to expand. The government has created an investment environment for small business that we have not seen in this country for decades. We certainly did not see it under 13 years of Labor. We have record low inflation and record low interest rates. Businesses want to get on with the job of expanding, producing, exporting and, most importantly, employing Australians.
I hope the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is passed through the Senate. I appeal to senators, to the Democrats and to Senator Brian Harradine, in particular, to reconsider their opposition to this bill. This bill is not an attack on workers. This bill supports workers. It allows small business to escape from the fear of unfair dismissal claims and allows them to increase their employment. It is absolutely critical to small business that this legislation be passed through the Senate because this legislation, once and for all, will mean an end to Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal legislation for small businesses employing less than 50 people.
—What a farce. You are trying to amend your own bill. It is your law, you dope!
—Order! I think you should withdraw that comment.
—I withdraw.
—We are all aware that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business is all about economic growth and job creation. Small business generates one-third of the gross domestic product and accounts for 50 per cent of the 
 total employment in Australia. Over the past 10 years employment in the small business sector has been growing at a very strong rate—almost twice the rate of the national average.
I must place on record my disappointment at the comments by Senator Harradine in relation to the Workplace Relations Bill. On 21 October last year Senator Harradine said very little on the Workplace Relations Bill other than:
. . . this measure is arbitrary, unfair, unnecessary and uncalled for as witnessed by the low priority it has been given. It is hardly on the sheet as far as most businesses are concerned. The government have done what they needed to do. Anyone who has had experience in industrial relations will know that this measure is arbitrary, uncalled for, unfair and unnecessary. I am not going to grace it frankly with any further comments, other than to say I intend to vote against it.
I must express my disappointment and concern at those comments by Senator Harradine. I simply want to say to Senator Harradine that he is wrong. This bill is high priority. This bill is needed by small business. This bill is wanted by small business, and this bill is needed by the workers of Australia, particularly those who are unemployed and who wish to become meaningfully employed by small businesses in this country. I believe Senator Harradine is a fair minded man who looks at the issue and weighs up the issues. Again, I appeal to him to have another look at the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill with a view to passing it.
It is important to make very clear once again, particularly for the member for Canberra, the difference between unfair dismissal and unlawful dismissal. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill will amend parts of the act to enable small businesses employing no less than 15 workers to be exempt from the provisions for unfair dismissal. Unfair dismissal refers to the situation where the employer's conduct in bringing the employment relationship to an end can be characterised as harsh, unjust or unreasonable—which is certainly in contrast to unlawful dismissal. It is very clear that it is unlawful to dismiss workers for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. I know that it is wished that I 
 wind up my speech. I do have a great deal more that I would like to say on this subject.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—The contribution by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) clearly demonstrates one or two issues which need to be clarified from the outset. The first is that what people have to understand—whether they are in small business or whether they are out there listening to the debate in this parliament tonight—is that the laws proposed to be amended by this piece of legislation have nothing to do with Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton or Kim Beazley; they are the laws of Peter Reith and John Howard that were introduced and passed through this parliament in 1996.	 It was the law that came into being in Australia to govern people under industrial awards at the federal level that is operational in Australia from December 1996. All of this talk about Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws and that this is sweeping away the remnants of that is absolute nonsense. With the passage of the Workplace Relations Act in 1996, Laurie Brereton's laws as they were under industrial relations have gone. This government knows that is the case.
The member for Robertson, probably under instructions from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is the great master of disinformation in this place and in the broad community, constantly says to people that these are Laurie Brereton's laws that we have to change because he has left us this remnant of unfair dismissal and it is all at Laurie Brereton's feet. Quite clearly it is not. If it is at anybody's feet, it is at the feet of Peter Reith, the minister for workplace relations, because it was Minister Reith who introduced the legislation into this place. As was pointed out by my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), in the lead-up to the 1996 election along with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) he flatly ruled out any changes to unfair dismissal as far as small business was concerned. He flatly ruled it out.
The member for Canberra read a couple of quotes. Peter Reith on the ABC's Daybreak of 28 February 1996 said:
Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal . . .
On the John Laws show on 23 January 1996, the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, said:
. . . I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard-working employee.
Again, John Howard in an interview with Keith Conlon on ABC Radio on 25 January 1996 said:
I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed.
As the member for Canberra asked, where did they say that there are exemptions from unfair dismissal for small business? Where specifically did small business get singled out?
It is important again to put a few facts on the record about small business. The member for Robertson mentioned that most small businesses are micro businesses. That is right; about 50 per cent of small businesses are micro businesses—husband and wife operations, single persons working from home. As a consequence, they do not employ anyone. If 50 per cent of small businesses in Australia do not—
Mr Cadman interjecting—
—If the parliamentary secretary would only listen. I said that if they are a husband and wife not employing anyone, or if they are a micro business of one person not employing anyone, why would they be subject to these unfair dismissal laws? Are they going to sack themselves? The only laws that a husband and wife might come up against if they had a disagreement would not be in the Industrial Relations Court but in the Family Court. That is where they would sort out any problems on small business or unfair dismissal or any other issues.
The other factor that is important when you start to talk about small businesses is that this law that operates in Australia today operates only in respect of people covered under federal awards—except for Victoria, where they ceded their industrial relations power to the Commonwealth government, and I note 
 that South Australia is thinking about doing the same thing. For the moment, only people covered under federal awards and all employees in Victoria are potentially covered by the Workplace Relations Act that is operational in Australia and covers industrial relations.
If you took a genuine poll and saw genuine statistics from the Industrial Relations Commission, you would see that the workload of the commission under the existing legislation—the government's own legislation—is falling because the number of complaints registered for unfair dismissal is dropping off. That is a consequence of who is covered under the law. That is the second great bit of disinformation which the minister often puts out in the community. He says that everybody is picked up in Australia. Everyone is not picked up in Australia. You are picked up only if you are covered by federal awards or if you are a Victorian employee.
The other thing that is important in all of this is the nonsense that small business will hire only if they feel that they have the right to dismiss people. As I understand it—perhaps the parliamentary secretary will clarify the point if he is going to sum up on this bill, if not tonight then certainly tomorrow—it is written in the existing legislation that at the moment there is a three-month period of grace in which an employer can work out if their employee is up to the mark. If not, they can have separation and are not subject to unfair dismissal claims.
To my friend the member for Robertson who has come back into the chamber and who previously talked about his former life in a general store at a service station: I wonder whether he, as a former employer, when he sat down and worried about whether to put anyone on on a permanent basis or as another one of those 12 casuals he talked about, stopped to think that under his own legislation—the legislation of this government—he could put somebody on and if that person did not work out within three months that person could be let go, and there would be no claim on him as an employer. Did he ever stop to think that that would be the case?
I wonder what sort of an employer he would be if in the period of that three months 
 he could not work out whether somebody he had put on the payroll was going to work out—whether that person he put on was able to pump the gas, pump up the tyres, look after the general store and do all the sort of work that somebody would have to do in that particular role. If he could not work it out after three months, he must not be much of a manager. That is all I can say.
I say to the honourable member for Robertson—I am sure he is contemplating his future after the next election and will perhaps go back to the service station—that he would want to have a look at the proposals that his mate Minister Reith is putting forward in respect of changes to the Trade Practices Act, because his service station misses out on all the benefits of this so-called fair deal, raw deal, that the government has put up. He would want to have a look at that very carefully. Mr Deputy Speaker, I digressed for half a moment because I thought it was important given that he had come back into the place, and after the preselection of Senator Neal to run against him at the next election he should be looking for a new job.
I again come back to the bill and the changes. Why is it that the government decided once again to bring back into this place a change which they do not need and a change which their own committees examined and recommended against changing? I take people's memories back to when the Prime Minister, having won government in 1996, decided to seek a way in which to honour some of the commitments and promises he had made to the small business constituency. One they had said they were going to look at was ways to reduce the burden of red tape, reduce the compliance costs on small business. They had given a commitment that within three years the compliance costs would be cut by 50 per cent. So the Prime Minister said, `I know what I will do—when in doubt, form a committee.' So he did. He asked Charlie Bell, who was the Managing Director of McDonald's Australia, to form a committee to have a look at red tape. He brought down a report on that particular issue.
Interestingly enough, in that inquiry Mr Bell actually said to the Prime Minister and 
 the government, `You have only just brought in changes to the industrial relations system in Australia. You have only just brought in your own industrial relations legislation that has absolutely swept away anything Labor had in place.' He recommended that there be no changes to the Workplace Relations Act for a minimum period of 12 months until it had time to settle down. He specifically said in terms of small business, which he was examining, that unfair dismissal as part of that should be left to settle down.
The Prime Minister was not happy about that. When he brought his recommendations into the parliament in March 1997 he was dreaming up ways to add a bit of oomph to his statement. When he looked at the actual response to Charlie Bell's report, there was a lot of `Yes, we agree in principle', `We'll set up another inquiry to have a look at that' and `Oh, yes, not a bad idea but the government is not prepared to move on it just yet.' He thought to himself, `There's not much in this, is there? This is not going to give much oomph out there in the small business community that I promised to do so much for.' So he decided he would go for broke and say something about unfair dismissal when it came to small business. He decided that he would exempt small businesses of fewer than 15 employees from the provisions of the unfair dismissal laws.
The Prime Minister's laws had been in place a mere four months. Contrary to Charlie Bell's recommendations, the Prime Minister said, `Small business—what they need is exemptions from unfair dismissal laws because they will all rush out and employ people.' Rob Bastion came along and said, `Fifty thousand jobs will be created almost overnight.' Come on! What sort of an approach to industrial relations and small business policy development is that?
What we saw at the time was people in small business actually scratching their heads and saying, `We hadn't really thought that unfair dismissal was such a big issue with us any more. Here you are as a government. You promised the world to us. You said, ""We'll sweep away Laurie Brereton's laws and we'll put new ones in."" You have done that. Here 
 you were out there trumpeting the fact that you had this industrial relations triumph and four months later you said, ""Hang on, we didn't quite go far enough. We'll have to go and make one or two more changes. The constituency that is having a bit of a whinge because we really haven't done much is small business so, all right, we'll do something for them.""'
I will also say something to the minister, who unfortunately is not with us tonight. In question time today—once again as part of his general approach to take statements at face value and try to convince people if he says them often enough that they must be the truth—he said that I had been out talking to people. Once again, he said, `You've been talking to big business about small business and unfair dismissal.'
Again, let me say to the minister that in the last 12 months since I have had the opportunity and the privilege on this side to look after small business, I have spoken to small businesses and big businesses. I have spoken to people in Raymond Terrace, Townsville, Cairns, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Wollongong and in the Western suburbs of Sydney. I have spoken to small businesses, I have spoken to micro businesses and I have also spoken, as the minister pointed out, to Lend Lease and to Westfield to ask them their opinions on the changes that we were going to propose to some of the legislation that the government was proposing to introduce to put in place the `new deal, fair deal' concept with respect to retail tenancies and changes to the Trade Practices Act.
I am out there talking to these people and the minister is in here criticising me for talking to people. I have to say to his parliamentary secretary, `Look, you're right. You can go back and tell him that I have been out talking to all these people and micro businesses out in the electorate of my colleague the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield). I went out at his invitation and spoke to a number of wood turners out there about problems created by the government. I also went into the electorate of a number of my colleagues in South Australia. I have been down to Tasmania and spoken to very small 
 businesses about what they want.' I will tell honourable members what they wanted. They wanted more customers coming in the door. They wanted the promised reduction in the burden of red tape. They wanted to see some genuine government assistance. They did not want to see all the promises that had been made by a succession of failed ministers like Geoff Prosser and now the present minister who goes around disingenuously putting out information about what great things the government has done for small business. We have even seen that today. Today of all days! The parliamentary secretary should go to his minister and say, `What have you done here?'
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said in this place last year that he was going to fix the problem with this `new deal, fair deal' and the issues associated with uniform retail tenancy laws in particular. He rushed off on Friday, 5 December and saw all the state ministers. He sat them down and said, `We're going to bat on again with this industrial relations stuff but I'll tell you what else we are going to do. We are going to put in place the fact that it is you in the states who look after uniform retail tenancy stuff.' They said, `Whatever you say, Minister, because if we do not do this we are not going to get anything, are we?' He said, `Damn right, you're not. You sign up to this or you will get nothing.' Guess what? Three days ago his mate, the Liberal minister in Victoria, decided she could not wait for Peter Reith to get this uniform state agreement. She has introduced her own and she said, `As far as Peter Reith is concerned, I am not going to wait two or three years for that to happen.' So once again it is going to fall over.
—Could I suggest you will not wait for the minister either.
—The minister was caught out again in respect of that but he was also caught out on this industrial relations bill that we are debating here now. The member for Canberra did say something about the unfairness of this and the fact that ordinary working people and most employers in small business are decent hard-working individuals. There is not a problem. But from time to time there 
 are those individuals, as employers, who do not do the right thing. Deep down in his heart of hearts, the parliamentary secretary knows it. He knows that there is a need for some protection.
I might say, again, that both the Prime Minister and the minister for workplace relations knew that when they were in opposition. It was only a matter of a few weeks before the election that they said to the people of Australia, `We're not going to touch unfair dismissal laws in terms of small business. We reckon that workers need protection. We stand for the battlers.' Remember the Howard battlers, Mr Deputy Speaker, out there in voter land? These were the people that were going to get support from this government's industrial relations.
What do we have out of this now? We have a government coming in here and taking their own industrial relations law and conceding, in their view, that it is not working—we do not agree with that, and we do not see the necessity for this. We believe, in the words of the minister for workplace relations, Peter Reith, when he was in opposition, that the position was clear, that if you have been unfairly dealt with at work you should have a right of appeal. We reckon that is right.
—We took him at his word.
—We actually did take him at his word. As hard as it might be to accept now, we took him at his word then. We also took the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, at his word when he said, `I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent hardworking employee.'	 Dead right! That is what this side of the parliament is constantly going to stand up for and speak on behalf of. We will defend the rights of those decent hardworking employees and those decent employers in small business to get on with what they want to do—and that is to create jobs, make profits for themselves and have decent wages for their employees.
We believe there is no need to change this system. We have been through the arguments once before in this place. The government got rolled in the Senate last time round, and now here it is back again. One can only come to 
 the conclusion, as the member for Canberra has, that there must be other reasons. Are we talking about a double dissolution? Does the government want the technical trigger that is out there? Does the government want the technical trigger for the double dissolution—
—I think that may be right.
—My friend the member for Denison thinks that may be right, being a touch cynical as he is. But he thinks that may well be right. So the technical trigger provided by industrial relations fits very nicely in the minister's plans when it comes to IR. You cannot tell me he is walking around the waterfront with kid gloves. We know his approach to industrial relations. It is the same approach he used with small business organisations when he told them, `You cop what we're putting up or you'll get absolutely nothing.'
We know the tactics that this minister uses. We reject this legislation. It is not necessary; it is unjust; it is unfair; it will do nothing to improve the system. We look forward to continuing opposition to it in the Senate.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-02,"—If one needed any evidence of how out of touch with the Australian community the opposition is, one only had to listen to that very dull, dispirited performance by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I do not believe that he actually believes the kinds of comments that he has made. When one listens to what he has said and when one listens to what the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) has said, it is clear that these people are totally and completely out of touch with the Australian community.
The  Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  is being introduced in to the House after the Senate rejected it on 21 October last year. We welcome the opportunity to debate this bill yet again. This bill is the latest instalment in the rectification of the havoc wreaked on the Australian industrial scene by Laurie Brereton and the Australian Labor Party. Honourable members on both sides of the House would be well aware of the numbers of small business proprietors who have beaten tracks to their doors to complain about the small business situation, to com 
 plain about the unfair dismissals law which has put Australian small business in the situation of being prepared to do anything to avoid putting on extra staff.
The Labor Party, one would think, would ultimately learn. They were comprehensively rejected at the election on 2 March 1996—just two years ago—yet we find that the honourable member for Cunningham has the hide and the audacity to come into this place and defend the indefensible. He has sought to tell us that what the Labor Party did in the Senate was fair and reasonable. He has sought to tell us that it is right to condemn Australians to stay on the dole queue because the laws brought in by the Labor Party prevent small business from being prepared to give them a job.
—Shame!
—It is a shame; it is disgusting. Whenever the next election is, the Labor Party will pay very dearly for their refusal to accept reality. The honourable member for Canberra, in one of the flattest and most ordinary contributions—among many ordinary contributions he has made in this place—said:
This bill will take away rights from Australians . . . it will expose Australians to harsh, unfair and unreasonable dismissal.
What about the rights of young Australians to have a job? What about the rights of Australians who have been on the dole queue for a very long time? What about the rights of Australians who were condemned to unemployment by the Labor Party when we got to a situation where 11.2 per cent of Australians were unemployed when the former government was in office? What about that, Mr Deputy Speaker? Why won't they come in and apologise? Why won't they tell us why they were such a disaster?
The honourable member for Cunningham, who has run away from the chamber, said that this bill is an attack on decent hardworking employees. No-one wants to attack decent hardworking employees. No-one wants to make it difficult for them. This bill is all about a fair go for employers, particularly small business. We define small business for this purpose as those who employ 15 or fewer workers. 
—Just get rid of them. Don't care about their rights.
—You ought to apologise. Why are you condemning the young people of Hobart to being perpetually on the unemployment queues? Why won't you tell the Labor Party to pass this bill? Why won't you do it? You ought to apologise, my friend. You are a complete disaster. You owe an apology. In fact, you were one of the former ministers of the former government that was responsible for the fact that the Labor Party was defeated by such an enormous majority at the last election.
My friend, you really ought to keep quiet. You have nothing to crow about. You ought to be getting up here and apologising. But you are refusing to do so. What is more, when you vote against this bill in this place again you will once again indicate how out of touch you are with the Australian small business community.
We welcome the opportunity to debate this bill. If the Senate once again rejects it, we will have no apology about obtaining a double dissolution trigger because we are determined to make sure that this fair and reasonable reform becomes part of the law of this country. The Labor Party might seek to frustrate but the Labor Party will pay very dearly because this reform is fair and reasonable and needed.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-03-02,"—Many months after the government announced its multiple changes to aged care policies there remains considerable confusion amongst older Australians as to whether they can afford to go into a nursing home. New entrants to nursing homes will face complex income and assets tests that will apply from today. This confusion is being expressed right across the aged care industry—by clients, operators and service providers.
Nursing home vacancies have risen to their highest level in 25 years because of growing uncertainty amongst the elderly community about whether they can afford aged care. Nursing home operators, both private and non-profit, representing some 90 per cent of Australia's nursing homes, are threatening to take the government to court. They claim that contracts guaranteeing $90 million in funds for much needed improvements to nursing homes have been scrapped illegally.
The New South Wales College of Nursing has claimed that some nursing home residents could be forced back into hospital because homes stand to lose money under the federal government's aged care reforms. A study into the new method of classifying the case needs of elderly residents conducted by the research company Latea Pty Ltd found that they were classified in a way that attracted less funding. These multiple changes to government policy have still not removed the possibility that some people may have to sell their family home to pay accommodation charges for nursing homes.
Australia's population is ageing rapidly. In 1996, some 12 per cent of the Australian population was over the age of 65. By the year 2016, this figure will increase to 16 per cent over 65. Even though on these figures more Australians will be in need of nursing home care, this government continues to reduce its contribution to this very vital area of health care.
The present reform debate has been carried out against a backdrop of the federal government's disgraceful $500 million cuts to aged care services. While there are many excellent nursing homes—and in Greenway they are outstanding—the standard between these and the general run of nursing homes is deteriorating. According to Francis Sullivan, Executive Director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, over 15 per cent of nursing homes fail to meet fire and safety regulations. Many nursing homes have been unable to keep up with building and refurbishing programs because of lack of support from this government.
Against this background, on top of the $4,380 a year accommodation charge, the 
 government is introducing a means tested daily fee for self-funded retirees and part-pensioners, which represent some 35 per cent of nursing home residents. These fees could be up to $63 a day. Ninety per cent of nursing home residents are pensioners, and over 70 per cent of these are women whose average age is 85. Therefore, there is a severe limitation on the financial contribution that these people will be able to make towards the provision of their aged care needs.
These new charges will not add one extra dollar to the care of the aged and will not add one extra dollar to the capital needs of nursing homes. They are purely and simply the result of budget cuts. Whether the government likes it or not, in real terms they are an appalling tax on the frail and elderly. What the general public is demanding very strongly from this government is a fair and reasonable aged care policy which builds a community spirit and provides dignified care for the elderly. The government should immediately abandon its cuts to aged care services and at least restore and then maintain the level of funding that applied under the Labor government until all nursing homes are able to reach acceptable standards. The government should also exempt short-stay nursing home residents from paying the accommodation charges. Nursing home care should equally be available to all Australians based on their clinical needs, irrespective of the financial capacity of any of them to meet the cost demands.
The views that I have expressed in this adjournment debate are clearly summed up in an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. The headline says `Empty beds as rising fees hit nursing homes'. The article goes on to say:
Frail aged people are staying at home or in hospital to avoid a swag of nursing home charges under the Federal Government's user-pays policies—and yesterday's increase is likely to accelerate the trend, according to industry and consumer groups.
