Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:42):  Never before in the history of the Senate have the provisions of the standing orders been so abused under this new Kevin Rudd government. It was bad enough under the Julia Gillard government, but it is even worse under Mr Rudd. Today we have had a motion rammed through dealing with changes to the Privileges Committee, which is the most important committee of this place, which makes recommendations in relation to penalties to be imposed on senators. Just as these tax bills will be guillotined in a matter of 17 minutes, so these people opposite—the Greens-Labor alliance—have guillotined a decision in relation to the most important committee of this place.


Honourable senators will recall that, during question time this week, I asked the now deposed Leader of the Government in the Senate whether any deal had been done with the Australian Greens to get their agreement, their connivance, to move this unprecedented guillotine of over 55 bills this week. Senators will also recall that, in the term of the Howard government, 2004-07, when we had a majority in the Senate, only 32 bills in three years were guillotined. Here this week the Senate is being abused, with 55 bills being guillotined.


But not content with guillotining bills through this place, those opposite—the Labor Party—are now doing the dirty work for the Australian Greens, sponsoring Greens' motions as government business. So we had to have the pantomime of the Thespian Senator Bob Carr, at question time, claiming to attack the Greens. What a pathetic act that was, when we now see the dirty, sleazy deals that are done behind closed doors, away from the microphones. When I asked Senator Conroy, 'Can you give an assurance that no deal has been done with the Greens in relation to the guillotine?' he studiously avoided the question. He did not deny the allegation. We now know why. It is because the government has agreed to sponsor this outrageous motion that will set in train a system for the Privileges Committee on the very last day of this parliament.


What is the urgency? Nobody can tell us. What is the urgency to put this in the standing orders to give the Greens a permanent position on the Privileges Committee? There is no answer other than that it is the basis of a dirty sleazy deal. So on the very last day of this parliament there are the Australian Labor Party and the Greens: they may have publicly ripped up the marriage certificate, but they are still co-habiting and behaving exactly as they want. It is a raw abuse of the power of this place.


Here we are debating a tax bill and the whole Senate is given less than 20 minutes to discuss its provisions. Then, after that, we will have another 11-plus bills—guillotine, guillotine, guillotine.


And I say to the empty press gallery: it is a disgrace. But I will give one compliment to the ABC, because we are being broadcast courtesy of the ABC, and so some people in Australia will get to understand the gross hypocrisy of some of the scribes in the press gallery who wrote column after column after column condemning the Liberal and National Party majority in the Senate for the outrage against democracy for forcing 32 bills through the Senate. Where are their fingers on the keyboards when this disgraceful Greens-Labor alliance guillotines not 32, not 64, not 96 but 216 bills, and then rorts the Privileges Committee to boot on the very last day of the parliament? They are trying to future-proof the position of the Greens and the Labor Party in the event that the Australian people decide to change the government. This is raw abuse. The Australian people need to understand that the so-called country Independents in the other place did nothing against this raw abuse and nor did the Greens. Indeed, the Greens were active participants.


So the question for the Australian people at the next election will be a very simple one: whom do you trust to safeguard the role of the Senate as a house of review, to have the checks and balances in place on its powerful Privileges Committee and to respect the role of the Senate? The Liberal and National parties are clearly the best custodians of the role of the Senate. The Greens and the ALP have been shown to be the exact opposite. An unprecedented number of bills have been guillotined throughout this parliament—over 200. This week alone there were 55 bills—in one week, one and a half times the number of bills that the Howard government did in three years. Am I saying that the guillotine should never be used? Of course not. All this argument is about is a sense of proportion, a sense of decorum and a sense of decency. What we know about those opposite is that those qualities mean nothing to them. They are completely foreign to them. If you have the numbers you use them.


What better example do we have other than your newly elected leader, who said to the people only months ago: 'I am a man of integrity and of my word. I will not challenge for the leadership.' You know why he was a man of integrity at that time? It was because he did not have the numbers. But as soon as he had the numbers: 'The Australian people demand it of me.' And so he breaks his solemn promise to the Australian people. What is more with those opposite, we have now seen the faceless man Bill Shorten becoming the two-faced man, with blood on both hands. This is the morality of the government. This is the standard of the government. Well may they change their leader, because they have not changed their morality, they have not changed their decency and they have not changed their respect, or disrespect I should say, for this place. It is situation normal, just with a different face: a bloke wearing a blue tie—whatever that might mean.


The role of the Senate is vital in our federal system of government; it is one of the vital checks and balances. One of the good-news stories is that, if the Liberal and National parties were to one day gain a majority in the Senate, we would actually allow our members to cross the floor and represent their states. In this parliament have you ever seen the Greens, who claim to be quasi-Independents, split? Have they ever crossed the floor?



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Have you ever seen the Labor Party do that? Of course not, because they are corralled by their socialist dogma that everybody has to give in to the majority, irrespective of the issue of the day. We, in the Liberal and National parties, believe in the individual right of people to cross the floor. We believe in the role of the Senate. We see the importance of the role of the Senate as a house of review, as a states' house, and that is why we are so angry today at the way this important institution has been so willingly abused by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens. It beggars belief when you hear the commentary from Senator Christine Milne, the Leader of the Australian Greens, when she condemned the Howard government, and the comments of Senator Conroy and others.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Yes, the word 'hypocrite' does come to mind, Senator Ian Macdonald, but of course that would be unparliamentarily so I will not use it. Those listening might think that that is exactly the label that should be stuck on the foreheads of Senator Christine Milne, Senator Penny Wong and all their followers in this place.


The bill that is before us will allow individuals to withdraw excess contributions above the concessional contribution cap. It will apply an interest charge to individuals who exceed the cap, to account for the income tax that would have been paid if the amounts had been taken as wages or salary. And so the list goes on. The question is: if this is such good legislation, why is it that the Labor Party and the Australian Greens do not want to ventilate the provisions of this legislation and all the other legislation? If you are so proud of your legislative agenda and if you are so proud of the things you are trying to ram through the parliament, wouldn't you be saying, 'Let's have an extra week or two of sittings so that all of these wonderful policies of ours can be fully ventilated, and so that the Australian people can see what a great government we really are—how we really are serving the welfare of the people of Australia'? But they know that they are not. They are ramming through legislation after legislation that is not within the best interests of the Australian people.


Last night we saw the ramming through of extra provisions in relation to the right of entry laws, giving union bosses—believe it or not—even more power. Having made a solemn promise that the right of entry rules would remain, in 2007, they gave union bosses an extra 157 powers in the Fair Work Act—a complete breach of promise—and then last night they gave them an extra power to invade every lunch room in this country. They are so proud of it that they wanted to guillotine it and restrict debate, because they do not want the Australian people to know about it. My friend and colleague Senator George Brandis reminded me just before we came into the chamber that, in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, there was a matter of such importance that those opposite wanted to ventilate before the public that they called for public submissions. Great! The only problem: 40 hours to get your submissions in—not even two days. Not only do they rort the legislative agenda with their raw abuse of the guillotine, not only do they rort the Privileges Committee—they rort the committee system as a whole. If you have the numbers, according to the Green-Labor alliance, you use them, you abuse them and you achieve whatever end you want irrespective of how unprincipled or how unprecedented it is.


That should not surprise anybody, because we have seen it from the very top of this government with Mr Rudd, who made a solemn promise that he would never challenge while he did not have the numbers, but he never told us that that was the caveat so here he is challenging and getting the leadership in complete breach of that solemn promise. Should that surprise us? His predecessor got into power saying there will be no carbon tax and then she implemented one. Mr Rudd said he would not challenge and then did challenge, and now he is Prime Minister. Their two top people have got into their position through deceit. The honour of an individual, the strength of character of an individual, is that if you have made a promise you stick by it no matter how it hurts.


The best example of that was the former Prime Minister John Howard, who genuinely changed his mind on the goods and services tax. He had made a solemn promise to the Australian people, so what did he do? He went back to the Australian people and said, 'I am not going to abuse my position of Prime Minister and implement a GST; I am going back to you with a promise that, should you re-elect me, I will implement a GST.' That is a stark example of the difference in character, in integrity and honesty, between leadership of the coalition and leadership of the ALP. When we come to the next election I would call upon the Australian people to consider who they trust. Do they trust a man who deceives his own leader and says 'I will not challenge, I am a man of honour', and then does challenge, or, if they get rid of him again and reinstall Ms Gillard, a lady who said there will be no carbon tax and then implemented one? Or do they trust a coalition that when it did have the numbers in this place used them in a measured manner to ensure that the institution of the Senate and the parliament was protected, a party that has in its makeup, in its DNA, a respect for the Australian electorate so that when you make a solemn promise like 'no GST' you do not implement one without first getting a separate deliberate mandate from the Australian people, without being open and honest and upfront with them?


In my area of workplace relations, the Labor Party demanded at the last election that there should be no changes to the Fair Work Act; they had the balance absolutely right—they had negotiated with employers and employees; they said they had the balance right. They got back in, with the connivance of the Australian Greens and the country Independents, and 400 pages of amendments to the Fair Work Act have been passed by the 43rd parliament—in complete breach of their promise and their assertion to the Australian people that the Fair Work Act was perfect and did not need amending. Here we are, 400 pages later. Having got the balance right between employers and employees in the original Fair Work Bill that was not to be touched, we now have 400 pages oozing with deals and privileges for the trade union bosses—no balance anymore; a complete breach of promise to the Australian electorate.


As we get into the dying hours of this parliament and of this sitting week, the Australian people have a stark contrast between an opposition that has a real solutions plan that has been put out to the Australian people for them to consider in detail, and a government that is riven and driven by revenge, personality and hostilities, without an agenda for the nation other than two items on Mr Rudd's agenda: revenge within and attack on Tony Abbott without. If he were to be Prime Minister after the next election, he would sit back and say, 'My great achievement is to deny Mr Abbott the prime ministership.' That sort of relentless negativity is not acceptable.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:21):  I move:




That standing order 18 establishing the Committee of Privileges be amended as follows:





(a) in paragraph (1), omit 
""
7
""
, substitute 
""
8
""
; and





(b) omit paragraph (3), substitute:





(3) The committee shall consist of 8 senators, 4 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and 1 nominated by a minority party and independent senators.





Senator MILNE:
  For the purposes of the debate, I would like to indicate that the motion seeks for standing order 18, establishing the Committee of Privileges, to be amended so that the committee would consist of eight senators—four nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, three nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and one nominated by a minority party and Independent senators. There is a very good reason for moving this amendment today, and that is to represent the democratic wishes of the Australian people and in particular in terms of the representation here in the Senate.


The current membership of the Privileges Committee is under a temporary order of the Senate that was passed in October 2011 without any opposition from any party or Independent in the chamber, and it has been working well ever since. It is an accepted practice with Senate committees that they should be reflective of the composition of the chamber. Every other substantive Senate committee has got crossbench representation. For example, if you consider the legislation committees or the references committees, the Procedure Committee or the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests, all have crossbench representation—minor party and/or Independent representation. The Privileges Committee is the odd one out. As I indicated, that was changed by temporary order in 2011 and it has worked extremely well. There can be no argument in democratic representation. The Senate committee system is indeed one of its great strengths. I think all of us in here who have served—and everybody does from time to time—on the various committees will recognise that the strength of the Senate is having all the views in this Senate represented and given voice on those committees. The committee system has worked well.


There are some of us who were here in the Senate when the Howard government had control of both houses of the federal parliament. We saw then a change to the committee system for the worst. I remember that, when I was first elected here and took my seat in 2005, Senator Siewert and I moved for references on a number of occasions. One in particular was the impact of climate change on Australia's agricultural industries. It took us years before the Senate would finally agree to that, because it was blocked as a result of the majority that the Howard government had in both houses of parliament and they did not want to have the views of the alternative voices in the parliament considered, and yet now everybody across Australia's rural and regional communities understands the impacts of climate change that they are already suffering, and we could have been dealing with that years earlier if we had not been blocked from doing so. No-one will forget that the change to the committee system that occurred then gave the government control of all Senate committees. That has fortunately changed back, and I would hate to think that there were any prospects in the future, after such a bad experiment, that Senate committees would not reflect the make-up of the Senate. It is on that basis that I argue strongly that the Privileges Committee does need to represent—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Before we vote on this, I think it is very important that, when Senator Milne talks about minor parties, she points out whether she is referring to the Greens—or does that include the National Party?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Joyce. Senator Milne, you have the call.




Senator MILNE:
  It certainly is true that the National Party is a minor party. If that is how they wish to describe themselves, well and good—and the Australian Greens outpoll them all over the country—but I do not think that is relevant to the point I make in terms of representation on Senate committees. In fact, the opposition parties are represented on all Senate committees, as they should be, but the minor parties and Independents are not represented on the Privileges Committee. That is why I am arguing that the Privileges Committee ought to come into line with all the other Senate committees and have representation from the crossbenches. 


I think it is particularly important that we have this matter settled, because it would not be appropriate that we go to an election with a temporary order in place with a view to it lapsing without making a decision about permanency. I would like to hear from anyone who says that democracy is not well served by having representation from the crossbenches on the Privileges Committee. It would be grossly unfair if it were deemed that the Privileges Committee were the plaything of the two old parties. 



Senator Joyce interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  It is interesting; the lack of courtesy that is being extended by the likes of Senator Joyce just gives you an idea of the born-to-rule mentality that exists in this parliament. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  It is most unfortunate that members of the opposition cannot extend other people the courtesy of being able to be heard in silence, which the standing orders require. Having said that, I think it is important that we settle this matter, that we change the membership of the Privileges Committee on a permanent basis so that we end up with a fair representation which shows that the crossbench has a percentage of members in this place and that that percentage of members needs to be represented in all of the Senate committees.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr President, on a point of order, I cannot hear what Senate Milne is saying because of the rabble on that side screaming across the chamber. I would ask you to ask them to desist.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind honourable senators that a senator speaking is entitled to be heard in silence. Senator Milne, you are to continue. 




Senator MILNE:
  As this motion indicates, I think it is time we made a decision on the Privileges Committee—that the membership be permanently changed so that it reflects the make-up of the Senate and that the crossbench has representation on the committee—because that is the only fair and decent thing to do and brings it into line with all of the other Senate committees. (Time expired)




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, on a point of order: I circulated an amendment to this motion. It has been circulated to all honourable senators. I simply ask: are we really to believe that the deals that have been done today will stop the longstanding precedent and principle that all proposed changes to standing orders go to the Procedures Committee? That has been the practice each and every time there has been a change to standing orders in this place. This proposal has not been to the Procedures Committee, and I simply say to those opposite, especially the ALP: be exceptionally careful. I am just asking for your guidance, Mr President, as to whether this motion will allow that strong principle, that strong precedent that has been followed by everybody, to just be tossed out the window like a soiled tissue, discarded without any thought.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The clock had ticked over to 2.30 pm, and in accordance with the resolution of the Senate, I will proceed to the next business.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:21):  I move:




That standing order 18 establishing the Committee of Privileges be amended as follows:





(a) in paragraph (1), omit 
""
7
""
, substitute 
""
8
""
; and





(b) omit paragraph (3), substitute:





(3) The committee shall consist of 8 senators, 4 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and 1 nominated by a minority party and independent senators.





Senator MILNE:
  For the purposes of the debate, I would like to indicate that the motion seeks for standing order 18, establishing the Committee of Privileges, to be amended so that the committee would consist of eight senators—four nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, three nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and one nominated by a minority party and Independent senators. There is a very good reason for moving this amendment today, and that is to represent the democratic wishes of the Australian people and in particular in terms of the representation here in the Senate.


The current membership of the Privileges Committee is under a temporary order of the Senate that was passed in October 2011 without any opposition from any party or Independent in the chamber, and it has been working well ever since. It is an accepted practice with Senate committees that they should be reflective of the composition of the chamber. Every other substantive Senate committee has got crossbench representation. For example, if you consider the legislation committees or the references committees, the Procedure Committee or the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests, all have crossbench representation—minor party and/or Independent representation. The Privileges Committee is the odd one out. As I indicated, that was changed by temporary order in 2011 and it has worked extremely well. There can be no argument in democratic representation. The Senate committee system is indeed one of its great strengths. I think all of us in here who have served—and everybody does from time to time—on the various committees will recognise that the strength of the Senate is having all the views in this Senate represented and given voice on those committees. The committee system has worked well.


There are some of us who were here in the Senate when the Howard government had control of both houses of the federal parliament. We saw then a change to the committee system for the worst. I remember that, when I was first elected here and took my seat in 2005, Senator Siewert and I moved for references on a number of occasions. One in particular was the impact of climate change on Australia's agricultural industries. It took us years before the Senate would finally agree to that, because it was blocked as a result of the majority that the Howard government had in both houses of parliament and they did not want to have the views of the alternative voices in the parliament considered, and yet now everybody across Australia's rural and regional communities understands the impacts of climate change that they are already suffering, and we could have been dealing with that years earlier if we had not been blocked from doing so. No-one will forget that the change to the committee system that occurred then gave the government control of all Senate committees. That has fortunately changed back, and I would hate to think that there were any prospects in the future, after such a bad experiment, that Senate committees would not reflect the make-up of the Senate. It is on that basis that I argue strongly that the Privileges Committee does need to represent—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Before we vote on this, I think it is very important that, when Senator Milne talks about minor parties, she points out whether she is referring to the Greens—or does that include the National Party?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Joyce. Senator Milne, you have the call.




Senator MILNE:
  It certainly is true that the National Party is a minor party. If that is how they wish to describe themselves, well and good—and the Australian Greens outpoll them all over the country—but I do not think that is relevant to the point I make in terms of representation on Senate committees. In fact, the opposition parties are represented on all Senate committees, as they should be, but the minor parties and Independents are not represented on the Privileges Committee. That is why I am arguing that the Privileges Committee ought to come into line with all the other Senate committees and have representation from the crossbenches. 


I think it is particularly important that we have this matter settled, because it would not be appropriate that we go to an election with a temporary order in place with a view to it lapsing without making a decision about permanency. I would like to hear from anyone who says that democracy is not well served by having representation from the crossbenches on the Privileges Committee. It would be grossly unfair if it were deemed that the Privileges Committee were the plaything of the two old parties. 



Senator Joyce interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  It is interesting; the lack of courtesy that is being extended by the likes of Senator Joyce just gives you an idea of the born-to-rule mentality that exists in this parliament. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  It is most unfortunate that members of the opposition cannot extend other people the courtesy of being able to be heard in silence, which the standing orders require. Having said that, I think it is important that we settle this matter, that we change the membership of the Privileges Committee on a permanent basis so that we end up with a fair representation which shows that the crossbench has a percentage of members in this place and that that percentage of members needs to be represented in all of the Senate committees.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr President, on a point of order, I cannot hear what Senate Milne is saying because of the rabble on that side screaming across the chamber. I would ask you to ask them to desist.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind honourable senators that a senator speaking is entitled to be heard in silence. Senator Milne, you are to continue. 




Senator MILNE:
  As this motion indicates, I think it is time we made a decision on the Privileges Committee—that the membership be permanently changed so that it reflects the make-up of the Senate and that the crossbench has representation on the committee—because that is the only fair and decent thing to do and brings it into line with all of the other Senate committees. (Time expired)




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, on a point of order: I circulated an amendment to this motion. It has been circulated to all honourable senators. I simply ask: are we really to believe that the deals that have been done today will stop the longstanding precedent and principle that all proposed changes to standing orders go to the Procedures Committee? That has been the practice each and every time there has been a change to standing orders in this place. This proposal has not been to the Procedures Committee, and I simply say to those opposite, especially the ALP: be exceptionally careful. I am just asking for your guidance, Mr President, as to whether this motion will allow that strong principle, that strong precedent that has been followed by everybody, to just be tossed out the window like a soiled tissue, discarded without any thought.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The clock had ticked over to 2.30 pm, and in accordance with the resolution of the Senate, I will proceed to the next business.

The speech read as follows—



I rise today to read the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013 for the second time.




Commitment to early childhood



This Government has a proud record of achievement in early childhood education and care.


Core to our values is giving every child an opportunity to succeed and we have consistently demonstrated throughout the last six years, our commitment to improving the outcomes for all Australian children.


With more Australian children in education and care than ever before and a compelling body of evidence showing that 90 per cent of a child's brain development happens in these critical years, we want to give our children the best start in life.


Australian and international research shows that having educators with higher qualifications is closely associated with improved outcomes for children. More highly qualified staff means a greater understanding of early childhood development so staff are more able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them learn and develop.


This Bill acknowledges that commitment by securing for these educators the necessary recognition of their professionalism and to reward them accordingly with higher wages.


At the heart of this Bill is this Government's commitment to quality early childhood education, a commitment to early childhood education that is accessible and affordable and a commitment to having a highly qualified early childhood workforce.




Quality



The Government's commitment to quality early childhood education is evidenced by our leadership in establishing the National Quality Framework for early childhood education and care.


The National Quality Framework is an important reform which delivers a higher standard of care for children in the critical areas of educational development, health and safety and social interactions. It provides clear and comprehensive information for families so they can make informed choices about which service is best for their child.


The National Quality Standard improves quality through improved educator-to-child ratios, stronger educator qualification requirements and a new quality rating system.


Quality early childhood education and care ensures that children are happy, engaged and learning with qualified educators who are nurturing and caring. It means children are in safe and stimulating learning environments. When parents drop off their children, they need to do so with confidence that their child will be cared for and educated in the best way possible.


We have recently seen the first ratings published on the website giving parents more information to help them chose the service that meets their needs.


The NQF is a fundamental and long lasting reform. Ensuring improved quality of early childhood education and care will produce long term improved productivity and economic prosperity for Australia.


The Early Years Quality Fund will support the implementation of the NQF by assisting providers to offer educators higher wages consistent with changes in staff to child ratios and the increased qualification requirements of the NQF.




Affordability and Accessibility



This Government has been working hard to ensure that quality early childhood education and care remains affordable and accessible for all Australians families.


Over the next four years the Government will invest a record $25 billion in early childhood education and care, of which $22.1 billion will be in direct child care assistance to parents, more than triple the investment in the four years prior to 2007, making improvements to the lives of children and families.


But we know that affordability is only part of the story and that accessibility to quality services is critical.


We have recognised that early childhood education and care is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour.


We understand that services must be more responsive to the varying needs of families. That's why Child Care Rebate and Child Care Benefit can be used for a range of flexible approved child care services.


The Australian Government is trialling new ways to make child care more flexible for families, such as extending opening hours in long day care centres.


Our commitment to accessible quality early childhood education and care is also evidenced by the Government's investment of nearly $970 million between 2008 and 2013 to provide all children in the year before school access to a quality pre-school education delivered by a qualified early childhood teacher.


Recent data shows that because of this investment 266,000 four and five year old children were enrolled in a program in the year before full-time school in 2012. This is 60,000 more children enrolled in 2012 than in 2008


In this year's budget, the Government announced a further $660 million to extend the universal access commitment to quality early childhood education in the year before school to the end of 2014.


This brings the total funding to over $1.6 billion to area that was neglected prior to 2007.


It is with pride that I can also say that the early childhood education and care Closing the Gap target will be met this year. In 2008 we pledged to deliver access to early childhood education to all indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities within five years.


This year, 2013, we will meet that target. I am proud to be a part of a Government that not only set ambitious long term goals, but provided the funding and leadership to achieve that goal.




Quality Workforce



Every day thousands of committed and dedicated early childhood professionals help to prepare Australian children for the world around them, providing a nurturing, caring and supporting environment. An environment where every child gets the opportunity to learn, grow  and develop at their own pace, with people interested only in helping them be the best they can be.


We know these critical early years mean so much to a child's future learning and we owe it to both the children and families using early childhood education and those that educate and care for them to do all that we can to recognise and reward the important work that they do.


With over 615,000 children in long day care in Australia to the September quarter of last year the benefit to the community is enormous.


And, in addition to the critical work educating children, educators are crucial in upholding the economic stability of the country through increased workforce participation and greater security of employment, especially for women.


I am proud of this Government's record in assisting the early childhood workforce, through programs such as:


The TAFE Fee Waiver—which enables students to obtain a diploma or advanced diploma in children services without paying fees.


The Recognition of Prior Learning initiative—which provides grants of up to $3500 to enable educators to have the skills they have acquired through working in the sector recognised and enable them to obtain or upgrade their qualifications.


The HECS-HELP initiative—which provides funding to reduce the Higher Education Loan Program debts of early childhood education teachers who work in areas of high need, such as remote areas.


The Inclusion and Professional Support Program—through which the educators and services receive professional development and support to enhance the provision of quality early childhood education and care services.



Early Years Quality Fund



In bringing this Bill here today, the Government continues this record of achievement in early childhood through securing a professional workforce that will ensure higher quality education and care for Australian children.


To complement the vital work that this Government has done to improve accessibility, affordability and quality of early childhood education and care, this Bill establishes a $300 million Early Years Quality Fund to support quality outcomes for children by assisting the early childhood services to attract and retain qualified hard working professionals in the sector and reduce the numbers of educators leaving the sector overall.


The Fund, which will operate for two years, will enable grants to be paid services to supplement wage increases of all educators and staff assisting in the provision of quality early childhood education and care.


The fund will ensure higher wages across all classification scales, providing an incentive for educators to further their careers by attaining higher qualifications.


This Bill will be the difference between some of the best and brightest in the sector staying in their vitally important profession, or leaving for higher wages in sectors such as retail or administration.


The Early Years Quality Fund will assist with maintaining the affordability of early childhood education, along with the Government's substantial financial assistance to families through Child Care Benefit and Child Care Rebate, while ensuring the high quality of education and care for children.


All Long Day Care centres approved for Child Care Benefit can apply for the funding. Eligible services must demonstrate a commitment to improve quality outcomes for children, including workforce plans to attract and retain qualified staff.


But we know that this Fund is the first step in the increased professional recognition of the early childhood education and care workers.  That is why, the Government also announced the establishment of the Pay Equity Unit in the Fair Work Commission


The Pay Equity Unit will undertake research and data collection to inform matters related to pay equity under the Fair Work Act, modern award reviews and annual minimum wage decisions.


The Early Years Quality Fund and the Pay Equity Unit build on the record of achievement in the Social and Community Services and the Aged Care sectors.  The Government has achieved significant outcomes with respect to pay equity, but is committed to do more to close the gender gap and assist workers in low paid sectors, who are usually women, to improve wages and gain the professional recognition they deserve.


The Early Years Quality Fund will give a much needed wage increase to our professional, hard-working qualified early childhood educators, ensuring that they not only feel valued, but that their value to the Australian community is reflected in their pay checks.


The Fund continues the Government's commitment to economic growth and jobs, supporting parents to remain in the workforce, increasing skills across the workforce and building a productive future for our children.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-06-28,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (14:32):  I rise to speak on the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill 2013. I have to say, those on the other side must be exceptionally happy that (a) we are already at three minutes past 2.30 pm and (b) the guillotine falls on this bill at 2.45 pm today. And why do I say that? I say it because there are some bills that have been rushed through this place so quickly that the Australian public will not know what the details of the bills are. In relation to this bill, there is no way those on the other side and their grubby little friends in their alliance, the Greens—and we have just seen the Greens' grubbiness and hypocrisy on show in this place in relation to the motion that was just before the Senate—




Senator Milne:
  Mr Deputy President, a point of order: I refer you to the rules of debate, and particularly to standing order 193, and ask that Senator Cash withdraw reference to 'grubbiness' in relation to other senators, because that is clearly a personal reflection on members or officers of this house.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cash, it would assist if you were prepared to withdraw that.




Senator CASH:
  Absolutely, Mr Deputy President. I withdraw the statement in relation to grubbiness. But I will say that they are hypocrites. By their very actions in accepting the largest political donation of all time—the $1.6 million that they accepted from Mr Graeme Wood—they are well and truly able to be described as hypocrites. In fact, some may say, in relation to those people who speak with forked tongue and stand up in this place and say one thing and then do another, that those actions are grubby little actions.


But in relation to this particular bill, which the Greens are joining with Labor today to support, this is probably one of the greatest travesties of justice that is ever to go through this place. By this bill, Labor and their little friends the Greens are throwing a few crumbs at the lowest-paid workers in Australia and they are acting as if those few crumbs are gold. When you read the details of this legislation, it becomes apparent that the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill is nothing more and nothing less than a con.


The United Voice union was having trouble signing up members, so what did it do? It went to its union mates in the government and said, 'We need some money', and a deal was done to give United Voice what is in effect $300 million, which they will have access to through this fund. And then what did United Voice do? They went on a membership drive, and do you know what they said? They blatantly misled the lowest-paid workers in Australia—those who work in the child-care industry—and they sent out the following propaganda. They sent out a document that stated: 'How does my centre qualify for the money that they can get under the fund? This is how you qualify: you join United Voice.' Well, no, actually—you do not need to join United Voice to get access to this fund. United Voice then negotiates a new EBA, because—guess what? One of the conditions of this fund is that the childcare centre has to have an EBA. And guess what? Only 20 per cent of childcare centres in Australia have an EBA—knocking out, overnight, 80 per cent of childcare centres in Australia. They automatically do not qualify for this fund unless United Voice negotiates an EBA on their behalf. They then say the owner-operator signs an agreement with the government. And guess what the end process is? You get a raise. That is blatantly misleading the lowest-paid workers in Australia. The Labor Party and their little friends in the Green movement know full well that less than 40 per cent of those in the childcare sector will get any share of these funds—less than 40 per cent.


So when they stand up in this place and they say that they are getting a raise for the lowest-paid workers in Australia and they have the audacity to then send out propaganda to those workers indicating that they will all get a raise, that is an absolute disgrace. It shows just how low those on the other side will go to blatantly mislead those vulnerable people in the childcare sector who actually believed that this legislation was going to give them a pay rise. That is completely, totally and utterly incorrect. There is only $300 million going into this fund. There are exceptionally strict guidelines under which a childcare centre in Australia can apply for the funds—which automatically, in relation to the EBA, knocks out over 80 per cent of childcare centres in Australia.


But worse than that even the former minister—the minister had to resign because he could not serve under the current Prime Minister, Mr Rudd—Minister Garrett claimed that 68,000 people may or may not be entitled to the pay rise. Media reports say that it is closer to a workforce of 78,000. But guess what? When at estimates we asked the department how many childcare workers in Australia would potentially qualify for these funds, do you know what the department said? They said, 'We actually don't know.' But they could confirm one thing: they could confirm that 40 per cent or fewer of the childcare sector will qualify for the funds. Do you know what is even worse?



Senator Lines interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Lines, you have been interjecting quite consistently. It is disorderly to do so across the chamber.




Senator CASH:
  Was that a sheep bleating? Did someone bring a sheep into this chamber?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections, Senator Cash.




Senator CASH:
  Senator Back, did you bring a sheep into this chamber? If you did you need to control it. As a vet, Senator Back, you need to control your sheep.


As I was saying, the childcare sector—the people who are allegedly going to be the beneficiaries of this legislation—have come out and said to the government: 'You can't do this. You are creating a two-tiered system within child care in Australia.' But why does that surprise me? Those on the other side play elitist politics every day of the week. Those on the other side love class warfare. This is exactly what this bill does. They throw $300 million at United Voice. United Voice can then run around on a membership drive and sign up a few extra people. And they will be telling them that they are going to get a pay rise, and that is blatantly misrepresenting what this legislation does. But at least the childcare sector knows that this legislation is nothing more and nothing less than confirmation of what we already knew about the former Gillard government—and quite frankly the current Rudd government. And we all know that Senator Wong voted for Rudd, the sisterhood stabbing one of their own in the back. You always have to like it, don't you, when the sisterhood stab one of their own in the back? Stabbing people in the back is exactly what this legislation does.


What is worse than the fact that this is merely for a union membership drive and worse than the fact that 40 per cent or fewer of the sector will qualify is that the fund runs out after two years and then there is no money; no money at all. The Labor Party, the party of the workers, throw a bit of money at a few people in the sector and pretend that they are saving the world and giving them a huge pay rise—and they pretend that they are the party of the workers—when in reality this is nothing more and nothing less than one of the worst con jobs that has ever come before this chamber.


Then you have the childcare centres, who have said to the government in submission after submission: 'We are concerned. What happens if we apply for these funds and are not successful? What do we then go back and say to our workers? Our union, United Voice, told the workers they're getting a pay rise. But under the guidelines, they're not getting a pay rise. What do we say to the workers?' I can tell you what United Voice are going to be saying: they are going to be saying, 'That bad employer refused to pass that pay rise on.' But there will be no pay rise; there never was a pay rise. This legislation is just smoke and mirrors, nothing more and nothing less.


What is worse is that a lot of the childcare centres have said that, as a result of this grubby little piece of legislation, they are going to have to raise the wages that they pay to compete with those who may get a wage rise courtesy of the government. But they cannot afford to. All this government is doing is creating a two-tiered system in Australia. But you would expect nothing more and nothing less from those elitists on the other side.

That this bill be now read a second time.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



MIGRATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SPONSORED VISAS) BILL 2013


The purpose of this Bill is to propose a package of integrity measures that seek to enhance the government's ability to deter sponsor behaviour which is inconsistent with the policy intent of the Subclass 457 visa program and other temporary employer sponsored visa programs.  Together with proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994, this Bill presents a comprehensive package of reforms which would balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen protection for overseas workers.


Importantly, the Bill gives powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman (and Fair Work Inspectors) to monitor and investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations, to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and being paid market salary rates.


It will require Subclass 457 sponsors to undertake Labour Market Testing in relation to a nominated occupation, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations, to ensure that Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible temporary visa holders are given first opportunity to apply for skilled vacancies in the domestic labour market.


The government has always said that the Subclass 457 visa plays an important role in allowing employers to address skilled shortages when skilled local labour is unavailable.  It is intended as a vehicle to allow employers to quickly supplement the Australian labour market, including the use of Enterprise Migration Agreements and Regional Migration Agreements, where a genuine skill shortage exists.


It is an important component of our overall non-discriminatory migration program, which is roughly comprised of one third families and two thirds skilled migration. Just over half of the current holders of Subclass 457 visas go on to apply for permanent residence and we think that's appropriate.


Usage of the Subclass 457 visa program has been growing strongly in recent years.   The number of primary Subclass 457 visa holders in Australia has risen from 68 400 in June 2010 to 106 680 as at 31 May 2013, an increase of 56 per cent.


Many growing industries including those connected with the resources boom, such as mining, as well as non-resource sector users of the program, such as health care and information and communications technology (ICT), accounted for a large portion of all Subclass 457 visa grants in 2011-12.


However, strong growth has also been recorded in industries in which employment has fallen recently, such as accommodation and food service, and retail trade.


It concerns the government that, at a time when the labour market has been flattening and some sectors and regions have experienced lay-offs and increased unemployment, the Subclass 457 program has continued to grow.


Coupled with this strong growth is a tendency for some employers to source foreign labour through the Subclass 457 program without regard to the Australian domestic labour force.


These trends highlight that current requirements do not commit sponsors to using the Subclass 457 program as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, the domestic labour force.


In the recently released report of the Migration Council Australia, survey data of Subclass 457 employer sponsors revealed that 15% of employers say that they have no difficulty finding suitable labour locally and yet they sponsor employees from overseas under this scheme.


Further, 7% of primary visa holders surveyed said that they were remunerated differently to their Australian counterparts doing the same work, while 2% stated they were paid well under the minimum salary for a 457 employee which is currently $51,400.


Indeed, the reforms at the heart of this Bill are not unique to the Australian context. As recently as the 7th of May this year, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Stephen Harper – a conservative – stated in relation to his country's equivalent of the Subclass 457 scheme:


""Not only has the government indicated for some time that it would be reforming the temporary foreign workers program, but in the budget last year specifically we brought in measures to better match job vacancies with people who are seeking work or in the employment insurance system. We have been very clear. We need to do a better job of matching the demand for employment insurance and the demand for temporary foreign workers. That is precisely what the government has been doing for a year and a half … The minister brought in changes last year to make sure people who are on employment insurance get first crack at jobs rather than temporary foreign workers.""


The Canadian Government is taking steps to tighten the provisions of their program to ensure that only genuine skill shortages are being filled by temporary overseas labour.


Likewise, academics from the Law School of The University of Adelaide recently submitted to a Senate enquiry that the 457 scheme had shifted in focus since its introduction in 1996 from a focus on filling high skill jobs in areas of skill shortage to satisfying broader employer demand for labour. It is worth noting that back in 1996, Labour Market Testing was a requirement of the scheme.


The Australian Hotels Association underlines this shift in recently arguing for a lowering of the minimum salary threshold of $51,400, such that employers in their industry could use the scheme more extensively. I remind the Chamber that in the past 12 months the use of 457s in the hospitality industry has doubled – yes, it has doubled in the past year.


This Bill, together with the package of reforms announced in February 2013, seeks to realign the program to ensure a balance between job opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents, enabling employers to fill skills shortages, while protecting overseas workers.  The measures will be implemented in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.


The purpose of the Subclass 457 visa program is to address genuine shortages without displacing employment and training opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents and without serving as the mainstay of the skilled migration program.


The government has concerns that some employers are turning to overseas workers first, rather than investing in local training and recruitment.  There has also been evidence of some sponsors paying overseas workers below the market rate, failing to commit to the training requirements of the program, and using the visa fraudulently to help family and friends migrate.


In February, the Government announced a package of reforms to the Subclass 457 visa program to strengthen its capacity to identify and prevent employer practices that are not in keeping with the intent of the program.


These reforms will build on the Worker Protection reforms of 2009 that introduced a sponsorship framework designed to ensure that the working conditions of sponsored visa holders meet Australian standards and provided certain cost incentives to encourage employers to seek to recruit Australians before looking to sponsor overseas skilled workers.  The 2009 reforms also introduced a civil penalty regime, including infringement notices to enhance the powers of the Department to take action against sponsors who fail to meet their sponsorship obligations.


The proposed changes to the Migration Regulations will seek to reduce the risk of nominations for non-genuine positions; strengthen the market salary rate requirement; align the English language requirement with that of the permanent Employer Nomination Scheme; introduce an obligation that sponsors meet the training requirement for the term of sponsorship approval; remove potential for the exploitation of temporary overseas skilled workers; and restore public confidence in the program.


To complement the reforms to the Migration Regulations announced in February 2013, the Bill will enshrine in the Migration Act the kinds of sponsorship obligations which are to be prescribed in the Migration Regulations.


This will ensure that the Migration Regulations include existing sponsorship obligations requiring sponsors to among other things:


ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment (including payment of a 'market salary rate'),


keep information and provide information to the Department, and


cooperate with inspectors;


as well new and strengthened sponsorship obligations proposed to come into effect on 1 July 2013 to:


meet training requirements for the term of sponsorship approval, not transfer, charge or recover certain costs from sponsored visa holders and restrict on-hiring arrangements.


Exactly how the new obligations will be spelt out in the Migration Regulations proposed to commence on 1 July 2013.


The Bill will further strengthen the integrity of the Subclass 457 visa program by expanding the government's capacity to detect and take action against sponsors who do the wrong thing and ensure that overseas workers are not used as a substitute for Australian workers.


The government believes that Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents deserve the opportunity to get local jobs on local projects.


The government also announced in February an expansion of the Fair Work Ombudsman and Inspector powers.


This Bill expands the government's capacity to monitor and investigate compliance with the temporary sponsored work visa program by enabling Fair Work Inspectors to exercise powers for the purposes of the Migration Act.


The Bill will make it clear that a Fair Work inspector is also an inspector for the purposes of the Migration Act and is able to exercise all the powers conferred on inspectors by the Migration Act.


The Department currently has 32 active inspectors appointed under the Migration Act to monitor compliance with sponsorship obligations.  An expansion of inspector powers to over 300 Fair Work inspectors will significantly increase the government's capacity to monitor compliance with the Subclass 457 visa program and other sponsored visas.


Fair Work inspectors will focus in particular on monitoring a sponsor's compliance with the following obligations:


to ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment which requires sponsors to ensure the subclass 457 visa holders are receiving at least the same salary as that which was approved at nomination; and


to ensure the sponsored person works or participates in the nominated occupation and is performing the duties of the occupation, approved at nomination.


The Migration Act contains an enforcement framework relating to the sponsor monitoring regime which includes administrative sanctions (to bar or cancel the approval of a person as a sponsor), an infringement notice and civil penalty scheme.


The Bill provides for enforceable undertakings as an additional enforcement option under the Migration Act where a sponsor has failed to satisfy a sponsorship obligation.


Enforceable undertakings are promises enforceable in court which would be agreed between the Minister and a sponsor.


Enforceable undertakings would be used as an alternative to, or work in combination with, barring a sponsor or cancelling a sponsor's approval.


Enforceable undertakings might also avoid the substantial legal costs associated with litigation in the courts.  They are designed to be flexible and secure compensation for any loss resulting from contraventions (for example, payment to compensate for underpayment of workers).


The amendment will also allow the Minister to publish enforceable undertakings on the Department's website.  This is an important tool to encourage compliance by all sponsors and a means of providing transparency to the Australian public on the monitoring of sponsors.


A key objective of this Bill is to strengthen the government's capacity to manage the Temporary Sponsored Work visa program (in particular, the Subclass 457 visa program).  It will seek assurance from employers that they are only utilising the 457 visa program in circumstances where there is a genuine skills shortage in Australia.  To enable this outcome, the Bill introduces a requirement that sponsors must undertake Labour Market Testing in relation to nominated occupations, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.


In recognition that the Subclass 457 visa is the primary visa that delivers our World Trade Organization and Free Trade Agreement obligations for the Movement of Natural Persons, the Bill ensures that Australia continues to meet our obligations not to Labour Market Test certain categories of persons.


The Bill allows the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to determine by legislative instrument how to give effect to relevant categories of persons for whom international obligations are owed.  The legislative instrument will reflect the relevant commitments with respect to Labour Market Testing under Australia's international trade agreements.


The labour market testing requirement will be met if the Minister is satisfied that a suitably qualified Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or eligible temporary visa holder is not readily available to fill the nominated position.  An eligible temporary visa holder is defined as a person who, at the time the application for the nomination is made, holds a Work and Holiday (462) visa or a Working Holiday (417) visa and who is lawfully employed in the agricultural sector by the sponsor (or an associated entity of the sponsor).


It is proposed that the Labour Market Testing requirement will initially require a sponsor to demonstrate that they have sought to find a suitably qualified Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident anytime within the four months prior to submission of an application for nomination approval.  There has been some misinformation regarding the time period; so I reiterate, labour market testing can be undertaken anytime within the four months prior to application for nomination approval, it is not required to be undertaken for four months.   This will provide a balance between giving Australians the opportunity to apply for jobs, and ensuring that Australian businesses do not experience undue delays in filling skilled labour shortages which would negatively impact on their businesses.  As part of the evidentiary requirement, a sponsor may include research on labour market trends generally and in relation to relevant occupations that was released in the four months prior to a sponsor lodging a nomination.


In addition, the Bill proposes a mandatory requirement for sponsors to provide information if one or more Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents were made redundant or retrenched from positions in the nominated occupation in a sponsor's business or associated entity in the four months prior to lodging a nomination.


If there have been redundancies or retrenchments, labour market testing must be undertaken by the sponsor after those redundancies and retrenchments.


In relation to the evidentiary requirements for sponsors, the Bill proposes that it be mandatory for a sponsor to provide information about their attempts to recruit suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents to the position and any similar positions.  Sponsors must also provide details of any advertising (paid or unpaid) of the position, and any similar positions, commissioned or authorised by the approved sponsor, and fees and other expenses paid (or payable) for that advertising.


If the approved sponsor elects to provide evidence and information other than evidence of advertising and fees, or payment of fees, to support their claim to have tested the labour market, the Minister may take that evidence into account.  The nomination will not, however, be treated less favourably if the approved sponsor elects not to provide such additional evidence or information.


The Bill proposes a delayed commencement for the Labour Market Testing requirement to allow sufficient time for the implementation of Labour Market Testing and ensure that sponsors are given a period of time to undertake Labour Market Testing.


Further, the Bill includes an exemption to the Labour Market Testing requirement in the event of a major disaster, natural or otherwise, in order to assist disaster relief or recovery.


This exemption will give the government flexibility to respond to situations of national or state emergency and would facilitate the speedy entry of overseas skilled workers without the delay caused by requiring a sponsor to undertake labour market testing.


The Bill allows for skill and occupational exemptions to the labour market testing requirement to apply to specific occupations, by legislative instrument, within Skill Levels 1 or 2 as currently described in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations.  The legislation will however, require that nominations made by approved sponsors requiring either or both experience or a qualification in engineering (including shipping engineering) or nursing cannot be exempt from labour market testing.


At present all primary Subclass 457 visa holders are subject to visa condition 8107 which provides the visa holder must not cease employment for 28 consecutive days.  If a visa holder does not comply with this condition there are grounds to cancel their visa.


This Bill amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days, enabling a more socially just outcome for visa holders as they will have more time find an alternative job with an employer sponsor or to arrange their personal affairs at the conclusion of sponsored employment.


This amendment is in line with recommendations of the 2008 Deegan review of the Subclass 457 visa program and the Migration Council Australia in its report of 11 May 2013.


Lastly, to ensure that the views of relevant stakeholders are considered in any regulatory changes to the Subclass 457 visa program, and in recognition of the advisory function of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, the Bill proposes the inclusion of the requirement that the Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that, at all times, there is in existence the Migration Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, a body which includes representatives of unions, industry and State and Territory governments and other members if any nominated by the Minister, and that meets at least on a quarterly basis.  Without limiting the functions, the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration is to provide advice to the Minister in relation to the temporary sponsored work visa program.


The Government intends to review the efficacy of these reforms within three years of their implementation to ascertain whether further refinements are required. We have some major changes in our labour market over recent years and it is appropriate that we re-examine these policy settings.


The totality of the Government's reforms will close loopholes in the current legislative and policy settings to ensure that the program can only be used by appropriately skilled persons and to fill genuine skills shortages as was intended.  Put another way, they aim to ensure the program better meets its overarching intent of acting as a supplement to rather than a substitute for the Australian labour market, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.


The government is confident that the revised legislative and policy settings for the Subclass 457 program will achieve this balance, and will further enhance an already successful program.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-06-28,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (14:56):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. The sisterhood may have taken out one of their own the other night; the Labor leadership may have changed and you may now have Prime Minister Rudd; but, within the first 24 hours of Prime Minister Rudd reassuming the leadership, there is one thing that the Australian public have learnt and that is: they may have changed the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, but they have not changed their direction.


This bill is an example. If Mr Rudd had really meant it the other night when he said, 'I want to do a deal with business; I want to work with business,' this is the first piece of legislation he would have pulled. This legislation is nothing more and nothing less than the CFMEU, Minister O'Connor and former Prime Minister Gillard getting together without any consultation whatsoever with industry and without any regard for their own Office of Best Practice Regulation, which said, 'You have to assess regulatory impact in relation to this legislation.' No way—why do that when you can come to this place, stitch up a deal with your little mates in the Greens, the green doormat, and slam this legislation through the Senate with 3½ minutes of debate?


The Australian Mines and Metals Association got it right in their press release today: 'Day 1: Rudd sells business out to unions'. There you go. This is a business that is directly affected by this legislation and on day one AMMA is already issuing a statement—




Senator Farrell:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I believe Senator Cash has exceeded the decibel levels in the—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is no point of order. Senator Cash has the call.




Senator CASH:
  If you want to talk about exceeding decibel levels, I wonder how loud former Prime Minister Gillard screamed when her own sisterhood knifed her in the back and took her out. Minister Wong is now sitting, reaping the spoils of the victory, drinking from the chalice of blood—Ms Gillard's own sisterhood took her out. Where is EMILY's List when you need them? There goes EMILY's List now, walking up to the table. This is what the sisterhood in the Labor Party do. They take out one of their own because they did not have the guts to take the former Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, to the election. They did not have the guts to have her face the Australian people.


Quite frankly, the current Prime Minister, Prime Minister Rudd mark II, is nothing more and nothing less than a carbon copy of Prime Minister Rudd mark I and former Prime Minister Gillard. This is the bill that says to the Australian people: nothing has changed at the top. You can take the photograph away and put up another photograph, but guess what? Unless you change the direction of your policy, unless you realise that you have made mistakes, the Australian people will judge you. When you have a piece of legislation as important as this being slammed through the Senate with 3½ minutes of debate, if that does not say the union movement controls the ALP, I do not know what does.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for consideration of the bill has expired. The question is that the bill now be read a second time.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-06-28,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:28):  I rise to speak on adjournment for the last time in this 43rd session of parliament. I think I am the last speaker to speak in this 43rd session of parliament, a parliament that has been one of the most constructive in the nation's history. Among the many achievements of this parliament have been its victories for the environment, from putting a price on carbon pollution to the declaration of the world's largest network of marine parks.


One of the processes initiated in this term of parliament and government reached its culmination only this week. On Monday, 24 June, UNESCO recognised over 170,000 hectares of Tasmania's old growth forest as among the world's most special places. In supporting the Labor government's nomination of these forests for world heritage status, UNESCO has declared that they are the common estate of humanity and deserving of the highest protection. These forests are the legacy of the ancient landforms of Gondwana, and hundreds of thousands of years of nature uninterrupted. They include the Styx Valley, only 70 kilometres from Hobart and home to some of the tallest hardwood trees in the world, stretching over 25 storeys into the air and five metres wide at their bases. The Styx-Tyenna area contains the greatest concentration of these trees in the world. It includes the unique biodiversity in the Upper Florentine, Huon and Picton, and includes areas from Cockle Creek in the far south of Tasmania to Cradle Mountain in the north-west. Habitats for rare and threatened species, such as the endangered wedge-tailed eagle, the white form of the grey goshawk, and the Tasmanian devil are also included in the new boundaries for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Geology that tells the history of our world is also included—places that exhibit evidence of glacial movement along the Walls of Jerusalem and Central Plateau millions of years ago.


I have walked along these rock faces and among these giants, and they are some of the most beautiful and moving places on earth. There is no doubt in my mind that they are worthy of protection. But declaring these sites of shared significance is no simple decision. Common human heritage requires common human understanding about the meaning of these places, and for at least the last 30 years Tasmania's forests have been the subject of bitter community conflict. This declaration has been made possible by traditional protagonists from the conservation movement and the forestry industry being willing to sit down together and negotiate together. Through the community-driven process concluding in the Tasmanian forests agreement, both parties were able to focus on the best results for the future. And when they had reached that agreement, they were supported by the federal Labor government.


There are not only conservation gains in this agreement, though. The agreement is underwritten by an understanding of the value of Tasmania's forests to industry and to families that depend on forestry jobs. Importantly, the Tasmanian forests agreement provides greater certainty for Tasmanians working in the forestry industry, giving industry players certainty and providing space and resources to restructure in a way that can build a better future and assure jobs. One of our most important job providers in the state, Ta Ann, whose capacity underpins the success of many operators, will be able to access $26 million to restructure their business in response to market changes and the changing face of Tasmanian forestry. Economic diversification projects, new and innovative developments in affected parts of the state, and structural adjustment programs to allow people to transition or exit out of the industry are just some of the outcomes of this agreement which will benefit workers.


Ultimately, what will be facilitated by this agreement, including the World Heritage Committee's decision this week, is the end of community division over Tasmania's forests. Tasmania's forests have always been important to Tasmanians—to those who were awed by their transcendent beauty and to those families who were sustained by their bounty. Preserving the precious value of our forests is a joint aim now. Now, with the extension of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, it is the aim of our nation and our world as well.


I want to turn my attention now to the new National Asbestos Exposure Register. Firstly, I want to commend Minister Bill Shorten, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, for setting up the register in the wake of community concerns after asbestos was found in Telstra pits during the rollout of the National Broadband Network. Residents near some of these pits have expressed fears that they might have been exposed to potentially deadly asbestos fibres, and at least one family in Sydney moved to a hotel after asbestos was found on their front lawn after it was removed incorrectly from a Telstra pit. The parents feared that their children might have brought the asbestos into the house on their shoes.


There are around two million pits across Australia; they are in almost every footpath. It is estimated that asbestos is in around 10 per cent of these pits. Telstra owns these pits and has accepted responsibility for pit remediation work. Telstra is also working with NBN contractors to ensure that all workers are trained in the removal and handling of asbestos in pits and pipes—trained adequately and properly. In this aim, they are providing 200 experts to oversee the work across Australia.


I am pleased that Minister Shorten moved so quickly to address community concerns regarding asbestos removal from the underground pits and to set up the National Asbestos Exposure Register. The minister convened an urgent meeting of Telstra, union representatives, contractors and asbestos support groups and created a task force to develop a new training standard for asbestos removal. Telstra and NBN Co. have confirmed that they are working with the unions and Comcare to ensure that all Telstra and NBN employees and contractors are trained in the safe removal and handling of asbestos from Telstra pits. With this National Asbestos Exposure Register, anyone who is exposed can register where and when it occurred. We know that it can be up to 20 years before any asbestos related disease comes to light, so it is essential that anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to asbestos puts their name on the register.


The register has been established by the government's Office of Asbestos Safety, with assistance from the Chief Medical Officer. In Australia we have a national approach to asbestos, including establishing the national Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency and the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Council. This historic legislation passed the Senate last week.


On the day the legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives a truck driver in Sydney was caught on CCTV dumping asbestos outside a childcare centre. This illegal dumping of waste carries fines of between $750 and $1 million and up to seven years imprisonment. The local Sydney council spent $13,000 cleaning up the area after the alarm was raised, but the council says finding the person who dumped the asbestos is like 'trying to find a needle in a haystack'. Dumping of asbestos continues to happen and is putting people at risk. It highlights why we need a national approach to dealing with asbestos and its safe removal. After the media coverage of the asbestos in the Telstra pits, my office in Hobart had a call from a man who was worried about dumping of asbestos in the Hobart Domain. However, incidents of dumping near childcare centres and the concern with Telstra pits again highlight just why we need a national approach and a national agency and council to try to eradicate asbestos from workplaces and public buildings.


Australia, unfortunately, has one of the highest rates of asbestos related deaths in the world and this will continue to rise if we do not safeguard our community from asbestos. Removal of asbestos should be above politics—the health and safety of Australians are too important to see it politicised. Therefore, I commend the government for establishing the first National Asbestos Exposure Register as well as the national asbestos agency.
