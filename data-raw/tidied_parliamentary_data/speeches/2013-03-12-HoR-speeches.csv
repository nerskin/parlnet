Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (12:03):  Before my comments were interrupted by other parliamentary business in the last session I was speaking about Britney and how after her school graduation last year she and her mother became in need of additional further support after school. Her mother works as a nurse and she needs more support hours so that she can look after Britney and provide for the rest of the family. Most of that support comes from the state, but it does highlight the need for the Prime Minister to stop her politically driven fights with the states and seek bilateral agreements as everyone needs to be on board to drive change and deliver for all those with disabilities such as Britney, Mitchell and their families.


Throughout this debate, the government has repeatedly suggested that they are the party of the NDIS because the NDIS represents Labor values. But I remind the parliament that abandoning those in need is not the policy of any political party. The coalition supported the work of the Productivity Commission. We supported the $1 billion in the last budget and the five launch sites, and the agreement for the New South Wales rollout, and we support this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition has also demonstrated his personal commitment to those with disabilities by dedicating the 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride to Carers Australia; $540,000 was raised.


An economy well managed by the federal government can deliver the NDIS in the time frame, but not this government. They talk about their values with the usual sanctimony, but in the end their spending decisions have damaged the ability of this nation to have an NDIS on time, and they must be held to account. Talk is cheap; the NDIS is not, and it will fall to a better government to deliver—and that better government, I hope, will be delivered soon when the Australian people reject the Labor Party.


I thank those constituents of mine who have come forward to tell me of their circumstances and to impress upon me their needs. What I would say is that under Tony Abbott we want to deliver the change required, but because of the wasteful spending of this government there is now more spending on interest payments each year than would be required to fully fund the NDIS. This Labor government has spent beyond the means of this country, and their recklessness is now holding back a comprehensive and effective NDIS. To cover up their inability to fund this worthwhile and necessary NDIS, they have picked fights with state governments to develop a smokescreen and deceive the people of this country. Australians should choose a Tony Abbott led government at the election to get this job done.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (12:05):  Today I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012 and the positive benefits it will have for the people of Macarthur. I believe this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever been and that ever will be spoken about in this parliament.


Since becoming the member for Macarthur I have fought hard to support the charity groups and organisations in my electorate who support those living with a disability and their families. These families should have access to the funding and support services they need to ensure the best quality of life possible for their loved ones. The NDIS will provide this much-needed support by providing the funding and support services they need. We hope this will in turn help them join the workforce and become active members of our communities.


The NDIS will empower individuals and reduce red tape for people living with a disability and their carers. It will provide funding to individuals and organisations to help people with a disability participate more fully in our communities through things like aids, equipment, supported accommodation and personal care. It is my strong belief that the financial support and assistance for these people living with a disability should not be the responsibility of the parents and carers, who already provide hands-on support to their loved ones 24 hours a day, seven days a week.


The added pressure of fundraising for equipment and fighting for more services and financial support should not be left to these families who have so much on their plates already. The sad truth is that the lack of funding and support can put even more pressure and stress on these families and sometimes pull them apart. The NDIS will provide funding in the form of individual support packages for people living with a disability and the possibility of some block funding for different groups or organisations to support these Australians and their families. In my electorate the cracks are definitely showing. It is very obvious that our current system of support for people living with a disability in this country is not working. In Macarthur, people living with a disability and their families are relying heavily on the support of several charities, community groups and organisations who work hard to continually raise money to provide this vital support.


Many times in this place I have mentioned these groups and the fantastic work they do in my community to help those in need. These include KU Starting Points, an educational support organisation that offers a range of early intervention programs for children with disabilities and their families; the Right Start Foundation, a group of local parents who raise money and awareness to provide support for local families living with Down syndrome; the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, an organisation dedicated to improving health care for every child living in Macarthur by raising money and advocating for children's health services and research across the region; Society 389, an organisation that provides financial support and assistance for families of children with disabilities and special needs; Macarthur Disability Services, a not-for-profit organisation that provides support for people living with a disability, people with a mental illness, the aged, families and carers in the Macarthur region; Macarthur Temporary Family Care, an organisation that provides support and high-quality care programs for children of families in crisis and respite care for children and adults who have a physical or intellectual disability; NOVA Employment, offering specialist job-seeking assistance and post-placement support for people living with a disability; and Northcott Disability Services, one of New South Wales's leading service providers for people living with a disability, providing support and services direct to their clients as well as carers and family members.


All of these groups provide vital support to residents in my community and rely heavily on community fundraisers, state and federal government grants and hardworking volunteers to do the great work they do in my electorate. Many of these groups have played an active role in the Every Australian Counts campaign to raise awareness of the NDIS in Macarthur. I have attended many of these events and heard firsthand from those families who believe the NDIS would have a huge impact on their lives. While speaking about these groups in parliament I have also shared the stories of many children and families in my electorate who have relied on their support. One of these children was Brittney McKenna, who was born with the heartbreaking disease spinal muscular atrophy. Sadly, Brittney passed away in 2008 at just nine years of age. When I met with Brittney's parents last year they mentioned the lack of funding and respite for families living with SMA and the added stress this caused to their family. There was limited support offered to Brittney's family and no respite because she was classified as 'too high medical support'. Brittney's mum was proficient in all her medical needs including her IV medications. In between all the years spent in hospital, the 41 surgeries and the 24-hour intensive care for their daughter, Debbie and Andrew also had to do their own fundraising for equipment and home modifications to support Brittney. They told me that life by the hospital bed included a constant struggle with red tape, bureaucracy, budgets and politics in an attempt to get some support. My hope for the NDIS is that no family in Macarthur or anywhere else in Australia should ever have to experience what this family went through whilst trying to care for a sick child. Brittney's longest single admission in hospital was 21 months. Her dad, Andrew, was working interstate to support the family financially and her mum, Debbie, was by her hospital bed 24 hours a day. Their son Liam was passed around family and friends to give him some stability and routine. With the help of the community the family raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to give Brittney the life she deserved. It is no wonder they were left financially, physically and emotionally exhausted.


In recent years I have become very close to many families in my electorate who love and support someone with a disability. That is why this issue is very close to my heart. It is no secret that I am a big supporter of the Right Start Foundation, a charity group that supports local families living with Down syndrome. The foundation was started by a group of mums who have children living with Down syndrome. These women continually fight for funding and support and are now raising money to establish Australia's first Down syndrome specific centre in Macarthur to ensure children and families receive all the therapy and support they need for the right start in life. These parents really are an inspirational group of people. Not only do they provide so much love and support for their own children; they work hard to raise awareness and to fundraise to support others living with Down syndrome. My hope is that the NDIS will give these children the support they deserve and greater opportunities to support themselves as they grow older.


Another reason the NDIS is very close to my heart is that one of my very own staff members has a son with a disability. Ben Upfill was born with one of the most severe forms of Angelman syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder which causes severe intellectual disability, speech impediment, sleep disturbance, unstable jerky movements of the limbs and seizures. Ben's Mum, Carla, his dad, Dave, and siblings, Joel and Olivia, give Ben all the love and support they can as a family to make sure he has the best quality of life possible. Unless you have a child with a severe disability it is hard to imagine what it is like to provide such intensive care to a child at home whilst working to pay the bills and provide for your disabled child and the rest of your family. Just a few years ago the Macarthur charity Society 389 could see the family was in need of a new car to help them transport Ben in his wheelchair. Through a charity night more than $45,000 was raised to buy the family a car to make life a little easier for them.


My point is that families, like this one, who are caring for a child with a disability, are very lucky to have the support of many charities made up of volunteers to help them raise money to support their children. For some the support of these charities is a godsend, because without them these families would be forced to make a choice between supporting their disabled child and paying the bills and putting food on the table. Unfortunately the resources of these charities and organisations can become quite stretched, with so many people in my community needing their support. That is why the National Disability Insurance Scheme is so important and why it is so important that we get it right.


We need a new system of support based on need. The person living with the disability and their family or carers need to be at the centre of the scheme and in charge, able to choose the support, aid, equipment, and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme which I wholeheartedly support. The coalition supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme because we know that the current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. This is why the concept of the NDIS has gained momentum over the past five years. In my own electorate, groups like Macarthur Disability Services, Northcott Disability Services, Macarthur District Temporary Family Care, Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly councils, Sunnyfield Independence, the Macarthur Disability Network and Macarthur Diversity Services have all worked together to raise public awareness about the importance of the scheme and show Macarthur's support for its successful implementation.


In October last year I attended the Macarthur NDIS Big DisabiliTEA to hear from these groups and show my support for the NDIS. It was a great day with many families from across my electorate there to share their stories and show their support. Events like this one are very important. Not only did it raise awareness for the scheme but it was to me like a cry for help from these Macarthur families who love their children so much and want to see them given the support they need now and into the future. So many of the parents I spoke to fear what will happen to their children once mum and dad are no longer around to look after them. Yes, many of them have siblings who love them and will take on the role of carer when it is their turn, but it is important that these siblings are given the support they need to carry on this role.


I believe that the NDIS will give many parents peace of mind that even when they are no longer around to provide for their children the Australian government will ensure they have access to the support services and funding they need. And of course it is not just Macarthur residents who will benefit from the scheme. It is estimated that 7,500 young Australians who require full-time care are currently living in aged-care facilities and more than 700,000 young Australians are being cared for at home by their loved ones.


There are so many young people and so many Australian families who need our help. It is our job to make sure that they do not slip through the cracks. Perfecting the NDIS gives us an opportunity to do just that. This is why the coalition has supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, which confirmed that our current system of support simply is not good enough. We support the National Disability Insurance Scheme and believe it requires bipartisan support from both sides of government.


While we supported the $1 billion promised in last year's budget, it was disappointing that this figure fell short of what the Productivity Commission estimated would be needed in the first four years of the scheme by $3 billion. I would hope to see the Treasurer account for this shortfall in his coming budget. The coalition has also supported the five launch sites for the NDIS and the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments for a full statewide rollout after the launch in the Hunter.


We believe that the NDIS can be delivered within the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission by a sensible government that manages it well. We are ready to work with the government to see an NDIS delivered as soon as possible and we believe that we must get this right the first time around, with a very high level of consultation and attention to the detail from now until its full implementation.


So far we have heard very little in regard to how each individual will be assessed and who will be eligible for the scheme. I would like to know if the NDIS is going to extend to those who might look healthy from the outside but are struggling with a terminal illness. For example, in Macarthur there are more than 80 people living with cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that effects more than 3,000 people in Australia. The condition is life threatening, and daily physio treatment, regular hospital stays and life-threatening lung infections can limit a person suffering from CF and their carers from leading a full and productive life.


Cystic Fibrosis Australia has put forward a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in regard to the NDIS. In the submission the organisation has asked that the NDIS framework include people living with cystic fibrosis. It has asked that the scheme provide the full range of equipment used by people with CF, including parts and servicing for nebulisers, oxygen saturation machines, mouthpieces and inhalers. They would also like to see the inclusion of non-PBS medicines, both dietary and other supplements, as well as travel and accommodation allowances to attend specialist clinics. The submission pushes for a needs assessment and support service for carers and the inclusion of preventative services such as exercise programs and equipment for CF sufferers. These are just some of the things needed by people living with cystic fibrosis that could be provided under the NDIS.


I am also concerned about the eligibility for residents in my electorate who are over 65 years of age. Will they be eligible to benefit from the NDIS? There are many unanswered questions that must be worked through properly. This is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would lock in all parties and allow us to work through the design and eligibility together.


I find it disappointing that the government has knocked back the coalition's call for bipartisanship on so many occasions. I believe that the implementation of the NDIS should be placed above politics. I think that this is a time when we must come together to ensure that we get it right for all people living with a disability in our electorates. There is no reason for one side of politics to take on such an important piece of legislation on its own.


I believe that if we work together we can implement one of the best disability policies in the world, one that ensures no person living with a disability falls through the cracks. If the scheme is to succeed it will need the support of all levels of government in all states and territories across this country. If it is well-implemented, the scheme will ensure people with a disability have the support they need today and into the future.


I spend a lot of time with families in my electorate who have children living with a disability. I am continuously inspired by their positive attitude and their dedication to breaking down barriers and raising awareness of their child's condition. But no matter how amazing the parent or the child might be, raising a child with additional needs can be extremely challenging and isolating. That is why I believe that it is imperative that we work together on this one, because I want nothing more than the best for my community and those Macarthur families who will benefit from this scheme. I wholeheartedly support a National Disability Insurance Scheme for the people of Macarthur and the people of Australia. I hope that as a parliament we can work together to ensure the scheme is rolled out as effectively and as soon as possible.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (12:19):  In addressing the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, let me begin by giving my wholehearted support to the bill and to the broader underlying principle. I want to speak briefly today across three fronts: the humanity behind the bill; the principles to be enshrined in the bill; and the issue of supported accommodation, which, for those living in the Hastings area as well as across the electorate of Flinders and across Australia, is a critical element of care and treatment for those who have some of the most challenging disabilities that we face in our country.


I want to begin by looking at the humanity, with people that I know. There is a young fellow, Tom McGann, whom I have known for over a decade. His situation is that has had:


… a neuromuscular disability since birth which means I have never walked and have been in a motorised wheelchair from age 4.


He is now a young adult. He went through mainstream schooling at Mount Martha Primary School and then secondary school. He is a joy to be with and he is an absolute source of pride to his parents. These days, he is studying IT at TAFE and his goal is to have a career in the field. He has been involved with Boccia, a Paralympic sport, and with Channel 31, where he has an on-camera role.


He has also been involved with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a local self-help group created to assist those with disabilities to have access to the appropriate technology. It was started by a magnificent local constituent, Richard Stubbs, who was a very successful banker. He developed a severe neuromuscular condition and lost much of his mobility. His response was not to feel sorry for himself but to establish a practical self-help group named Beyond Disability. I have watched as their charitable work has grown and expanded. It has provided a window to the world, an avenue and means of communication, self-respect, creativity and fulfilment.


Out of that process has come Tom McGann. Tom has been determined to live the best life he can lead. He is really a shining example to me of a life well lived. So it is a real honour to have known him since he was such a young age and to have watched him develop through primary and secondary school and then enter tertiary education as a fine young Australian. His story is powerful because it is an example of what we can be and how we can overcome challenges and be our best selves. He has done that despite great difficulties, with the support of stunningly helpful and committed parents. In many cases, family circumstances just do not allow these steps forward. That is why we come to the issue of a national disability insurance scheme.


I saw another example only a couple of weekends ago, when the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia held a disabled surf event at Point Leo on the Mornington Peninsula. My understanding is that there were over 50 participants. I was there in a wetsuit as one of the support crew—




Dr Southcott:
  Shameless!




Mr HUNT:
  Yes! I gave my little bit. There were 50-plus participants who have disability, and they had the time of their lives. Some were a little bit frightened, but you could see their fear being overcome as something new came into their lives. You could see the joy—they were just thrilled to be in the water. By my count, there were over 200 volunteers there. It was one of the most uplifting events you could ever witness. It was Australians supporting Australians, locals supporting locals and families supporting families, in the best of all possible ways.


Many of these people and their families have endured extraordinary challenges and difficulties. Whether it is Tom McGann or the crew at the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia or the people for whom they are caring; whether it is Richard Stubbs or another local constituent, Alan Lachman, who, in order to give his daughter, Francesca, the best support he could, helped establish the Insight school for those with visual challenges, blindness and other forms of eyesight disability; whether it is those working in the autism space—and we have pledged to work with Senator Mitch Fifield, our shadow minister responsible, towards a national autism summit; whether it is any of those or the many other areas in which challenges abound, it is time for a National Disability Insurance Scheme.


The principle behind this is that, if you were designing a budget from scratch—if you had a blank sheet of paper—supporting those with disabilities in the best possible way would be right at the top of the list of measures because it is an expression of our humanity, an expression of decency and an expression of what we do. But, as we have developed in different ways over different times, we come to the point where we are today, with a different budgetary position.


So what we have to do now, I think, is adopt two fundamental principles: firstly, flexibility of delivery and, secondly, a non-bureaucratic model. The critical principle of flexibility of delivery is that we find the right solution for the right person. Each person's needs will be different. That may mean that for some it is about respite, for others it is about ongoing care and for others it is about material assistance such as customisation of a car or other vehicle or provision of computer equipment. Our approach should be flexibility, and that is what I think is critical—a flexible approach.


That leads to the non-bureaucratic model. I am very heartened by what I have seen come out of Western Australia. I think the Barnett model of flexibility is non-bureaucratic and an extremely important way forward. I think we should all look to the way in which Western Australia has provided a model. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a simple, flexible, non-bureaucratic model which is not about employing lots and lots of public servants but about giving individual families, carers and those suffering from disabilities the ability to meet their most significant needs.


That leads me to my third and final point, which is about supported accommodation. The Hastings model, as it is sometimes called, of small supported accommodation started just across the road from my office. Families such as Norm and Dizzy Carlyon, Joy and David Jarman, and Karl and Marie Hell—Karl has now passed on—came together to say that we needed a small, local supported accommodation centre. That was funded and it is largely built, but I have to say, with great respect to the Commonwealth, that nothing has happened in the best part of 18 months. The buildings have been frozen and the Commonwealth has not intervened to ensure that a building issue is resolved. I would respectfully say to the minister: now is the time to intervene, bring together the different parties and make sure that this building dispute is ended. It is a great model and one which I would like to see as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but this case in Hastings can and should be resolved so we can get young people into supported accommodation. They are waiting; they are desperate; their families have visited. So I say to the minister: please intervene. This is an early example of the positive things that can be done by a national scheme. It is a pilot, an exemplar and a model. I ask for your help.


Having said that, when I think of Tom McGann, disabled surf Australia, Richard Stubbs, the work that Alan Lachman has done and those parents of children with autism, for whom we did our walk two years ago, they need and, above all else deserve, our support. As a parliament, we can be our best selves by supporting them. I commend the notion of a joint parliamentary committee. We will, as a parliament—as a unified group of people—continue to work towards a model which ultimately is not about bureaucracy nor tight rules; it is about finding the right solution to the needs of each family with a significant disability so that those families and those with the disability can be their best selves.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:30):  I rise today to give my whole hearted support to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. It is an important bill. It shows that, as a country, we can be compassionate and fair, and we can look after those who are less fortunate—who, due to circumstances out of their control, have had things happen to them that mean that they will need assistance and help throughout their lives. As a society, we can recognise that and do what needs to be done.


As a young boy growing up, my parents every year took me along to support the Mansfield Autism Centre. They held a ball every year. It was put on to raise money for that centre, and as a young boy I came across the parents, the carers and the children who were in the centre, and I got an understanding of all the issues that they were dealing with. It has meant that as I have gone through life I have had a great deal of compassion and sympathy, but above all else I have had a great deal of admiration for everyone who works in the disability sector and for all those people with disabilities as they go about their lives.


As a parliament we have a real opportunity to make a difference with this bill, and that is what we should do. Only three or four months ago I was reminded of the time that I spent as a young boy trying to help and support the Mansfield Autism Centre, when I met with the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group. I went along to talk to the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group but also, more importantly, to listen. While I was there—I was there for a couple of hours—I heard some of the most compelling testimony that you would hear in your life as to why we need a national disability insurance scheme.


One lady in particular read out a four-page letter about the difficulties that she had had getting respite for her child. It was an incredibly moving letter. I do not think anyone in the room—and there were 30 or 40 of us—had a dry eye by the time she has finished. The sad thing about her letter was that it showed clearly the difficulties that people face in this area. More often than not it is not because anyone sets out to deliberately cause problems or issues; it is just that the system is broken. It is having a huge personal toll on those who are dealing with this system. That is why we need to implement this bill. We need to implement the trials that are part of this bill and we need to get on with making sure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme becomes a reality.


I would like to take the time to thank the opposition shadow minister for disabilities, carers and the voluntary sector for the time that he has spent in my electorate explaining what the scheme would mean to our local communities. He has visited Portland, Warrnambool, Avoca and Maryborough. I am sure—he has said so—he would more than willing to come back and meet with other groups to explain how important this NDIS scheme is. I have met with more groups across the electorate, and everywhere I go all I can think is that the case is even more compelling for this scheme.


I would like to congratulate those who have campaigned for the NDIS. I had a meeting on 8 September 2011 with Jacqui Pearce and Lynn Foreman, who came to my office to promote the NDIS. Lynn Foreman in particular went beyond the call of duty to ensure that she got to that meeting and was able, once again, to make me aware of the need for the NDIS. She tried to get down by train. In the end she could not, and ended up having to come in a taxi—which shows once again the difficulties people with disabilities face on a daily basis. But, once again, they were able to put an extremely compelling case—and that has been done across the nation, to all MPs and to all senators, to both state and federal parliamentarians, because we are going to require the cooperation of those two levels of government to ensure that the NDIS is rolled out and rolled out properly.


I would also like to take this opportunity to mention Bill Shorten because, in his previous role as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, he spent a lot of time publicising the need for the NDIS. In a show of bipartisanship I would like to recognise the contribution that Bill Shorten has made.


I would also like to recognise the contribution that the Productivity Commission has made. It is not easy getting the parameters right around implementing such a thing as the NDIS. This is serious reform and it needs to be done in a way that we know will work. There are people whose hopes are dependant on the NDIS and its successful rollout, and the Productivity Commission to date has done an outstanding job in setting the framework as to how that should take place.


When we talk about bipartisanship I think we should note—and this will be as important on our side, if we win the next election, as it is currently to the government—that we need to do everything we can as a parliament to make this a bipartisan step. This is something that all sides of this House should be able to get together and work on, to make sure that what we get is an excellent product. Neither side of this place has the wherewithal and the brains to ensure that every single element of this is rolled out to perfection. What we need to do is to make sure that we cooperate, that we work together, that we ensure that by putting our minds together collectively we do the best we can—and I think it is beholden to the government to look at what it can do to ensure that the NDIS is a bipartisan initiative, as much as it will be on this side if we win the next election. That is something that I will be extremely keen to see in the months and years ahead, as we continue to roll out the scheme.


There are going to be important aspects of the scheme that we are going to have to make sure we get right. The previous speaker, Mr Hunt, expressed some of these aspects. There are two in particular that I would like to pick up on; one is that we are going to have to make sure that there is flexibility of delivery. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, because it will not work—across disabilities there are unique circumstances. When it comes to how this is rolled out, and the services delivered between metropolitan, regional and rural communities, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. So we have to ensure that there is proper flexibility in the system. If we do not do that, then once again we will see people battling the system, and they have been doing that for too long. That is what the NDIS is all about: trying to prevent the bureaucracy and the red tape from sucking the life out of people as they try to get help for their loved ones. We have to make sure that the system we put in place is flexible across disabilities, but it must also be flexible across communities, whether they are metropolitan, regional or rural.


We also have to ensure as best we can that red tape is minimised, because nothing strangles more than red tape. For people who are emotionally dealing with incredibly difficult circumstances, the last thing they need is having that emotion added to by having constant battles with red tape. Often the red tape is well-intentioned. It is put there to ensure that delivery occurs according to how the system is legislated, but we have to make sure that, in putting this system in place, what we want to see occur is very clear and we have to make sure it allows people to get on with caring for their loved ones.


The time has come for this piece of legislation. It is something we need to see as quickly as possible. When I have met with groups across my electorate, there has been one uniform and compelling thing that they have said to me, and that is that they want to see compassion from their government—they call it 'their government', and they should call it 'their government'. They want to see an understanding, they want to see that people are listening and, above all else, they want to see a government which is prepared to step in and help them deal with the issues that they are dealing with on a daily basis. That is what this piece of legislation will enable. We still have a long way to go. We have to make sure that the trials are done properly; we have to make sure that we learn lessons from the trials; we have to make sure that the feedback from the trials will feed into the final NDIS; and we have to make sure that the establishment of the NDIS is done in such a way that we can continue to have bipartisan support for the model. These are going to be the challenges that we are all going to have to meet as we go forward.


I would like to say this: failure on this piece of legislation is not an option. Once you have met with community groups, once you have met with disability carers groups and once you have seen what these people are currently going through, you have to keep in the back of your mind that failure is not an option. They are doing wonderful work. They are dealing with things that we have to make sure we comprehend. We have to compassionately show that we understand and want to lend a hand. If we do not do that as a national parliament, we will fail. I do not want that resting upon my shoulders, as I am sure no-one else in this parliament wants it resting on theirs. I give my wholehearted support to this piece of legislation. We still have a lot of hard work to do, but we have to make sure that we do it and we get it right.

Mr CROOK
 (O'Connor) (12:44):  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. I agree with many statements made by members of this House, on both sides of politics, and I would particularly like to endorse the comments of the member for Wannon. I have enjoyed the non-politicised, passionate words from members such as the member for Gippsland and my friend the member for Denison. As members are all too aware, the current disability support system is unfair, underfunded and disjointed. The current system fails to give people with a disability proper choice about their future and gives no guarantee of access to appropriate support.


Australia is a fortunate, wealthy country where most Australians enjoy freedom of choice and boundless opportunities. However, one of the largest minority groups, people living with a disability, are not afforded basic rights and are not protected by the social safety net that protects most Australians. In many cases Australia has failed to provide people living with a disability with the very basic commitments of fairness and human rights. It is sad to hear that by most empirical measurements Australians living with disabilities and their carers are among the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. All Australians deserve a fair go. In this respect, these changes are long overdue. I believe we will look back at this time as an important crossroad in our nation.


There have been many times in this 43rd Parliament when I have been embarrassed about the politicking, infighting and obsession with party room antics that occur at the expense of our constituents, but today I am proud. I am proud to be a member of this parliament when both sides of politics are working together to improve the lives of Australians and to give people with a disability a right to realise their potential—a right that should be afforded to all Australians.


In such an important debate, I feel it is important to stop and make some acknowledgements. As members have done before me, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the carers of people with disabilities—to all the O'Connor electorate carers who I have had the pleasure of meeting and all those who I am yet to meet and, indeed, all carers in Australia. I acknowledge the enduring love and lifelong commitment that carers give to their disabled family members and friends. I acknowledge the huge amount of work that carers undertake and their willingness to participate in vital, unpaid work that benefits the entire community. I acknowledge the integral role that carers play in the Australian health system and in the Australian economy. I acknowledge and congratulate many of those carers who have done so much work to put this debate on the national agenda for those who cannot.


I also acknowledge the professional staff who work in the O'Connor electorate and I acknowledge the professional staff who work in high-care facilities, nursing homes and schools throughout Australia. Thank you for your tireless work. It not only improves the lives of many individuals and their families but contributes to the social fabric of our regional communities.


Finally, I acknowledge all of those people living with a disability in the O'Connor electorate. I acknowledge all those who joined me for a morning tea in Kalgoorlie and to all those who joined Wendy Duncan, at the time the member of the Legislative Council in Western Australia, for a DisabiliTEA in Esperance. In particular, I acknowledge the special people from my electorate who have taken the time to share their stories with me and to contribute to this debate.


Throughout 2012 I heard from many constituents on this issue—some with disabilities, some carers, some support service professionals, and many community members who thought that people with a disability deserved a fairer go. As members have done before me, I would like to share a couple of stories. It is most important to remember that these stories reflect what it is like every single day for many Australians. One such story that sticks in my mind is from Kathy and Greg Jones in Narrogin in regional Western Australia. Kathy and Greg are 60-year-old parents of a son with cerebral palsy. Their son is in a wheelchair and is fully reliant on his parents for everything. He is unable to walk or talk. Kathy and Greg, like many committed parents with a disabled child, often wonder, 'What happens when we are unable to care for our child? Once we pass away, where will our child live? How will he be looked after?' Without the NDIS, the answer to these questions and to many more is too difficult to contemplate by any parent. Kathy and Greg have commented that, once they know that the NDIS is on the way, they may begin to sleep at night again.


Another example is Jill, a tireless worker in disability support services in the city of Albany on the south-west coast of my electorate. Jill has described the astonishing amount of stress that families are put under when they are unable to access proper support for their disabled child. Under the current system, families have to bare their souls and participate in a very crisis-driven application process for support. Jill knows of families that simply cannot cope with the stress of not having support for their child. Some families have ended up with mental illnesses and within the mental health system from the stress. This, in fact, compounds the problem because, as we all know, mental health has its issues around funding and service delivery, particularly in regional and remote Australia.


Other families have considered handing their child back to the Department of Child Protection. This a notion that, to most, is incomprehensible and a decision that must be devastating. These levels of stress are echoed by participants in the Productivity Commission inquiry who noted that parents regularly contemplate suicide as they have been unable to find adequate support for their child.


My next story is of a very special Goldfields woman who gave me information about the NDIS in 2010 at my campaign launch in Kalgoorlie prior to being an elected member of this House. I have known Jo Russell for many, many years. For Jo the NDIS has been a very long time coming. Jo is the mother of three children and her eldest and youngest, Daniel and Megan, both have autism. Jo has dealt with disability service providers for over 20 years and I trust her when she says that the problem with disability care is that the system was not created and modelled by those who actually use it. I cannot summarise some of the information Jo has provided to me, so will read Jo's comments. She stated:


Too often, we have to repeat our stories over and over, only to be told we are not 'eligible' or that funding is insufficient for our needs. We have to create and recreate our stories of stress, misery, financial insufficiency and difficulties. Absolutely humiliating and hardly uplifting.


We are sick to the back teeth of service providers and organisations 'assessing' us, and determining what they feel is best for us.


Truthfully, it makes me want to vomit—so tired of the emphasis of service providers on doing things for and 'to' people, rather than 'with' people.


Disability assistance is seen more as a charity model—the terms used in disability language is revolting—we are known as 'clients'—actually we are PEOPLE, thank you!


Jo continued:


THEIR words include things like victim, support, care, crisis, assimilation, programmes, behaviours.


But the language of disability should include words like empowerment, rights and participation, choice, control, and self-determination, dignity, and assurance.


It is critical that we have a system that supports people to make their own decisions, chart their own course, call the shots, but needs to be accompanied by appropriate checks and balances on outcomes. And that system is the NDIS.


Jo added:


So that people with disabilities and their carers have the RIGHT to build the best life THEY can, through their own design and choice, with the help that is needed to get there. This is the NDIS.


Jo, I could not have put that any better myself and I am proud today to stand in this House and read your words. Jo is a strong advocate for not only her own children but also every other family or individual touched by disability in the Goldfields region. Keep up the amazing work you do, Jo. I am totally bewildered by how you do it all on two hours sleep a day.


On a personal note I have a niece with Down syndrome and have seen firsthand the unexpected difficulties that can arise for families including my own. Tess is a twin and she and Emma are now both 11 years old. My wife and I babysit Tess from time to time, and getting her out of the pool is like pulling teeth. Tess does not let me watch the footy when the Dockers are playing because her mum and dad have brainwashed her into only watching the Eagles. That is something that really bemuses me. Tess attends a wonderful school in Kalgoorlie which can cater for her needs and that of her classmates. Again I touch on the amazing work that carers and teachers offer our young students with disabilities. Tess is a great kid, with so much energy, enthusiasm and love to give. However, I know the NDIS will give her just that much more support for her to continue to grow as the gorgeous young lady she already is.


These stories fill me with mixed emotions. The first is to do with the love that families have within them. The second is disappointment that the current system has failed so many Australians. However, the strongest emotion must be the one of hope in all of us for the change that the NDIS promises to so many families and hope that this place can work to support people with disabilities. As politicians, as leaders, as community members, as members of families, we have a responsibility to work together to ensure the implementation of this program without letting politics get in the way. This cannot and must not be politicised.


The unavoidable truth is that this program needs both sides of politics to work together. Although the key players from government and the opposition should be congratulated on bringing this issue to the floor, the success of the NDIS will require ongoing collaboration, non-partisan commitment and funding security. The NDIS will require funding from this government and from future governments, even in a tight fiscal environment. The NDIS will require commitment to its implementation from this government and from future governments. For this reason alone, the amendment moved by the opposition leader should be absolutely endorsed. The most important issue in this debate in my view is that we must not raise the hopes of these very special people in our community only to fail them at the very last hurdle. In this respect, I support the bill and encourage all members to truly put aside party politics on this issue. We must keep politics out of the debate. We need to do what is owed to these families affected by disability. For these reasons, I support the bill. Thank you.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (12:56):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We on this side of the House stand ready to work with the government to ensure that a successful and working NDIS is delivered as soon as possible for all those in need. It is an increasingly rare event for parliaments across the country to consider a piece of legislation so universally supported. That is because the NDIS is all about a fair go for those Australians who need help and support structures to ensure that they can more fully participate in our community. It was Winston Churchill who once said that you measure the degree of civilisation of a society by how it treats it weakest members. It is a statement that I believe most members in this place would agree with.


Providing adequate care for people with a disability is absolutely core government business. I make this point at a time when government is larger, more intrusive and more bloated than ever before. I am reminded by the whole debate leading up to this bill why we are actually here: we are here to protect and improve the lives of all Australians, including disabled Australians.


Last year alone, there more than 250 pieces of legislation passed through this parliament. In many cases, those bills had the effect of increasing regulations and limiting freedom. The pursuit of freedom is something that many opposite place a lower degree of importance on than we on this side of the House. But that pursuit of freedom, both in a personal and community sense, is ingrained in the DNA of the opposition. The bill before us today is unusual in that it will increase the size of government, and most certainly increase expenditure but, at its core, will have the effect of dramatically increasing the freedom of so many people in this country who suffer from a disability—and, in fact, it will dramatically increase the freedom of their carers.


This is no small thing. In 2009, 3.5 million Australians were reported as having a specific limitations or restriction. About 1.3 million people had a profound or severe core activity limitation. There is a huge section of our society whose daily freedoms are restricted through no fault of their own. If there is anything that we as national legislators can do to improve the daily lives and increase the freedoms of a large portion of our society then we should do whatever we can in order to achieve this.


I want to briefly go over some statistics that help paint a picture of disability in Australia. These figures were presented in a PricewaterhouseCoopers report a little over a year ago. The report notes that people with a disability in this country are some 50 per cent less likely to be employed than those without a disability. Beyond that simple fact, a lack of employment obviously leads to financial stress and has an impact on a person's freedom, their confidence, their living standard and their ability to pursue other life objectives. For someone who has recently acquired a disability, the loss of employment often has a more dramatic result. In that instance we often see a rapid downward spiral. It is imperative that we do everything that we in this place can to enhance the opportunities of people with a disability to seek, gain and retain employment.


The next statistic is shocking, particularly when you compare the figure with those from other comparable and, relatively speaking, wealthy nations. When you know that 45 per cent of Australians with a disability live in poverty you realise how grim things are. This is more than 2.5 times the rate of poverty experienced in the general population and more than twice the OECD average, which is 22 per cent. On this issue, we rank a lowly 21st out of 29 OECD countries. When we look at other OECD figures, we see that the OECD average for relative poverty risk is approximately 1.6, which means that those with a disability have a poverty risk 1.6 times higher than those without a disability. Australia has a relative poverty risk of 2.7, making us by far the worst performer in the OECD. These figures are grim and should give all of us reason to pause and think.


It would be naive to suggest that the NDIS will be the answer to all our problems. It will not be. It is important that we do not present this program as some type of magical cure or panacea. Indeed, one of the authors of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that I referred to earlier said that the NDIS could help drive greater workforce and community participation for those with disabilities but only if it was accompanied by a broader cultural shift. He went on to say: 'Without other things happening, an NDIS won't deliver its full potential. If kids with disability can't get into education or access transport to get to a job, we'll continue to fall further behind, even with an NDIS.'


The PricewaterhouseCoopers report suggested that the implementation of an NDIS could support an additional 370,000 people with disabilities into the workforce by 2050. An additional 80,000 carers could also enter the workforce as they were freed from their daily caring responsibilities. This would be terrific. But let us not forget that if there are around 4.5 million Australians who suffer from a form of disability and if a large proportion of those people are already living below the poverty line then we cannot expect an NDIS to make all problems in this space go away—and certainly not overnight—through some miraculous stroke of the pen. This is a very important scheme, but it would be foolish of us to raise expectations where the point that the inevitable reaction of the Australian community is one of disappointment.


Having said all of that, the coalition obviously approaches this bill in the most constructive spirit possible. We supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion in the budget last year and we supported the five launch sites. We support this legislation because we want the NDIS to be a success. Also, we will support measures in the months ahead to ensure that we get a robust and workable NDIS that services our community.


I want to thank all of the parents in my electorate who took the time over the last few years to come and see me and relate their very personal stories, very painfully and very emotionally at times, to me. I know that many of their fellow carers have done the same with my colleagues on this side of the House and with members of the government. They need to be given particular credit. They take time out from their very important commitments to care for family members. Without their persistence and perseverance—they give the issue of disability care and disability services a very real and human aspect—I suspect we may not have reached this point at this particular time. I want to thank them and acknowledge their contribution in standing up and demanding of government what they need, what their families need and what any civilised society ought to provide in order to give those in our community with disabilities, and their carers, the freedom to more fully participate in our society.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (13:07):  I begin where my friend and colleague the member for Indi finished, speaking about the sacrifices that so many parents and families make supporting loved ones, especially children, with disabilities. It is long overdue that we are debating a national disability insurance scheme and that we are on the verge of seeing a national disability insurance scheme actually realised in Australia. It is a testament to the significance of this reform that we have seen so many members from both sides of this chamber add their voices to this debate. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this truly is an idea whose time has come, and the coalition are strongly committed to an NDIS and have been since we supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission of an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme, in 2009. That report was released in 2011 and it confirmed that our current system of support for people with a disability was utterly inadequate, a finding that, while disheartening, we recognised and acknowledged called for action from governments at both the federal and the state level. Australia's funding and support system for those most in need is clearly broken, and this National Disability Insurance Scheme has been a long time coming.


I am proud to say that along with all the other members of the coalition—and I note in particular the advocacy work of Senator Mitch Fifield—I support this proposal to support people with disabilities and their families. It should be a thoroughly core government business. A federally funded scheme that will provide people with a disability, and their carers and families, with regular care and support and with the therapy and equipment they need to live a dignified and fulfilled life is a challenge that faces us all, but it is one that we must all confront to ensure that parliament turns this dream—apparently a bipartisan dream—into a fully functioning and fully funded policy.


It is very important that the government, through this debate, stop trying to represent the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS, as being a Labor reform. It is not a Labor reform; it is a reform that has the wholehearted support of all sides of politics and it is one that will be more compelling and more likely to come to realisation if it is seen as being one of those causes, those political or social reforms, that is not the property of one side of politics or another. There are some issues and causes in this House that are very much the property of one side of politics—some that the government holds dear to but we would disown, and vice versa. But this is one that we should all stand united upon because it is a huge challenge. It is huge in the scale of its complexity, dealing with so many people, each with individual needs and each with thoroughly unique needs. The scale of the resources needed is formidable. An increase in funding from $6 billion to $12 billion towards disability services is not a trifling amount of money. I might say that it underlines the need for prudent economic management, for prudent use of government resources and to ensure that we have a strong and growing economy that will generate the government revenues that will be needed to meet the requirements of this scheme.


The concept, as the Productivity Commission has recommended, would see all Australians contributing to and, should they need it, having access to a well-funded individualised scheme for their own care where individuals needing support would receive vouchers they would be able to spend on service providers, who, over time, would start to provide competitively the service that individuals need. This system will be one where support is based on need, where the individual has more control over the support services, aid and equipment they need in order to live their life to the full and to be able to rise above their disabilities.


As I noted earlier, the coalition supported the initial reference to the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion allocated in the last federal budget, and we have supported the five launch sites as well as the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government to extend the trial to a full state-wide rollout following the Hunter region launch. It has been encouraging, too, to see this concept of a national disability insurance scheme endorsed at COAG.


Many of my own constituents in the electorate of Wentworth have raised this matter with me directly. Whether it is principal Ian Gallan from the Wairoa School in Bondi, or Dr Chris Blackwell, one of our local clinicians, or the many other parents with stories as heartrending as they are profound, they have supported this important initiative. I am a proud patron of SailorswithdisABILITIES, which is a not-for-profit organisation in my electorate of Wentworth that is committed to changing not only the way those with disabilities view themselves but also society's perception of those with a disability. SailorswithdisABILITIES helps over 4,000 disabled children and adults annually through their sailing programs and has an extensive network of volunteers from the local community offering their support.


As a thoroughly able-bodied seaman I know just how difficult sailing can be, certainly in some conditions. It is wonderful to see SailorswithdisABILITIES not only build the confidence of those living with a disability by demonstrating just what they can achieve, but also developing the skills and showing the benefits of working in a team. The founder of SailorswithdisABILITIES, David Pescud, said that he could never accept being written-off because of his disability. He said, 'I was always more interested in what you can do rather than what you cannot do.' That goes to the heart of what an NDIS should be all about. It is about enabling those with a disability to fully participate in all aspects of life. It is about giving those living with a disability the opportunity to maximise their potential, to give them the dignity, the lifestyle and the independence they deserve.


Last year the SailorswithdisABILITIES crew completed the Sydney to Hobart race, crossing the finishing line after three days, 20 hours, four minutes and two seconds at sea. Their crew of disabled sailors beat 50 other boats in the international blue water race, led by the organisation's founder, David Pescud, and president, David Leslie, both of whom are sailors with disabilities. Brett Pearce, a member and volunteer, said of the organisation, 'Being part of SailorswithdisABILITIES is about being part of an organisation that empowers disabled people to achieve more than they thought capable.' Of a National Disability Insurance Scheme David Pescud said the benefits for the members to have the decision-making power to decide who, how and where they choose to spend their funds for their services that they require 'empowers people to make decisions for themselves and the opportunity of the governance of their own lives'.


Another institution in my electorate, which provides education and other services to students with intellectual and physical disabilities from four to 18, is the Wairoa Special School at Bondi. Every year, at our annual Christmas party, we raise money for that school—and it receives support from many other generous people in the community. As Wairoa school and its supporters, families and teachers will be all too aware, it is absolutely vital that those living with a disability get the proper care and education early, before those difficulties multiply—and this is the fantastic service that Wairoa offers, by providing the physical environment which specifically addresses the varying needs of their many students and fosters a culture of support both at school and at home.


For Wairoa, one of the biggest issues is ensuring children are properly assessed. Those who are better-off financially often have more opportunity to have their child assessed properly; and then, if they are assessed as acute, they can receive the maximum level of care. At Wairoa, 50 per cent of the children cared for have autism—and yet their needs differ greatly. Wairoa's experience is that determining the level of care that is required for a child with mild autism or acute autism is like comparing chalk and cheese, as often the children are not assessed properly, because their symptoms are all so different—and, as I said earlier, early assessment is absolutely critical. What Wairoa hopes for in an NDIS is to have a more structured assessment process and a more structured level of assistance to parents so there will be surety and equity of care. One of the main concerns for Dominic Sweeney, a teacher at Wairoa, is the level of care the children receive once they leave the school—the support they get there is fantastic, yet there is a failure at every level, he says, to provide adequate care for them once they move on. An NDIS should be able to address this.


Windgap, another organisation, just outside of my electorate in Eastlakes, knows just how important education and support for those with disabilities are to ensure they reach their full potential and raise community awareness to their needs and aspirations.


Another institution in my community that would have a remarkable difference made to it by an NDIS is Jewish Care, which runs a disability support program for 140 members of the Jewish community with an intellectual disability and provides support for 180 more with a mental illness. The clients of Jewish Care rely almost entirely on the community-raised income for their support. Claire Vernon, of Jewish Care, tells me of a 61-year-old woman living in Department of Housing and Community Services accommodation and attending Print-35, a fantastic initiative established by Jewish Care, which I visited, which employs people with disabilities to produce quality printing while contributing to their personal development and sense of worth. However, to enable this lady to manage in the community, Jewish Care provides a case manager and 16 hours of drop-in support every week—of which eight hours are contributed by the New South Wales government. She is like many with a disability: as they age their needs become more complex. Providing individuals with the funding to enable them to continue to live independently in the community, to direct support to the services they need the most, would, in Jewish Care's opinion, be a wonderful initiative. The need for flexibility and a person-centred approach is something that Jewish Care has recognised and acted on through its flexible funding program which provides $3,000 to $5,000 to families to purchase therapy and respite support.


As Jewish Care knows all too well, for too long families have had to negotiate the maze of services and the lottery of gaining a spot in a program or service. The great virtue of a NDIS is that funding is linked to the needs of each individual and the maximum autonomy and independence is accorded to that individual as their care plans and services are identified.


While there are clearly great prospects and great needs for a NDIS, many concerns remain. So much of how the scheme operates will depend on the rules that are still being finalised and on establishing the long-term funding arrangements to guarantee lifetime support. Above all—and I emphasise this not in any sense of partisanship—the prudent economic management of the government of the Commonwealth is absolutely critical. All of our compassion, all of our concern, for people with disabilities, all of our aspirations for an NDIS, will be only so much warm thoughts and warm words if we cannot afford to pay for them. It has often been said that a vision without resources is nothing more than a hallucination. We cannot afford to fool ourselves about a reform of this scale.


This will be one of the great social reforms of our time—indeed, of any time. It has the coalition's utmost support. We are committed to it and we are, above all, committed to ensuring that if we are returned to government later this year the economy, the business of government, of this nation will be managed in a way that we can well afford to show in real terms—in financial terms—the backing that our compassion calls us to provide.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (13:22):  I congratulate the member for Wentworth on his very well-chosen words in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We have heard many eloquent and heartfelt speeches from both sides of the House attesting to the wide support for a national disability insurance scheme.


There is clearly wide acknowledgement in the community and in this parliament that we need a scheme such as the NDIS. That support is visible wherever you go. Everyone in this chamber will have spoken with people in their own electorates, as I have, who can attest to the fact that the current support system for people with a disability does not work. There are people in our local communities who are carers or who need support, but there can be no one rule that applies to everyone and that works with the same level of effectiveness—disabilities are so varied; families are so varied; the pressures on families are so varied; and the ability of families to deal with a child or children with a disability are varied. A lot of it equates to time; a lot of it equates to money; and some of it even equates to the ability to actually deal with the issue itself.


The level of support a person with a disability receives can therefore depend on a number of factors, both within the family and outside it. Some of those factors include where they live. Are they are on a rural property 60, 70 or 100 kilometres from the nearest town? Are they in a small town, perhaps in western Queensland or eastern Western Australia or some other isolated place where the level of support simply is not available? Is the disability congenital or was it acquired and, if so, when was it acquired? What was the person's position in terms of economic security when it was acquired? There is a whole range of factors. Of course, if the disability is the result of an accident there may be support mechanisms through workers compensation and motor vehicle insurance in some states.


So, again, the issue is not just the disability but how the disability occurred and whether or not the disability occurred as a result of an accident. Particularly if you acquire a disability later in life, the handling of the whole issue is much more difficult—you have to contend with the extra issues of queues and waiting lists. This results in many people with a disability being left without the assistance that they need. There is no doubt we need a new system of support based on need, rather than rationing of an entitlement for support spread across the disabled community. We need to ensure that we deal with this area better. The individual needs to be at the centre of the support. The individual needs to be in charge—to be able to pick the support, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report into the long-term care and support for people with disabilities. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


I grew up with a disabled brother. He has achieved far more in this world, because of the assistance and support he was able to get, than anyone probably thought possible when they looked at that five-year-old with cerebral palsy and wondered if he would ever be able to speak in a way which people could understand, to walk, and to be a productive member of the community. So when I talk about disability insurance and the need to support people with disabilities I think of my brother Neil. He has achieved an extraordinary amount in his life, for many reasons. The first is that he is one of the most determined and stubborn people I have ever met. When he was old enough to understand, he made up his mind that he would overcome his disabilities as best he could. He was able to do so because he was given the support he needed. Obviously, a great deal of that support came from the family. We are a determined family in our own way—I know people would be shocked to hear that!—and when we set our minds on achieving something we usually achieve it. The family has certainly been a great support to him, but, in the end, what really made the difference was the support and services that he got.


He was, of course, supported in another age—the age of institutions. They are out of favour these days—I think sometimes they are unfairly. The Spastic Centre has, in the past, achieved some phenomenal results, but sending children away to a centre like that is now not seen as socially acceptable, and that makes me wonder just how many people like Neil are currently missing out on the opportunities that he was given. The Spastic Centre at New Farm in Brisbane, with the support of our family and the determination of Neil, were able to produce an individual, an adult, who I taught to drive. He ended up getting married and having a child. He worked for most of his life as a public servant. Before that he was even more productive as a farmer. He is now retired. He has achieved a great deal. But, in all honesty, I have to say that Neil is the exception rather than the rule in terms of people with severe disabilities. When we look at people like my brother and what they have achieved, we also have to realise that we are a family who had the wherewithal to do what was needed, and that was in his favour.


The reason we need to look at what can be implemented in an NDIS is that, in the end, we need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve their maximum possible outcome in regard to their disability and their potential. So we need a scheme that, as I say, is individual in the way it operates—that is, not a one-size-fits-all scheme.


The coalition are committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As the Leader of the Opposition said at the National Press Club recently:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


Really, this is about being totally bipartisan. If this issue becomes political—if this becomes an issue which people try to gain votes or political points on—it will simply bogged down. The reality is that the government should accept our offer of a parliamentary oversight committee. The coalition intend to give the government, the Greens and the Independents an opportunity to accept our hand of cooperation by moving an amendment to this bill to establish a nonpartisan oversight committee. That offer should be accepted.


It is so important to note that every government in Australia and every opposition in Australia supports the NDIS, so the issue is not whether we should have an NDIS but whether we should make it happen now rather than haggle over the political issues and not see it happen anytime soon. People in our communities and community organisations are of that view as well. When I talk to the people in Toowoomba who run the Endeavour foundation or to the many other groups that deal with the enormous challenges faced in providing opportunity, care, therapy and treatment for people with disabilities, they are not interested in things that need to be argued about, detailed and sorted out; they just want to see it happen. Parents come to see me and talk about their children, some of whom are, literally, 55 or 60 years old. These parents wonder how their children will be looked after when they, the parents, are no longer around. They are not interested in the politics that often surrounds this place; they just want to see it happen.


Again I refer to my own experience and say that we were lucky in that we were able to do something, but parents with disabled children carry an enormous burden for the whole life of that disabled child. Things are different in a family with a disabled child. No matter how you adjust—and we adjusted pretty well—there are things that need to be done for that child which put pressure and strain on every member of that family, be they child or parent. We need to address this issue and soon. Parents are carrying an enormous weight out there. As I say, our family was fortunate. We banded together. Neil was determined and he has led a relatively normal life. I see families whose every waking moment, almost 24 hours a day, is spent caring for a disabled child. That is why it is imperative that we resolve this issue. That is why it is imperative that we get ourselves into a position where this scheme is affordable.


The member for Wentworth mentioned, and I support him 100 per cent, that the real issue here is that we move forward with our support for an NDIS and work out the implementation passage, but also that we have a government that can govern and provide the money to support the scheme. In the end, with all the intentions, good wishes and cooperation in the world, this will boil down to money and a serious amount of it. We need a government that can manage its budget, and that is part of the issue we are facing: no matter how well-intentioned we are in this House and no matter how much we agree, we are going to have to pay for this. And the problem we have at the moment is that this government is broke—absolutely stone motherless broke. It is broke to the point that it has borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars. So part of the challenge in making sure that this scheme comes about is getting a government that can run a budget in surplus.


As we look at the period ahead, let's hope that we do get that government, but in the meantime we all need to focus on ensuring that we continue to take this path to implement an NDIS. It will require cooperation, and the coalition has offered that. It will require bipartisanship, and the coalition has offered that. It will require that we all sit down around a table and, as we say, co-chair a committee to make this happen. The challenge for the government is to accept that and join with us in making this happen.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (13:35):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. This is a momentous overhaul of disability funding across Australia and represents a once-in-a-generation reform. The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the framework for the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. On average, every 30 minutes someone in Australia is diagnosed with a significant disability. There are 410,000 people across Australia who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.


The current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. The level of support a person with a disability receives in Australia depends on a number of factors: what state they live in, what disability they have and how that disability was attained. While workplace and motor vehicle accidents are covered by accident insurance, those who are born with a disability or who acquire one later in life can be left without the assistance they need or be faced with waiting lists and queues.


The Productivity Commission found that, while there are pockets of successfully managed disability services in some states, no disability support services are working well across the board. I have seen, in my 17 years as a federal member, that families are often frustrated by the lack of support that they receive from state government disability services and by the fact that this support is rationed. We need a new system of support for those with disabilities that is based on need, rather than the current system of rationing on a budget allocation. The individual needs to be in control. The individual needs to be at the centre and able to pick the support, aid, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission report and it is the vision of the NDIS. It will work in a similar way to Medicare, a successful social insurance scheme.


The coalition has been an enthusiastic supporter of the NDIS at every step. We supported the Productivity Commission work, we supported the $1 billion in the last budget, we supported the five launch sites and we are supporting this legislation. We believe the NDIS can be delivered in the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission. As evidence of our goodwill, we are willing to work with the government to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. This historic reform will develop over the life of several parliaments and needs to be the property of the parliament rather than of any one political party. That is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. Unfortunately, those opposite have refused this by voting down Senator Fifield's motion in the Senate with the support of the Greens.


The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. The agency will be set up as an independent body separate from government to deliver and manage the NDIS. This will allow the scheme to be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first site is designed to benefit over 20,000 people with disabilities, their families and carers. The five launch sites are South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, Hunter in the New South Wales and Barwon in Victoria.


An NDIS looks beyond just the immediate need of a person with disabilities and focuses on what that person will require across their lifetime. The scheme provides funding to help people with a disability to participate more fully in economic and social life by providing an entitlement that will allow them to organise aids, equipment, supported accommodation or personal attendant care. The NDIS, when fully implemented, will be available to all Australians who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.


In my own electorate of Boothby there are many important sites where there are a number of people with a disability who will benefit from an NDIS. Bedford Industries, based at Panorama in Boothby since 1949 and originally founded in 1920, is an employment and training provider for people with a disability. It has an excellent reputation across the nation. Bedford supports almost 4,000 people with a disability or disadvantage. It employs 800 people with disabilities across South Australia in its furniture, horticulture, hospitality, packaging and other areas. Bedford provides living arrangements for almost 200 people up at its Balyana residences.


Minda, established in 1898, is South Australia's largest disability service provider. It offers support and opportunity to over 1,500 people in accommodation, supported employment, lifestyle services and respite. Minda has already received $30,000 in funding to prepare themselves for the NDIS through the NDIS Readiness Fund. The Suneden School, founded in 1943 and located in Mitchell Park, is a private school catering for children with intellectual and multiple disabilities aged between five and 21 years old. My electorate office has a number of artworks from the students of Suneden School, and their art show every year is always a highlight of the local community's calendar.    Suneden has close links with a number of external agencies to assist with their provision of programs, including Disability SA, Autism SA, Novita, Minda, Respite Services and various workplace providers, including Bedford Industries, Orana and Phoenix.


In conclusion, this is an important change that will help support those around Australia with disabilities. The coalition supports this bill, and we stand ready with the government to make the NDIS a reality.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (13:42):  At short notice I come into this chamber to talk about a very important subject: the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. The following might be of interest to the member of Boothby, because in closing his remarks he talked about the Suneden School in Mitchell Park. I can inform him that my sister, who was mentally retarded, went to Suneden. She was there for quite a while. It was certainly a very important part of her life to visit Suneden. I know they use different terms these days than the one I use, but I grew up with my sister, who was about 20 months older than myself. She was the seventh-born in the family, and I was the eighth. My mother likes to dine out on the story that when I came along at least one person thought I was perfect; the doctor wanted to reassure my mother that I did not have any intellectual disabilities—although I am sure some people might disagree with that now!


But this is a very important subject, and there is no doubt in my mind that it is a very worthy one. I may speak later about some of the problems that may exist. There are some people who may not be covered who think that they will be covered. In fact, I had an email and a phone call only last week from constituents who were concerned, in one case, that once they reached 65 there would not be any coverage—and they were actually thinking about their son—and, in another case, whether blindness was actually covered by this. And I suppose that is the concern of some people: they might think they are being covered when in actual fact they will not be covered.


The concept of a national disability insurance scheme has gained momentum over the past few years. Whenever it has been brought up in this parliament I have been a very strong supporter. One of the reasons it has gained momentum is due to a very strong grassroots campaign by carers, Australians with disabilities and the organisations that support them. More recently, the Every Australian Counts campaign, chaired by John Della Bosca, has certainly made sure we have strong support in this chamber. It has certainly kept the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the public mind on behalf of all those disability organisations.


The NDIS concept was conceived by John Walsh AM and progressed by Bruce Bonyhady AM, President of Philanthropy Australia. It was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit in 2008. It is probably the only decent thing that came out of that 2020 Summit in 2008. In 2009—so we are talking about four years ago—the federal coalition supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission for an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme. A final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry was released on 10 August 2011. Anyone who has looked at that final report would be encouraged by the support given by the Productivity Commission and would confirm that the current system of support for people with disability is—in their language—'broken'. This conclusion was endorsed by the federal coalition in all of its jurisdictions. We are not playing politics with this. We totally support it and any suggestion otherwise is bunkum.


Agreement has been reached with five states and territories, including my own home state of South Australia, the ACT, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Launch sites will commence in the states in July this year and in the ACT in July next year. In December 2012 the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government concluded an intergovernmental agreement for a full state-wide rollout of the NDIS beyond the Hunter launch site. Further expansion of the NDIS will be dependent on the Commonwealth negotiating and concluding further bilateral agreements with each jurisdiction. Queensland and Western Australia are not hosting launch sites but both have submitted proposals to the Commonwealth to be part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and they are certainly part of the support.


The Labor government has sought to claim the NDIS as its own, rejecting bipartisanship on a number of occasions. That is pretty sad. This is too important to play politics with. This has the support of the whole parliament and it is not just them or us; we all support it. Our only concern is where the money is coming from. We are committed to finding that money. We certainly want to show that it does have very strong cross-party support at both federal and state levels.


This bill provides for the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Some people might ask: why has this taken so long? To be fair to the government and to everyone, this is a big decision by government and a big decision by this parliament. It will need a pilot scheme. The last thing we want is money just thrown at something without some sort of sensible pilot scheme to make sure that it works. It is important that we do this properly. That probably means we are going a bit slower than some people would like, but if we do it properly we will end up with a well-thought-out scheme.


The agency may provide general support for people with disability who are not participants in the NDIS, through information, coordination and referral activities. While most funding for NDIS participants will be in the form of individual support packages, the agency may block fund some entities that support people with disability. That is a bit like what we do with block funding in private schools: as a government, we do not get down to the nitty-gritty and saying, 'You do it this way.' For example, in my electorate, where the Lutheran school system is very strong, they get block funding and organise it themselves. In some ways I think that is more efficient than government bureaucracies trying to run it. We support that.


The eligibility provisions described in the scheme require that a person's impairment results in substantially reduced functional capacity affecting their communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management. Eligibility includes early intervention to mitigate, alleviate or prevent the deterioration of a person's functional capacity.


As I mentioned earlier, people over 65 years of age at the time they request NDIS support will not be eligible. However, future participants can choose to continue with the NDIS once they turn 65. The assessment method will be in the NDIS rules. It is important that we have personal planning provisions which emphasise a person-centred and self-directed approach. A plan must include a statement of participant goals and aspirations prepared by the participant in the statement of participant supports to be approved by the agency.


I digress for a short period of time. Very early in my career as a member of this parliament, I was approached by four mothers in my electorate. I remember the meeting very well. They were concerned not so much about themselves and the work that they do as carers—they saw that as their duty and that was not a problem—but about what happens when they die. You hear that time and time again: 'Who is going to look after my children?' Obviously they will have grown up a bit more, but who will look after them when both parents are deceased? That was a real concern for them because they want to ensure that their offspring get the proper care that they need. I have heard that very often when other members speak on this bill.


Coming back to the bill itself, the plans will specify general support—and that is not purchased with individualised funding—and reasonable and necessary support. Of course, when we talk about 'reasonable', that is always a bit of a moot point: what is reasonable? Some people will want more than others think is reasonable, but in the end we will do our best, whether we are in government or in opposition, to make sure that they get that support. There will also be a review date and it will describe how the funds and other aspects of the plan will be managed. Managing the funding for supports under a plan can be done by a registered plan management provider, a nominee, the agency or participants themselves. Plan management involves purchasing supports, and receiving, managing and acquitting the funds.


Details about the process to become a registered provider of supports or a plan manager will be outlined in the NDIS rules. The agency may compel prospective participants to take action to obtain compensation for personal injury, and the agency is entitled to recover relevant portions of any compensation awarded to participants. These provisions are designed to protect the NDIS from cost-shifting.


There will have to be review processes. Information on review rights must be given to participants when reviewable decisions are made. Reviewable decisions cover eligibility support plans, provider registration, and nominee determinations. And, like many parts of legislation from this parliament, the legislation provides a further avenue of review to the all-important Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 


Governance will also be important. The agency will have a board consisting of a chair and eight members who collectively will possess an appropriate balance of skills, experience or knowledge in the following fields: provisional use of disability services, operation of insurance, compensation or long-term liability schemes, financial management or corporate governance. The Commonwealth minister will appoint the chair and must obtain the approval of a majority of jurisdictions before those members are appointed.


The legislation also establishes an independent advisory council that will include at least four people with disabilities; at least two carers; at least one person with skills, experience or knowledge in the supply of equipment or provision of services; and up to five more members. The legislation provides for an independent review of the act after two years.


I pay credit to my elder sister who was a nun with the Josephites. She set up the first lance society in Australia. She was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her work there. Our family experience was of a child with a mental disability and it has certainly been a very strong part of my family's upbringing. (Time expired)

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (13:57):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. There are not many in this House that do not have some understanding of the hardship families experience in caring for those with a disability. My electorate of Wright is quite remote. It starts at the top of the Toowoomba Range and borders Robina on the Gold Coast. In an area like that we do not have an enormous amount of infrastructure to help or support families. As a rural and regional community we rely heavily on neighbours, friends and family to support those people in their hours of need.


We will not be opposing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I remind the House that we support this bill, as we do 83 per cent of legislation when we come into the House. This government would have you believe there is a relentless negativity from the opposition. That is factually not true. Public documents from the Parliamentary Library state that we have supported over 83 per cent of bills that have come before this House. What may not be known to those in the gallery today is that the coalition has requested a bipartisan committee to be formed on the National Disability Insurance Scheme so that we can move forward collectively with this. But no—as we move through, they will continue to take the single headline, the single grab, that 'the coalition are opposed to this' and that it is only Labor that will provide and deliver an NDIS. I say to you, Madam Speaker and those in the gallery, that nothing could be further from the truth. There are no lows to which this government will not go to hide the truth when it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


I also take the opportunity to acknowledge where the pilot projects are being rolled out at the moment, in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and the ACT—



The SPEAKER:  Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (12:03):  Before my comments were interrupted by other parliamentary business in the last session I was speaking about Britney and how after her school graduation last year she and her mother became in need of additional further support after school. Her mother works as a nurse and she needs more support hours so that she can look after Britney and provide for the rest of the family. Most of that support comes from the state, but it does highlight the need for the Prime Minister to stop her politically driven fights with the states and seek bilateral agreements as everyone needs to be on board to drive change and deliver for all those with disabilities such as Britney, Mitchell and their families.


Throughout this debate, the government has repeatedly suggested that they are the party of the NDIS because the NDIS represents Labor values. But I remind the parliament that abandoning those in need is not the policy of any political party. The coalition supported the work of the Productivity Commission. We supported the $1 billion in the last budget and the five launch sites, and the agreement for the New South Wales rollout, and we support this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition has also demonstrated his personal commitment to those with disabilities by dedicating the 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride to Carers Australia; $540,000 was raised.


An economy well managed by the federal government can deliver the NDIS in the time frame, but not this government. They talk about their values with the usual sanctimony, but in the end their spending decisions have damaged the ability of this nation to have an NDIS on time, and they must be held to account. Talk is cheap; the NDIS is not, and it will fall to a better government to deliver—and that better government, I hope, will be delivered soon when the Australian people reject the Labor Party.


I thank those constituents of mine who have come forward to tell me of their circumstances and to impress upon me their needs. What I would say is that under Tony Abbott we want to deliver the change required, but because of the wasteful spending of this government there is now more spending on interest payments each year than would be required to fully fund the NDIS. This Labor government has spent beyond the means of this country, and their recklessness is now holding back a comprehensive and effective NDIS. To cover up their inability to fund this worthwhile and necessary NDIS, they have picked fights with state governments to develop a smokescreen and deceive the people of this country. Australians should choose a Tony Abbott led government at the election to get this job done.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (12:05):  Today I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012 and the positive benefits it will have for the people of Macarthur. I believe this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever been and that ever will be spoken about in this parliament.


Since becoming the member for Macarthur I have fought hard to support the charity groups and organisations in my electorate who support those living with a disability and their families. These families should have access to the funding and support services they need to ensure the best quality of life possible for their loved ones. The NDIS will provide this much-needed support by providing the funding and support services they need. We hope this will in turn help them join the workforce and become active members of our communities.


The NDIS will empower individuals and reduce red tape for people living with a disability and their carers. It will provide funding to individuals and organisations to help people with a disability participate more fully in our communities through things like aids, equipment, supported accommodation and personal care. It is my strong belief that the financial support and assistance for these people living with a disability should not be the responsibility of the parents and carers, who already provide hands-on support to their loved ones 24 hours a day, seven days a week.


The added pressure of fundraising for equipment and fighting for more services and financial support should not be left to these families who have so much on their plates already. The sad truth is that the lack of funding and support can put even more pressure and stress on these families and sometimes pull them apart. The NDIS will provide funding in the form of individual support packages for people living with a disability and the possibility of some block funding for different groups or organisations to support these Australians and their families. In my electorate the cracks are definitely showing. It is very obvious that our current system of support for people living with a disability in this country is not working. In Macarthur, people living with a disability and their families are relying heavily on the support of several charities, community groups and organisations who work hard to continually raise money to provide this vital support.


Many times in this place I have mentioned these groups and the fantastic work they do in my community to help those in need. These include KU Starting Points, an educational support organisation that offers a range of early intervention programs for children with disabilities and their families; the Right Start Foundation, a group of local parents who raise money and awareness to provide support for local families living with Down syndrome; the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, an organisation dedicated to improving health care for every child living in Macarthur by raising money and advocating for children's health services and research across the region; Society 389, an organisation that provides financial support and assistance for families of children with disabilities and special needs; Macarthur Disability Services, a not-for-profit organisation that provides support for people living with a disability, people with a mental illness, the aged, families and carers in the Macarthur region; Macarthur Temporary Family Care, an organisation that provides support and high-quality care programs for children of families in crisis and respite care for children and adults who have a physical or intellectual disability; NOVA Employment, offering specialist job-seeking assistance and post-placement support for people living with a disability; and Northcott Disability Services, one of New South Wales's leading service providers for people living with a disability, providing support and services direct to their clients as well as carers and family members.


All of these groups provide vital support to residents in my community and rely heavily on community fundraisers, state and federal government grants and hardworking volunteers to do the great work they do in my electorate. Many of these groups have played an active role in the Every Australian Counts campaign to raise awareness of the NDIS in Macarthur. I have attended many of these events and heard firsthand from those families who believe the NDIS would have a huge impact on their lives. While speaking about these groups in parliament I have also shared the stories of many children and families in my electorate who have relied on their support. One of these children was Brittney McKenna, who was born with the heartbreaking disease spinal muscular atrophy. Sadly, Brittney passed away in 2008 at just nine years of age. When I met with Brittney's parents last year they mentioned the lack of funding and respite for families living with SMA and the added stress this caused to their family. There was limited support offered to Brittney's family and no respite because she was classified as 'too high medical support'. Brittney's mum was proficient in all her medical needs including her IV medications. In between all the years spent in hospital, the 41 surgeries and the 24-hour intensive care for their daughter, Debbie and Andrew also had to do their own fundraising for equipment and home modifications to support Brittney. They told me that life by the hospital bed included a constant struggle with red tape, bureaucracy, budgets and politics in an attempt to get some support. My hope for the NDIS is that no family in Macarthur or anywhere else in Australia should ever have to experience what this family went through whilst trying to care for a sick child. Brittney's longest single admission in hospital was 21 months. Her dad, Andrew, was working interstate to support the family financially and her mum, Debbie, was by her hospital bed 24 hours a day. Their son Liam was passed around family and friends to give him some stability and routine. With the help of the community the family raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to give Brittney the life she deserved. It is no wonder they were left financially, physically and emotionally exhausted.


In recent years I have become very close to many families in my electorate who love and support someone with a disability. That is why this issue is very close to my heart. It is no secret that I am a big supporter of the Right Start Foundation, a charity group that supports local families living with Down syndrome. The foundation was started by a group of mums who have children living with Down syndrome. These women continually fight for funding and support and are now raising money to establish Australia's first Down syndrome specific centre in Macarthur to ensure children and families receive all the therapy and support they need for the right start in life. These parents really are an inspirational group of people. Not only do they provide so much love and support for their own children; they work hard to raise awareness and to fundraise to support others living with Down syndrome. My hope is that the NDIS will give these children the support they deserve and greater opportunities to support themselves as they grow older.


Another reason the NDIS is very close to my heart is that one of my very own staff members has a son with a disability. Ben Upfill was born with one of the most severe forms of Angelman syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder which causes severe intellectual disability, speech impediment, sleep disturbance, unstable jerky movements of the limbs and seizures. Ben's Mum, Carla, his dad, Dave, and siblings, Joel and Olivia, give Ben all the love and support they can as a family to make sure he has the best quality of life possible. Unless you have a child with a severe disability it is hard to imagine what it is like to provide such intensive care to a child at home whilst working to pay the bills and provide for your disabled child and the rest of your family. Just a few years ago the Macarthur charity Society 389 could see the family was in need of a new car to help them transport Ben in his wheelchair. Through a charity night more than $45,000 was raised to buy the family a car to make life a little easier for them.


My point is that families, like this one, who are caring for a child with a disability, are very lucky to have the support of many charities made up of volunteers to help them raise money to support their children. For some the support of these charities is a godsend, because without them these families would be forced to make a choice between supporting their disabled child and paying the bills and putting food on the table. Unfortunately the resources of these charities and organisations can become quite stretched, with so many people in my community needing their support. That is why the National Disability Insurance Scheme is so important and why it is so important that we get it right.


We need a new system of support based on need. The person living with the disability and their family or carers need to be at the centre of the scheme and in charge, able to choose the support, aid, equipment, and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme which I wholeheartedly support. The coalition supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme because we know that the current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. This is why the concept of the NDIS has gained momentum over the past five years. In my own electorate, groups like Macarthur Disability Services, Northcott Disability Services, Macarthur District Temporary Family Care, Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly councils, Sunnyfield Independence, the Macarthur Disability Network and Macarthur Diversity Services have all worked together to raise public awareness about the importance of the scheme and show Macarthur's support for its successful implementation.


In October last year I attended the Macarthur NDIS Big DisabiliTEA to hear from these groups and show my support for the NDIS. It was a great day with many families from across my electorate there to share their stories and show their support. Events like this one are very important. Not only did it raise awareness for the scheme but it was to me like a cry for help from these Macarthur families who love their children so much and want to see them given the support they need now and into the future. So many of the parents I spoke to fear what will happen to their children once mum and dad are no longer around to look after them. Yes, many of them have siblings who love them and will take on the role of carer when it is their turn, but it is important that these siblings are given the support they need to carry on this role.


I believe that the NDIS will give many parents peace of mind that even when they are no longer around to provide for their children the Australian government will ensure they have access to the support services and funding they need. And of course it is not just Macarthur residents who will benefit from the scheme. It is estimated that 7,500 young Australians who require full-time care are currently living in aged-care facilities and more than 700,000 young Australians are being cared for at home by their loved ones.


There are so many young people and so many Australian families who need our help. It is our job to make sure that they do not slip through the cracks. Perfecting the NDIS gives us an opportunity to do just that. This is why the coalition has supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, which confirmed that our current system of support simply is not good enough. We support the National Disability Insurance Scheme and believe it requires bipartisan support from both sides of government.


While we supported the $1 billion promised in last year's budget, it was disappointing that this figure fell short of what the Productivity Commission estimated would be needed in the first four years of the scheme by $3 billion. I would hope to see the Treasurer account for this shortfall in his coming budget. The coalition has also supported the five launch sites for the NDIS and the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments for a full statewide rollout after the launch in the Hunter.


We believe that the NDIS can be delivered within the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission by a sensible government that manages it well. We are ready to work with the government to see an NDIS delivered as soon as possible and we believe that we must get this right the first time around, with a very high level of consultation and attention to the detail from now until its full implementation.


So far we have heard very little in regard to how each individual will be assessed and who will be eligible for the scheme. I would like to know if the NDIS is going to extend to those who might look healthy from the outside but are struggling with a terminal illness. For example, in Macarthur there are more than 80 people living with cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that effects more than 3,000 people in Australia. The condition is life threatening, and daily physio treatment, regular hospital stays and life-threatening lung infections can limit a person suffering from CF and their carers from leading a full and productive life.


Cystic Fibrosis Australia has put forward a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in regard to the NDIS. In the submission the organisation has asked that the NDIS framework include people living with cystic fibrosis. It has asked that the scheme provide the full range of equipment used by people with CF, including parts and servicing for nebulisers, oxygen saturation machines, mouthpieces and inhalers. They would also like to see the inclusion of non-PBS medicines, both dietary and other supplements, as well as travel and accommodation allowances to attend specialist clinics. The submission pushes for a needs assessment and support service for carers and the inclusion of preventative services such as exercise programs and equipment for CF sufferers. These are just some of the things needed by people living with cystic fibrosis that could be provided under the NDIS.


I am also concerned about the eligibility for residents in my electorate who are over 65 years of age. Will they be eligible to benefit from the NDIS? There are many unanswered questions that must be worked through properly. This is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would lock in all parties and allow us to work through the design and eligibility together.


I find it disappointing that the government has knocked back the coalition's call for bipartisanship on so many occasions. I believe that the implementation of the NDIS should be placed above politics. I think that this is a time when we must come together to ensure that we get it right for all people living with a disability in our electorates. There is no reason for one side of politics to take on such an important piece of legislation on its own.


I believe that if we work together we can implement one of the best disability policies in the world, one that ensures no person living with a disability falls through the cracks. If the scheme is to succeed it will need the support of all levels of government in all states and territories across this country. If it is well-implemented, the scheme will ensure people with a disability have the support they need today and into the future.


I spend a lot of time with families in my electorate who have children living with a disability. I am continuously inspired by their positive attitude and their dedication to breaking down barriers and raising awareness of their child's condition. But no matter how amazing the parent or the child might be, raising a child with additional needs can be extremely challenging and isolating. That is why I believe that it is imperative that we work together on this one, because I want nothing more than the best for my community and those Macarthur families who will benefit from this scheme. I wholeheartedly support a National Disability Insurance Scheme for the people of Macarthur and the people of Australia. I hope that as a parliament we can work together to ensure the scheme is rolled out as effectively and as soon as possible.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (12:19):  In addressing the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, let me begin by giving my wholehearted support to the bill and to the broader underlying principle. I want to speak briefly today across three fronts: the humanity behind the bill; the principles to be enshrined in the bill; and the issue of supported accommodation, which, for those living in the Hastings area as well as across the electorate of Flinders and across Australia, is a critical element of care and treatment for those who have some of the most challenging disabilities that we face in our country.


I want to begin by looking at the humanity, with people that I know. There is a young fellow, Tom McGann, whom I have known for over a decade. His situation is that has had:


… a neuromuscular disability since birth which means I have never walked and have been in a motorised wheelchair from age 4.


He is now a young adult. He went through mainstream schooling at Mount Martha Primary School and then secondary school. He is a joy to be with and he is an absolute source of pride to his parents. These days, he is studying IT at TAFE and his goal is to have a career in the field. He has been involved with Boccia, a Paralympic sport, and with Channel 31, where he has an on-camera role.


He has also been involved with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a local self-help group created to assist those with disabilities to have access to the appropriate technology. It was started by a magnificent local constituent, Richard Stubbs, who was a very successful banker. He developed a severe neuromuscular condition and lost much of his mobility. His response was not to feel sorry for himself but to establish a practical self-help group named Beyond Disability. I have watched as their charitable work has grown and expanded. It has provided a window to the world, an avenue and means of communication, self-respect, creativity and fulfilment.


Out of that process has come Tom McGann. Tom has been determined to live the best life he can lead. He is really a shining example to me of a life well lived. So it is a real honour to have known him since he was such a young age and to have watched him develop through primary and secondary school and then enter tertiary education as a fine young Australian. His story is powerful because it is an example of what we can be and how we can overcome challenges and be our best selves. He has done that despite great difficulties, with the support of stunningly helpful and committed parents. In many cases, family circumstances just do not allow these steps forward. That is why we come to the issue of a national disability insurance scheme.


I saw another example only a couple of weekends ago, when the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia held a disabled surf event at Point Leo on the Mornington Peninsula. My understanding is that there were over 50 participants. I was there in a wetsuit as one of the support crew—




Dr Southcott:
  Shameless!




Mr HUNT:
  Yes! I gave my little bit. There were 50-plus participants who have disability, and they had the time of their lives. Some were a little bit frightened, but you could see their fear being overcome as something new came into their lives. You could see the joy—they were just thrilled to be in the water. By my count, there were over 200 volunteers there. It was one of the most uplifting events you could ever witness. It was Australians supporting Australians, locals supporting locals and families supporting families, in the best of all possible ways.


Many of these people and their families have endured extraordinary challenges and difficulties. Whether it is Tom McGann or the crew at the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia or the people for whom they are caring; whether it is Richard Stubbs or another local constituent, Alan Lachman, who, in order to give his daughter, Francesca, the best support he could, helped establish the Insight school for those with visual challenges, blindness and other forms of eyesight disability; whether it is those working in the autism space—and we have pledged to work with Senator Mitch Fifield, our shadow minister responsible, towards a national autism summit; whether it is any of those or the many other areas in which challenges abound, it is time for a National Disability Insurance Scheme.


The principle behind this is that, if you were designing a budget from scratch—if you had a blank sheet of paper—supporting those with disabilities in the best possible way would be right at the top of the list of measures because it is an expression of our humanity, an expression of decency and an expression of what we do. But, as we have developed in different ways over different times, we come to the point where we are today, with a different budgetary position.


So what we have to do now, I think, is adopt two fundamental principles: firstly, flexibility of delivery and, secondly, a non-bureaucratic model. The critical principle of flexibility of delivery is that we find the right solution for the right person. Each person's needs will be different. That may mean that for some it is about respite, for others it is about ongoing care and for others it is about material assistance such as customisation of a car or other vehicle or provision of computer equipment. Our approach should be flexibility, and that is what I think is critical—a flexible approach.


That leads to the non-bureaucratic model. I am very heartened by what I have seen come out of Western Australia. I think the Barnett model of flexibility is non-bureaucratic and an extremely important way forward. I think we should all look to the way in which Western Australia has provided a model. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a simple, flexible, non-bureaucratic model which is not about employing lots and lots of public servants but about giving individual families, carers and those suffering from disabilities the ability to meet their most significant needs.


That leads me to my third and final point, which is about supported accommodation. The Hastings model, as it is sometimes called, of small supported accommodation started just across the road from my office. Families such as Norm and Dizzy Carlyon, Joy and David Jarman, and Karl and Marie Hell—Karl has now passed on—came together to say that we needed a small, local supported accommodation centre. That was funded and it is largely built, but I have to say, with great respect to the Commonwealth, that nothing has happened in the best part of 18 months. The buildings have been frozen and the Commonwealth has not intervened to ensure that a building issue is resolved. I would respectfully say to the minister: now is the time to intervene, bring together the different parties and make sure that this building dispute is ended. It is a great model and one which I would like to see as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but this case in Hastings can and should be resolved so we can get young people into supported accommodation. They are waiting; they are desperate; their families have visited. So I say to the minister: please intervene. This is an early example of the positive things that can be done by a national scheme. It is a pilot, an exemplar and a model. I ask for your help.


Having said that, when I think of Tom McGann, disabled surf Australia, Richard Stubbs, the work that Alan Lachman has done and those parents of children with autism, for whom we did our walk two years ago, they need and, above all else deserve, our support. As a parliament, we can be our best selves by supporting them. I commend the notion of a joint parliamentary committee. We will, as a parliament—as a unified group of people—continue to work towards a model which ultimately is not about bureaucracy nor tight rules; it is about finding the right solution to the needs of each family with a significant disability so that those families and those with the disability can be their best selves.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:30):  I rise today to give my whole hearted support to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. It is an important bill. It shows that, as a country, we can be compassionate and fair, and we can look after those who are less fortunate—who, due to circumstances out of their control, have had things happen to them that mean that they will need assistance and help throughout their lives. As a society, we can recognise that and do what needs to be done.


As a young boy growing up, my parents every year took me along to support the Mansfield Autism Centre. They held a ball every year. It was put on to raise money for that centre, and as a young boy I came across the parents, the carers and the children who were in the centre, and I got an understanding of all the issues that they were dealing with. It has meant that as I have gone through life I have had a great deal of compassion and sympathy, but above all else I have had a great deal of admiration for everyone who works in the disability sector and for all those people with disabilities as they go about their lives.


As a parliament we have a real opportunity to make a difference with this bill, and that is what we should do. Only three or four months ago I was reminded of the time that I spent as a young boy trying to help and support the Mansfield Autism Centre, when I met with the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group. I went along to talk to the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group but also, more importantly, to listen. While I was there—I was there for a couple of hours—I heard some of the most compelling testimony that you would hear in your life as to why we need a national disability insurance scheme.


One lady in particular read out a four-page letter about the difficulties that she had had getting respite for her child. It was an incredibly moving letter. I do not think anyone in the room—and there were 30 or 40 of us—had a dry eye by the time she has finished. The sad thing about her letter was that it showed clearly the difficulties that people face in this area. More often than not it is not because anyone sets out to deliberately cause problems or issues; it is just that the system is broken. It is having a huge personal toll on those who are dealing with this system. That is why we need to implement this bill. We need to implement the trials that are part of this bill and we need to get on with making sure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme becomes a reality.


I would like to take the time to thank the opposition shadow minister for disabilities, carers and the voluntary sector for the time that he has spent in my electorate explaining what the scheme would mean to our local communities. He has visited Portland, Warrnambool, Avoca and Maryborough. I am sure—he has said so—he would more than willing to come back and meet with other groups to explain how important this NDIS scheme is. I have met with more groups across the electorate, and everywhere I go all I can think is that the case is even more compelling for this scheme.


I would like to congratulate those who have campaigned for the NDIS. I had a meeting on 8 September 2011 with Jacqui Pearce and Lynn Foreman, who came to my office to promote the NDIS. Lynn Foreman in particular went beyond the call of duty to ensure that she got to that meeting and was able, once again, to make me aware of the need for the NDIS. She tried to get down by train. In the end she could not, and ended up having to come in a taxi—which shows once again the difficulties people with disabilities face on a daily basis. But, once again, they were able to put an extremely compelling case—and that has been done across the nation, to all MPs and to all senators, to both state and federal parliamentarians, because we are going to require the cooperation of those two levels of government to ensure that the NDIS is rolled out and rolled out properly.


I would also like to take this opportunity to mention Bill Shorten because, in his previous role as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, he spent a lot of time publicising the need for the NDIS. In a show of bipartisanship I would like to recognise the contribution that Bill Shorten has made.


I would also like to recognise the contribution that the Productivity Commission has made. It is not easy getting the parameters right around implementing such a thing as the NDIS. This is serious reform and it needs to be done in a way that we know will work. There are people whose hopes are dependant on the NDIS and its successful rollout, and the Productivity Commission to date has done an outstanding job in setting the framework as to how that should take place.


When we talk about bipartisanship I think we should note—and this will be as important on our side, if we win the next election, as it is currently to the government—that we need to do everything we can as a parliament to make this a bipartisan step. This is something that all sides of this House should be able to get together and work on, to make sure that what we get is an excellent product. Neither side of this place has the wherewithal and the brains to ensure that every single element of this is rolled out to perfection. What we need to do is to make sure that we cooperate, that we work together, that we ensure that by putting our minds together collectively we do the best we can—and I think it is beholden to the government to look at what it can do to ensure that the NDIS is a bipartisan initiative, as much as it will be on this side if we win the next election. That is something that I will be extremely keen to see in the months and years ahead, as we continue to roll out the scheme.


There are going to be important aspects of the scheme that we are going to have to make sure we get right. The previous speaker, Mr Hunt, expressed some of these aspects. There are two in particular that I would like to pick up on; one is that we are going to have to make sure that there is flexibility of delivery. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, because it will not work—across disabilities there are unique circumstances. When it comes to how this is rolled out, and the services delivered between metropolitan, regional and rural communities, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. So we have to ensure that there is proper flexibility in the system. If we do not do that, then once again we will see people battling the system, and they have been doing that for too long. That is what the NDIS is all about: trying to prevent the bureaucracy and the red tape from sucking the life out of people as they try to get help for their loved ones. We have to make sure that the system we put in place is flexible across disabilities, but it must also be flexible across communities, whether they are metropolitan, regional or rural.


We also have to ensure as best we can that red tape is minimised, because nothing strangles more than red tape. For people who are emotionally dealing with incredibly difficult circumstances, the last thing they need is having that emotion added to by having constant battles with red tape. Often the red tape is well-intentioned. It is put there to ensure that delivery occurs according to how the system is legislated, but we have to make sure that, in putting this system in place, what we want to see occur is very clear and we have to make sure it allows people to get on with caring for their loved ones.


The time has come for this piece of legislation. It is something we need to see as quickly as possible. When I have met with groups across my electorate, there has been one uniform and compelling thing that they have said to me, and that is that they want to see compassion from their government—they call it 'their government', and they should call it 'their government'. They want to see an understanding, they want to see that people are listening and, above all else, they want to see a government which is prepared to step in and help them deal with the issues that they are dealing with on a daily basis. That is what this piece of legislation will enable. We still have a long way to go. We have to make sure that the trials are done properly; we have to make sure that we learn lessons from the trials; we have to make sure that the feedback from the trials will feed into the final NDIS; and we have to make sure that the establishment of the NDIS is done in such a way that we can continue to have bipartisan support for the model. These are going to be the challenges that we are all going to have to meet as we go forward.


I would like to say this: failure on this piece of legislation is not an option. Once you have met with community groups, once you have met with disability carers groups and once you have seen what these people are currently going through, you have to keep in the back of your mind that failure is not an option. They are doing wonderful work. They are dealing with things that we have to make sure we comprehend. We have to compassionately show that we understand and want to lend a hand. If we do not do that as a national parliament, we will fail. I do not want that resting upon my shoulders, as I am sure no-one else in this parliament wants it resting on theirs. I give my wholehearted support to this piece of legislation. We still have a lot of hard work to do, but we have to make sure that we do it and we get it right.

"Crook, Tony, MP",NatsWA,2013-03-12,"



Mr CROOK
 (O'Connor) (12:44):  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. I agree with many statements made by members of this House, on both sides of politics, and I would particularly like to endorse the comments of the member for Wannon. I have enjoyed the non-politicised, passionate words from members such as the member for Gippsland and my friend the member for Denison. As members are all too aware, the current disability support system is unfair, underfunded and disjointed. The current system fails to give people with a disability proper choice about their future and gives no guarantee of access to appropriate support.


Australia is a fortunate, wealthy country where most Australians enjoy freedom of choice and boundless opportunities. However, one of the largest minority groups, people living with a disability, are not afforded basic rights and are not protected by the social safety net that protects most Australians. In many cases Australia has failed to provide people living with a disability with the very basic commitments of fairness and human rights. It is sad to hear that by most empirical measurements Australians living with disabilities and their carers are among the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. All Australians deserve a fair go. In this respect, these changes are long overdue. I believe we will look back at this time as an important crossroad in our nation.


There have been many times in this 43rd Parliament when I have been embarrassed about the politicking, infighting and obsession with party room antics that occur at the expense of our constituents, but today I am proud. I am proud to be a member of this parliament when both sides of politics are working together to improve the lives of Australians and to give people with a disability a right to realise their potential—a right that should be afforded to all Australians.


In such an important debate, I feel it is important to stop and make some acknowledgements. As members have done before me, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the carers of people with disabilities—to all the O'Connor electorate carers who I have had the pleasure of meeting and all those who I am yet to meet and, indeed, all carers in Australia. I acknowledge the enduring love and lifelong commitment that carers give to their disabled family members and friends. I acknowledge the huge amount of work that carers undertake and their willingness to participate in vital, unpaid work that benefits the entire community. I acknowledge the integral role that carers play in the Australian health system and in the Australian economy. I acknowledge and congratulate many of those carers who have done so much work to put this debate on the national agenda for those who cannot.


I also acknowledge the professional staff who work in the O'Connor electorate and I acknowledge the professional staff who work in high-care facilities, nursing homes and schools throughout Australia. Thank you for your tireless work. It not only improves the lives of many individuals and their families but contributes to the social fabric of our regional communities.


Finally, I acknowledge all of those people living with a disability in the O'Connor electorate. I acknowledge all those who joined me for a morning tea in Kalgoorlie and to all those who joined Wendy Duncan, at the time the member of the Legislative Council in Western Australia, for a DisabiliTEA in Esperance. In particular, I acknowledge the special people from my electorate who have taken the time to share their stories with me and to contribute to this debate.


Throughout 2012 I heard from many constituents on this issue—some with disabilities, some carers, some support service professionals, and many community members who thought that people with a disability deserved a fairer go. As members have done before me, I would like to share a couple of stories. It is most important to remember that these stories reflect what it is like every single day for many Australians. One such story that sticks in my mind is from Kathy and Greg Jones in Narrogin in regional Western Australia. Kathy and Greg are 60-year-old parents of a son with cerebral palsy. Their son is in a wheelchair and is fully reliant on his parents for everything. He is unable to walk or talk. Kathy and Greg, like many committed parents with a disabled child, often wonder, 'What happens when we are unable to care for our child? Once we pass away, where will our child live? How will he be looked after?' Without the NDIS, the answer to these questions and to many more is too difficult to contemplate by any parent. Kathy and Greg have commented that, once they know that the NDIS is on the way, they may begin to sleep at night again.


Another example is Jill, a tireless worker in disability support services in the city of Albany on the south-west coast of my electorate. Jill has described the astonishing amount of stress that families are put under when they are unable to access proper support for their disabled child. Under the current system, families have to bare their souls and participate in a very crisis-driven application process for support. Jill knows of families that simply cannot cope with the stress of not having support for their child. Some families have ended up with mental illnesses and within the mental health system from the stress. This, in fact, compounds the problem because, as we all know, mental health has its issues around funding and service delivery, particularly in regional and remote Australia.


Other families have considered handing their child back to the Department of Child Protection. This a notion that, to most, is incomprehensible and a decision that must be devastating. These levels of stress are echoed by participants in the Productivity Commission inquiry who noted that parents regularly contemplate suicide as they have been unable to find adequate support for their child.


My next story is of a very special Goldfields woman who gave me information about the NDIS in 2010 at my campaign launch in Kalgoorlie prior to being an elected member of this House. I have known Jo Russell for many, many years. For Jo the NDIS has been a very long time coming. Jo is the mother of three children and her eldest and youngest, Daniel and Megan, both have autism. Jo has dealt with disability service providers for over 20 years and I trust her when she says that the problem with disability care is that the system was not created and modelled by those who actually use it. I cannot summarise some of the information Jo has provided to me, so will read Jo's comments. She stated:


Too often, we have to repeat our stories over and over, only to be told we are not 'eligible' or that funding is insufficient for our needs. We have to create and recreate our stories of stress, misery, financial insufficiency and difficulties. Absolutely humiliating and hardly uplifting.


We are sick to the back teeth of service providers and organisations 'assessing' us, and determining what they feel is best for us.


Truthfully, it makes me want to vomit—so tired of the emphasis of service providers on doing things for and 'to' people, rather than 'with' people.


Disability assistance is seen more as a charity model—the terms used in disability language is revolting—we are known as 'clients'—actually we are PEOPLE, thank you!


Jo continued:


THEIR words include things like victim, support, care, crisis, assimilation, programmes, behaviours.


But the language of disability should include words like empowerment, rights and participation, choice, control, and self-determination, dignity, and assurance.


It is critical that we have a system that supports people to make their own decisions, chart their own course, call the shots, but needs to be accompanied by appropriate checks and balances on outcomes. And that system is the NDIS.


Jo added:


So that people with disabilities and their carers have the RIGHT to build the best life THEY can, through their own design and choice, with the help that is needed to get there. This is the NDIS.


Jo, I could not have put that any better myself and I am proud today to stand in this House and read your words. Jo is a strong advocate for not only her own children but also every other family or individual touched by disability in the Goldfields region. Keep up the amazing work you do, Jo. I am totally bewildered by how you do it all on two hours sleep a day.


On a personal note I have a niece with Down syndrome and have seen firsthand the unexpected difficulties that can arise for families including my own. Tess is a twin and she and Emma are now both 11 years old. My wife and I babysit Tess from time to time, and getting her out of the pool is like pulling teeth. Tess does not let me watch the footy when the Dockers are playing because her mum and dad have brainwashed her into only watching the Eagles. That is something that really bemuses me. Tess attends a wonderful school in Kalgoorlie which can cater for her needs and that of her classmates. Again I touch on the amazing work that carers and teachers offer our young students with disabilities. Tess is a great kid, with so much energy, enthusiasm and love to give. However, I know the NDIS will give her just that much more support for her to continue to grow as the gorgeous young lady she already is.


These stories fill me with mixed emotions. The first is to do with the love that families have within them. The second is disappointment that the current system has failed so many Australians. However, the strongest emotion must be the one of hope in all of us for the change that the NDIS promises to so many families and hope that this place can work to support people with disabilities. As politicians, as leaders, as community members, as members of families, we have a responsibility to work together to ensure the implementation of this program without letting politics get in the way. This cannot and must not be politicised.


The unavoidable truth is that this program needs both sides of politics to work together. Although the key players from government and the opposition should be congratulated on bringing this issue to the floor, the success of the NDIS will require ongoing collaboration, non-partisan commitment and funding security. The NDIS will require funding from this government and from future governments, even in a tight fiscal environment. The NDIS will require commitment to its implementation from this government and from future governments. For this reason alone, the amendment moved by the opposition leader should be absolutely endorsed. The most important issue in this debate in my view is that we must not raise the hopes of these very special people in our community only to fail them at the very last hurdle. In this respect, I support the bill and encourage all members to truly put aside party politics on this issue. We must keep politics out of the debate. We need to do what is owed to these families affected by disability. For these reasons, I support the bill. Thank you.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (12:56):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We on this side of the House stand ready to work with the government to ensure that a successful and working NDIS is delivered as soon as possible for all those in need. It is an increasingly rare event for parliaments across the country to consider a piece of legislation so universally supported. That is because the NDIS is all about a fair go for those Australians who need help and support structures to ensure that they can more fully participate in our community. It was Winston Churchill who once said that you measure the degree of civilisation of a society by how it treats it weakest members. It is a statement that I believe most members in this place would agree with.


Providing adequate care for people with a disability is absolutely core government business. I make this point at a time when government is larger, more intrusive and more bloated than ever before. I am reminded by the whole debate leading up to this bill why we are actually here: we are here to protect and improve the lives of all Australians, including disabled Australians.


Last year alone, there more than 250 pieces of legislation passed through this parliament. In many cases, those bills had the effect of increasing regulations and limiting freedom. The pursuit of freedom is something that many opposite place a lower degree of importance on than we on this side of the House. But that pursuit of freedom, both in a personal and community sense, is ingrained in the DNA of the opposition. The bill before us today is unusual in that it will increase the size of government, and most certainly increase expenditure but, at its core, will have the effect of dramatically increasing the freedom of so many people in this country who suffer from a disability—and, in fact, it will dramatically increase the freedom of their carers.


This is no small thing. In 2009, 3.5 million Australians were reported as having a specific limitations or restriction. About 1.3 million people had a profound or severe core activity limitation. There is a huge section of our society whose daily freedoms are restricted through no fault of their own. If there is anything that we as national legislators can do to improve the daily lives and increase the freedoms of a large portion of our society then we should do whatever we can in order to achieve this.


I want to briefly go over some statistics that help paint a picture of disability in Australia. These figures were presented in a PricewaterhouseCoopers report a little over a year ago. The report notes that people with a disability in this country are some 50 per cent less likely to be employed than those without a disability. Beyond that simple fact, a lack of employment obviously leads to financial stress and has an impact on a person's freedom, their confidence, their living standard and their ability to pursue other life objectives. For someone who has recently acquired a disability, the loss of employment often has a more dramatic result. In that instance we often see a rapid downward spiral. It is imperative that we do everything that we in this place can to enhance the opportunities of people with a disability to seek, gain and retain employment.


The next statistic is shocking, particularly when you compare the figure with those from other comparable and, relatively speaking, wealthy nations. When you know that 45 per cent of Australians with a disability live in poverty you realise how grim things are. This is more than 2.5 times the rate of poverty experienced in the general population and more than twice the OECD average, which is 22 per cent. On this issue, we rank a lowly 21st out of 29 OECD countries. When we look at other OECD figures, we see that the OECD average for relative poverty risk is approximately 1.6, which means that those with a disability have a poverty risk 1.6 times higher than those without a disability. Australia has a relative poverty risk of 2.7, making us by far the worst performer in the OECD. These figures are grim and should give all of us reason to pause and think.


It would be naive to suggest that the NDIS will be the answer to all our problems. It will not be. It is important that we do not present this program as some type of magical cure or panacea. Indeed, one of the authors of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that I referred to earlier said that the NDIS could help drive greater workforce and community participation for those with disabilities but only if it was accompanied by a broader cultural shift. He went on to say: 'Without other things happening, an NDIS won't deliver its full potential. If kids with disability can't get into education or access transport to get to a job, we'll continue to fall further behind, even with an NDIS.'


The PricewaterhouseCoopers report suggested that the implementation of an NDIS could support an additional 370,000 people with disabilities into the workforce by 2050. An additional 80,000 carers could also enter the workforce as they were freed from their daily caring responsibilities. This would be terrific. But let us not forget that if there are around 4.5 million Australians who suffer from a form of disability and if a large proportion of those people are already living below the poverty line then we cannot expect an NDIS to make all problems in this space go away—and certainly not overnight—through some miraculous stroke of the pen. This is a very important scheme, but it would be foolish of us to raise expectations where the point that the inevitable reaction of the Australian community is one of disappointment.


Having said all of that, the coalition obviously approaches this bill in the most constructive spirit possible. We supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion in the budget last year and we supported the five launch sites. We support this legislation because we want the NDIS to be a success. Also, we will support measures in the months ahead to ensure that we get a robust and workable NDIS that services our community.


I want to thank all of the parents in my electorate who took the time over the last few years to come and see me and relate their very personal stories, very painfully and very emotionally at times, to me. I know that many of their fellow carers have done the same with my colleagues on this side of the House and with members of the government. They need to be given particular credit. They take time out from their very important commitments to care for family members. Without their persistence and perseverance—they give the issue of disability care and disability services a very real and human aspect—I suspect we may not have reached this point at this particular time. I want to thank them and acknowledge their contribution in standing up and demanding of government what they need, what their families need and what any civilised society ought to provide in order to give those in our community with disabilities, and their carers, the freedom to more fully participate in our society.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (13:07):  I begin where my friend and colleague the member for Indi finished, speaking about the sacrifices that so many parents and families make supporting loved ones, especially children, with disabilities. It is long overdue that we are debating a national disability insurance scheme and that we are on the verge of seeing a national disability insurance scheme actually realised in Australia. It is a testament to the significance of this reform that we have seen so many members from both sides of this chamber add their voices to this debate. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this truly is an idea whose time has come, and the coalition are strongly committed to an NDIS and have been since we supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission of an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme, in 2009. That report was released in 2011 and it confirmed that our current system of support for people with a disability was utterly inadequate, a finding that, while disheartening, we recognised and acknowledged called for action from governments at both the federal and the state level. Australia's funding and support system for those most in need is clearly broken, and this National Disability Insurance Scheme has been a long time coming.


I am proud to say that along with all the other members of the coalition—and I note in particular the advocacy work of Senator Mitch Fifield—I support this proposal to support people with disabilities and their families. It should be a thoroughly core government business. A federally funded scheme that will provide people with a disability, and their carers and families, with regular care and support and with the therapy and equipment they need to live a dignified and fulfilled life is a challenge that faces us all, but it is one that we must all confront to ensure that parliament turns this dream—apparently a bipartisan dream—into a fully functioning and fully funded policy.


It is very important that the government, through this debate, stop trying to represent the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS, as being a Labor reform. It is not a Labor reform; it is a reform that has the wholehearted support of all sides of politics and it is one that will be more compelling and more likely to come to realisation if it is seen as being one of those causes, those political or social reforms, that is not the property of one side of politics or another. There are some issues and causes in this House that are very much the property of one side of politics—some that the government holds dear to but we would disown, and vice versa. But this is one that we should all stand united upon because it is a huge challenge. It is huge in the scale of its complexity, dealing with so many people, each with individual needs and each with thoroughly unique needs. The scale of the resources needed is formidable. An increase in funding from $6 billion to $12 billion towards disability services is not a trifling amount of money. I might say that it underlines the need for prudent economic management, for prudent use of government resources and to ensure that we have a strong and growing economy that will generate the government revenues that will be needed to meet the requirements of this scheme.


The concept, as the Productivity Commission has recommended, would see all Australians contributing to and, should they need it, having access to a well-funded individualised scheme for their own care where individuals needing support would receive vouchers they would be able to spend on service providers, who, over time, would start to provide competitively the service that individuals need. This system will be one where support is based on need, where the individual has more control over the support services, aid and equipment they need in order to live their life to the full and to be able to rise above their disabilities.


As I noted earlier, the coalition supported the initial reference to the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion allocated in the last federal budget, and we have supported the five launch sites as well as the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government to extend the trial to a full state-wide rollout following the Hunter region launch. It has been encouraging, too, to see this concept of a national disability insurance scheme endorsed at COAG.


Many of my own constituents in the electorate of Wentworth have raised this matter with me directly. Whether it is principal Ian Gallan from the Wairoa School in Bondi, or Dr Chris Blackwell, one of our local clinicians, or the many other parents with stories as heartrending as they are profound, they have supported this important initiative. I am a proud patron of SailorswithdisABILITIES, which is a not-for-profit organisation in my electorate of Wentworth that is committed to changing not only the way those with disabilities view themselves but also society's perception of those with a disability. SailorswithdisABILITIES helps over 4,000 disabled children and adults annually through their sailing programs and has an extensive network of volunteers from the local community offering their support.


As a thoroughly able-bodied seaman I know just how difficult sailing can be, certainly in some conditions. It is wonderful to see SailorswithdisABILITIES not only build the confidence of those living with a disability by demonstrating just what they can achieve, but also developing the skills and showing the benefits of working in a team. The founder of SailorswithdisABILITIES, David Pescud, said that he could never accept being written-off because of his disability. He said, 'I was always more interested in what you can do rather than what you cannot do.' That goes to the heart of what an NDIS should be all about. It is about enabling those with a disability to fully participate in all aspects of life. It is about giving those living with a disability the opportunity to maximise their potential, to give them the dignity, the lifestyle and the independence they deserve.


Last year the SailorswithdisABILITIES crew completed the Sydney to Hobart race, crossing the finishing line after three days, 20 hours, four minutes and two seconds at sea. Their crew of disabled sailors beat 50 other boats in the international blue water race, led by the organisation's founder, David Pescud, and president, David Leslie, both of whom are sailors with disabilities. Brett Pearce, a member and volunteer, said of the organisation, 'Being part of SailorswithdisABILITIES is about being part of an organisation that empowers disabled people to achieve more than they thought capable.' Of a National Disability Insurance Scheme David Pescud said the benefits for the members to have the decision-making power to decide who, how and where they choose to spend their funds for their services that they require 'empowers people to make decisions for themselves and the opportunity of the governance of their own lives'.


Another institution in my electorate, which provides education and other services to students with intellectual and physical disabilities from four to 18, is the Wairoa Special School at Bondi. Every year, at our annual Christmas party, we raise money for that school—and it receives support from many other generous people in the community. As Wairoa school and its supporters, families and teachers will be all too aware, it is absolutely vital that those living with a disability get the proper care and education early, before those difficulties multiply—and this is the fantastic service that Wairoa offers, by providing the physical environment which specifically addresses the varying needs of their many students and fosters a culture of support both at school and at home.


For Wairoa, one of the biggest issues is ensuring children are properly assessed. Those who are better-off financially often have more opportunity to have their child assessed properly; and then, if they are assessed as acute, they can receive the maximum level of care. At Wairoa, 50 per cent of the children cared for have autism—and yet their needs differ greatly. Wairoa's experience is that determining the level of care that is required for a child with mild autism or acute autism is like comparing chalk and cheese, as often the children are not assessed properly, because their symptoms are all so different—and, as I said earlier, early assessment is absolutely critical. What Wairoa hopes for in an NDIS is to have a more structured assessment process and a more structured level of assistance to parents so there will be surety and equity of care. One of the main concerns for Dominic Sweeney, a teacher at Wairoa, is the level of care the children receive once they leave the school—the support they get there is fantastic, yet there is a failure at every level, he says, to provide adequate care for them once they move on. An NDIS should be able to address this.


Windgap, another organisation, just outside of my electorate in Eastlakes, knows just how important education and support for those with disabilities are to ensure they reach their full potential and raise community awareness to their needs and aspirations.


Another institution in my community that would have a remarkable difference made to it by an NDIS is Jewish Care, which runs a disability support program for 140 members of the Jewish community with an intellectual disability and provides support for 180 more with a mental illness. The clients of Jewish Care rely almost entirely on the community-raised income for their support. Claire Vernon, of Jewish Care, tells me of a 61-year-old woman living in Department of Housing and Community Services accommodation and attending Print-35, a fantastic initiative established by Jewish Care, which I visited, which employs people with disabilities to produce quality printing while contributing to their personal development and sense of worth. However, to enable this lady to manage in the community, Jewish Care provides a case manager and 16 hours of drop-in support every week—of which eight hours are contributed by the New South Wales government. She is like many with a disability: as they age their needs become more complex. Providing individuals with the funding to enable them to continue to live independently in the community, to direct support to the services they need the most, would, in Jewish Care's opinion, be a wonderful initiative. The need for flexibility and a person-centred approach is something that Jewish Care has recognised and acted on through its flexible funding program which provides $3,000 to $5,000 to families to purchase therapy and respite support.


As Jewish Care knows all too well, for too long families have had to negotiate the maze of services and the lottery of gaining a spot in a program or service. The great virtue of a NDIS is that funding is linked to the needs of each individual and the maximum autonomy and independence is accorded to that individual as their care plans and services are identified.


While there are clearly great prospects and great needs for a NDIS, many concerns remain. So much of how the scheme operates will depend on the rules that are still being finalised and on establishing the long-term funding arrangements to guarantee lifetime support. Above all—and I emphasise this not in any sense of partisanship—the prudent economic management of the government of the Commonwealth is absolutely critical. All of our compassion, all of our concern, for people with disabilities, all of our aspirations for an NDIS, will be only so much warm thoughts and warm words if we cannot afford to pay for them. It has often been said that a vision without resources is nothing more than a hallucination. We cannot afford to fool ourselves about a reform of this scale.


This will be one of the great social reforms of our time—indeed, of any time. It has the coalition's utmost support. We are committed to it and we are, above all, committed to ensuring that if we are returned to government later this year the economy, the business of government, of this nation will be managed in a way that we can well afford to show in real terms—in financial terms—the backing that our compassion calls us to provide.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (13:22):  I congratulate the member for Wentworth on his very well-chosen words in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We have heard many eloquent and heartfelt speeches from both sides of the House attesting to the wide support for a national disability insurance scheme.


There is clearly wide acknowledgement in the community and in this parliament that we need a scheme such as the NDIS. That support is visible wherever you go. Everyone in this chamber will have spoken with people in their own electorates, as I have, who can attest to the fact that the current support system for people with a disability does not work. There are people in our local communities who are carers or who need support, but there can be no one rule that applies to everyone and that works with the same level of effectiveness—disabilities are so varied; families are so varied; the pressures on families are so varied; and the ability of families to deal with a child or children with a disability are varied. A lot of it equates to time; a lot of it equates to money; and some of it even equates to the ability to actually deal with the issue itself.


The level of support a person with a disability receives can therefore depend on a number of factors, both within the family and outside it. Some of those factors include where they live. Are they are on a rural property 60, 70 or 100 kilometres from the nearest town? Are they in a small town, perhaps in western Queensland or eastern Western Australia or some other isolated place where the level of support simply is not available? Is the disability congenital or was it acquired and, if so, when was it acquired? What was the person's position in terms of economic security when it was acquired? There is a whole range of factors. Of course, if the disability is the result of an accident there may be support mechanisms through workers compensation and motor vehicle insurance in some states.


So, again, the issue is not just the disability but how the disability occurred and whether or not the disability occurred as a result of an accident. Particularly if you acquire a disability later in life, the handling of the whole issue is much more difficult—you have to contend with the extra issues of queues and waiting lists. This results in many people with a disability being left without the assistance that they need. There is no doubt we need a new system of support based on need, rather than rationing of an entitlement for support spread across the disabled community. We need to ensure that we deal with this area better. The individual needs to be at the centre of the support. The individual needs to be in charge—to be able to pick the support, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report into the long-term care and support for people with disabilities. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


I grew up with a disabled brother. He has achieved far more in this world, because of the assistance and support he was able to get, than anyone probably thought possible when they looked at that five-year-old with cerebral palsy and wondered if he would ever be able to speak in a way which people could understand, to walk, and to be a productive member of the community. So when I talk about disability insurance and the need to support people with disabilities I think of my brother Neil. He has achieved an extraordinary amount in his life, for many reasons. The first is that he is one of the most determined and stubborn people I have ever met. When he was old enough to understand, he made up his mind that he would overcome his disabilities as best he could. He was able to do so because he was given the support he needed. Obviously, a great deal of that support came from the family. We are a determined family in our own way—I know people would be shocked to hear that!—and when we set our minds on achieving something we usually achieve it. The family has certainly been a great support to him, but, in the end, what really made the difference was the support and services that he got.


He was, of course, supported in another age—the age of institutions. They are out of favour these days—I think sometimes they are unfairly. The Spastic Centre has, in the past, achieved some phenomenal results, but sending children away to a centre like that is now not seen as socially acceptable, and that makes me wonder just how many people like Neil are currently missing out on the opportunities that he was given. The Spastic Centre at New Farm in Brisbane, with the support of our family and the determination of Neil, were able to produce an individual, an adult, who I taught to drive. He ended up getting married and having a child. He worked for most of his life as a public servant. Before that he was even more productive as a farmer. He is now retired. He has achieved a great deal. But, in all honesty, I have to say that Neil is the exception rather than the rule in terms of people with severe disabilities. When we look at people like my brother and what they have achieved, we also have to realise that we are a family who had the wherewithal to do what was needed, and that was in his favour.


The reason we need to look at what can be implemented in an NDIS is that, in the end, we need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve their maximum possible outcome in regard to their disability and their potential. So we need a scheme that, as I say, is individual in the way it operates—that is, not a one-size-fits-all scheme.


The coalition are committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As the Leader of the Opposition said at the National Press Club recently:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


Really, this is about being totally bipartisan. If this issue becomes political—if this becomes an issue which people try to gain votes or political points on—it will simply bogged down. The reality is that the government should accept our offer of a parliamentary oversight committee. The coalition intend to give the government, the Greens and the Independents an opportunity to accept our hand of cooperation by moving an amendment to this bill to establish a nonpartisan oversight committee. That offer should be accepted.


It is so important to note that every government in Australia and every opposition in Australia supports the NDIS, so the issue is not whether we should have an NDIS but whether we should make it happen now rather than haggle over the political issues and not see it happen anytime soon. People in our communities and community organisations are of that view as well. When I talk to the people in Toowoomba who run the Endeavour foundation or to the many other groups that deal with the enormous challenges faced in providing opportunity, care, therapy and treatment for people with disabilities, they are not interested in things that need to be argued about, detailed and sorted out; they just want to see it happen. Parents come to see me and talk about their children, some of whom are, literally, 55 or 60 years old. These parents wonder how their children will be looked after when they, the parents, are no longer around. They are not interested in the politics that often surrounds this place; they just want to see it happen.


Again I refer to my own experience and say that we were lucky in that we were able to do something, but parents with disabled children carry an enormous burden for the whole life of that disabled child. Things are different in a family with a disabled child. No matter how you adjust—and we adjusted pretty well—there are things that need to be done for that child which put pressure and strain on every member of that family, be they child or parent. We need to address this issue and soon. Parents are carrying an enormous weight out there. As I say, our family was fortunate. We banded together. Neil was determined and he has led a relatively normal life. I see families whose every waking moment, almost 24 hours a day, is spent caring for a disabled child. That is why it is imperative that we resolve this issue. That is why it is imperative that we get ourselves into a position where this scheme is affordable.


The member for Wentworth mentioned, and I support him 100 per cent, that the real issue here is that we move forward with our support for an NDIS and work out the implementation passage, but also that we have a government that can govern and provide the money to support the scheme. In the end, with all the intentions, good wishes and cooperation in the world, this will boil down to money and a serious amount of it. We need a government that can manage its budget, and that is part of the issue we are facing: no matter how well-intentioned we are in this House and no matter how much we agree, we are going to have to pay for this. And the problem we have at the moment is that this government is broke—absolutely stone motherless broke. It is broke to the point that it has borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars. So part of the challenge in making sure that this scheme comes about is getting a government that can run a budget in surplus.


As we look at the period ahead, let's hope that we do get that government, but in the meantime we all need to focus on ensuring that we continue to take this path to implement an NDIS. It will require cooperation, and the coalition has offered that. It will require bipartisanship, and the coalition has offered that. It will require that we all sit down around a table and, as we say, co-chair a committee to make this happen. The challenge for the government is to accept that and join with us in making this happen.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (13:35):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. This is a momentous overhaul of disability funding across Australia and represents a once-in-a-generation reform. The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the framework for the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. On average, every 30 minutes someone in Australia is diagnosed with a significant disability. There are 410,000 people across Australia who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.


The current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. The level of support a person with a disability receives in Australia depends on a number of factors: what state they live in, what disability they have and how that disability was attained. While workplace and motor vehicle accidents are covered by accident insurance, those who are born with a disability or who acquire one later in life can be left without the assistance they need or be faced with waiting lists and queues.


The Productivity Commission found that, while there are pockets of successfully managed disability services in some states, no disability support services are working well across the board. I have seen, in my 17 years as a federal member, that families are often frustrated by the lack of support that they receive from state government disability services and by the fact that this support is rationed. We need a new system of support for those with disabilities that is based on need, rather than the current system of rationing on a budget allocation. The individual needs to be in control. The individual needs to be at the centre and able to pick the support, aid, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission report and it is the vision of the NDIS. It will work in a similar way to Medicare, a successful social insurance scheme.


The coalition has been an enthusiastic supporter of the NDIS at every step. We supported the Productivity Commission work, we supported the $1 billion in the last budget, we supported the five launch sites and we are supporting this legislation. We believe the NDIS can be delivered in the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission. As evidence of our goodwill, we are willing to work with the government to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. This historic reform will develop over the life of several parliaments and needs to be the property of the parliament rather than of any one political party. That is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. Unfortunately, those opposite have refused this by voting down Senator Fifield's motion in the Senate with the support of the Greens.


The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. The agency will be set up as an independent body separate from government to deliver and manage the NDIS. This will allow the scheme to be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first site is designed to benefit over 20,000 people with disabilities, their families and carers. The five launch sites are South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, Hunter in the New South Wales and Barwon in Victoria.


An NDIS looks beyond just the immediate need of a person with disabilities and focuses on what that person will require across their lifetime. The scheme provides funding to help people with a disability to participate more fully in economic and social life by providing an entitlement that will allow them to organise aids, equipment, supported accommodation or personal attendant care. The NDIS, when fully implemented, will be available to all Australians who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.


In my own electorate of Boothby there are many important sites where there are a number of people with a disability who will benefit from an NDIS. Bedford Industries, based at Panorama in Boothby since 1949 and originally founded in 1920, is an employment and training provider for people with a disability. It has an excellent reputation across the nation. Bedford supports almost 4,000 people with a disability or disadvantage. It employs 800 people with disabilities across South Australia in its furniture, horticulture, hospitality, packaging and other areas. Bedford provides living arrangements for almost 200 people up at its Balyana residences.


Minda, established in 1898, is South Australia's largest disability service provider. It offers support and opportunity to over 1,500 people in accommodation, supported employment, lifestyle services and respite. Minda has already received $30,000 in funding to prepare themselves for the NDIS through the NDIS Readiness Fund. The Suneden School, founded in 1943 and located in Mitchell Park, is a private school catering for children with intellectual and multiple disabilities aged between five and 21 years old. My electorate office has a number of artworks from the students of Suneden School, and their art show every year is always a highlight of the local community's calendar.    Suneden has close links with a number of external agencies to assist with their provision of programs, including Disability SA, Autism SA, Novita, Minda, Respite Services and various workplace providers, including Bedford Industries, Orana and Phoenix.


In conclusion, this is an important change that will help support those around Australia with disabilities. The coalition supports this bill, and we stand ready with the government to make the NDIS a reality.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (13:42):  At short notice I come into this chamber to talk about a very important subject: the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. The following might be of interest to the member of Boothby, because in closing his remarks he talked about the Suneden School in Mitchell Park. I can inform him that my sister, who was mentally retarded, went to Suneden. She was there for quite a while. It was certainly a very important part of her life to visit Suneden. I know they use different terms these days than the one I use, but I grew up with my sister, who was about 20 months older than myself. She was the seventh-born in the family, and I was the eighth. My mother likes to dine out on the story that when I came along at least one person thought I was perfect; the doctor wanted to reassure my mother that I did not have any intellectual disabilities—although I am sure some people might disagree with that now!


But this is a very important subject, and there is no doubt in my mind that it is a very worthy one. I may speak later about some of the problems that may exist. There are some people who may not be covered who think that they will be covered. In fact, I had an email and a phone call only last week from constituents who were concerned, in one case, that once they reached 65 there would not be any coverage—and they were actually thinking about their son—and, in another case, whether blindness was actually covered by this. And I suppose that is the concern of some people: they might think they are being covered when in actual fact they will not be covered.


The concept of a national disability insurance scheme has gained momentum over the past few years. Whenever it has been brought up in this parliament I have been a very strong supporter. One of the reasons it has gained momentum is due to a very strong grassroots campaign by carers, Australians with disabilities and the organisations that support them. More recently, the Every Australian Counts campaign, chaired by John Della Bosca, has certainly made sure we have strong support in this chamber. It has certainly kept the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the public mind on behalf of all those disability organisations.


The NDIS concept was conceived by John Walsh AM and progressed by Bruce Bonyhady AM, President of Philanthropy Australia. It was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit in 2008. It is probably the only decent thing that came out of that 2020 Summit in 2008. In 2009—so we are talking about four years ago—the federal coalition supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission for an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme. A final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry was released on 10 August 2011. Anyone who has looked at that final report would be encouraged by the support given by the Productivity Commission and would confirm that the current system of support for people with disability is—in their language—'broken'. This conclusion was endorsed by the federal coalition in all of its jurisdictions. We are not playing politics with this. We totally support it and any suggestion otherwise is bunkum.


Agreement has been reached with five states and territories, including my own home state of South Australia, the ACT, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Launch sites will commence in the states in July this year and in the ACT in July next year. In December 2012 the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government concluded an intergovernmental agreement for a full state-wide rollout of the NDIS beyond the Hunter launch site. Further expansion of the NDIS will be dependent on the Commonwealth negotiating and concluding further bilateral agreements with each jurisdiction. Queensland and Western Australia are not hosting launch sites but both have submitted proposals to the Commonwealth to be part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and they are certainly part of the support.


The Labor government has sought to claim the NDIS as its own, rejecting bipartisanship on a number of occasions. That is pretty sad. This is too important to play politics with. This has the support of the whole parliament and it is not just them or us; we all support it. Our only concern is where the money is coming from. We are committed to finding that money. We certainly want to show that it does have very strong cross-party support at both federal and state levels.


This bill provides for the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Some people might ask: why has this taken so long? To be fair to the government and to everyone, this is a big decision by government and a big decision by this parliament. It will need a pilot scheme. The last thing we want is money just thrown at something without some sort of sensible pilot scheme to make sure that it works. It is important that we do this properly. That probably means we are going a bit slower than some people would like, but if we do it properly we will end up with a well-thought-out scheme.


The agency may provide general support for people with disability who are not participants in the NDIS, through information, coordination and referral activities. While most funding for NDIS participants will be in the form of individual support packages, the agency may block fund some entities that support people with disability. That is a bit like what we do with block funding in private schools: as a government, we do not get down to the nitty-gritty and saying, 'You do it this way.' For example, in my electorate, where the Lutheran school system is very strong, they get block funding and organise it themselves. In some ways I think that is more efficient than government bureaucracies trying to run it. We support that.


The eligibility provisions described in the scheme require that a person's impairment results in substantially reduced functional capacity affecting their communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management. Eligibility includes early intervention to mitigate, alleviate or prevent the deterioration of a person's functional capacity.


As I mentioned earlier, people over 65 years of age at the time they request NDIS support will not be eligible. However, future participants can choose to continue with the NDIS once they turn 65. The assessment method will be in the NDIS rules. It is important that we have personal planning provisions which emphasise a person-centred and self-directed approach. A plan must include a statement of participant goals and aspirations prepared by the participant in the statement of participant supports to be approved by the agency.


I digress for a short period of time. Very early in my career as a member of this parliament, I was approached by four mothers in my electorate. I remember the meeting very well. They were concerned not so much about themselves and the work that they do as carers—they saw that as their duty and that was not a problem—but about what happens when they die. You hear that time and time again: 'Who is going to look after my children?' Obviously they will have grown up a bit more, but who will look after them when both parents are deceased? That was a real concern for them because they want to ensure that their offspring get the proper care that they need. I have heard that very often when other members speak on this bill.


Coming back to the bill itself, the plans will specify general support—and that is not purchased with individualised funding—and reasonable and necessary support. Of course, when we talk about 'reasonable', that is always a bit of a moot point: what is reasonable? Some people will want more than others think is reasonable, but in the end we will do our best, whether we are in government or in opposition, to make sure that they get that support. There will also be a review date and it will describe how the funds and other aspects of the plan will be managed. Managing the funding for supports under a plan can be done by a registered plan management provider, a nominee, the agency or participants themselves. Plan management involves purchasing supports, and receiving, managing and acquitting the funds.


Details about the process to become a registered provider of supports or a plan manager will be outlined in the NDIS rules. The agency may compel prospective participants to take action to obtain compensation for personal injury, and the agency is entitled to recover relevant portions of any compensation awarded to participants. These provisions are designed to protect the NDIS from cost-shifting.


There will have to be review processes. Information on review rights must be given to participants when reviewable decisions are made. Reviewable decisions cover eligibility support plans, provider registration, and nominee determinations. And, like many parts of legislation from this parliament, the legislation provides a further avenue of review to the all-important Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 


Governance will also be important. The agency will have a board consisting of a chair and eight members who collectively will possess an appropriate balance of skills, experience or knowledge in the following fields: provisional use of disability services, operation of insurance, compensation or long-term liability schemes, financial management or corporate governance. The Commonwealth minister will appoint the chair and must obtain the approval of a majority of jurisdictions before those members are appointed.


The legislation also establishes an independent advisory council that will include at least four people with disabilities; at least two carers; at least one person with skills, experience or knowledge in the supply of equipment or provision of services; and up to five more members. The legislation provides for an independent review of the act after two years.


I pay credit to my elder sister who was a nun with the Josephites. She set up the first lance society in Australia. She was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her work there. Our family experience was of a child with a mental disability and it has certainly been a very strong part of my family's upbringing. (Time expired)

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (13:57):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. There are not many in this House that do not have some understanding of the hardship families experience in caring for those with a disability. My electorate of Wright is quite remote. It starts at the top of the Toowoomba Range and borders Robina on the Gold Coast. In an area like that we do not have an enormous amount of infrastructure to help or support families. As a rural and regional community we rely heavily on neighbours, friends and family to support those people in their hours of need.


We will not be opposing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I remind the House that we support this bill, as we do 83 per cent of legislation when we come into the House. This government would have you believe there is a relentless negativity from the opposition. That is factually not true. Public documents from the Parliamentary Library state that we have supported over 83 per cent of bills that have come before this House. What may not be known to those in the gallery today is that the coalition has requested a bipartisan committee to be formed on the National Disability Insurance Scheme so that we can move forward collectively with this. But no—as we move through, they will continue to take the single headline, the single grab, that 'the coalition are opposed to this' and that it is only Labor that will provide and deliver an NDIS. I say to you, Madam Speaker and those in the gallery, that nothing could be further from the truth. There are no lows to which this government will not go to hide the truth when it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


I also take the opportunity to acknowledge where the pilot projects are being rolled out at the moment, in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and the ACT—

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:16):  The Leader of the Opposition and I, in the company of Her Excellency the Governor-General, the Premier of New South Wales and the opposition leader of New South Wales, had the opportunity on the weekend to attend a memorial event for Peter Harvey, the late great Peter Harvey. It was a very special occasion as we celebrated a life well lived and ended all too soon. Peter Harvey, for millions of Australians, was the person who, with an unmistakable voice of authority, brought them the news, decade after decade. Indeed his sign-off 'Peter Harvey, Canberra'—I will not try and mimic the voice—is something that has so far gone into Australian consciousness and lexicon that it is now used by many as a way of noting a connection with Canberra events.


Peter Harvey was an amazing journalist. He covered nations at war and brought those images back to Australian lounge rooms. He engaged in popular culture, whether it was on the red carpet interviewing actors, film stars or musicians or whether it was engaged in the human interest stories that tug at people's hearts or whether it was following the rough and tumble of politics. Peter Harvey was an exemplary journalist, always able to generate a script, which in a very pithy way brought home to people the emotions that he was seeking to convey.


The Leader of the Opposition and I had an opportunity during this memorial service to watch some of the highlights of Peter Harvey's most glittering career. It was truly with a sense of loss that we sat there but also a sense of celebration about a life in which so much was achieved. He will be missed. He will be particularly missed by his wife, Anne, and by his children, Claire and Adam. Our condolences most sincerely go to them and their extended family.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:18):  I rise to support the fine words of the Prime Minister, and, yes, Peter Harvey was indeed an icon of journalism. He was the genial face of reporting in this country. He was a press gallery journalist who was universally liked rather than feared or scorned or both. Anyone who could describe Canberra's own Summernats as a kind of 'Floriade for revheads', as Peter Harvey did—and we were reminded of that just the other day—obviously had a simply brilliant turn of phrase.


He will be much missed, and on behalf of the coalition we offer condolences. I offer condolences to Anne, his wife, and to Adam, his son, who is a reporter for the ABC, and Claire, his daughter, who is the deputy editor of the Sunday Telegraph, who are both proudly carrying on their father's fine tradition.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:21):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, though I am a bit surprised that he would raise in this parliament cost-of-living pressures for the people of Western Sydney when the Leader of the Opposition has a plan to ensure that more than half a million people in Western Sydney pay more tax, that 115,000 families in Western Sydney lose their schoolkids bonus, that 240,000 pensioners lose pension increases, that 1.1 million people in Western Sydney lose their low-income superannuation contribution. And then, of course, the cuts go on because of what the Leader of the Opposition has planned for schools and for hospitals and also the attacks that he has got planned on small businesses, with 120,000 small businesses—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, in the absence of you calling the Prime Minister to order, I raise the point of order: how can this answer be in the least bit relevant to a question about when the government will deliver a surplus?



The SPEAKER:  There was a rather large preamble to the question. The question is the entire question. Unless you want to narrow down the question posed, relevance goes to all the words in the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  I was asked a lengthy question including references to cost-of-living pressures in Western Sydney, and I am addressing that part of the question. Important for families in Western Sydney is the flow-through of lower interest rates to the burden that paying the household mortgage is for families in Western Sydney, with the average mortgage now costing them $5,000 less per year than it did when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in government. So, for cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney, we are very concerned.


We understand that, though our nation has a resilient economy, for many families it can be very difficult to make ends meet, which is why we will keep working with families in Western Sydney and indeed around the nation: working to provide benefits like the schoolkids bonus; working to better support their childcare costs than they have ever been supported before; working to ensure that they continue to enjoy the benefit of tax cuts, with more than half a million people in Western Sydney having their tax cuts at risk as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition; making sure that we help them at the time that a new baby is born, through paid parental leave both for mums and for dads, making sure that that special support is available; and, for those older citizens in Western Sydney, continuing to provide pensions at an increased level—indeed, having delivered a historic increase and then adding to it. So cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney and around the nation are at the forefront of the government's policies and plans to work with modern families as they work their way through the stresses and strains of modern living.


On government budget matters: the budget will be unveiled in May. I trust that, on the Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition replies, he will stop running for cover and hiding—



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will return to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  and produce a complete set of figures.

We can continue to provide a Paid Parental Leave scheme that meets the needs of families. We will; the Leader of the Opposition wants to put their grocery bills up. We will continue to bring pressure on the Barry O'Farrell government—

Again, to the Leader of the Opposition: we will always work with families around the nation, including in Western Sydney—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Madam Speaker, you asked the Prime Minister to return to the question about when the government would deliver a surplus and she has completely ignored you. I would ask you to bring her back to the question.



The SPEAKER:  I again state that the entire question is for the relevance rule, but I had pulled up the Prime Minister when she was straying into state matters. I think that is going off what this government has to do or what the Prime Minister's responsibility has to do.




Ms GILLARD:
  On budget matters: of course the budget will be produced in May, and my challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to make sure that, on budget reply night, he details how many families in Western Sydney will be worse off under his plan.

The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will return to the question.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:17):  I have sought to refresh my memory of the Labor Party's commitments over the years to living within their means.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am glad I have the support of the member for Hunter. I imagine the member for Griffith is equally pleased to have his support. Speaking of the member for Griffith, I reminded myself that it was in 2007, just before he was elected Prime Minister, that he declared: 


I am an economic conservative.


Not to be outdone, at the National Press Club in 2007, his then shadow Treasurer said:


Like Kevin Rudd, I am an economic conservative.


Chris Uhlmann also asked the now Prime Minister the same question on the ABC in 2007. He asked: 


Are you also an economic conservative?


Julia Gillard replied:


I'm an economic conservative. … I've always believed in the value of hard work and I certainly believe we need to keep the budget in surplus …


Not that Labor ever has delivered a surplus! The member for Griffith, the member for Lilley and the now Prime Minister are fingers on the same hand—they are all tinder dry economic conservatives so committed to delivering surplus budgets that they do not have to worry about debt or about putting anything on the national credit card. They were so unconcerned about their ability to properly govern the country that they introduced a bill—the Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Bill. It was Chris Bowen, the member for Prospect, who introduced this. Remember that he was the author of a number of different watches—and he was not a watchmaker. He brought in Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch—all his ideas and he did such a great job with them! But little did the Treasurer know that the then Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs was issuing a debt limit bill. I suspect in the depths of my heart that the member for Prospect knew that Labor could not live within its means, so he wanted to put a little handcuff in there without the Treasurer knowing. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt. In his second reading speech he said:


The government's commitment to strong fiscal discipline means that there is no need to issue debt securities to finance spending.


Five years and $200 billion later, with a debt interest bill of over $12 billion a year, how those words must ring in the ears of the Labor Party. How those words about living within your means must ring in their ears. 


They are always quick to give Australians a lecture about how the Australian people should live within their means. 'But don't worry about us,' they say, 'We're borrowing money—and we are borrowing money because we   cannot deliver a surplus.' Labor has not delivered a surplus since 1989. The member for Longman, up the back there, was not even born in 1989. In his lifetime, he has never seen a Labor surplus—and I expect that, in his lifetime, he never will see a Labor surplus. And long may you live, Member for Longman. 


The truth is that Labor do not know how to live within their means. They are like someone with a credit card who is out of control. When the member for Prospect introduced that prophetic bill, the Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Bill, he said: 'Don't worry—we only need a $75 billion limit. That is all we need. Really that is a bit more than we need; we are going to have plenty left.' It is like a compulsive spender going into the bank and saying, 'Look, can you lend me 10 grand—I don’t need 10 grand; I'm only going to spend three or four but 10 grand is the limit I want; I want you to handcuff me.' And that is what they did. But then they feared they would exceed the limit, so they went from $75 billion to $200 billion in 2009.


They said it was a financial crisis, a calamity. Okay, there was an impact on revenues—I fully accept that, and I always have. But $200 billion? They said at the time, 'Don't worry, it is the GFC—the GFC has done it; we've seen the worst of it and we've come through it because of what Labor has done.' Then, in 2011, three years after the GFC hit the budget, they said, 'Two hundred billion is not really enough; we need to increase our debt limit.' So they go back to the bank—the parliament—and say, 'Two hundred billion is not enough; can we take it to $250 billion?' We said, 'Hang on, you said $200 billion was the limit, and before that you had said $75 billion was the limit. What is your limit?' They said, 'No, $250 billion is the limit; that is the limit we will legislate for.' They were supported by their mates, the Independents, and the Greens. The Greens would have a trillion dollars if they could. The bottom line was that they said $250 billion was the limit.


Last year, along comes the Treasurer. He says, 'Good news, Australia—we are going to run a surplus. We are going to live within our means and we are going to pay it all back by the end of the decade. But, hey, can you increase the limit to $300 billion? We are not sure, we might exceed $250 billion, but I give you a guarantee'—as he did in this place—'that at the end of the financial year we will not get above $250 billion; we will just pop up and down because we have different debt issuance instruments, and the timing is a bit here and there, but don't worry, we will not exceed $250 billion at the end of the financial year but we need to go to $300 billion.' So now we are just a few weeks from the end of the financial year and the debt is $263 billion. 


Madam Speaker, we asked the most simple questions, and you bore witness to them. You were in the chair, Madam Speaker, and you heard that our questions of the Treasurer were simple and straightforward: 'Will you keep your word that the debt will not exceed $250 billion this year?' He could not answer the question. It was agony to watch—it was painful. Anyone watching in the gallery or on TV must have been aching just a little bit for the Treasurer. But not me. I know, and I suspect all of my colleagues know, that at the end of the day it is the taxpayers who have to pay back this debt. At the end of the day, someone has to pay this money back. They cry crocodile tears about cost-of-living pressures on Australians and yet they keep jacking up the taxes—27 new or increased taxes since they have come in. Not to be outdone, the Prime Minister has declared that she is going to introduce a tough budget. We know what a tough budget means—it is tough for the taxpayer. The Labor Party has no respect for taxpayers. But the Labor Party have no respect for the meaning of their words—they are just words; just spin. They have no regard for the impact of their decisions on everyday Australians.


I have confessed to a couple of friends here that my old mate Peter Costello—he remains a very good mate—said to me, '$250 billion is quite an ask, Joe.' I said, 'Do you know what, Peter, it is quite an ask. And, by the way, when Labor last left office they left a $96 billion debt, but there was a Telstra to sell, a Qantas to sell'—not that it is worth as much as it once was—'and a range of different assets to sell. I haven't got any assets to sell if I become the Treasurer.' The NBN? I could not give it away. If anyone wants to buy the NBN for one dollar, it is for sale right now. Come on, Emmo—a gold coin will do it. The CEFC? What is left? There is nothing left. 


I will tell you what we are left with—as of today, $263 billion of debt, and $12 billion a year in interest payments, which is more in interest each year that the Commonwealth government has to find than the entire yearly proceeds of capital gains tax in Australia. It is four times the total collection of fringe benefits tax each year. It is far more than the carbon tax—in fact, it is more than the carbon tax and the mining tax combined. That revenue alone would not meet the interest bill on the Labor Party's debt. They say not to worry about it; the rest of the world is in great shape. But when they compare us with the rest of the world they are comparing us with Europe. Gee, Europe is doing well; it is a cracker. European countries are benchmark states for us. That is exactly who we should be comparing ourselves to! Or the United States, with its fiscal cliff. They are doing really well, too, with unemployment hovering around nine per cent. Using the United States for comparison is a great idea! Maybe Japan? How well is Japan doing? It has been in a cocoon for a decade or more, and yet those opposite compare us with Japan. They compare us with the slowest runners in the field, at a time when we should be the fastest runner in the field.




Mr Perrett:
  Who do you want to compare us to?




Mr HOCKEY:
  Don't interject, old son—listen carefully. When you compare us to the fastest runners in the field, Australia with its11.6 per cent of GDP debt compares with Norway, whose debt is minus 169 per cent. That means they have more savings and they have not got any debt. Finland's debt is minus 51 per cent of GDP, and Sweden's debt is minus 17½ per cent of GDP—but, no, the government says we have been hit really hard by a loss of revenue. So I thought, 'Well, how do we compare?' I go back to Norway. Norway improved by 45.8 per cent over the last five years. Finland was roughly stable. Sweden improved 5.1 per cent. Our debt deteriorated 17 per cent. So who are they comparing us with?


Why does Labor keep doing this? Why does Labor embrace mediocrity? Why does Labor embrace the lowest common denominator, when you should compare us to the best? Because we want Australia to be best. We do not want to be second best or third best; we want our nation to be the best that it can be. We want our nation to be the best in the world, and we want to ensure that our children start at the top of the mountain, not at the bottom of the mountain. We want to ensure that we give the next generation and those beyond a better quality of life—an even better quality of life than that which we have. Yes, we have a better quality of life than our parents and our grandparents, and so it should be. But we owe that to others. Why? That is the way humanity should run. We should aim to be better. We should aim to leave a better legacy.


One of the reasons why this debt level from Labor hurts so much is the terms of trade: the demand for what is in our ground or in our oceans is far greater now than it has been at any other time in our history. The terms of trade are higher now than any day during the previous, Howard government. Yet it was the Howard government that had to pay off Labor's $96 billion of debt and left $60 billion to $70 billion of extra money available, and it is Labor that comes in and spends all of that and then keeps adding to the debt bill so that we have over $263 billion to try and repay. You know what, Madam Deputy Speaker—Mr Speaker—Mr Deputy Speaker—





Mr HOCKEY:
  I know, 'There is no sex in the chair,' as Joan Child once said. I say this to you, Deputy Speaker Scott: we are ready to climb this mountain. We are ready to pay back the debt. We are ready, on behalf of the Australian people, to do the hard yards. It starts here. It starts within the size of government. It starts on the basis that we have to live within our means before we ask the Australian people to suffer more at the hands of Labor. We are the ones that are determined to turn the place around. We are the ones that are determined to deliver hope to generations of Australians that tomorrow will be better than today, because we are the ones that know how to live within our means, and we will not ask the Australian people to do anything that we are not prepared to do ourselves.

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Asian Century Policy) (15:32):  This matter of public importance is a welcome debate because we are witnessing a sharp contrast between the position of the Labor government and that of the coalition in opposition, and that contrast is this: Labor consider that the economy is strong and that the economy can be strengthened further, and we are implementing policies to do that in order to secure jobs for the working men and women of this country and for the young generations coming through, while the coalition consider that the economy is ailing, it is sick and it needs the sort of radical surgery that the shadow Treasurer just outlined—savage cuts to government spending, and big tax increases. I will substantiate my arguments by going through, one by one, the areas where they would cut and the areas where they would increase taxes.


I do note that the shadow Treasurer, in his opening remarks, declared that he is a good mate of Peter Costello. Peter Costello has been in the news in the great state of Queensland recently, yet again, and the reason is that he has overseen the preparation of a second audit commission report. The first audit commission report contained cuts in government services that were not outlined by Premier Newman before the Queensland state election. The second audit commission report contains recommendations for the privatisation of government services, including hospital services. So, when I speak of the radical surgery that the coalition considers essential because it believes the economy is ailing, you need look no further than the second audit commission report, where the coalition—the LNP in Queensland—under the recommendations of the shadow Treasurer's good mate, is proceeding to cut vital hospital services. This points to the fundamental difference between Labor in government and the coalition in opposition.


Labor in government note that, here in Australia, we are growing faster than any other major advanced country; the unemployment rate is relatively low; and the official inflation rate is low. Interest rates, the Reserve Bank cash rate—which went up 10 times after the coalition government promised in the 2004 election to keep interest rates at record lows—have fallen from 6¾ per cent under the coalition government to three per cent. That means, for a mortgage holder with a $300,000 mortgage, a saving of $5,000. We consider that to be good. The coalition considers all of these indicators to be the signs of an ailing and sick economy.


We consider that investment at 50-year highs is a sign of a healthy economy. The coalition considers that the Australian economy is weak and ailing and in need of radical surgery. We consider the fact that three international ratings agencies, for the first time in Australia's history, have rated Australia triple A and stable to be an indicator of a strong economy. The coalition considers this to be an indicator of a weak and ailing economy that needs radical surgery. We consider car sales going through the roof to be a sign of a healthy economy. The coalition considers car sales going through the roof as evidence of an ailing and weak economy. We consider a pick-up in consumer confidence to be a good sign, along with a surging stock market and improving retail sales and house prices—all indicators of a strong economy that is getting better. The coalition considers these things indicators of a weak economy—a sick and ailing economy—which needs radical surgery.


It is through the device that the coalition have already supported in Queensland that they would pursue their radical surgery. I refer, of course, to the shadow Treasurer's mate Peter Costello and his device of an audit commission. The coalition, in opposition federally, have said that they would have an audit commission just as Campbell Newman has had an audit commission in Queensland. The reason they want to have an audit commission is that they want to conceal from the Australian people, just as Campbell Newman tried to conceal from the Queensland people, savage cuts to services and to jobs; they do not have the wit or the courage to explain to the Australian people where they would make their savage cuts to what they consider to be a sick and ailing economy.


The opposition leader's Liberal Party, in contrast to the Liberal Party of the member for Wentworth, propose policy prescriptions such as $180 billion in cuts to government spending. The shadow Treasurer referred to the global financial crisis—at last he has acknowledged that it did occur—but this opposition leader's Liberal Party are saying that, when there was a hit during the global financial crisis of $180 billion to government revenue, the opposition would have cut spending commensurately. They would have matched a $180 billion write-down of government revenue with $180 billion in cuts to government spending.


I refer now to statements by the shadow education minister, who said late last year:


Well, if there had been a Coalition government for the last five years, Kieran, I think most people accept that we would have had continuing surpluses.


This is my point—they would have matched the $180 billion write-down in taxation revenue with a $180 billion cut in expenditure. The shadow Attorney-General said:


Well, we think the budget should never have been put into deficit.


Again, this indicates that they would have matched $180 billion in government revenue cuts with $180 billion of cuts to government spending. What would such cuts have inflicted on the Australian people? They would have inflicted a deep and prolonged recession. That is why I think the Australian people should rightly be fearful of a coalition that are led by this opposition leader. A cut of $180 billion in government spending is an example of the cuckoo policy prescriptions they have in mind for the Australian people and for the Australian economy, which they consider so sick and so ailing that it needs radical surgery.


We know from the mouth of the opposition leader that his preferred policy prescription for dealing with the GFC was a recession for Australia. He said:


For instance, in New Zealand they have tried to reform their way through the global financial crisis under the new government's leadership, and they seem to be doing pretty well.


But what happened in New Zealand? There was a recession that lasted five quarters—1¼ years. That is what happened in New Zealand, and that is the policy prescription of the current Leader of the Opposition, supported by the shadow Treasurer. When they lecture us on ensuring that we have responsible fiscal policy they ought to look at their own admissions, because they personally have admitted that they already have a $70 billion funding hole. The opposition leader said:


Well, this $70 billion figure is a fanciful figure. It is plucked from the air by government ministers and I'm surprised you're retelling it to me.


Who gave the $70 billion figure? It was the shadow finance minister. He said:


The $70 billion is an estimate of the sort of challenge that we will have.


He went on to say:


The $70 billion is an indicative figure of the challenge that we've got.


He was asked:


Is it a furphy?


He replied:


No, it's not a furphy. We came out with the figure, right?


That is the coalition admitting that they have a $70 billion funding hole—and they have been trying to plug the hole ever since.


Just recently the shadow Treasurer has been fluffing his lines. The coalition know that they are going to make, through the concealed device of an audit commission, the $180 billion in cuts. When talking about the fact that they would remove the mining tax if they were elected, the shadow Treasurer was asked by a journalist:


What about the hole in the money?


He said:


The expenditure against it is going to go.


He had already mentioned, in the same context, the government's increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, so he was saying that the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent will go if the coalition is elected. The journalist then asked him:


So what would you cut?


He answered:


I just outlined them. I can go through them again if you want.


The journalist asked:


So you would cut all those initiatives?


The shadow Treasurer answered:


Absolutely, you can’t afford them.


So he was saying, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, that the opposition would cut the nine per cent to 12 per cent increase in the superannuation guarantee. But, by the time the six o'clock news put what he said to air, he tweeted to reprimand National Nine News for reporting what he had said—the words that came out of his own mouth. The shadow Treasurer said, in a moment of candour, that the increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent would go under a coalition government. Of course, what he said was repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition because the Leader of the Opposition did not want the smelly cat out of the bag before an audit commission. But the cat is out of the bag—and a dirty, smelly creature it is. The coalition would cancel the increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. They were the words that came out of the mouth of the shadow Treasurer.


But it gets worse. In only the week just gone, the shadow Treasurer discussed the tax-free threshold. I refer to the increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 which has liberated more than one million Australians from being taxpayers; it has taken more than six million Australians out of the tax system and offered them cuts of more than $300 a year.



Mr Van Manen interjecting—




Dr EMERSON:
  I am reading from a transcript. I know that members opposite do not think that transcripts have any credibility. Certainly the member for Forde does not believe a transcript has any credibility and neither does the shadow Treasurer, because he expunges embarrassing material from transcripts. He said:


Let me be very clear, if there is no carbon tax then there is no need for compensation.


He was asked about the tax-free threshold and he actually said, '$3. That is what you said'—turning to the Liberal candidate for Parramatta—'$3.' It is not $3; it is $300, and that part of the transcript was expunged. Why? Because, again, the shadow Treasurer tripped up on his words. He let that dirty cat out of the bag, that dirty, smelly cat, and the opposition leader said, 'Put the stinking creature back in the bag because that is going to come out if we get elected, through the audit commission process after an election.' We know that the shadow finance minister has said that they have got all their policies. They are already costed. They are all ready to rock-and-roll. He said: 'We have identified 49 errors of policy. I have got on my desk 49 policy documents with covers'—very nice covers, apparently—'and the costings.' But, of course, once they get a bit of pressure on the costings, they then run away and seek refuge in this audit commission.


What is the truth of the matter? The truth of the matter is that they have these policies, but they have personally said that they are going to wait until after the budget in order to reconcile. Then they said they were going to wait 10 days into the actual election campaign. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'No, no, we're going to wait until 30 September for the final budget figures,' which is after the election. The truth is that they would wait for this audit commission to make all of these errors add up through the savage cuts that they would deliver. Of course, they have form. We know that last time they botched it to the tune of an $11 billion funding hole. And, on 12 February this year, the shadow Treasurer was asked:


Your costings were wrong before the last election.


The shadow Treasurer said:


I don't accept that at all.


It was objectively shown to be the case.


I go back to where I started: we believe that the Australian economy is fundamentally sound. We can strengthen it further. It does not need the sort of radical surgery that the coalition believe it needs and want to conceal from the Australian people until after the election. The Australian people deserve better. They deserve accountability. They will continue to get that from the Gillard Labor government. The cowardice of the coalition in saying, 'We'll do it after an election,' is unacceptable, and this economy does not need the radical, savage surgery that they have in mind for it. (Time expired)

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (15:47):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the failure of the government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. It is good to follow the Minister for Trade, but I cannot say that much of what he detailed here in the chamber was relevant to the topic. Perhaps he could have been more relevant if he gave us one of his 'improv' karaoke renditions of Horror Movie—and maybe it could be in tune this time—because a horror movie is really what we have got with Australia's current fiscal position. Indeed, it is because of that that it is a matter of urgent public importance. The fiscal mess that this government is creating is a mess that the public will be left to clean up.


Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes. Our children will pay the price of this government's reckless waste through taxes and lost opportunities. This government's failure to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position is this government's selling-out of our children's future. But, according to the Treasurer, 'That's not a problem.' Our escalating debt is not a problem, he reckons: 'Move along—nothing to see here.'


If you want to know why this Labor government is failing to address the problem, it is because it denies there is a problem in the first place. Here is what the Treasurer said about this nation's debt—the excuse for incompetence that he dusts off and trots out on a weekly basis. He says, 'Compare with other major advanced economies.' He just loves to compare Australia to a handful of the worst performing economies in the world—not the big resource economies that are out there like ours but the ones that are floundering and are currently groaning under enormous debt levels. That is his aim. That is where he wants us to be.


He knows we are a long way back, but, boy oh boy, he is trying to catch them. It was a late start, because he had to overcome the handicap of actually having some cash in the bank and a strong economy when he took the reins, but he is coming—he is coming through with a late surge! He has got the blinkers on and he is riding that one-trick pony home, and he is going to catch them. He is! And here is how much he is gaining on them. In the outline of the economy, he laments the fact that the size of the task before him might actually be beyond him. He says: 


Even at its peak, net debt will be a tiny fraction of the average of the major advanced economies.


Then there was this encouragement from the cheer squad, the Prime Minister, in a speech to the Queensland Media Club on 12 October 2012, where she said:


Australia's debt is lower than any major advanced economy—our net debt will peak at 6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12.


Let us skip ahead to what the Treasurer said in MYEFO, the mid-year budget update in October last year:


The average net debt position of the major advanced economies is projected to peak at 95 per cent of GDP in 2016, almost 10 times higher than the expected peak in Australia's net debt of 10.0 per cent of GDP in 2011-12.


So, from October 2010 to October 2012, Labor's forecast for net debt changes from six per cent to 10 per cent of GDP. He is catching them. He is coming in with a late run.


The truth is that those opposite actually have no idea when net debt will peak, because in government Labor will never see net debt peak; it will just keep going up and up, because they have got no idea how to stop it from growing. It is very easy, Wayne: just spend less than what you earn. There are seven million households in Australia, in the real Australia out there, who understand that fact. But the world's luckiest Treasurer, or whatever Euromoney magazine named him, cannot quite grasp that fact. Poor old Swanny. He cannot get his head around how a household budget actually works, and he wants to. He tries really, really hard. I can picture him, sitting there at the kitchen table, doing his homework with a firm grip on the crayon and a wrinkled brow, biting his tongue. And, after much constipated endeavour, he works his sums hard enough to come up with the debt analogy that he loves the most. Even the Prime Minister has picked it up and run with it. I return to a quote of hers that I used earlier, from the Queensland media club, where she said:


… our net debt will peak at 6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 …


Her next line was straight out of Swanny Junior's big book of sums. She said that that was:


… equivalent to someone who earns $100,000 a year taking out a $6,000 loan.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I am sorry—it was straight out of the Treasurer Junior's big book of sums:


… equivalent to someone who earns $100,000 a year taking out a $6,000 loan.


Well, that is what she said. A couple of months earlier, the Treasurer used the same line in a doorstep. On 4 August 2010, when net debt was at six per cent, he said:


That’s the equivalent of someone who’s earning $100,000 a year borrowing $6,000 a year.


But, on 22 November 2011, we had the then Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation upping the ante:


… Commonwealth government debt is at seven per cent. That is the equivalent of $7,000 out of a GDP of $100,000.


By the latter half of the next year the Treasurer was crowing on ABC on 16 October 2012:


Our debt in international standards is very, very low. It's like someone earning $100,000 a year owing a modest $10,000 …


Up and up it goes, and that is lovely.


But the problem is that comparing your debt to everyone else's is not a very good analogy. Viewing debt as a percentage of GDP might be useful if you are comparing it with other countries'—especially if the other countries have similar economies that are resource based. But to use the figures to compare to a mortgage is just as reckless as your spending—as the government's spending, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, not yours.


GDP is produced by everyone. The seven million households out there have their own debts to worry about, and when their mortgages are paid off they will actually have a house. But what will the government have? What the Treasurer will have to service his debt is government income, raised mainly through taxes. Government income, which can be used to service government debt, was $329.9 billion in 2011-12. That is what we collected in revenue last year: $329.9 billion.


So let us take the Treasurer to the bank manager and see if he can get a loan like the one he describes as 'tiny' and 'very, very low'. Let us imagine Mr Swan saying to the bank manager, 'I want a loan for $144 billion, Mr Bank Manager.' That is the net debt that we have currently. The bank manager: 'Certainly, Mr Swan; what was your income last year?' Mr Swan: 'It was roughly $330 billion.'




Mrs D'Ath:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been very tolerant, but my point of order is that the member continually refers to the Deputy Prime Minister inappropriately and should refer to him by his correct title.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The parliamentary secretary has made a point of order. The member for Dawson will refer to members by their title or their relevant ministry.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  Here the bank customer is the Treasurer. So the Treasurer walks in and says, 'I want a loan for $144 billion, Mr Bank Manager.' The bank manager: 'Certainly, Mr Treasurer; what was your income last year?' The Treasurer: 'It was around $330 billion.' The bank manager: 'Okay, Mr Treasurer. Let's go through your actual expenditure. Oh boy! It looks like you've got a lot of dependants. I've got down here that you've got a lot of welfare recipients. Foreign aid's increasing. You're letting other people into your household as well—asylum seekers. You're increasing expenditure on that. I see that you've bought some school halls and the value of them is about half of what you actually paid for them. And what's this purchase here for flammable pink batts? What's that all about, Mr Treasurer?' After the bank manager has gone through the books and had a look at all the expenditure, he turns to the Treasurer and says: 'So, Mr Treasurer, what was your expenditure actually last year?' And the Treasurer mumbles something. The bank manager says: 'What was that, Mr Treasurer?' The Treasurer: 'Oh, it was about $374 billion.' The bank manager: 'That's about $43 billion more than you actually earned. You are spending more than you have earned. Mr Treasurer, how are you going to actually pay back this loan that you are trying to get from me?' The Treasurer: 'Oh, that's easy. I'll just come back to you and get another loan and I'll pay the interest off with that.'


That is what the government is doing: raising the debt ceiling again and again and taking out another loan to pay off the interest that this nation currently owes. That loan will get even bigger next year. He will raise the debt ceiling again and borrow more money to pay that interest. We see something from the West Australian today where they actually state that:


The interest bill on the nation’s $267 billion gross debt, to be revealed when the Budget is handed down on May 14, is expected to be at least $1 billion worse and could be pushed out even further.


That is a terrible legacy to leave for our nation because today's debt, the debt that this government has engaged in, is tomorrow's taxes. We are saddling a whole generation with this, and the money that we are using to spend on interest is not going into worthy infrastructure projects around the nation which would otherwise be funded.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (15:57):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, discussing in particular Australia's fiscal position. In doing so I follow on from Dr Emerson, my next-door neighbour, who is the minister at the table. I would like to contrast his contribution with those of the member for Dawson and the member for North Sydney.


I do not know the member for North Sydney's electorate that well, though I think I have been in his electorate. I know that if I stand in the southern part of his electorate I am in Kirribilli. So I have been there once, for a function—I think with the minister, in fact—with the Chinese community. If you stand in the southern bit of my electorate you are in Acacia Ridge, which is quite a different part of the world. But I know that when I am in Acacia Ridge talking to the people about debt and what sort of debt is manageable—and I refer to the member for Dawson talking about the seven million households in Australia and how we should approach debt—most people understand that debt is not a bad thing. Debt, in fact, can change your circumstances.


I have here a newspaper story from Simon Benson from June 2010 talking about the Leader of the Opposition taking out a mortgage for $710,000 for his house. Even for someone in their 40s or 50s, as the Leader of the Opposition would have been when he took out this loan, debt is not necessarily a bad thing. It is good if you can keep interest rates under control. So I am sure the opposition leader would be thankful that, under this government, the interest that he is paying on that mortgage has probably halved in the time that we have been here. I think we even gave him a pay rise as well. So I am sure he is very thankful for that to this side of the House.




Dr Emerson:
  He has not mentioned it!




Mr PERRETT:
  He has not mentioned it, but I am sure as a good Christian that he would mention it at the appropriate time. The reality is we need to put everything in context, like the spin that comes out of the member for North Sydney—we need to put things in context. We need to remember that Australia has a $1.3 trillion national economy. We are not just talking about a small trucking business and not just talking about one household: we are a nation with an economy of $1.3 trillion.


It is important that we look at some of the other countries. The member for Dawson said, 'You should compare our situation to comparable countries, like resource-rich countries such as Canada.' He did not mention Canada, but obviously that is very comparable in terms of size, resources and population. Canada is very comparable. As I read through the list of significant countries in terms of GDP growth, we outdo the lot. In fact, I think the only one that is outperforming us that is comparable would be Taiwan, which is good for some of the constituents in my electorate.


When we are compared to Norway or Sweden—as mentioned by the member for North Sydney—or to the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom or France, we are outperforming those countries. The reality is we are outperforming these countries. We have had 3.1 per cent growth and 0.6 per cent in the December quarter. However, what do we hear from those opposite? If they are overseas, they say that it is good. But no, because they are here, we hear the member for North Sydney say that our economy is flatlining. It is out and out misleading the public.


We have the Leader of the Opposition say that it did not grow. It did grow 3.1 per cent, but he says that it did not grow. The member for Dawson calls it a 'horror movie'. It must be like the Scary Movie version of a horror movie, because the reality is that when our economy grows like that it actually brings smiles to people's faces. Obviously, there are some stresses and this high Australian dollar is obviously something of concern. It is nice if you are an importer and your business is selling tires or something like that—as I inspected at one of my businesses yesterday. But to have a high dollar and these declining terms of trade is obviously something that is of concern to the government. Obviously, we could take a leaf out of the John Howard a playbook. If we taxed at their rates of taxing, we would have an additional $30 billion in taxes per year.




Dr Emerson:
  Easily in surplus.




Mr PERRETT:
  Yes, in surplus in five, six or seven years easily if we taxed at the rate that John Howard did, which has a record in history as the highest taxing government ever at 24.2 per cent of GDP. Instead, we have made the decision to be a much lower taxing government at 22 per cent of GDP. Sadly, obviously the reality is that no government in more than 30 years has run a surplus with a tax to GDP ratio below 22 per cent. That does bring some strains and stresses to the government, but obviously we are not hearing those opposite say that we should be taxing at the same rate as John Howard.


I do know what we should do. The member for Dawson said that we would have nothing to show at the end of the process and compared acquiring a house to what the government does. I can tell you what we do: we invest in education, we invest in the NBN and we invest in infrastructure. I want to return to those three points, because the member for Dawson—so typical of people down here in Canberra—mocked our investment in education and insulation. Of course, he goes to the school facilities that have had their curriculum improved and that have had their quality of educational delivery improved, and he mocks the NBN.


In fact, we have the Leader of the Opposition make that incredible statement during his contribution that he would nationalise the NBN if he was in power. He did not say that term, but he forgot that the government does not actually own the NBN. He said that he would effectively nationalise the NBN and then sell it for $1. That was his offer; it is on Hansard today. He did not realise that that is the major contribution that this government is making to improving productivity. It was ironic to have someone from the region—the Mackay area—not mention the NBN and the contributions that it makes to the local economy.


In terms of productivity, I well remember that when we took office in 2007—the member for Petrie and I were elected on 24 November 2007—productivity for that December quarter was at zero. That is not all the fault of the Howard government, admittedly. I know it does fluctuate a little bit. But the reality is that now we are starting to improve productivity, because—as everyone knows—productivity drives growth in living standards. We have got a bit of a pick-up in labour productivity. In fact, the labour productivity in the market sector grew by 3.3 per cent over the year to December, which is well above the 1.5 per cent average annual growth rate over the last 10 years.


Productivity is a sure indicator as to whether the economic engine is tuned correctly. Anyone that understands economics understands that you just cannot cut wages, which is the Work Choices way—the lazy way—of bringing improvements to the economy. You cannot make people work harder by cutting their wages—that just does not work. You have got to be smart about it. What do you do? You invest in infrastructure. It is a disgrace to have one of the economic brains of those opposite come in and say, 'I guarantee that I will nationalise the NBN and then sell it for $1.' I would like him to go to the Islamic college in the minister's electorate and tell them that the NBN is not worth anything. I say that because I received over 1,000 letters from the students in that school saying that they want the NBN rolled out faster to them, because they understand the jobs of the future will not necessarily be in their neighbourhood but will be throughout the Asian region. How do we engage with the Asian region? We invest in the NBN.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Which private company owns the NBN?




Mr PERRETT:
  It is not the government. The reality is that it is not actually owned by the government. For the Leader of the Opposition to commit to nationalising that company and to then sell it off for $1—and for the snickers to come from those opposite—shows that those opposite do not get technology. The reality is the digital age is upon us. I know we have a Leader of Opposition who says: 'I do not get technology. I do not worry about banking.' They go into the bank with their little passbook and say, 'This is the way to do things.' We need to invest in productivity, the NBN and the infrastructure in schools. That is what we need to do to improve our economy and make sure that we maintain this strong position.


The member for Dawson said we should be compared to other countries, and the member for North Sydney said we should be compared to other countries. I think the member for North Sydney mentioned Sweden and Finland. When you look at their actual GDP growth, when you look at their unemployment, when you look at the size of their economies and not just the fact that they have got some particular resources, Australia comes out ahead by a mile.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:07):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance, which is about the failure of the government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. It is always good to follow the member for Moreton. He has given a brief description of his electorate in Queensland, so I might take the opportunity to give a brief description of my electorate in Western Australia. Before I do that: I do not think it has been mentioned today in the chamber that there was an election in Western Australia on the weekend. Part of what the incumbent government in Western Australia went out to the population with was that Western Australia is heading in the right direction and now is not the time to take the risk of changing the government. Despite leading a minority government, Colin Barnett's leadership is providing certainty and direction to the state's economy. That is something this federal Labor government fails to do—provide certainty and direction to our national economy. Barnett's leadership and determination has ensured that Western Australia has remained secure and prosperous during difficult economic times. By standing up for our state, we Liberals are leading our country and leading the world. Whether it is through jobs, access to better health services at state-of-the-art hospitals, a revitalised city centre—




Dr Emerson:
  We've had the election.




Mr IRONS:
  If the member does not want to hear about it, he is welcome to leave the chamber. Whether it is through support for the vulnerable and disadvantaged; new train carriages; more police and new laws to help them; new and upgraded roads and highways; or a new world-class sports stadium, the Liberals make decisions and get things done. They are securing Western Australia's future. I believe the Minister for Defence said there was a federal drag on the election for WA Labor—they will not even mention 'ALP'; they just call themselves WA Labor. Anyway, Western Australians have made their choice. They have chosen security, certainty and direction in their state economy, which unfortunately this federal government cannot provide.


We heard the member for North Sydney speak today. He started off talking about Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Ms Gillard, who described themselves as economic conservatives and promised to keep the budget in surplus. The member for Longman, who is sitting in front of me, has never seen, and probably will never see, a Labor surplus. For the member for Longman, let us hope that, one day, Labor will keep their promises. At the moment, they are failing to do that, and they are failing to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. They keep going with the same policies, driving us further into debt.


We also heard the member for North Sydney talk about the credit card limit—and the member for Dawson also mentioned it—and how we have gone from a debt ceiling of $75 billion to a debt ceiling of $300 billion. Is that something to be proud of? Is that something that the government should put on their CV and say, 'This is the right direction for any country to head in'—into a ridiculous debt situation? And we heard the member for Moreton continually quoting about the Howard government. That was nearly six years ago, but he kept talking about them. He never once mentioned that there was a $20 billion cash surplus with the Howard government at that particular time.


We also heard the member for North Sydney mention that this is taxpayers' money, not the government's money. That is what this is all about—the failure of this government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. All it has to worry about is spending the money, not earning the money. It talks about a reduction in income tax from businesses. But, if you look at the way the PAYG system works, businesses are still paying their tax on last year's income. They are paying their forward tax, as you know—and I can see the Minister for Trade. I know that because I am doing it myself. My company is still paying tax on profits that were made two years ago; we are still paying it as we are going through. So you are still getting the income. But what is going to happen at the end of this financial year, when companies are not paying the same level of corporate tax? The government is going to have to repay all that money to those companies who have not made the same profits they were making one or two years ago. I am sure that has been allowed for in the budget as well.


I remind the House that Labor has produced the four biggest budget deficits on record, totalling $170 billion. We have now heard that there will also be a deficit in 2012-13. We have heard more than 500 times the government promise that it is going to achieve a surplus for all that time and for this particular year. We also know that the net interest payments are close to $12 billion per year. This government's expenditure has risen from just over $250 billion under the Howard government to over $350 billion this financial year. That is not a bad rise in spending—$100 billion within five years.


We have also heard that we are $263 billion in debt. How are we going to deal with that? Have we heard from this government how it is actually going to address that deteriorating fiscal position? We have heard two speakers from the government side, and they have said nothing about addressing the situation that this MPI is about. They have talked about the history. They compare themselves to Europe and other countries that are behind Australia's benchmarking, but they never want to benchmark us against countries that are better than us.


At the last sitting we heard the member for Moncrieff, Steven Ciobo, ask the Treasurer a question about the mining tax, which is particular to Western Australia. I call it the WA tax. He asked:


Given the mining tax has raised just $126 million its first six months of operation, when will the Treasurer face the fact that all his revised tax has achieved is that his credentials have indeed been shot to pieces?


The member for Lilley, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, answered:


It is the case that, in the second half of last year, which coincided with the first two quarters of the MRRT, there was a huge crash in resource prices. The consequence of that has been less revenue. … All of our profit based taxes—company tax, capital gains tax, superannuation tax, resource rent taxes—have taken a very substantial hit from global volatility at the end of last year.


That is something that he has to deal with. He could not foresee that and kept saying, 'I promise: this surplus is definitely going to happen. There are no ifs or buts: it will happen.' It never happened, and it is not going to happen. It just will not happen. So we need to hear from this government how they are going to address the deteriorating fiscal policy situation.


I also asked the Treasurer a question about the Gateway project, which again he tied in an interview in 2012 on 6PR to the mining tax. That is an expenditure of $685 million for the Gateway project in my electorate in Western Australia and he said it is in the budget bottom line. If it is tied to the mining tax and you are not getting an income from the mining tax, how are you going to pay for it? We hear, 'More debt, more debt.' We are going to borrow money from overseas again to pay off a project that was tied to the mining tax. Again we hear the government talking about how well they can manage the economy when they cannot even get the funding right for the small—actually it is a pretty decent size—Gateway project in Western Australia, in my electorate. We would like to get an answer from the government on how they are going to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal policy. We have had an answer that says nothing at all and just talks about the fact that it is in the budget bottom line, which we know it is not. We know it is not there.


In Western Australia, as I said before, we have a government that provides security and confidence in the economy, a government for the people of Western Australia to vote for—and that is what we achieved on Saturday. Now all we would like to see from this federal government is the same strict fiscal policies that will create the surplus for this nation which we are still waiting to see.


The member for Dawson talked about family budgets. People have been coming up to me at various places around the electorate saying that this is a government you could not put in charge of your own household budget because they just have no way of controlling spending and no way of budgeting correctly to provide Australia with a secure and certain future in the economy. In summary, I would like to say in support of the Australian people that we need this government to come out with some direct policies to address the fiscal deterioration in our nation.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:17):  It is a very sad day in this parliament when the man who would be the Treasurer of this country has 20 minutes to address the serious economic circumstances that we face in this country and spends that time lamenting nothing more than the fact that, were he Treasurer, he would have nothing left to privatise. He spent the rest of the time ridiculing the economy and the country with which, were he Treasurer, he would be out there attempting to strike a trade and economic relationship. The people in my electorate would be very sad indeed if they were to witness this debate. They would be sad but not surprised because they saw a Liberal Premier in New South Wales come to office promising not to privatise the Port Kembla harbour, but the very first thing they did when they came into office was to privatise the Port Kembla harbour, an asset worth well in excess of $100 million, and give nothing more than $10 million back to the local community. Is it any wonder that the would-be Treasurer of Australia, a member of that very same party, stands here and seriously suggests that, if he could, he would sell the National Broadband Network off for $1? In fact, he would rather give it away. This is from the man who would like to be Treasurer of this country.


We have some good news in this country. It is good news for Australia but bad news for people who hate good news, such as those on the other side of the House. We are growing as an economy, and that marks us off as one of the few countries in the world that can say that. We are growing at around three per cent on trend. Indeed, our economy, the Australian economy, has pulled itself through the worst recession in the world in over 100 years and it is now 13 per cent bigger than it was in 2004. This on its own is nothing short of a miracle. But when you add on top of that the fact that over that self-same period an additional 850,000 new jobs have been created it is no wonder that when people get off the plane at Mascot airport they ask, 'What are you guys doing in Australia? We've come here to learn because you guys must be doing something right and we envy your economy. We envy the economic circumstances that you have here in Australia.'


I was tempted to describe the economics proffered by those on the other side as 'bonehead economics' or 'Flintstone economics', but that would be wrong because bones have weight. There has been absolutely no weight and no substance to the contribution that has been given by each of the three speakers in this debate so far. They would have you believe that the only right thing for a government to do is sit here and deliver a surplus, year in and year out, no matter what the economic circumstances are. It does not take a year 7 economics student to work out that if your economic recipe for this country is to deliver a surplus no matter what the economic circumstances are, if your promise to the Australian people is that you will deliver a surplus year in and year out no matter the economic circumstances, your promise to the Australian people is twofold. Firstly, you are promising to tax them more than you need to because, if you are a government that consistently collects more revenue than you are spending, you are a government that is consistently taxing the Australian people more than you need to. Is that the sort of economic recipe that they would have for this great country of ours? The second thing they are promising is to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. If as a government you are proposing to deliver a surplus no matter what the economic circumstances are, you are promising to do precisely the wrong things at the wrong time in the economic cycle while taxing the Australian people more than you need to. It is little wonder that we hear that from those on the other side and the man who would be Treasurer of this country because they wear the gold medal for the highest taxing government in this country’s history, at 24.2 per cent of GDP in 2004-05. 


Those opposite have spoken for well over 40 minutes in contributing to this debate. Is it any wonder that the one report they did not mention is a recent report from the International Monetary Fund which has belled the cat? It has said that the Howard government was the most profligate, the highest spending government, in the nation’s history. It was the most reckless-spending government in this nation’s history. When the economy was raining gold bars, what that government should have been doing was addressing some of the long-term problems, the long-term issues, that we have in this country. As members from the National Party would often lament, it should have been spending more on infrastructure, more on roads. It is a source of great embarrassment to those in the National Party that this government has spent more on roads and more on rail—more on critical infrastructure—than the coalition ever did when it was in government. That is a source of great embarrassment to every single National Party member who sits on the other side of the House. 


If you reject bonehead economics such as those offered by the other side and you are committed to doing the right thing, then you ensure, at the time in the economic cycle when the government needs to act to support jobs and growth, that you stimulate the economy. If that means going into deficit, then that is the right thing to do. As the economy starts to recover, you start to pull back on spending—and that, indeed, is exactly what this government has done. 


We are looking at stimulating, with targeted expenditure, those areas of the economy that need assistance but pulling back on some of those longer term spendings and expenditures which are going to create structural problems over the long term. That is why we have delivered $130 billion worth of structural savings to the budget—indeed, over $16 billion since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the right thing to do. You will not hear that from the economic lightweights on the other side. All they can do is crack jokes about how much they would like to privatise the assets of this country, or denigrate our great trading partners, the people they would like to strike up an economic relationship with. 


Deputy Speaker, you will hear a lot of whinging from those on the other side about government spending. But when they go back to their electorates they are talking about the projects they wish the government would fund. The longest line in my electorate is that of Liberal Party councillors and Liberal Party supporters who are knocking on my door saying, 'Whatever you do, you've got to stop that Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, from tearing up the NBN; and for God’s sake can you ensure that it turns up to my business, to my house, to my school before that bloke ever sits on this side of the House.' The longest line in any electorate office will be the line of Liberal Party people who are pro the NBN—people who want to see the NBN rolled out in their neighbourhood, to their business, to their school, to their university. They will not be talking about these sorts of things in their electorate, but when they come here to Canberra these are exactly the sorts of things that they are saying the government should be doing. 


I have spoken about spending on infrastructure. Is it the investments such as we are proposing to create a revolution in our school education system that they want us to axe? Is it the funds we have set aside for regional development in this country that they want us to axe? I heard the previous speaker say that the minerals resource rent tax has delivered only $125 million in the last six months. That is $125 million more than it would have collected if those opposite were in office, and I can tell you it would go a long way to delivering much needed infrastructure projects in my electorate. The tax is actually working in exactly the right way. It collects more revenue as company profits increase and less revenue when they do not. These are the sorts of things that a government will do if it is not wedded to the sort of bonehead economics of those on the other side of the House. 


We are talking about taxation and we are talking about revenue and expenditure. As we go into the next election those on the other side of the House will go to their electorates promising tax cuts for the wealthiest, tax increases for the poorest and pension cuts for people who can least afford it. This is the sort of bonehead economics that they are so wedded to. They do not look beneath the talking points. They are following the empty slogans of their leaders. But the facts do not lie: low unemployment, trend growth, an economy which is the envy of the rest of the world and public finances in good shape, as every respected commentator will testify. These are the sorts of things we should be doing if we are serious about economics in this country.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:27):  We have just listened to a wonderful 10-minute contribution from the member for Throsby on vapourware and Keynesian economics, which are well and truly discredited in this day and age. Again we stand here discussing the government's inability to manage its own budget circumstances. Maybe we should clear up a couple of misconceptions at the outset. If you take the amount of debt that this government has added to the Australian people's credit cards over the past five years as a percentage of spending on GDP, it is well in excess of anything the Howard government ever spent during its term. I love the fact that those opposite say they have had budget savings over the past five years. The Australian people, including those in the gallery, should know that they include in that 27 new or increased taxes which they are saying are savings. The last time I checked, increasing taxes was not a saving. 


We stand here today debating this MPI because this government has a serious and undeniable spending crisis. We are faced with a government that over the past five years has succeeded in destroying a fiscal foundation that took 10 years to create. This fiscal foundation was predicated on a sound budgetary policy of surpluses—surpluses which paid off $96 billion of debt and surpluses which allowed us to put funds away to save for the future and for future generations. 


This prudent fiscal management resulted in the creation of not only the Future Fund but also the Higher Education Endowment Fund, with an initial investment of some $5 billion, and the Health and Medical Infrastructure Fund, with an initial investment of some $2½ billion. The objective of these funds was to utilise the earnings to fund capacity improvements in higher education and health and medical infrastructure, whilst leaving the capital to accumulate for future generations. But in 2008 the Labor government rolled these funds into the nation-building funds, and within those funds they created the opportunity to spend not only the earnings but also, crucially, the capital, which had been set aside for the longer term. Of these funds, only the Future Fund now remains intact; however, due to the government's financial profligacy, it has not had any additional funds added to it in the past five years.


We know two things about this Labor government: they cannot manage the economy and they cannot be trusted. Businesses and households now know they cannot believe a word the government say about the budget or the state of the economy. We see the government frequently complain that their dire fiscal position is due to falling revenue, when the fact is that revenue has remained reasonably steady over the period. However, the differences occur when comparing the actual revenue received to what was forecast, and therein lies the tale of this government's fiscal and economic ineptitude. During a period with some of the best terms of trade in our history and despite the government introducing, as I said earlier, 27 new taxes and increased taxes and a whole range of fees and charges, we have seen a gross deterioration in our nation's fiscal position. This deterioration has not been due to the community's lack of effort or our business community's drive to improve their business but is directly a result of the Labor government's failure to adequately manage their finances and live within their means. 


We have witnessed over the past five years the greatest fiscal deterioration in our nation's history. We have seen a government that calls tax increases savings. We have seen a government that has spent some $172 billion more than it has collected in revenue over the past five years, resulting in the Australian people now owing more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. In the current budget year, 2012-13, the government has increased the debt limit to a record $300 billion. It was only some $75 billion in the 2008-09 year. Australians know that that debt needs to be serviced and repaid. Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes. More debt means more money spent in the future on interest payments instead of on schools, hospitals or lowering taxes. As the member for North Sydney quite rightly pointed out, our gross interest bill is now some $12 billion a year.


I would like to say today that this government has seen the light and learnt the lessons from its profligate  spending. However, sadly that appears not to be the case. An analysis by the Australian Financial Review last year reveals that future governments will need to raise some $120 billion by the end of the decade to pay for Labor's unfunded spending commitments. The budget bottom line has already been hit by Labor's multi-billion-dollar blow-out on border protection. It will be further hit by Labor's massive unfunded commitments in disability services, defence, education and now dental care. Australians are entitled to ask, 'Where is the money coming from?' I would like to give you a list of some of the unfunded commitments: the National Disability Insurance Scheme; aged care; increases for low-paid workers in the social and community sector; offshore processing; an increase in the refugee intake; defence; the dental care scheme; and the Gonski review implementation. We all agree that education is extremely important for our children, but we need to pay for it in a sensible and considered way so that, when they enter the workforce, it is not their taxes that are paying for their education.


More recently we have seen the Business Council of Australia make the following comments in regard to the budget, 'It is in urgent need of repair,' and 'The government’s fiscal strategy is not working and needs a major rethink.' In addition, analysis by Deloitte Access Economics shows that this Labor government has added almost $50 billion to the budget in new spending programs. This is the fundamental underlying issue for this Labor government: it does not know how to control its spending. It is interesting to note the comments made by the authors of a European Central Bank working paper on the effect of the size of government on economic performance. The results of their studies show 'a significant negative effect of the size of government on growth'. They say: 


Interestingly, government consumption is consistently detrimental to output growth irrespective of the country sample considered …


In conclusion, they surmise that the more resources required for financing government spending, the greater the reduction in the optimal level of private consumption as well as productivity.


We have a government that continue to spend like a drunken sailor. They talk about improving productivity within our economy, yet their very profligate spending policies are actually greatly detrimental to increasing our productivity and our national wealth. This is why the coalition is focused on ensuring that, if we are elected to government at the next federal election, we will live within our means, reducing the negative impact of profligate government expenditure on the Australian economy. It is important to note that the budget will always be in a stronger position under a coalition government because good economic management is in our DNA. It is only a coalition government that has the desire to restore hope, reward and opportunity to the Australian people.

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (20:19):  At the outset, I must say that the coalition has grave reservations about the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013, but, due to the disastrous budget mismanagement of this government, we do not believe that we can oppose this bill, which is principally designed to cut the level of funding for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, because this is a savings measure. However, we do condemn the government for this outcome, and I will be moving a second reading amendment which notes that the coalition, should we be elected to government, commits to reviewing the changes in this bill to establish their true budgetary and administrative impact on business, especially small and medium enterprises, who need the support of this scheme in order to grow their export oriented businesses.


The changes proposed in the bill are to implement the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to deliver annual savings of $25 million. That is how dire the budget situation has become. This government, which has run up over $260 billion in gross debt, now has to look for savings in the order of $25 million a year out of this scheme. The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partly supports the export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports, to grow our economy in Australian produced goods and services. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the cap. My understanding is that about 5,100 enterprises per year apply for grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped for many years at $150 million per annum, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied. 


According to the government, the changes in this bill will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years worth to eight years. The government believes that this offers Australian small- and medium-sized exporters a slightly longer and more commercially realistic period to become established in these markets. However, to offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an increased number of grants to East Asian and emerging and frontier markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union is to be reduced. I believe that the 21st century should be known as 'the global century' and that Australia, as a global nation with global interests, should not only be looking to East Asia but also be continuing to pursue opportunities for our exporters in established markets. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted and small businesses would typically face fewer barriers to doing business. 


The bill provides for the reduction in the number of grants for these markets from a maximum of seven years of annual grants to only five years. So, in effect, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness is telling Australian exporters that he knows how to run their businesses better than they do. He knows through who knows what business experience that the US market is bad but the Asian market is good. The fact is that the minister for trade does not have a clue. If the minister for trade thought the Asian market was so vital, why did he do virtually nothing to stop the government's disgraceful ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia? The government claims that it is seeking to introduce this bill now to avoid creating considerable uncertainty for small businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements which become operational on 1 July 2013. 


The coalition has consulted key stakeholder groups, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Export Council of Australia—both oppose the expenditure cut and have asked that the coalition oppose the bill. We have agonised over this decision because we agree with them that the EMDG scheme under a competent government is a fine scheme and it has helped Australian exporters over many decades, and we believe it should not be cut in this way. However, recognising the dire state of this government's upcoming budget, recognising the dire state of the debt situation that this government has plunged Australia into and in the interests of our wider budget management policy, it is felt that we cannot oppose the expenditure cuts. But we note that this is yet another blow to business caused by the budget mismanagement and fiscal recklessness of the Gillard government.


When in doubt a Labor government will default to kicking the business community. The former trade union bosses and their lawyers who form the Labor Party just do not get business, especially small business. Labor cries crocodile tears about job security, but does not acknowledge or appreciate that it is the business community that is the engine room for job security—the businesses that take the risks to find new markets to grow their businesses. It is business that employs workers and creates and provides jobs. So, this blow to the EMDG scheme is just another example of Labor not understanding business and its needs. It is fair to say that since 2007 Labor has made a complete mess of the EMDG scheme. Soon after taking office Labor expanded the scheme by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $15,000 to $10,000, increasing the number of grants from seven to eight and increasing the maximum grant from $150,000 to $200,000—all well and good, if you can believe them. The cost of these changes was estimated at $50 million a year, but then—and this is the key—Labor increased funding only for the year 2009-10. So, in June 2010 Labor then amended the scheme to essentially reverse the 2008 implementation of its election commitments. Why should we have been surprised?


In the past the coalition has made commitments to increase the funding levels of the EMDG scheme. We believe it is a good scheme. While this remains a long-term goal, we believe the export sector would benefit more from a coalition government making its first priority the abolition of the carbon tax, then the mining tax, the reduction in Labor's debt and the reversal of Labor's fiscal mismanagement. In terms of the detail of the legislation, I am advised that industry representatives have various concerns about the potential exclusion of some types of activities—for example, the promotion of musical concerts. While these are a matter for debate, the bottom line is that many of these exclusions would appear to have been made because of cost cutting. The principal change that has attracted most attention is the cutting of grants available to established markets like the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada with some of the savings used to fund increased grants, principally in the East Asian region. The rest of the savings go to consolidated revenue, although we do not have a breakdown on the composition of that—so, again, another warning sign.


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argues that there is no credible commercial analysis provided that shows that the EMDG money spent on established markets is any less valuable than that spent in emerging markets. I agree and the coalition agrees that it should be up to Australian business to exploit markets according to commercial realities, rather than bureaucratic whim. The minister who introduced this bill, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, has one of the worst track records of any trade minister in modern history in terms of achieving for exporters. There has barely been any progress at all in trade negotiations by this minister. He has cut the vitally important EMDG scheme. He stood by idly when the Gillard government trashed our trade relations with Indonesia over the live cattle export fiasco and trashed our reputation as a trusted and reliable trading partner. The Australia-China Free Trade Agreement has barely moved from the starting point of negotiations that occurred under the Howard government in 2005. New Zealand also started negotiations with China in the same year and concluded their free trade agreement by 2008. In particular there has been stalled progress with respect to the free trade agreement with South Korea. Again, where is the practical concern with boosting our trade with Asia, when the government cannot finalise an agreement with one of our friendliest trading partners? 


The National Farmers Federation has been particularly vocal about this export issue. Last week, along with representatives of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Industry Council and the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the President of the National Farmers, Mr Jock Laurie, said: 


Australian beef producers stand to miss out on $1.4 billion in exports to Korea because of our stalled free trade agreement.


He went on to say:


… the threat to other agriculture exports like wheat (around $350 million) and dairy (over $100 million) was also pronounced.


Further he stated that:


Total losses to Australian agriculture could run into the multi billions of dollars. Australian farmers are losing out in a major way while ever we don’t have an FTA with Korea and our major competitors like the USA do.


The beef industry provides a classic example. The National Farmers Federation notes that: 


Under the current arrangements, Australia’s $645 million annual beef trade with Korea is subject to a 40 per cent tariff.


However, after signing a Korea-US FTA, United States beef is subject to only a 34.6 per cent tariff, 5.3 per cent less than Australian beef. But the differential will become massive as time goes by since US beef exports to Korea will be completely tariff free by 2026. 


This government has publicly admitted that a key sticking point is its unilateral veto of what are called investor-state dispute settlement clauses. The Howard government used the potential inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement clause as a negotiating position for bilateral agreements and so such clauses were included in some of Australia's FTAs concluded under the Howard government, as well as in the one with ASEAN and in the free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore and Thailand. But they were not included in others—for example, the FTAs with the United States and New Zealand. Inclusion of such clauses should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 


It is true to say that the Australian business community does not have a united view on the matter. However, in 2011 the Gillard government stated that they were opposed to investor-state dispute settlement clauses, despite the previous inclusion of such clauses in the Chile and ASEAN agreements finalised since 2007. In contrast, the coalition remains open, as a negotiating position, to including ISDS clauses. The fact is that the EMDG cut is just another blow in the general mismanagement of our export trade. 


We are also concerned by the extra regulatory burden which will be placed on exporters by the changes to the EMDG scheme. Should we be elected to government, we are determined to cut red tape and overregulation. This bill is just another example of this government making changes which will lead to additional red tape and regulation.


In conclusion, therefore, I move:


That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) condemns the Government for breaking its 2007 election promise to increase spending on the Export Market Development Grant (EMDG) scheme and instead cutting the program over the course of the last 5 years;


(2) notes that the cuts to the EMDG scheme:


(a) are directly due to the budget mismanagement of the Government and its wasteful expenditure policies; and


(b) represent further evidence of the Government’s inability to understand the plight of Australian exporters as they meet huge challenges in the quest to build their international markets;


(3) expresses concern that the Government has introduced increased red tape in the administration of the EMDG scheme when what is required across the Government is a reduction in red tape; and


(4) recognises that the Coalition, when in government, commits to reviewing the changes in the bill to establish their true budgetary and administrative impact on business, especially small and medium enterprises.”

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:33):  I support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. Having listened to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party's arguments and her reasons for putting forward her amendment, I am not at all persuaded by them nor do I believe they are worthy of the support of this House.


The Export Market Development Grants scheme is an Australian government financial assistance program which assists and encourages small- and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses above $10,000, provided that the total expenses are at least $20,000. To date, the program has provided up to seven grants to each eligible applicant. To access the scheme for the first time, businesses need to have spent $20,000 over two years on eligible export marketing expenses. To be eligible, the Australian business must have income of not more than $50 million in the grant year and must have promoted the export of goods—most services also qualify—the export of intellectual property and know-how, inbound tourism or conferences and events held in Australia.


There are eight key provisions of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. The first is to increase the maximum number of grants to eight. The second is to exclude expenses relating to the promotion of sales to the markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union in grant years six, seven, and eight for all applicants except approved bodies. The third key provision is to remove the limit on administrative expenditure from the legislation and introduce a power for the minister to set the limit on administrative expenditure by determination. The fourth is to prevent further approval of joint ventures after 30 June 2013. Fifthly, the provisions of the bill remove event promoters from the EMDG scheme. Sixthly, the provisions of this amendment bill prevent the payment of grants engaging an EMDG consultant who has been assessed to be not a fit and proper person. The seventh change will enable a grant to be paid more quickly where a grant is determined before the l July following the so-called 'balance distribution date'. Lastly, the bill will require applicants to acquit claims by individually paying for claimed expenses.


The government's white paper, Australia in the Asian century, makes very clear the importance of Asia in Australia's future and the opportunities that Asia's development in the 21st century holds for Australia. In recent years the pace of growth and change in the Asian region has been nothing short of phenomenal. According to the white paper, in the past 20 years China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy and increased their absolute economic size six times over. By 2025, the region as a whole will account for almost half of world output.


The white paper also takes a close look at what Asia's future means for Australia and at the opportunities for us in the years ahead. As an advanced economy with expertise in so many areas, including education, construction, business, entertainment, tourism, health and the environment, Australia is extremely well placed to strengthen its ties with Asia. It is in Asia and developing countries in other parts of the world that our future markets lie and that is where Australia should focus its efforts. The government recognises that and so do Australian businesses—it is an obvious reality—and that is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. 


Asia has a population of around four billion and it is already a market we should be tapping into much more than we have done to date. We have good links with Asia, established as a result of not only our proximity to many Asian countries but also the links that we have formed with many Asian countries—links that will hold us in good stead when we want to do more business with them in the future. These links result in two-way trade, and they are links that the Asia white paper quite properly says our future should be based on. Our future lies in Asia and the emerging countries, because the people of those countries are wanting to bring their standard of living into line with those of advanced economies. That is where the opportunities will lie. Those countries are the ones that will be wanting to tap into the expertise that already exists in Western countries and in particular the expertise that exists in friendly Western countries like Australia. 


This is well understood by business in Australia. In my own electorate, I frequently speak to business people who are already doing business in Asian markets but who are looking to expand their business. On many occasions they have come to my office to seek assistance to further their business in Asian markets and in the Asian countries we have relationships with. For many small- and medium-size businesses, who do have great ideas and who see obvious opportunities in Asia, without assistance their ideas will never be put into practice. Many of the people I speak to need assistance and they come to my office to see what assistance is available from the government. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an ideal way of providing that very assistance so that they can bring their initiatives to fruition.


I have no doubt at all that this legislation, and the scheme more broadly, has been welcomed by the business community. Those who say that it is wrong for us to cut back the focus on the USA, Canada and Europe are short-sighted. The reality is that business in Australia today has limited opportunities in those places, for many reasons and not the least of which is that those countries do not require the kinds of services that I alluded to earlier to the same extent as the emerging markets do—and those emerging markets are best located for us in the Asian area, as well as other places in the world where developing countries are looking to prosper. 


The amendments contained in this legislation ensure that the Australian people—Australian businesses—get the best return for the public funds provided by the government under this program. The Australian people will get the best returns because the best return for their funds is gained by focusing on the emerging opportunities in the Asian market. As I said a moment ago, this focus will benefit the very businesses that are seeking to access those funds.


My understanding is that there will be a saving of about $25 million per annum as a result of these changes. Frankly, the government is responsible for the expenditure of public funds and it ought to use those funds prudently. If we can manage funds better and still support business, then quite frankly we should be doing so. Reviewing legislation such as this on a regular basis is simply part of being a prudent government. I understand that in 2012-13 over 3,000 claims have been made under this scheme, and I understand that about $125.4 million has been allocated in the current budget. Those are not insignificant amounts of money, and those funds will assist Australian businesses. 


In more recent weeks I have spoken with businesses in my electorate who have brilliant ideas—in some cases they are brilliant inventions—and they are simply seeking some support and assistance to get those ideas and inventions out to the wider market. These are inventions that will be embraced and adopted particularly in those countries that we refer to as the emerging or developing countries. Yet, these businesses are quite often restrained by a lack of financial support. This program is the kind of program that provides them with the right sorts of support and certainly it is the kind of program that will enable them to send their ideas offshore. The people offshore also benefit because they are the beneficiaries of intellectual property, knowhow or whatever it is that is brought to them as a result of someone's idea here in Australia. 


Lastly, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in her remarks alleged that these amendments mean more red tape. As I said earlier on, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that public funds are spent wisely, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that no-one rorts the system and it is incumbent on any government to ensure that taxpayers get the best possible value for their dollars. Cutting out people like promoters—promoters of entertainment events; concerts and the like—is quite reasonable. Promoters are not, in my view, the beneficiaries for which this fund was set up. As a result of promotional activity you might get some economic benefit through the impact on tourism and the like, but, frankly, I believe there are much more worthy and much more deserving areas where these grants should be applied, and the decision by the government to tighten the rules in respect of some of those matters is quite appropriate. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:45):  I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for trade, the member for Curtin, to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. It has long been said that Australia is an exporting nation, and this has never been more obvious than in Western Australia. According to state government figures, Western Australia contributed $122 billion of Australia's merchandise exports in 2011-12, a rise of five per cent on the previous year. This equates to 46 per cent of this nation's exports, which exceeds the combined contribution of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. So it is a significant export effort. Trade accounts for 53 per cent of Western Australian's gross state product, with the great majority, over 90 per cent, coming from the mining sector. However, the state is also a major agricultural exporter. In 2010-11, Western Australia produced over $6 billion of agricultural, fisheries and forestry merchandise, and, of this, $5 billion worth was exported. The vast majority of these products are going to Asia, due to Western Australia's natural geographical competitive advantage—its proximity to those Asian markets. With these key figures in mind, it must be obvious even to the most parochial eastern state members in this House that Western Australia is in fact an export powerhouse.


It is for this reason also that export assistance needs to have a Western Australian focus and create further opportunities. It is easy to be fooled into thinking that the west has only large multinational mining companies which are readily able to do their own marketing. Indeed, it might seem that our mining companies actually sell themselves—I know that some on the other side think this. There are, however, many smaller players, in a range of industries, that certainly deserve the support of the government.


The south-west of Western Australia, in particular, is an area of innovation and industry. Whilst we have a number of those same large exporters, such as Worsley Alumina, we also have a broad range and a large number of small suppliers exporting a wide variety of products. As I know well, the south-west, with a $16.8 billion regional economy of its own, is an economic engine room for the whole nation. The region derives most of its wealth from the mining and manufacturing sectors, which, latest figures show, produce $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. It is also a major exporter of agricultural products, as I said, from beef and dairy—some of the best dairy products in the world—to the finest of Margaret River and Geographe region wines. Some of these have found niche markets for their high-quality products, and it is this group that needs and deserves support. They are out there doing the hard yards. They are small businesses, frequently.


I note that the explanatory memorandum to this bill tells us in the outline that the bill 'helps achieve savings of $25 million per year'. However, the explanatory memorandum also notes, under 'Financial Impact':


Expenditure under the Act is set through annual Appropriation acts. A capping mechanism ensures that expenditure under the scheme is limited to the amount appropriated.


They are conflicting statements. That really tells us, the readers, that the government has once again engaged in what you could only call a surreptitious slashing of funds—and this time it is actually of industry support to those same small businesses that are seeking an export opportunity.


As was acknowledged at Senate estimates, this is another attempt by the Gillard government to hide the real budget position it will face in May. It is duplicitous of the government to attempt to hide this slashing of funding and to sanitise the explanatory memorandum. This bill is not about enhancing exports. It is not. It is about saving the government dollars at the expense of those same very innovative and keen Australian exporters that just need a bit of a hand along the way. This is at a time when the world remains almost on the edge of an economic precipice and when the value of the Australian dollar is crucifying Australian exporters. It is tough out there, and I do not know what the Australian government expects. If you are an exporter, it is a tough market. If you are an agricultural exporter, it is an even tougher market.


I saw some recent forecasts about the future of agriculture and agricultural exports, and they predicted even tougher times than we have now. I am concerned, as you would be, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, for the future of a lot of those exporters and the growers that supply them. I also noticed last week the economic forecasting by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences that indicated the Australian dollar is expected to stay at current levels—a particularly high level of at least US104c—and not return to parity until 2018. If that is not a great example of the pressure that Australian agricultural exporters are under, I do not know what is. Everyone in this House needs to think again, including the government, because, if this scenario proves to be accurate, the export sector in Australia is in for very rough times until 2018. The ability of both Europe and the US to survive their respective impending debt disasters will also have long-term impacts on the value of the exchange rate.


Now, there are optimistic economists demonstrating perhaps a bit of hubris at the moderate improvement in budget deficits in both of those areas, but the realist economists still recognise that those budgets are not actually in surplus but just a little bit less in deficit. This is the reality, and that tells us that the Australian dollar is not likely to weaken anytime soon. It is also a reality that this global generation generally continues to almost binge on debt. Those on the other side do the same thing. We heard today, in the debate on the MPI, about the government's $300 billion debt—the debt ceiling. Let us wait and see what is in the next budget. Government spending is increasing the burden on the next generation—spending today is taxing tomorrow. This government is leaving debt and deficit for the next generation. The next generation in Europe and the US will have to pay off the debts of their parents or simply pass them on with their own added debt to some future generation to take care of. In this parliament there has also been a passing on of intergenerational debt, perhaps for the first time in this nation's history. That is an indictment of this government.


Australian exporters may recover if the US dollar improves, but there is another element of the export debate that needs to be addressed here in the House today. It is the failure of the government, through Austrade, to adequately enhance the export capacity and opportunity of Australian manufacturers and producers. It should be core business for Austrade to help our small businesses into the markets. Austrade has a number of workers both domestically and overseas who are struggling with poor resourcing—and poor leadership, in some senses. The bill before the House does not improve this situation; it makes it worse. Another $25 million cut from services currently provided is part of the government's death by 1,000 cuts of export innovation, and it is death particularly to small exporters. I—like, I would bet, just about every member in this House—have had such exporters at my door saying: 'All we need is a hand. We need to get into these markets, but we are a relatively small business and we are doing it tough on the ground.' I think it entirely escapes this government how tough it is on the ground, particularly for food manufacturers and exporters and even more particularly for those in the agricultural sector.


Austrade appears to be too bogged down covering for the government's incompetence to do its own job properly. It might surprise the Prime Minister and the trade minister to learn that the role of Austrade is to promote Australian exports, not to promote the Prime Minister and the minister for trade. Austrade needs to promote small to medium enterprises—and even some of the bigger enterprises—not only in my electorate but also around Australia. Such businesses are investing their own money and their own expertise, and they are working overtime not just for themselves but also for their communities, for the regions and for our economy. They are alive and well in our part of the world but are doing it exceptionally tough, and often all they need is a small hand up.


A refocusing of Austrade is really urgent and essential so that our own exporters, rather than this government, can become the main agenda again. Austrade should be focused on our small to medium exporters who are out there wanting to get into the markets and provide some fabulous niche products. This refocusing is so urgent and essential because of the difficult economic times in which Austrade is operating. Austrade's job has got far harder since 2008. Things are also harder for our exporters, and we should all acknowledge how much harder they have got. The difficult economic times make it all the more important for our businesses to work smarter and to invest more wisely, and to do so some of them need assistance. Now is not the time to hang our exporters out to dry. Look at the terms of trade, look at what is happening on the ground, look how hard exporters are working and look how hard it is now that we do not have the numbers of tourists that we used to have coming to our part of the world. That is why it is important for Australian businesses to have access to export markets.


But the government is hanging exporters out to dry. It will probably take the election of a coalition government to end the rot and develop a focus on exports to assist small to medium enterprises and some of the bigger businesses. A coalition government will seek to look after the interests of exporters and innovators. We need to celebrate and support what they are doing, not celebrate and support the failing government we have here. The coalition will work for enhanced access for Australian businesses to world markets. We in the coalition understand very directly the importance of doing this work. If we are elected, we will do this work in conjunction with the private sector, and the private sector will also focus, I have no doubt, on marketing and market access.


In some sectors, both sides of the public-private partnership have abandoned the field. Both need to re-engage, and we in this place need to be part of the re-engagement. Nowhere will re-engagement be more important than in the agricultural sector. When you get out into the wheat belt in Western Australia, you see how tough farmers are doing it. There are the same challenges in my electorate. Right across Australia I see the same challenges. Farmers are finding it extremely difficult to remain viable. It is a huge challenge, as is the challenge of keeping enough young farmers coming through who have the knowledge, expertise and passion to continue doing what our farmers do so well.


We need to know what the Asian market is looking for. We know that we can produce the best quality food products in the world—we are good at it—but we also need to make sure that we have the capacity to deliver what established and emerging Asian markets are looking for. A coalition government would make sure that it sufficiently developed and supported access to these markets for Australian exporters.


This government has repeatedly failed farmers in Australia. This fact is as tangible as it could be. One of the main examples of the government's failure would have to be its actions on the live export trade. The impacts of the government's actions are being felt all up and down the chain in each state—and certainly in my electorate in south-west Western Australia. The impacts of the government's actions are major, even though the government chooses to ignore them. If you want to talk about impacts on exports, just look at the live cattle export debacle. It is just one example of how this government has failed farmers in Australia. It has also failed our food producers and food manufacturers. Australian farmers are certainly capable of delivering the products that the market not only demands but also deserves. Now is not the time to abandon Australian farmers.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:59):  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you come from Maranoa and know how important the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 is to you. I am interested that the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is at the table, along with the former Speaker, the member for Scullin. I also note that the member for McEwen, who is another regional member, is sitting in the chamber, listening intently to my words. I also acknowledge the member for Wright, as well as the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional health, who is also sitting at the table. He was in Wagga Wagga just last week and would have no doubt heard many farmers complaining about how difficult the terms of trade are for them at the moment. It is always wonderful to follow the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, because she is so passionate and feisty about all of these important issues, which are central to trade. I know that the members in the House at the moment all appreciate just how important trade, agriculture and Australia's future food security are.


I note how few Labor speakers are on the speakers list. That is a shame, because perhaps if we were talking about unions or public servants at risk of losing their jobs—one of those sorts of issues—the speakers list would be full. It is just a shame that the speakers list is not full with government members talking about this very important issue, because we have just heard the member for Forrest talking about just how hard and how tough our agriculture producers are doing it at the moment. The shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Calare, told us yesterday in our party room that producers are doing it tougher in some circumstances than they were at the height of the drought—and that is a problem. And it is not just a problem for them; it is a problem for the regional communities that their hard work underpins. It is a problem for our nation because we cannot sell the amount of food that we rely on to help our balance of payments figures, our balance of trade.


We cannot continue to operate this way. Those farmers, let us face it, were once the backbone of this economy, and they still keep it going. Agriculture is still such an important component. Mining may well be one of the big dollar earners, but agriculture helps our balance of payments no end, and we all like to eat food. Only last week I spoke to representatives from the Leeton citrus growers. This organisation has been going since 1942. They are doing it really tough at the moment. They have lost 150 growers in less than a decade. That is the loss of 300 wages. Their costs are now going through the roof. Their power costs are exorbitant and are not helped by the carbon tax. Their wages have not become any cheaper. The high Australian dollar is really killing them, as well as so many other agriculture producers. Bad water policy is just another thing which they are trying to contend with.


I note that the member for Wills is now the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and has been since 4 February 2013. It is an interesting position which the member for Wills finds himself in, given the fact that he was so stridently opposed to the live cattle export trade to Indonesia when that particular issue blew up after a Four Corners program. It was policy from this government based on a television program. It was a very savage knee-jerk reaction to a television program that saw the live cattle trade stop forthwith—bang—just like that, with no thought given to the cattle producers of Australia's west or north. Indeed, as the member for Forrest just indicated, the shock waves reverberated right throughout the cattle-producing industry and even beyond it. The markets in Wagga Wagga and elsewhere in the Riverina were affected because of it. There was a fear that they would not be able to export a lot of their cattle overseas and they would see them brought south. The people who built stock crates were also affected because orders were stopped.


I am pleased to say that the shadow minister for agriculture visited Indonesia last October, along with the opposition leader and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who has an intense interest in trade and certainly in helping our trading neighbours. The highlights of that trip were the sheer untapped potential, the member for Calare said, for our farm exports—and not just those of Northern Australia. The coalition took the extraordinary step of sending a delegation of senior shadow ministers to Indonesia because of the importance that this side of politics places on our northern neighbour as a valued trading partner—not somebody to whom we can just say, 'No more cattle.' They are not somebody whom we can just bring the gate down upon with our live exports but rather somebody whom we need to be friends with, somebody who is important to us, somebody whom we need to treat like a friend. You do not treat friends in the way that the Prime Minister did when she stopped the live cattle trade.


Indonesia has been vastly undervalued as a trading partner. While every nation across the globe is trying to capitalise on the Asian boom, there are a number of obvious reasons why Australia should be trying to make the most of the opportunities that exist within the Indonesian economy. Indonesia is not in great need of our coal because it has large deposits of its own, and some people foolishly dismiss Indonesia as a trading opportunity because of this. Australia has a unique opportunity to bolster our farm sector with Indonesia. It has 237 million people literally on our doorstep. It has a booming middle class of around 50 million strong and a high propensity for consumer spending. In short, it is an ideal destination for our farm produce. Our farm produce, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Maranoa, is the best in the world bar none. I do not mind saying that. I am sure the parliamentary secretary for agriculture, who is sitting at the table, would agree with me.




Mr Sidebottom:
  Hear, hear.




Mr McCORMACK:
  'Hear, hear,' he says. Certainly that is the case. We have the best in the world and we need to protect and preserve it.


The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 are to deliver on the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to concentrate the Export Market Development Grants Scheme more on small businesses exporting to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets. The MYEFO decision and associated policy changes in this proposal will deliver annual savings of $25 million.


Labor calls them savings. They really are cuts and taxes. Failed policy is what it really is, and it is having an effect in this particular instance on our trading relations. This is not the first time I have spoken today; I have spoken a number of times, and a number of times I have spoken about particular bills as being cost savings—as in the baby bonus, on which I spoke earlier this evening. Again, these are to try to help the Treasurer, our failed Treasurer, to try to balance his books. And it is not working. The Australian public are not fools; they are not buying it. The fact is that this government cannot properly fiscally manage our economy. And so many people I speak to cannot wait for the next election.


The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partially supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports of Australian-produced goods and services, which are, as I say, so important for our balance-of-trade figures. The EMDG Scheme reimburses up to half of eligible export promotion expenses incurred by small- to medium-sized enterprises, and then the claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the particular cap. Around 5,100 enterprises per year apply for these grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped at $150 million per year since 1997, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied.


The MYEFO decision late last year and associated policy changes in this bill are designed to deliver annual savings—again, that word 'savings'—of $25 million. According to Labor, the changes will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years' worth to eight years. We all know that this is not right; this is just typical Labor spin—typical Labor claptrap. This is more policy on the run. We cannot afford, as the member for Forrest indicated, to hurt our exporters—particularly at this time, when our balance-of-trade figures are not that good, and particularly at a time when our budget is so much in the red.


To offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an enlarged number of grants to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union are to be reduced. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted, and small businesses typically face fewer barriers to doing business—and that may be so. But, even though the Australian brand may well be known, why not promote it even more? Why is it necessary to keep cutting, to keep cost-shifting, to try to balance the Treasurer's failed books? And why is it that all the time the ones who are getting hit in the neck the most are Australian farmers, Australian exporters—the people who put food on our plates and on the plates of so many foreigners as well?


The government argues that the increased focus of the EMDG Scheme on emerging and frontier markets brings the EMDGS into closer alignment with Austrade's broader trade priorities following its review in 2011 and the government's Asian century policy agenda. I will just repeat that: 'Australia's broader trade priorities'.


As to what our trade priorities are or should be: the Prime Minister only last year, in quite a groundbreaking speech, actually, in Melbourne, talked about promoting and strengthening irrigation so that we could grow more food to tap into those Asian markets, but every single policy initiative by her side of government, the government that she leads, does just the opposite. I cannot understand it, nor can the citrus growers and cattle producers, nor can those wonderful lamb producers in the Riverina, who grow the best lamb in the entire nation. They cannot understand it.


They simply cannot understand why this government is doing everything in its power to just stymie them whenever they try to develop export markets, to stymie them whenever they try to have the ability to grow more food to feed our nation and others. It is hurting our balance-of-trade figures. It is hurting our ability to do business in export markets such as Indonesia. And it is hurting our farmers' and agricultural producers' ability to make a profit.


And, when the farming sector is doing it tough, regional towns are doing it tough. You do not have to go too far into my electorate to see how tough they are doing it. Farmers are having to work at two jobs—they are having to source off-farm incomes—simply because there has been bad water policy enacted by this parliament. This government is just so bogged down in green tape. I know there has been a divorce between Labor and the Greens, but still they seem to be in cahoots with one another when it comes to policy, because so much of the policy that we see from that side of government is bogged down in green tape and so often we hear the Greens leader, Senator Milne, make the catchcry and Labor just follow suit. Their policies just follow suit, and it has to stop.


It has to stop because our farmers are the world's best. Our farmers are not asking for a handout; they are just asking for a hand up, a bit of assistance, a bit of an even go, a bit of a level playing field—something that I am sure that the parliamentary secretary for agriculture knows also. I know he has offered to come to my electorate, and I will welcome him soon to come and see for himself and to talk to the sorts of people whom I talk to, because I know he would be interested. I serve on the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, and I know the good work that he did there as the deputy chair. I know he certainly has his heart in the right place. I would certainly welcome him to come to the Riverina to hear firsthand from people. This piece of legislation is not good, and it will hurt our exporters. They are extremely valuable people. I will certainly welcome the member for Braddon to come to my part of the world, hear the sorts of complaints people have and hear of the sorts of ways forward they believe we should be adopting and the sorts of policy initiatives that his government could also be implementing to help them to make ends meet and to help them not just to survive but indeed to thrive as they should. Thank you for allowing me to make those comments, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (21:14):  I rise tonight to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 and also to support the amendments moved by the deputy leader and member for Curtin. Just by way of background, the export market development grants scheme is administered by Austrade and it partly supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost the exports of Australian produced goods and services. It is a scheme that reimburses up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenditure incurred by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial years, pro rata, up to the cap. Around 5,100 firms applied for grants.


The basic provisions of this bill—and what it actually does—exclude expenses of export promotion for grant years six, seven and eight for the major markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union. It makes a tokenistic adjustment by increasing the number of grants by one year—just one year against eight—to countries of East Asia. First and foremost, this bill is simply confirmation of yet another broken promise by this Labor government. We can add this one to the long, long list of broken promises by this government. It is just another reason why the public no longer believes a word that they say and why the public has lost complete trust in anything that comes out of the mouth of any member of this government.


We will go back to 2007: this Labor government, then in opposition, promised hand on heart that they would increase—that is right: increase—funding for the export market development scheme. They told us how they understood this scheme, how it was vital for small business and how they were really going out there to help small business with their exports. In the last year of the Howard government, 2006-07, the export market development scheme was funded to the tune of $154.4 million—it was $154.4 million back in 2006-07. Come to this financial year, and we have a government that told us they would increase funding. They have not only been too lousy to maintain real expenditure, they have actually slashed the expenditure by $25 million. So this financial year, the expenditure is down to just $125 million.


This is the lowest amount of expenditure under this scheme for over two decades. It simply shows that Labor cannot be trusted with their promises, but not only that: whatever they promise, we see them doing the exact opposite. We saw them promise, 'No carbon tax.' We not only ended up with a carbon tax, but we ended up with the largest carbon tax in the world. They promised to stop the boats and we have ended up with an absolute explosion of boat arrivals. They promised to return the budget to surplus, but we just get larger and larger deficits. Here we had them promising to increase expenditure for the export market developments and what do we see? It is being slashed—slashed to the lowest levels in decades.


It is not only that, it is the hypocrisy that we have had from this government. On this bill, we have had one measly speaker from the government. I see the member for McEwan over there. Perhaps he is going to stand up and make a contribution to this bill.




Mr Mitchell:
  You are hopeless!




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I think he is perhaps too embarrassed to walk around the exporters in his electorate and have to tell them that his government is cutting the funding for export development grants. What we have seen is not only the hypocrisy, it is the spin. They do not come in here and just be truthful, and say: 'Look, we have stuffed things up. We have wasted billions of dollars and we have to make some cuts.' Instead of saying that, what we get is this spin with the bill being dressed up as somehow tied to promotion in the Asian Century.


As ACCI have argued, there is no credible commercial analysis that shows export development grant money spent in the USA, Canada or the EU is any less valuable than that spent in East Asia, Africa or South America. It should be up to our Australian businesses to decide where they should spend their export marketing dollar, but those decisions are now going to be distorted by this government. It is not based on good policy or sound logic, but simply on spin. I would say, however, that there is perhaps one area in the world in which we as a nation need to increase our export marketing expenditure; that is Indonesia, following the debacle of this government's cut to the live cattle exports. Overnight, without any warning at all, they simply cut off the supply of live cattle to Indonesia. That has done almost irreparable damage to our relationship with Indonesia. If we are looking to increase our export marketing expenditure, Indonesia is perhaps one of the first places where we should start.


Not only is this spin, bad policy and broken promises: it is simply bad economics. Austrade undertook a study about the benefits of such schemes. They found that firms benefiting from export market development grants spent more on export promotion than did other exporters. In fact, they estimated that the grants payment of $156 million resulted in those exporters spending an additional $147 million on marketing. What they estimated is that that extra marketing expenditure resulted in an extra $1.4 billion of export sales. For $156 million worth of expenditure under this scheme, we were able to achieve as a nation an increase in our export sales of $1.4 billion.


But it is actually better than that because, you have to remember, the grants are taxable. When you look at the net cost after the tax subsidy comes back, you are looking at a much greater multiplier. Austrade worked out that, in most industries, a mature exporter will generate in additional exports 15 to 25 times the grants paid to them. If we want to increase the revenue of this nation—if we are looking at how we are going to pay back this mob's debt, how we are going to fund the NDIS, how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for schools and how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for hospitals—we should be increasing the expenditure under this scheme, not cutting it back to record lows as this government is doing. This mob simply does not get it.


Also, we should be out there trying to create a culture of exporting and exporters. I know from my own experience. Before entering parliament, I had travelled and exhibited at trade shows in Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai. One thing I found at those trade shows was how generous other countries are, compared to Australia, and how small our scheme is. At these trade shows we were able to find out that, rather than being given 50 per cent of their expenditure by their government as Australian firms were, the companies from the UK that we were competing against were getting the whole lot subsidised by their government. So the scheme we have is very modest to start with, and this mob is just cutting it back again.


This government is also kicking exporters when they are down. Australian exporters are currently struggling with the high level of the dollar. And they were promised a tax cut by this government, funded by the mining tax. We know where that has gone.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  You have not got any money for it; that is the reason. You have not got any money to fund it; you have wasted it all. It was a concocted mining tax. You blokes were played off the break. It was a complete embarrassment to your lot. So not only were our exporters promised a company tax which has not eventuated but many of them are facing downturns in our export markets. And they are also struggling with the world's largest carbon tax. Under this Labor government, energy costs for Australian firms have risen faster than just about anywhere else in the world. This is putting Australian industry, and our exporters, at a competitive disadvantage. This is the very worst time to be cutting back their funding—and that is exactly what this government is doing.


We have to ask ourselves: why are they doing this? Why are they cutting back? Why are they slicing back money for export market development? It is because of their waste and mismanagement. This mob has run up the four largest deficits in our nation's history. To spin their way out of it they came up with the line 'returning the budget to surplus'. And one of the cuts they came up with was to cut back this very important scheme which we need to keep our economy going—a measly $25 million. It is interesting to see what industry experts say about these cuts. Warren Cross, a legal expert and director of a firm called Export Incentives, is quoted in Smart Company magazine as saying, 'It's frustrating and disappointing this scheme has been put on the chopping block again by Labor,' and he argues that the trade minister, Dr Emerson, 'does not have a clue'. I could not agree more. He also says of our trade minister: 'He has never been interested in the scheme from day one, so this isn't a surprise. They've been cutting this grant back for years.' That just about says it all.


But we should look at the important amendments moved by our deputy leader. Those amendments clearly denote the problems with this bill. We need to have another review of this scheme and, if the funding is available, we need to try and help develop our culture of exporting. The coalition in the past has funded this scheme at far greater levels than what the current government are doing. When the coalition government left office we had $150 million in the scheme. The current government are reducing that to $25 million. Again, that is the complete opposite of what they promised.


If we are going to move our country forward, if we are going to start paying the debt, a debt that we have to pay back, with interest, it is going to cost this nation $267 million a week, every week of the year, for the next 20 years. That is the funding that we have to find. We are looking at trying to find $8 billion to $10 million to fund the NDIS, which this mob on the other side loves to talk about but does not have a clue how we are going to fund. And we talk about the Gonski education reforms. To fund these things, we have to encourage exporters, we have to get our exporters out there. We make great products in Australia. That is the reason this scheme works. We want the government to encourage firms to get out there and get involved in exporting. We should not be cutting this scheme back. To cut the number of years back for the USA, for Canada and for the EU is completely the wrong direction. We should be looking at uncapping years. You cannot have just five years for marketing a product overseas. And we have to remember that these grants are not given per product, they are given per firm. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (20:19):  At the outset, I must say that the coalition has grave reservations about the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013, but, due to the disastrous budget mismanagement of this government, we do not believe that we can oppose this bill, which is principally designed to cut the level of funding for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, because this is a savings measure. However, we do condemn the government for this outcome, and I will be moving a second reading amendment which notes that the coalition, should we be elected to government, commits to reviewing the changes in this bill to establish their true budgetary and administrative impact on business, especially small and medium enterprises, who need the support of this scheme in order to grow their export oriented businesses.


The changes proposed in the bill are to implement the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to deliver annual savings of $25 million. That is how dire the budget situation has become. This government, which has run up over $260 billion in gross debt, now has to look for savings in the order of $25 million a year out of this scheme. The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partly supports the export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports, to grow our economy in Australian produced goods and services. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the cap. My understanding is that about 5,100 enterprises per year apply for grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped for many years at $150 million per annum, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied. 


According to the government, the changes in this bill will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years worth to eight years. The government believes that this offers Australian small- and medium-sized exporters a slightly longer and more commercially realistic period to become established in these markets. However, to offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an increased number of grants to East Asian and emerging and frontier markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union is to be reduced. I believe that the 21st century should be known as 'the global century' and that Australia, as a global nation with global interests, should not only be looking to East Asia but also be continuing to pursue opportunities for our exporters in established markets. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted and small businesses would typically face fewer barriers to doing business. 


The bill provides for the reduction in the number of grants for these markets from a maximum of seven years of annual grants to only five years. So, in effect, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness is telling Australian exporters that he knows how to run their businesses better than they do. He knows through who knows what business experience that the US market is bad but the Asian market is good. The fact is that the minister for trade does not have a clue. If the minister for trade thought the Asian market was so vital, why did he do virtually nothing to stop the government's disgraceful ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia? The government claims that it is seeking to introduce this bill now to avoid creating considerable uncertainty for small businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements which become operational on 1 July 2013. 


The coalition has consulted key stakeholder groups, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Export Council of Australia—both oppose the expenditure cut and have asked that the coalition oppose the bill. We have agonised over this decision because we agree with them that the EMDG scheme under a competent government is a fine scheme and it has helped Australian exporters over many decades, and we believe it should not be cut in this way. However, recognising the dire state of this government's upcoming budget, recognising the dire state of the debt situation that this government has plunged Australia into and in the interests of our wider budget management policy, it is felt that we cannot oppose the expenditure cuts. But we note that this is yet another blow to business caused by the budget mismanagement and fiscal recklessness of the Gillard government.


When in doubt a Labor government will default to kicking the business community. The former trade union bosses and their lawyers who form the Labor Party just do not get business, especially small business. Labor cries crocodile tears about job security, but does not acknowledge or appreciate that it is the business community that is the engine room for job security—the businesses that take the risks to find new markets to grow their businesses. It is business that employs workers and creates and provides jobs. So, this blow to the EMDG scheme is just another example of Labor not understanding business and its needs. It is fair to say that since 2007 Labor has made a complete mess of the EMDG scheme. Soon after taking office Labor expanded the scheme by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $15,000 to $10,000, increasing the number of grants from seven to eight and increasing the maximum grant from $150,000 to $200,000—all well and good, if you can believe them. The cost of these changes was estimated at $50 million a year, but then—and this is the key—Labor increased funding only for the year 2009-10. So, in June 2010 Labor then amended the scheme to essentially reverse the 2008 implementation of its election commitments. Why should we have been surprised?


In the past the coalition has made commitments to increase the funding levels of the EMDG scheme. We believe it is a good scheme. While this remains a long-term goal, we believe the export sector would benefit more from a coalition government making its first priority the abolition of the carbon tax, then the mining tax, the reduction in Labor's debt and the reversal of Labor's fiscal mismanagement. In terms of the detail of the legislation, I am advised that industry representatives have various concerns about the potential exclusion of some types of activities—for example, the promotion of musical concerts. While these are a matter for debate, the bottom line is that many of these exclusions would appear to have been made because of cost cutting. The principal change that has attracted most attention is the cutting of grants available to established markets like the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada with some of the savings used to fund increased grants, principally in the East Asian region. The rest of the savings go to consolidated revenue, although we do not have a breakdown on the composition of that—so, again, another warning sign.


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argues that there is no credible commercial analysis provided that shows that the EMDG money spent on established markets is any less valuable than that spent in emerging markets. I agree and the coalition agrees that it should be up to Australian business to exploit markets according to commercial realities, rather than bureaucratic whim. The minister who introduced this bill, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, has one of the worst track records of any trade minister in modern history in terms of achieving for exporters. There has barely been any progress at all in trade negotiations by this minister. He has cut the vitally important EMDG scheme. He stood by idly when the Gillard government trashed our trade relations with Indonesia over the live cattle export fiasco and trashed our reputation as a trusted and reliable trading partner. The Australia-China Free Trade Agreement has barely moved from the starting point of negotiations that occurred under the Howard government in 2005. New Zealand also started negotiations with China in the same year and concluded their free trade agreement by 2008. In particular there has been stalled progress with respect to the free trade agreement with South Korea. Again, where is the practical concern with boosting our trade with Asia, when the government cannot finalise an agreement with one of our friendliest trading partners? 


The National Farmers Federation has been particularly vocal about this export issue. Last week, along with representatives of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Industry Council and the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the President of the National Farmers, Mr Jock Laurie, said: 


Australian beef producers stand to miss out on $1.4 billion in exports to Korea because of our stalled free trade agreement.


He went on to say:


… the threat to other agriculture exports like wheat (around $350 million) and dairy (over $100 million) was also pronounced.


Further he stated that:


Total losses to Australian agriculture could run into the multi billions of dollars. Australian farmers are losing out in a major way while ever we don’t have an FTA with Korea and our major competitors like the USA do.


The beef industry provides a classic example. The National Farmers Federation notes that: 


Under the current arrangements, Australia’s $645 million annual beef trade with Korea is subject to a 40 per cent tariff.


However, after signing a Korea-US FTA, United States beef is subject to only a 34.6 per cent tariff, 5.3 per cent less than Australian beef. But the differential will become massive as time goes by since US beef exports to Korea will be completely tariff free by 2026. 


This government has publicly admitted that a key sticking point is its unilateral veto of what are called investor-state dispute settlement clauses. The Howard government used the potential inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement clause as a negotiating position for bilateral agreements and so such clauses were included in some of Australia's FTAs concluded under the Howard government, as well as in the one with ASEAN and in the free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore and Thailand. But they were not included in others—for example, the FTAs with the United States and New Zealand. Inclusion of such clauses should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 


It is true to say that the Australian business community does not have a united view on the matter. However, in 2011 the Gillard government stated that they were opposed to investor-state dispute settlement clauses, despite the previous inclusion of such clauses in the Chile and ASEAN agreements finalised since 2007. In contrast, the coalition remains open, as a negotiating position, to including ISDS clauses. The fact is that the EMDG cut is just another blow in the general mismanagement of our export trade. 


We are also concerned by the extra regulatory burden which will be placed on exporters by the changes to the EMDG scheme. Should we be elected to government, we are determined to cut red tape and overregulation. This bill is just another example of this government making changes which will lead to additional red tape and regulation.


In conclusion, therefore, I move:


That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) condemns the Government for breaking its 2007 election promise to increase spending on the Export Market Development Grant (EMDG) scheme and instead cutting the program over the course of the last 5 years;


(2) notes that the cuts to the EMDG scheme:


(a) are directly due to the budget mismanagement of the Government and its wasteful expenditure policies; and


(b) represent further evidence of the Government’s inability to understand the plight of Australian exporters as they meet huge challenges in the quest to build their international markets;


(3) expresses concern that the Government has introduced increased red tape in the administration of the EMDG scheme when what is required across the Government is a reduction in red tape; and


(4) recognises that the Coalition, when in government, commits to reviewing the changes in the bill to establish their true budgetary and administrative impact on business, especially small and medium enterprises.”

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:33):  I support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. Having listened to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party's arguments and her reasons for putting forward her amendment, I am not at all persuaded by them nor do I believe they are worthy of the support of this House.


The Export Market Development Grants scheme is an Australian government financial assistance program which assists and encourages small- and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses above $10,000, provided that the total expenses are at least $20,000. To date, the program has provided up to seven grants to each eligible applicant. To access the scheme for the first time, businesses need to have spent $20,000 over two years on eligible export marketing expenses. To be eligible, the Australian business must have income of not more than $50 million in the grant year and must have promoted the export of goods—most services also qualify—the export of intellectual property and know-how, inbound tourism or conferences and events held in Australia.


There are eight key provisions of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. The first is to increase the maximum number of grants to eight. The second is to exclude expenses relating to the promotion of sales to the markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union in grant years six, seven, and eight for all applicants except approved bodies. The third key provision is to remove the limit on administrative expenditure from the legislation and introduce a power for the minister to set the limit on administrative expenditure by determination. The fourth is to prevent further approval of joint ventures after 30 June 2013. Fifthly, the provisions of the bill remove event promoters from the EMDG scheme. Sixthly, the provisions of this amendment bill prevent the payment of grants engaging an EMDG consultant who has been assessed to be not a fit and proper person. The seventh change will enable a grant to be paid more quickly where a grant is determined before the l July following the so-called 'balance distribution date'. Lastly, the bill will require applicants to acquit claims by individually paying for claimed expenses.


The government's white paper, Australia in the Asian century, makes very clear the importance of Asia in Australia's future and the opportunities that Asia's development in the 21st century holds for Australia. In recent years the pace of growth and change in the Asian region has been nothing short of phenomenal. According to the white paper, in the past 20 years China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy and increased their absolute economic size six times over. By 2025, the region as a whole will account for almost half of world output.


The white paper also takes a close look at what Asia's future means for Australia and at the opportunities for us in the years ahead. As an advanced economy with expertise in so many areas, including education, construction, business, entertainment, tourism, health and the environment, Australia is extremely well placed to strengthen its ties with Asia. It is in Asia and developing countries in other parts of the world that our future markets lie and that is where Australia should focus its efforts. The government recognises that and so do Australian businesses—it is an obvious reality—and that is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. 


Asia has a population of around four billion and it is already a market we should be tapping into much more than we have done to date. We have good links with Asia, established as a result of not only our proximity to many Asian countries but also the links that we have formed with many Asian countries—links that will hold us in good stead when we want to do more business with them in the future. These links result in two-way trade, and they are links that the Asia white paper quite properly says our future should be based on. Our future lies in Asia and the emerging countries, because the people of those countries are wanting to bring their standard of living into line with those of advanced economies. That is where the opportunities will lie. Those countries are the ones that will be wanting to tap into the expertise that already exists in Western countries and in particular the expertise that exists in friendly Western countries like Australia. 


This is well understood by business in Australia. In my own electorate, I frequently speak to business people who are already doing business in Asian markets but who are looking to expand their business. On many occasions they have come to my office to seek assistance to further their business in Asian markets and in the Asian countries we have relationships with. For many small- and medium-size businesses, who do have great ideas and who see obvious opportunities in Asia, without assistance their ideas will never be put into practice. Many of the people I speak to need assistance and they come to my office to see what assistance is available from the government. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an ideal way of providing that very assistance so that they can bring their initiatives to fruition.


I have no doubt at all that this legislation, and the scheme more broadly, has been welcomed by the business community. Those who say that it is wrong for us to cut back the focus on the USA, Canada and Europe are short-sighted. The reality is that business in Australia today has limited opportunities in those places, for many reasons and not the least of which is that those countries do not require the kinds of services that I alluded to earlier to the same extent as the emerging markets do—and those emerging markets are best located for us in the Asian area, as well as other places in the world where developing countries are looking to prosper. 


The amendments contained in this legislation ensure that the Australian people—Australian businesses—get the best return for the public funds provided by the government under this program. The Australian people will get the best returns because the best return for their funds is gained by focusing on the emerging opportunities in the Asian market. As I said a moment ago, this focus will benefit the very businesses that are seeking to access those funds.


My understanding is that there will be a saving of about $25 million per annum as a result of these changes. Frankly, the government is responsible for the expenditure of public funds and it ought to use those funds prudently. If we can manage funds better and still support business, then quite frankly we should be doing so. Reviewing legislation such as this on a regular basis is simply part of being a prudent government. I understand that in 2012-13 over 3,000 claims have been made under this scheme, and I understand that about $125.4 million has been allocated in the current budget. Those are not insignificant amounts of money, and those funds will assist Australian businesses. 


In more recent weeks I have spoken with businesses in my electorate who have brilliant ideas—in some cases they are brilliant inventions—and they are simply seeking some support and assistance to get those ideas and inventions out to the wider market. These are inventions that will be embraced and adopted particularly in those countries that we refer to as the emerging or developing countries. Yet, these businesses are quite often restrained by a lack of financial support. This program is the kind of program that provides them with the right sorts of support and certainly it is the kind of program that will enable them to send their ideas offshore. The people offshore also benefit because they are the beneficiaries of intellectual property, knowhow or whatever it is that is brought to them as a result of someone's idea here in Australia. 


Lastly, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in her remarks alleged that these amendments mean more red tape. As I said earlier on, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that public funds are spent wisely, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that no-one rorts the system and it is incumbent on any government to ensure that taxpayers get the best possible value for their dollars. Cutting out people like promoters—promoters of entertainment events; concerts and the like—is quite reasonable. Promoters are not, in my view, the beneficiaries for which this fund was set up. As a result of promotional activity you might get some economic benefit through the impact on tourism and the like, but, frankly, I believe there are much more worthy and much more deserving areas where these grants should be applied, and the decision by the government to tighten the rules in respect of some of those matters is quite appropriate. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:45):  I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for trade, the member for Curtin, to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. It has long been said that Australia is an exporting nation, and this has never been more obvious than in Western Australia. According to state government figures, Western Australia contributed $122 billion of Australia's merchandise exports in 2011-12, a rise of five per cent on the previous year. This equates to 46 per cent of this nation's exports, which exceeds the combined contribution of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. So it is a significant export effort. Trade accounts for 53 per cent of Western Australian's gross state product, with the great majority, over 90 per cent, coming from the mining sector. However, the state is also a major agricultural exporter. In 2010-11, Western Australia produced over $6 billion of agricultural, fisheries and forestry merchandise, and, of this, $5 billion worth was exported. The vast majority of these products are going to Asia, due to Western Australia's natural geographical competitive advantage—its proximity to those Asian markets. With these key figures in mind, it must be obvious even to the most parochial eastern state members in this House that Western Australia is in fact an export powerhouse.


It is for this reason also that export assistance needs to have a Western Australian focus and create further opportunities. It is easy to be fooled into thinking that the west has only large multinational mining companies which are readily able to do their own marketing. Indeed, it might seem that our mining companies actually sell themselves—I know that some on the other side think this. There are, however, many smaller players, in a range of industries, that certainly deserve the support of the government.


The south-west of Western Australia, in particular, is an area of innovation and industry. Whilst we have a number of those same large exporters, such as Worsley Alumina, we also have a broad range and a large number of small suppliers exporting a wide variety of products. As I know well, the south-west, with a $16.8 billion regional economy of its own, is an economic engine room for the whole nation. The region derives most of its wealth from the mining and manufacturing sectors, which, latest figures show, produce $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. It is also a major exporter of agricultural products, as I said, from beef and dairy—some of the best dairy products in the world—to the finest of Margaret River and Geographe region wines. Some of these have found niche markets for their high-quality products, and it is this group that needs and deserves support. They are out there doing the hard yards. They are small businesses, frequently.


I note that the explanatory memorandum to this bill tells us in the outline that the bill 'helps achieve savings of $25 million per year'. However, the explanatory memorandum also notes, under 'Financial Impact':


Expenditure under the Act is set through annual Appropriation acts. A capping mechanism ensures that expenditure under the scheme is limited to the amount appropriated.


They are conflicting statements. That really tells us, the readers, that the government has once again engaged in what you could only call a surreptitious slashing of funds—and this time it is actually of industry support to those same small businesses that are seeking an export opportunity.


As was acknowledged at Senate estimates, this is another attempt by the Gillard government to hide the real budget position it will face in May. It is duplicitous of the government to attempt to hide this slashing of funding and to sanitise the explanatory memorandum. This bill is not about enhancing exports. It is not. It is about saving the government dollars at the expense of those same very innovative and keen Australian exporters that just need a bit of a hand along the way. This is at a time when the world remains almost on the edge of an economic precipice and when the value of the Australian dollar is crucifying Australian exporters. It is tough out there, and I do not know what the Australian government expects. If you are an exporter, it is a tough market. If you are an agricultural exporter, it is an even tougher market.


I saw some recent forecasts about the future of agriculture and agricultural exports, and they predicted even tougher times than we have now. I am concerned, as you would be, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, for the future of a lot of those exporters and the growers that supply them. I also noticed last week the economic forecasting by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences that indicated the Australian dollar is expected to stay at current levels—a particularly high level of at least US104c—and not return to parity until 2018. If that is not a great example of the pressure that Australian agricultural exporters are under, I do not know what is. Everyone in this House needs to think again, including the government, because, if this scenario proves to be accurate, the export sector in Australia is in for very rough times until 2018. The ability of both Europe and the US to survive their respective impending debt disasters will also have long-term impacts on the value of the exchange rate.


Now, there are optimistic economists demonstrating perhaps a bit of hubris at the moderate improvement in budget deficits in both of those areas, but the realist economists still recognise that those budgets are not actually in surplus but just a little bit less in deficit. This is the reality, and that tells us that the Australian dollar is not likely to weaken anytime soon. It is also a reality that this global generation generally continues to almost binge on debt. Those on the other side do the same thing. We heard today, in the debate on the MPI, about the government's $300 billion debt—the debt ceiling. Let us wait and see what is in the next budget. Government spending is increasing the burden on the next generation—spending today is taxing tomorrow. This government is leaving debt and deficit for the next generation. The next generation in Europe and the US will have to pay off the debts of their parents or simply pass them on with their own added debt to some future generation to take care of. In this parliament there has also been a passing on of intergenerational debt, perhaps for the first time in this nation's history. That is an indictment of this government.


Australian exporters may recover if the US dollar improves, but there is another element of the export debate that needs to be addressed here in the House today. It is the failure of the government, through Austrade, to adequately enhance the export capacity and opportunity of Australian manufacturers and producers. It should be core business for Austrade to help our small businesses into the markets. Austrade has a number of workers both domestically and overseas who are struggling with poor resourcing—and poor leadership, in some senses. The bill before the House does not improve this situation; it makes it worse. Another $25 million cut from services currently provided is part of the government's death by 1,000 cuts of export innovation, and it is death particularly to small exporters. I—like, I would bet, just about every member in this House—have had such exporters at my door saying: 'All we need is a hand. We need to get into these markets, but we are a relatively small business and we are doing it tough on the ground.' I think it entirely escapes this government how tough it is on the ground, particularly for food manufacturers and exporters and even more particularly for those in the agricultural sector.


Austrade appears to be too bogged down covering for the government's incompetence to do its own job properly. It might surprise the Prime Minister and the trade minister to learn that the role of Austrade is to promote Australian exports, not to promote the Prime Minister and the minister for trade. Austrade needs to promote small to medium enterprises—and even some of the bigger enterprises—not only in my electorate but also around Australia. Such businesses are investing their own money and their own expertise, and they are working overtime not just for themselves but also for their communities, for the regions and for our economy. They are alive and well in our part of the world but are doing it exceptionally tough, and often all they need is a small hand up.


A refocusing of Austrade is really urgent and essential so that our own exporters, rather than this government, can become the main agenda again. Austrade should be focused on our small to medium exporters who are out there wanting to get into the markets and provide some fabulous niche products. This refocusing is so urgent and essential because of the difficult economic times in which Austrade is operating. Austrade's job has got far harder since 2008. Things are also harder for our exporters, and we should all acknowledge how much harder they have got. The difficult economic times make it all the more important for our businesses to work smarter and to invest more wisely, and to do so some of them need assistance. Now is not the time to hang our exporters out to dry. Look at the terms of trade, look at what is happening on the ground, look how hard exporters are working and look how hard it is now that we do not have the numbers of tourists that we used to have coming to our part of the world. That is why it is important for Australian businesses to have access to export markets.


But the government is hanging exporters out to dry. It will probably take the election of a coalition government to end the rot and develop a focus on exports to assist small to medium enterprises and some of the bigger businesses. A coalition government will seek to look after the interests of exporters and innovators. We need to celebrate and support what they are doing, not celebrate and support the failing government we have here. The coalition will work for enhanced access for Australian businesses to world markets. We in the coalition understand very directly the importance of doing this work. If we are elected, we will do this work in conjunction with the private sector, and the private sector will also focus, I have no doubt, on marketing and market access.


In some sectors, both sides of the public-private partnership have abandoned the field. Both need to re-engage, and we in this place need to be part of the re-engagement. Nowhere will re-engagement be more important than in the agricultural sector. When you get out into the wheat belt in Western Australia, you see how tough farmers are doing it. There are the same challenges in my electorate. Right across Australia I see the same challenges. Farmers are finding it extremely difficult to remain viable. It is a huge challenge, as is the challenge of keeping enough young farmers coming through who have the knowledge, expertise and passion to continue doing what our farmers do so well.


We need to know what the Asian market is looking for. We know that we can produce the best quality food products in the world—we are good at it—but we also need to make sure that we have the capacity to deliver what established and emerging Asian markets are looking for. A coalition government would make sure that it sufficiently developed and supported access to these markets for Australian exporters.


This government has repeatedly failed farmers in Australia. This fact is as tangible as it could be. One of the main examples of the government's failure would have to be its actions on the live export trade. The impacts of the government's actions are being felt all up and down the chain in each state—and certainly in my electorate in south-west Western Australia. The impacts of the government's actions are major, even though the government chooses to ignore them. If you want to talk about impacts on exports, just look at the live cattle export debacle. It is just one example of how this government has failed farmers in Australia. It has also failed our food producers and food manufacturers. Australian farmers are certainly capable of delivering the products that the market not only demands but also deserves. Now is not the time to abandon Australian farmers.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:59):  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you come from Maranoa and know how important the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 is to you. I am interested that the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is at the table, along with the former Speaker, the member for Scullin. I also note that the member for McEwen, who is another regional member, is sitting in the chamber, listening intently to my words. I also acknowledge the member for Wright, as well as the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional health, who is also sitting at the table. He was in Wagga Wagga just last week and would have no doubt heard many farmers complaining about how difficult the terms of trade are for them at the moment. It is always wonderful to follow the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, because she is so passionate and feisty about all of these important issues, which are central to trade. I know that the members in the House at the moment all appreciate just how important trade, agriculture and Australia's future food security are.


I note how few Labor speakers are on the speakers list. That is a shame, because perhaps if we were talking about unions or public servants at risk of losing their jobs—one of those sorts of issues—the speakers list would be full. It is just a shame that the speakers list is not full with government members talking about this very important issue, because we have just heard the member for Forrest talking about just how hard and how tough our agriculture producers are doing it at the moment. The shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Calare, told us yesterday in our party room that producers are doing it tougher in some circumstances than they were at the height of the drought—and that is a problem. And it is not just a problem for them; it is a problem for the regional communities that their hard work underpins. It is a problem for our nation because we cannot sell the amount of food that we rely on to help our balance of payments figures, our balance of trade.


We cannot continue to operate this way. Those farmers, let us face it, were once the backbone of this economy, and they still keep it going. Agriculture is still such an important component. Mining may well be one of the big dollar earners, but agriculture helps our balance of payments no end, and we all like to eat food. Only last week I spoke to representatives from the Leeton citrus growers. This organisation has been going since 1942. They are doing it really tough at the moment. They have lost 150 growers in less than a decade. That is the loss of 300 wages. Their costs are now going through the roof. Their power costs are exorbitant and are not helped by the carbon tax. Their wages have not become any cheaper. The high Australian dollar is really killing them, as well as so many other agriculture producers. Bad water policy is just another thing which they are trying to contend with.


I note that the member for Wills is now the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and has been since 4 February 2013. It is an interesting position which the member for Wills finds himself in, given the fact that he was so stridently opposed to the live cattle export trade to Indonesia when that particular issue blew up after a Four Corners program. It was policy from this government based on a television program. It was a very savage knee-jerk reaction to a television program that saw the live cattle trade stop forthwith—bang—just like that, with no thought given to the cattle producers of Australia's west or north. Indeed, as the member for Forrest just indicated, the shock waves reverberated right throughout the cattle-producing industry and even beyond it. The markets in Wagga Wagga and elsewhere in the Riverina were affected because of it. There was a fear that they would not be able to export a lot of their cattle overseas and they would see them brought south. The people who built stock crates were also affected because orders were stopped.


I am pleased to say that the shadow minister for agriculture visited Indonesia last October, along with the opposition leader and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who has an intense interest in trade and certainly in helping our trading neighbours. The highlights of that trip were the sheer untapped potential, the member for Calare said, for our farm exports—and not just those of Northern Australia. The coalition took the extraordinary step of sending a delegation of senior shadow ministers to Indonesia because of the importance that this side of politics places on our northern neighbour as a valued trading partner—not somebody to whom we can just say, 'No more cattle.' They are not somebody whom we can just bring the gate down upon with our live exports but rather somebody whom we need to be friends with, somebody who is important to us, somebody whom we need to treat like a friend. You do not treat friends in the way that the Prime Minister did when she stopped the live cattle trade.


Indonesia has been vastly undervalued as a trading partner. While every nation across the globe is trying to capitalise on the Asian boom, there are a number of obvious reasons why Australia should be trying to make the most of the opportunities that exist within the Indonesian economy. Indonesia is not in great need of our coal because it has large deposits of its own, and some people foolishly dismiss Indonesia as a trading opportunity because of this. Australia has a unique opportunity to bolster our farm sector with Indonesia. It has 237 million people literally on our doorstep. It has a booming middle class of around 50 million strong and a high propensity for consumer spending. In short, it is an ideal destination for our farm produce. Our farm produce, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Maranoa, is the best in the world bar none. I do not mind saying that. I am sure the parliamentary secretary for agriculture, who is sitting at the table, would agree with me.




Mr Sidebottom:
  Hear, hear.




Mr McCORMACK:
  'Hear, hear,' he says. Certainly that is the case. We have the best in the world and we need to protect and preserve it.


The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 are to deliver on the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to concentrate the Export Market Development Grants Scheme more on small businesses exporting to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets. The MYEFO decision and associated policy changes in this proposal will deliver annual savings of $25 million.


Labor calls them savings. They really are cuts and taxes. Failed policy is what it really is, and it is having an effect in this particular instance on our trading relations. This is not the first time I have spoken today; I have spoken a number of times, and a number of times I have spoken about particular bills as being cost savings—as in the baby bonus, on which I spoke earlier this evening. Again, these are to try to help the Treasurer, our failed Treasurer, to try to balance his books. And it is not working. The Australian public are not fools; they are not buying it. The fact is that this government cannot properly fiscally manage our economy. And so many people I speak to cannot wait for the next election.


The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partially supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports of Australian-produced goods and services, which are, as I say, so important for our balance-of-trade figures. The EMDG Scheme reimburses up to half of eligible export promotion expenses incurred by small- to medium-sized enterprises, and then the claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the particular cap. Around 5,100 enterprises per year apply for these grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped at $150 million per year since 1997, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied.


The MYEFO decision late last year and associated policy changes in this bill are designed to deliver annual savings—again, that word 'savings'—of $25 million. According to Labor, the changes will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years' worth to eight years. We all know that this is not right; this is just typical Labor spin—typical Labor claptrap. This is more policy on the run. We cannot afford, as the member for Forrest indicated, to hurt our exporters—particularly at this time, when our balance-of-trade figures are not that good, and particularly at a time when our budget is so much in the red.


To offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an enlarged number of grants to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union are to be reduced. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted, and small businesses typically face fewer barriers to doing business—and that may be so. But, even though the Australian brand may well be known, why not promote it even more? Why is it necessary to keep cutting, to keep cost-shifting, to try to balance the Treasurer's failed books? And why is it that all the time the ones who are getting hit in the neck the most are Australian farmers, Australian exporters—the people who put food on our plates and on the plates of so many foreigners as well?


The government argues that the increased focus of the EMDG Scheme on emerging and frontier markets brings the EMDGS into closer alignment with Austrade's broader trade priorities following its review in 2011 and the government's Asian century policy agenda. I will just repeat that: 'Australia's broader trade priorities'.


As to what our trade priorities are or should be: the Prime Minister only last year, in quite a groundbreaking speech, actually, in Melbourne, talked about promoting and strengthening irrigation so that we could grow more food to tap into those Asian markets, but every single policy initiative by her side of government, the government that she leads, does just the opposite. I cannot understand it, nor can the citrus growers and cattle producers, nor can those wonderful lamb producers in the Riverina, who grow the best lamb in the entire nation. They cannot understand it.


They simply cannot understand why this government is doing everything in its power to just stymie them whenever they try to develop export markets, to stymie them whenever they try to have the ability to grow more food to feed our nation and others. It is hurting our balance-of-trade figures. It is hurting our ability to do business in export markets such as Indonesia. And it is hurting our farmers' and agricultural producers' ability to make a profit.


And, when the farming sector is doing it tough, regional towns are doing it tough. You do not have to go too far into my electorate to see how tough they are doing it. Farmers are having to work at two jobs—they are having to source off-farm incomes—simply because there has been bad water policy enacted by this parliament. This government is just so bogged down in green tape. I know there has been a divorce between Labor and the Greens, but still they seem to be in cahoots with one another when it comes to policy, because so much of the policy that we see from that side of government is bogged down in green tape and so often we hear the Greens leader, Senator Milne, make the catchcry and Labor just follow suit. Their policies just follow suit, and it has to stop.


It has to stop because our farmers are the world's best. Our farmers are not asking for a handout; they are just asking for a hand up, a bit of assistance, a bit of an even go, a bit of a level playing field—something that I am sure that the parliamentary secretary for agriculture knows also. I know he has offered to come to my electorate, and I will welcome him soon to come and see for himself and to talk to the sorts of people whom I talk to, because I know he would be interested. I serve on the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, and I know the good work that he did there as the deputy chair. I know he certainly has his heart in the right place. I would certainly welcome him to come to the Riverina to hear firsthand from people. This piece of legislation is not good, and it will hurt our exporters. They are extremely valuable people. I will certainly welcome the member for Braddon to come to my part of the world, hear the sorts of complaints people have and hear of the sorts of ways forward they believe we should be adopting and the sorts of policy initiatives that his government could also be implementing to help them to make ends meet and to help them not just to survive but indeed to thrive as they should. Thank you for allowing me to make those comments, Mr Deputy Speaker.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (21:14):  I rise tonight to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 and also to support the amendments moved by the deputy leader and member for Curtin. Just by way of background, the export market development grants scheme is administered by Austrade and it partly supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost the exports of Australian produced goods and services. It is a scheme that reimburses up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenditure incurred by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial years, pro rata, up to the cap. Around 5,100 firms applied for grants.


The basic provisions of this bill—and what it actually does—exclude expenses of export promotion for grant years six, seven and eight for the major markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union. It makes a tokenistic adjustment by increasing the number of grants by one year—just one year against eight—to countries of East Asia. First and foremost, this bill is simply confirmation of yet another broken promise by this Labor government. We can add this one to the long, long list of broken promises by this government. It is just another reason why the public no longer believes a word that they say and why the public has lost complete trust in anything that comes out of the mouth of any member of this government.


We will go back to 2007: this Labor government, then in opposition, promised hand on heart that they would increase—that is right: increase—funding for the export market development scheme. They told us how they understood this scheme, how it was vital for small business and how they were really going out there to help small business with their exports. In the last year of the Howard government, 2006-07, the export market development scheme was funded to the tune of $154.4 million—it was $154.4 million back in 2006-07. Come to this financial year, and we have a government that told us they would increase funding. They have not only been too lousy to maintain real expenditure, they have actually slashed the expenditure by $25 million. So this financial year, the expenditure is down to just $125 million.


This is the lowest amount of expenditure under this scheme for over two decades. It simply shows that Labor cannot be trusted with their promises, but not only that: whatever they promise, we see them doing the exact opposite. We saw them promise, 'No carbon tax.' We not only ended up with a carbon tax, but we ended up with the largest carbon tax in the world. They promised to stop the boats and we have ended up with an absolute explosion of boat arrivals. They promised to return the budget to surplus, but we just get larger and larger deficits. Here we had them promising to increase expenditure for the export market developments and what do we see? It is being slashed—slashed to the lowest levels in decades.


It is not only that, it is the hypocrisy that we have had from this government. On this bill, we have had one measly speaker from the government. I see the member for McEwan over there. Perhaps he is going to stand up and make a contribution to this bill.




Mr Mitchell:
  You are hopeless!




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I think he is perhaps too embarrassed to walk around the exporters in his electorate and have to tell them that his government is cutting the funding for export development grants. What we have seen is not only the hypocrisy, it is the spin. They do not come in here and just be truthful, and say: 'Look, we have stuffed things up. We have wasted billions of dollars and we have to make some cuts.' Instead of saying that, what we get is this spin with the bill being dressed up as somehow tied to promotion in the Asian Century.


As ACCI have argued, there is no credible commercial analysis that shows export development grant money spent in the USA, Canada or the EU is any less valuable than that spent in East Asia, Africa or South America. It should be up to our Australian businesses to decide where they should spend their export marketing dollar, but those decisions are now going to be distorted by this government. It is not based on good policy or sound logic, but simply on spin. I would say, however, that there is perhaps one area in the world in which we as a nation need to increase our export marketing expenditure; that is Indonesia, following the debacle of this government's cut to the live cattle exports. Overnight, without any warning at all, they simply cut off the supply of live cattle to Indonesia. That has done almost irreparable damage to our relationship with Indonesia. If we are looking to increase our export marketing expenditure, Indonesia is perhaps one of the first places where we should start.


Not only is this spin, bad policy and broken promises: it is simply bad economics. Austrade undertook a study about the benefits of such schemes. They found that firms benefiting from export market development grants spent more on export promotion than did other exporters. In fact, they estimated that the grants payment of $156 million resulted in those exporters spending an additional $147 million on marketing. What they estimated is that that extra marketing expenditure resulted in an extra $1.4 billion of export sales. For $156 million worth of expenditure under this scheme, we were able to achieve as a nation an increase in our export sales of $1.4 billion.


But it is actually better than that because, you have to remember, the grants are taxable. When you look at the net cost after the tax subsidy comes back, you are looking at a much greater multiplier. Austrade worked out that, in most industries, a mature exporter will generate in additional exports 15 to 25 times the grants paid to them. If we want to increase the revenue of this nation—if we are looking at how we are going to pay back this mob's debt, how we are going to fund the NDIS, how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for schools and how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for hospitals—we should be increasing the expenditure under this scheme, not cutting it back to record lows as this government is doing. This mob simply does not get it.


Also, we should be out there trying to create a culture of exporting and exporters. I know from my own experience. Before entering parliament, I had travelled and exhibited at trade shows in Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai. One thing I found at those trade shows was how generous other countries are, compared to Australia, and how small our scheme is. At these trade shows we were able to find out that, rather than being given 50 per cent of their expenditure by their government as Australian firms were, the companies from the UK that we were competing against were getting the whole lot subsidised by their government. So the scheme we have is very modest to start with, and this mob is just cutting it back again.


This government is also kicking exporters when they are down. Australian exporters are currently struggling with the high level of the dollar. And they were promised a tax cut by this government, funded by the mining tax. We know where that has gone.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  You have not got any money for it; that is the reason. You have not got any money to fund it; you have wasted it all. It was a concocted mining tax. You blokes were played off the break. It was a complete embarrassment to your lot. So not only were our exporters promised a company tax which has not eventuated but many of them are facing downturns in our export markets. And they are also struggling with the world's largest carbon tax. Under this Labor government, energy costs for Australian firms have risen faster than just about anywhere else in the world. This is putting Australian industry, and our exporters, at a competitive disadvantage. This is the very worst time to be cutting back their funding—and that is exactly what this government is doing.


We have to ask ourselves: why are they doing this? Why are they cutting back? Why are they slicing back money for export market development? It is because of their waste and mismanagement. This mob has run up the four largest deficits in our nation's history. To spin their way out of it they came up with the line 'returning the budget to surplus'. And one of the cuts they came up with was to cut back this very important scheme which we need to keep our economy going—a measly $25 million. It is interesting to see what industry experts say about these cuts. Warren Cross, a legal expert and director of a firm called Export Incentives, is quoted in Smart Company magazine as saying, 'It's frustrating and disappointing this scheme has been put on the chopping block again by Labor,' and he argues that the trade minister, Dr Emerson, 'does not have a clue'. I could not agree more. He also says of our trade minister: 'He has never been interested in the scheme from day one, so this isn't a surprise. They've been cutting this grant back for years.' That just about says it all.


But we should look at the important amendments moved by our deputy leader. Those amendments clearly denote the problems with this bill. We need to have another review of this scheme and, if the funding is available, we need to try and help develop our culture of exporting. The coalition in the past has funded this scheme at far greater levels than what the current government are doing. When the coalition government left office we had $150 million in the scheme. The current government are reducing that to $25 million. Again, that is the complete opposite of what they promised.


If we are going to move our country forward, if we are going to start paying the debt, a debt that we have to pay back, with interest, it is going to cost this nation $267 million a week, every week of the year, for the next 20 years. That is the funding that we have to find. We are looking at trying to find $8 billion to $10 million to fund the NDIS, which this mob on the other side loves to talk about but does not have a clue how we are going to fund. And we talk about the Gonski education reforms. To fund these things, we have to encourage exporters, we have to get our exporters out there. We make great products in Australia. That is the reason this scheme works. We want the government to encourage firms to get out there and get involved in exporting. We should not be cutting this scheme back. To cut the number of years back for the USA, for Canada and for the EU is completely the wrong direction. We should be looking at uncapping years. You cannot have just five years for marketing a product overseas. And we have to remember that these grants are not given per product, they are given per firm. (Time expired)

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (21:30):  I rise to speak about the circus that visited Western Sydney last week on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, we had seen the show in Western Sydney before at the last election when at Rooty Hill the Prime Minister promised a series of things for Western Sydney that failed to be delivered in her term of office after she was elected. The Prime Minister promised to consult on climate change—remember the people's panel? She instead delivered a carbon tax. But more specifically the Prime Minister promised to give $2.1 billion for a transport link in Western Sydney—the Epping to Parramatta rail link. Now she has announced just this week that half of that money will be ripped away and there will be no Parramatta-Epping rail link.


This is not the first time that we have had rail line politics played by a federal or state Labor government in New South Wales. In fact, residents in Western Sydney have for 15 years put up with rail line politics from Labor governments. Not only was the north-west rail line promised four or five times in my electorate and then eventually scrapped; the Parramatta to Epping line was also promised by the Carr Labor government. It was promised and promised and then scrapped. It makes you wonder what the member for Parramatta, who has been in this place since 2004, has been doing to obtain the Parramatta to Epping rail line. Promise after promise, election after election, time after time they have been talking about it. I remember these promises and these talks happening over a decade. Now we have had the Prime Minister tell the people of Western Sydney that half of that money is going to go.


It does not stop there. The Prime Minister promised to build an NBN over two years later. I have spoken to many of the business parks across Western Sydney—the places where the NBN would be most effective. Don't you think that if you were building an NBN to provide speeds through fibre to the premises hundreds of times faster than you would start with the businesses and business parks in Western Sydney that could provide the most productive increases for the economy? Of course you would. That is exactly why this government and this Prime Minister have failed to connect the main business parks in Western Sydney. In fact, they have been wastefully sending it to marginal seats and various homes in those marginal seats in a desperate attempt to turn around their political fortunes but ignoring the very hub of the economy—business. If you do not connect businesses such as the business parks in Western Sydney, what real benefit are you getting out of the NBN?


It continued in the last seven days. It is interesting to contrast the approaches of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. We did not just turn up to Western Sydney in the last seven days. The Leader of the Opposition has indeed visited Western Sydney over 51 times since the last election. He has been meeting with real people. I am happy to say that I can walk down any street in the electorates of Lindsay, Parramatta and Greenway—anywhere in Western Sydney—with the Leader of the Opposition at any time and any day of the week. I do not think the Prime Minister could do the same. It is not because of this culture of politics that we are hearing about; it is because of decisions the Prime Minister has taken, like the promises to build rail lines that never come to fruition. They have been copying Liberal Party policy and the not promise but commitment to fund and help the O'Farrell government build the WestConnex. Not only is it a commitment; it will be delivered.


In the last week we saw the shameless attempt of this government to copy the policy. They are bereft of ideas. The desperate and damned over there have decided that all they have left to do is copy Liberal Party policy and take the funding from the promises they made last election that they have not delivered. It is pretty pathetic, and the people in Western Sydney see right through it.


Infrastructure is a key priority in Western Sydney, and it was the Howard government who built the last significant infrastructure, funded from a federal level, in the M7—a fantastic motorway that has provided a great benefit and an economic boost to Western Sydney. It will be the next Liberal government, whenever that is, that will deliver the WestConnex motorway, a vital piece of infrastructure for people in Western Sydney. It certainly will not be the Prime Minister and this Labor government, who have promised and promised it. Members in Western Sydney, whether they be the member for Lindsay, the member for Chifley, the member for Parramatta or the member for Greenway, ought really to stand up to this Prime Minister and cabinet and tell them that they do not want any more false promises or false dawns for the people of Western Sydney. They need to provide real commitments and real delivery and not this circus of stunts that we saw in the last seven days. The people of Western Sydney are like all the hardworking people in the outer suburbs all around this country and they can see through desperate attempts to pull the wool over their eyes.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (16:31):  Before I make my remarks in this particular bill, can I also join members and senators in this place in wishing Canberra a very happy birthday. I went to high school in Canberra, both to Campbell High and to the fantastic Dickson College where I finished very early on in the years when the college system began, and Dickson College is still a remarkable place of education in this city.


Today I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The intent of this bill is to improve the administration of the Higher Education Loan Program in line with some of the proposals put forward in the post-implementation review on VET FEE-HELP in 2011. The post-implementation review made a number of sound recommendations—a number of these were introduced to parliament last year—seeking to further increase the number of registered training providers who are eligible to offer VET FEE-HELP courses.


The coalition recognises the important role that income-contingent loans can play in vocational education. Under the Howard government, income-contingent loans were extended to full-fee-paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP in 2005, and they flowed through to the vocational sector to vocational education and training—that is, VET—to VET FEE-HELP in 2008. Of course, income-contingent loans under the previous name of HECS in higher education courses have been around for some 25 years.


Access to FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP has enabled thousands of Australians the chance to access an education that they might otherwise not have been able to do. It has enabled them the financial assistance that they need to fund the course of their choosing. But the reality is that the take-up rate of VET FEE-HELP has been well below expectations. There is a range of requirements that providers must meet in order to be able to offer VET FEE-HELP courses. Regrettably, these requirements have proven too onerous for the vast majority of providers. Of the approximately 2,000 providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. This places serious limitations on the ability of students to access income-contingent loans to fund their qualifications, and, as we know, the cost of those qualifications is increasing.


In 2012, a quarter of 20- to 24-year-olds were not in full-time education or work. So many of these young people, who are not currently in work or training, come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and they struggle to afford to study at all. Access to income-contingent loans in VET or higher education qualifications is crucial to assist these young people in finding a course of study and a career path by boosting equity of access and affording them the opportunity for a better life. There is also an economic argument in favour of increasing access to income-contingent loans. Many of the courses that could be funded by FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP are in areas of skill shortages, and we potentially have a future workforce impeded only by the cost of study.


In addition to the acknowledgment made in the post-implementation review regarding the low take-up of VET FEE-HELP, a number of recommendations were made to improve the overall administration of the Higher Education Loans Program. As a result of these recommendations, this bill seeks to achieve the following. Schedule 1 of this bill allows for the automatic revocation of a provider's registration as an approved higher education or vocational education provider, where the provider has either had their registration cancelled by the relevant tertiary regulator or been deemed unable to operate by a court of law. Schedule 2 of the bill will see providers able to change their name where there is no change of legal entity. As the system currently stands, if a provider changes the name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be reapproved as a new applicant. In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected, the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. This is a practical measure, avoiding additional red tape for providers.


Schedule 3 will enable the minister to issue compliance notices to providers who are failing to comply. Currently the only courses of corrective action available to the minister are to either suspend or evoke approval of a provider or to withhold payment. This schedule provides an alternative measure, ensuring that providers have an opportunity to undertake corrective action and continue to operate without the sanctions that previously were the only available measure and were extremely harsh. Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculations of HELP repayment thresholds. This has come about as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has decided to publish the average weekly earnings data on a biannual basis, shifting from quarterly. This will ensure that individuals can repay their HELP debt based on more accurately calculated repayment thresholds in accordance with the ABS data. The final amendment will see an update of the qualification definitions in the act to echo changes made to the Australian Qualifications Framework.


So, while we welcome this bill and the amendments that it puts forward, I think it is necessary to acknowledge that there have been few such successful measures in the VET space achieved by those opposite. The broader system suffers from an incredible overload of bureaucracy and red tape. We on this side of the House have made it clear that reducing red tape for business and bureaucracy is high on our agenda. The national partnership on VET reform may well be considered to have failed, given the lack of sign-up by three key states. It would be impossible for anyone who enters into the administrative and compliance aspects of vocational education and training in this country to not be completely bamboozled.


We in the coalition supported the extension of income contingent loans to the vocational ed sector, because we have a really strong record in making sure that those who would study vocational education as opposed to higher education—or, in the common lingo, TAFE and training versus university—should have access to exactly the same support, including financial support. But, if the government are serious about this, it has taken them a while to recognise the extraordinarily low take-up—112 providers out of 2,000 who are using the scheme. Although I do not have detailed information, I would suggest that in rushing through the initial piece of legislation there was a failure to follow up, there was a failure to listen and there was a failure to consult. And that failure is written large across the entire government. If the government had been tuned in to the needs of the providers of registered training, as they should have been, they would not have sat on their hands and said, 'Okay, three years later we'll just get the department to do a review and see what the review says.' So three years pass and no-one has any idea that the system is not working, even though the intention might have been good in the first place. As I said, this is the pattern we are seeing in the training arena from the current government time and time again.


We will be watching closely to see if the modest measures that will be achieved by this legislation, which of course we are entirely supportive of, actually make a difference. If they do not, I would suggest to the minister, who is a new minister in this space and a little more engaged than the previous one—and I do not mean that unkindly, but certainly the previous minister seemed to the sector to be rather hands-off—that the minister acts sooner rather than later to hang on to this valuable cohort of students and this valuable group of training providers.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:39):  I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The previous speaker talked about the great record of the coalition. She should go north of the Tweed and see the terrible and appalling record of the LNP state government in Queensland. To localise this particular bill, there are two examples from my electorate that I will give the member for Farrer if she wants to have a look at the impact of both sides of politics on education. The University of Southern Queensland is the first, where the Education Gateways Program, the capital infrastructure program, is getting nearly $49 million of federal government funding. More university students than ever are being funded by the federal government, hitting the Bradley target of 40 per cent of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds getting into university. More young people than ever are going to university. The University of Southern Queensland in Springfield has a broader reach and larger footprint than ever before. It is going ahead in leaps and bounds.


Up the road, however—in fact, beside it—are the Springfield campus and the Bundamba campus of Bremer TAFE. That TAFE is funded almost exclusively by the state LNP government. What have we seen there? Cutbacks to services, cutbacks to courses and cutbacks to funding. We have seen more barriers, more obstacles, being put in place to young people—particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds in the Ipswich and West Moreton region—getting access to higher education. We have gotten lectures from those opposite about education funding. Go to my electorate and you will see the difference between what a Labor government will do at a federal level in terms of tertiary education and what a coalition government will do in terms of vocational education and training.


I say to the member for Farrer: have a look at what the Howard government did in terms of VET education and what they failed to do. We saw fewer students than ever before going to university under them. More than 190,000 students have gone to university under us—more than ever. Have a look at what the coalition government in Queensland has done. She mentioned—and this is referred to in the explanatory memorandum of this bill—the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. These amendments contribute to our commitment given under that agreement. Why do I mention that? It is because the LNP government in Queensland signed up to that national agreement on skills reform.


The legislation before this chamber makes further improvements to HELP, including VET FEE-HELP, that were signed up to by various Australian governments. In my home state, the minister responsible for employment, training and education, John-Paul Langbroek, has said, 'We're not responsible for training; we are not responsible for tertiary.' The LNP state government has got a task force dealing with the students who go to the sorts of institutions in Queensland that this legislation relates to. Students who go to those TAFE institutions are having the number of campuses cut by that task force from about 82 to 44. In my electorate, we are seeing barriers and obstacles put in the way of students all the time. Courses are being cut. Those opposite come in here and lecture us about what they are doing and say that they will keep an eye on us. Keep an eye on our record, because our record when it comes to tertiary funding is very good compared to that of those opposite.


This legislation, as I said, is a result of COAG's national partnership agreement and is pursuant to recommendations made in the final report of the implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme back in September 2011. It also includes other amendments. What this is about is enhancing the quality and accountability of the whole education framework that underpins HELP by making sure that there can be an automatic revocation of providers in circumstances in which there is a risk to public moneys and a high risk to students. We are going to make sure that those educational institutes have integrity and character and can deliver what they say they can. We are going to strengthen the compliance framework underpinning HELP by making sure that a minister can provide a compliance notice to the provider of education services.


Why is this so important? It is important because these income-contingent loans are paid to those institutions to help eligible students with their tuition fees to make sure they can get assistance to get through those courses which will give them an opportunity in life and give them a leg-up to make sure they get financial security and achieve all they want in terms of their dreams, aspirations and goals. For kids from poorer backgrounds that is particularly important. If you are a kid from Basin Pocket and you went to the local state primary school, Ipswich East State Primary School, and your parents had never gone to high school or never gone on to university, the idea that you might be able to go somewhere like Bremer TAFE and get a trade or qualification is really critical. This is what this is about.


I mention that particular national partnership agreement on skills reform because this legislation comes out of that. What happened in Queensland as result of that? Guess what? There was a program in Queensland that was geared to helping students and geared toward helping the training of young people particularly—8½ thousand of them, according to the Deloitte Access Economics report in July last year—that actually provided assistance to those people who never would have got a job but for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program put in by the previous Labor government. They put $90 million towards it. Fifty-seven thousand people got jobs as a result of that program. The Queensland government, a week before the evaluation report came out—this is the government that signed up for the national partnership agreement here in April last year—decided they would get rid of this. They got rid of a program a week before the report came out. 


They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a report and guess what that report says? It says that 57,000 Queenslanders got jobs in vocational education training by the skilling that the previous government had undertaken. It said there was an additional $6.5 billion in state gross product and gross domestic product to 2020; an additional $1.8 billion in consumption in Queensland and Australia to 2020; an additional $1.2 billion in state tax receipts to Queensland by 2020. That is for $90 million of job training, particularly for disadvantaged people.


That is why we provide FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. If we have institutions that are not providing the services, we should clamp down on them. That is what this legislation is about. But why would you close down good institutions that are providing help for young people, particularly disadvantaged young people in my community like BoysTown, who were getting about $154,000; the Salvation Army Canaan School for Training and Development, who are getting $395,000 and $120,000 for two programs; or Worklinks, who got $128,000 for another program; or Riverview Employment and Learning Program through the Riverview Neighbourhood House Association, $147,000; or, indeed, Ipswich City Council, which also got $45,500 for its community literacy program; or Harvest Rain Adult Literacy Project, who got $95,000 for its community literacy program? Why would you close it down? Not a peep from those opposite about those sorts of programs. These are good programs. These people would never, ever get compliance notices by the minister under this legislation before the chamber, but the coalition in Queensland took the opportunity to close down the funding to good providers, taking away billions of dollars from the Queensland economy to save $90 million. The minister has the temerity in Queensland to say that he is not responsible nor is the government of Queensland responsible for training. He has got it in his title! Yet he takes the money away. They are persecuting working-class people in my community, putting barriers and obstacles to training in their way.


Good providers will not be affected by this legislation before the chamber. If they are bad providers, then they have compliance notices. We are improving the system, and what the Queensland government should do is reverse these stupid cuts that impact adversely on the Queensland economy and on people in my community. When it comes to Bremer TAFE, they should re-employ those people, put those programs back in place, and get with the program that we need to undertake to make sure that people get jobs, that the economy in Queensland remains sound, and that the unemployment rate can be reduced. So far, we have seen it go up—up, up and up—under the LNP government, all for its obsession for so-called cuts. There has not been a peep, a word or a whisper from any of those opposite. We had sanctimonious unction from the previous speaker about this sort of thing. Come to my electorate and see what your comrades and colleagues in the LNP are doing.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:50):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh. The Canberra celebrations have been all too much for you. Congratulations, too. It was a wonderful centenary function this morning and I know you participated with the member for Canberra. Indeed, today is a very important day for Canberrans. Canberrans also understand the need, the necessity and the importance of higher education. Canberra perhaps has more people with degrees per capita than any other capital city in Australia. We know how important a good education is; it is the great enabler.


I take issue with the previous speaker, the member for Blair, for his criticism of the shadow minister and, as he called it, her being sanctimonious on the issue. I listened very closely to the member for Farrer, my neighbouring electorate colleague, and I did not think she was sanctimonious at all. In fact, I thought she gave quite a good account of the bill. You would almost think that the coalition was not supporting this legislation from the way the member for Blair has just carried on. Once again, like so many Labor members opposite, he has tried to introduce state issues into what is a federal matter. If he wants to talk about state matters, he only needs to think about the Victorian election in November 2010, New South Wales in March 2011, Queensland in March 2012, the Northern Territory in August 2012, and Saturday's Western Australian election to see that many of the things that his government offers are not in the best interests of this nation and are being rejected by the voters at the ballot box. He should be very careful when he tries to introduce those state issues into what is a federal matter.


The federal matter before us is the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. You would almost think that we as a coalition were opposing this bill from the sentiments that the member for Blair expressed and the condemnatory way—the virtual assault—in which he described the things we are proposing and the sorts of things that state governments are doing. These are not even in line with what this legislation is about because those are state matters.


A post-implementation review of vocational education and training—the Higher Education Loan Program: VET FEE-HELP—was undertaken in 2011. This bill seeks to introduce some of the recommendations made. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enable the strengthening of compliance and accountability frameworks for VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP loans. The amendments also improve transparency between the tertiary education regulators and allow for more efficient administrative arrangements when changing business entity names of approved providers. So, there, I agree with what is proposed. The coalition is in support of what is being proposed. I am really at a loss to understand why the member for Blair continued his rant in the way that he did.


In 2005, income contingent loans were extended to full-fee paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP under the Howard coalition government. In 2008, income contingent loans were extended to the vocational education sector in the form of VET FEE-HELP. These loans ensure students wishing to pursue a vocation can be provided with financial assistance similar to that on offer to university students through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The Howard Liberal-Nationals government recognised the importance of vocations and higher education and of enabling people to have the assistance they require, through tertiary and vocational supporting programs, to get the best job and realise their full potential. Certainly it was done then. The Labor government now says it is doing the same. When it comes up with a proposal or a plan that the coalition can see will be beneficial to those people looking to better themselves, we are in agreement with it. The loan may cover or partially cover the tuition costs for the VET course, however, VET FEE-HELP is not available for Certificates I to IV and students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level, which is $49,096 for 2012-13.


In order for students to be able to access these loans, their registered training organisation needs to have approval to offer VET FEE-HELP. The eligibility criteria for offering VET FEE-HELP includes a provider being a body corporate with the principal purpose of offering education, proving their financial viability, having central management based in Australia, offering VET accredited diploma and advanced diploma courses, with credit transfer arrangements in place, and being a member of an approved tuition assurance scheme, or have exemption from this requirement. Of the 2,000 or so providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses, only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. That was certainly brought out in the speech earlier this afternoon of the member for Farrer, the shadow minister. As a result, the take-up of VET FEE-HELP has been low, with only 39,124 students accessing VET FEE-HELP assistance in 2011.


Given that the intent of extending income contingent loans to the VET sector was done largely to alleviate the inequity of access, it is apparent there is considerably more work to do. In addition there are some major areas of skill shortages which could be addressed by ensuring that the organisations which offer these qualifications are VET FEE-HELP eligible. When I speak of inequity of access, that is certainly a factor in regional areas. Because of a lack of all sorts of services and support programs students in regional areas have a more difficult job of actually gaining tertiary education and better vocations than do people in metropolitan areas and people in your own electorates and here in Canberra. That is why I know the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional education, Senator Fiona Nash, has been so strident in her advocacy for independent youth allowance. Whilst that is not part of this bill, it is something that is important and imperative for regional students.


Schedule 1 of this particular bill is intended to bolster the accountability frameworks for FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. These amendments specifically will enable the automatic revocation of registered training organisations' approval as a higher education or vocational education provider when any of the following have occurred: the relevant tertiary regulator has ceased the provider's registration; a court has made an order to wind up a provider; or ASIC has determined they can no longer operate. Until such time as all paths of appeal have been exhausted the provider will continue to be registered.


The proposed amendments in schedule 2 of the bill would allow the minister to change the name of the entity for HELP purposes through one legislative instrument, but only in cases where there has been no change in legal ownership. Currently, if a provider changes their name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be re-approved as a new applicant would be.


In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected—and this is most important, because the last thing we need is for levels of bureaucracy to be affecting students when they need to get on with the job of learning—the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. Therefore, the entity would no longer be required to reapply and go through a duplicate approval process, which is currently the case.


Schedule 3 of the bill will enable additional flexibility for managing provider noncompliance. Currently, the act has limited options available for the management of noncompliance by providers. As it stands, the only options available to the minister are to either revoke or suspend the approval of a higher educational or VET provider or to withhold provider payments. These actions may be excessive for many administrative breaches. Under these amendments, there will be provision for a provider to be given a compliance notice which specifies the breach, the corrective action required and the time frame for this to be undertaken.


Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculation of HELP repayment thresholds. This has become necessary as average weekly earnings data is determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data. This data was published quarterly; however, it is now published biannually.


Schedule 5 of the bill deals with other amendments and will see the consolidation of provisions related to the government's ability to seek information from relevant tertiary education regulators in the one division. These will improve the transparency—and we all want greater transparency—with the relevant tertiary education regulators and enhance arrangements to identify at-risk providers. Additionally, there have been changes to definitions to incorporate changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. These changes will help to enhance the quality and accountability frameworks underpinning the higher education loan program, will enable the government to better manage risk to students and public moneys and will effectively and flexibly respond to low-quality providers.


When it comes to enabling universities and other support mechanisms for students to gain better vocations, I am on record thanking and praising the government for initiatives which have helped Charles Sturt University, whose Wagga Wagga campus is in my electorate. I attended the opening of the life sciences hub along with the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills, the member for Cunningham. It is a tremendous facility and it will do so much not only for this nation but for regional Australia and for the Riverina electorate.


At the moment, there is a push in Wagga Wagga for a rural medical school. I know that the relevant ministers are well aware of this, and it is something I will certainly be pushing. I know how important these rural medical schools are to the recruitment and retention of doctors in regional areas. There are proposals being put forward by the University of New South Wales and Charles Sturt University. I am in support of those proposals. A collaborative effort, a whole-of-government approach, is something that would be very beneficial to Wagga Wagga, to the Riverina, to country New South Wales and to the nation. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill. The coalition supports this legislation.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:03):  At the outset, I acknowledge the comments of the member for Riverina, who has demonstrated his passion for his constituents with his ability to speak for an appropriate length about an issue of importance to him and to the chamber.


I was pleased when I was an academic at the ANU to work alongside Bruce Chapman, one of the architects of HECS, who put in place a truly world-leading piece of policy. It is easy to forget now that HECS, now known as HELP, has become so much a part of our social fabric. The notion of income-contingent loans was one in which Australia was stepping out as a world first. Milton Freeman mentioned the notion of income-contingent loans in the 1960s but it was Professor Chapman who really picked it up, put flesh on its bones and suggested it as a way of ensuring two big things.


The first was that, because with a university education there is the private benefit to the student as well as the public benefit, they should contribute a little bit back into the public purse. University education boosts earnings significantly, and HECS, now HELP, recognises that private benefit. But, secondly, it was the recognition that we needed to expand the sector. We needed to ensure that university education was not something just for elites but was attainable for all Australians. The only way of getting those additional resources into the sector was to ask students to give a little bit back.


So now, when we look at policies in which Australia is leading the world I think we should also look to the HELP policy—a policy which has proven its worth and is now being adopted by a suite of other countries around the world. The UK, Germany, Israel, Thailand and Chile are all adopting or looking at adopting the HELP policy. I suspect that will be the case down the track with policies such as plain packaging of tobacco and putting a price on carbon pollution—we are moving with other countries in the world to put in place policies that future generations will thank us for. What we are doing with this policy is ensuring that the thresholds are indexed at appropriate levels. When HECS was originally introduced, repayment did not start until you reached average weekly earnings. That was based on the simple notion that you should not have to pay back your HECS debt until your university education had begun to pay off in earnings for you. When the Howard government came to office, that model was changed and the repayment thresholds were brought down substantially. I am pleased that now the HECS repayment threshold have been restored so that they are around average weekly earnings.


This bill is a part of a major university investment by this government. Since Labor has come to office there have been more than 150,000 extra Australians studying at university and total funding for the sector has been increased substantially. At the Australian National University, just to pick one of the many excellent universities in my electorate, there has been an increase in enrolments from 6,350 students to 7,086 students, significant investment in education and significant investment in improving access to youth allowance and the quality of student learning and living areas through our investment in housing. That matters, because high-quality university accommodation improves the learning experience.


Recently, we had the ANU alumni awards recognising extraordinary alumni. I acknowledge Alumni of the Year joint recipients Anne Gallagher and Martin Parkinson; Vice-Chancellor's Special Commendations Adam Ford, Danny Bishop and Chris Duffield; International Alumnus of the Year Cheong Choong Kong; Young Alumnus of the Year joint recipients Sebastian Robertson and Jennifer Robinson; Student of the Year joint recipients Katrina Marson and Ray Lovett; and Student of the Year finalists Aditya Chopra, Julie Melrose and Georgia Majoribanks.


In closing, I also note some important reforms being put in place by the government in teacher education courses. This government recognises that it is important to improve the academic aptitude of new teachers. When I was at the Australian National University I did work with Chris Ryan looking at the academic aptitude of new teachers and those entering tertiary education, and what we found was deeply disturbing. From 1983 through to 2003 the share of teachers who were in the top fifth of their class measured on literacy and numeracy had halved. Over the same period, the share of teachers who were in the bottom half of their class had doubled. So we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the 70th percentile to the 62nd percentile, and we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of those entering teacher education courses from the 74th percentile to the 61st percentile. It is a development that had also been seen over that period in the United States and it is a development that concerns this government. Literacy and numeracy does not guarantee you are going to be a great teacher but, all else equal, we want those who are at the whiteboard to have strong literacy and numeracy standards themselves. So, as the minister has announced, we will be putting in place literacy and numeracy testing, a more targeted admission process for teaching courses and more assistance to help all teachers over every stage of their career, recognising that there is no more important job in Australia than teaching students, particularly disadvantaged students. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Minister for Small Business) (17:10):  I thank all honourable members who spoke in this debate. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013 provides legislative authority for the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP. FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assist individuals to access higher education and higher level vocational training by providing students with income-contingent loans to assist them in paying their tuition fees. By accessing HELP, students do not have to make any loan repayments until their income reaches a minimum threshold—currently $49,096. 


This bill builds on the amendments made in the Higher Education Support Amendments (Streamlining and Other Measures) Act 2012 and supports recommendations made in the Post implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme—final report September 2011. The amendments follow extensive stakeholder consultation and contribute to commitments made under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Schools Reform. 


The amendments will enhance the quality and accountability framework underpinning HELP by providing for the automatic revocation of providers in specific circumstances where there is a risk to students and public moneys. This will occur only after all appeal and review mechanisms have been finalised. The amendments will also enhance the government's ability to protect the integrity of HELP by improving the range of provider compliance mechanisms available to the government. The existing arrangements for seeking information from the relevant tertiary education regulators will be further enhanced by consolidating these provisions into one general provision. The amendments will also streamline administrative arrangements for changes to business entity names for approved providers. Further, the bill will enable individuals to continue to repay their HELP debt based on appropriately calculated repayment thresholds by updating the calculation of indexation to apply to HELP repayment thresholds. This amendment reflects the move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from quarterly to biannual publication of average weekly earnings data. Finally, amendments will provide consistency across the tertiary sector by updating qualification definitions in the act to align with changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. I commend this bill, and its purpose to strengthen and enhance the government's income-contingent loans program, to the House.

I went to high school in Canberra, both to Campbell High and to the fantastic Dickson College where I finished very early on in the years when the college system began, and Dickson College is still a remarkable place of education in this city.


Today I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The intent of this bill is to improve the administration of the Higher Education Loan Program in line with some of the proposals put forward in the post-implementation review on VET FEE-HELP in 2011. The post-implementation review made a number of sound recommendations—a number of these were introduced to parliament last year—seeking to further increase the number of registered training providers who are eligible to offer VET FEE-HELP courses.


The coalition recognises the important role that income-contingent loans can play in vocational education. Under the Howard government, income-contingent loans were extended to full-fee-paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP in 2005, and they flowed through to the vocational sector to vocational education and training—that is, VET—to VET FEE-HELP in 2008. Of course, income-contingent loans under the previous name of HECS in higher education courses have been around for some 25 years.


Access to FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP has enabled thousands of Australians the chance to access an education that they might otherwise not have been able to do. It has enabled them the financial assistance that they need to fund the course of their choosing. But the reality is that the take-up rate of VET FEE-HELP has been well below expectations. There is a range of requirements that providers must meet in order to be able to offer VET FEE-HELP courses. Regrettably, these requirements have proven too onerous for the vast majority of providers. Of the approximately 2,000 providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. This places serious limitations on the ability of students to access income-contingent loans to fund their qualifications, and, as we know, the cost of those qualifications is increasing.


In 2012, a quarter of 20- to 24-year-olds were not in full-time education or work. So many of these young people, who are not currently in work or training, come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and they struggle to afford to study at all. Access to income-contingent loans in VET or higher education qualifications is crucial to assist these young people in finding a course of study and a career path by boosting equity of access and affording them the opportunity for a better life. There is also an economic argument in favour of increasing access to income-contingent loans. Many of the courses that could be funded by FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP are in areas of skill shortages, and we potentially have a future workforce impeded only by the cost of study.


In addition to the acknowledgment made in the post-implementation review regarding the low take-up of VET FEE-HELP, a number of recommendations were made to improve the overall administration of the Higher Education Loans Program. As a result of these recommendations, this bill seeks to achieve the following. Schedule 1 of this bill allows for the automatic revocation of a provider's registration as an approved higher education or vocational education provider, where the provider has either had their registration cancelled by the relevant tertiary regulator or been deemed unable to operate by a court of law. Schedule 2 of the bill will see providers able to change their name where there is no change of legal entity. As the system currently stands, if a provider changes the name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be reapproved as a new applicant. In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected, the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. This is a practical measure, avoiding additional red tape for providers.


Schedule 3 will enable the minister to issue compliance notices to providers who are failing to comply. Currently the only courses of corrective action available to the minister are to either suspend or evoke approval of a provider or to withhold payment. This schedule provides an alternative measure, ensuring that providers have an opportunity to undertake corrective action and continue to operate without the sanctions that previously were the only available measure and were extremely harsh. Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculations of HELP repayment thresholds. This has come about as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has decided to publish the average weekly earnings data on a biannual basis, shifting from quarterly. This will ensure that individuals can repay their HELP debt based on more accurately calculated repayment thresholds in accordance with the ABS data. The final amendment will see an update of the qualification definitions in the act to echo changes made to the Australian Qualifications Framework.


So, while we welcome this bill and the amendments that it puts forward, I think it is necessary to acknowledge that there have been few such successful measures in the VET space achieved by those opposite. The broader system suffers from an incredible overload of bureaucracy and red tape. We on this side of the House have made it clear that reducing red tape for business and bureaucracy is high on our agenda. The national partnership on VET reform may well be considered to have failed, given the lack of sign-up by three key states. It would be impossible for anyone who enters into the administrative and compliance aspects of vocational education and training in this country to not be completely bamboozled.


We in the coalition supported the extension of income contingent loans to the vocational ed sector, because we have a really strong record in making sure that those who would study vocational education as opposed to higher education—or, in the common lingo, TAFE and training versus university—should have access to exactly the same support, including financial support. But, if the government are serious about this, it has taken them a while to recognise the extraordinarily low take-up—112 providers out of 2,000 who are using the scheme. Although I do not have detailed information, I would suggest that in rushing through the initial piece of legislation there was a failure to follow up, there was a failure to listen and there was a failure to consult. And that failure is written large across the entire government. If the government had been tuned in to the needs of the providers of registered training, as they should have been, they would not have sat on their hands and said, 'Okay, three years later we'll just get the department to do a review and see what the review says.' So three years pass and no-one has any idea that the system is not working, even though the intention might have been good in the first place. As I said, this is the pattern we are seeing in the training arena from the current government time and time again.


We will be watching closely to see if the modest measures that will be achieved by this legislation, which of course we are entirely supportive of, actually make a difference. If they do not, I would suggest to the minister, who is a new minister in this space and a little more engaged than the previous one—and I do not mean that unkindly, but certainly the previous minister seemed to the sector to be rather hands-off—that the minister acts sooner rather than later to hang on to this valuable cohort of students and this valuable group of training providers.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:39):  I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The previous speaker talked about the great record of the coalition. She should go north of the Tweed and see the terrible and appalling record of the LNP state government in Queensland. To localise this particular bill, there are two examples from my electorate that I will give the member for Farrer if she wants to have a look at the impact of both sides of politics on education. The University of Southern Queensland is the first, where the Education Gateways Program, the capital infrastructure program, is getting nearly $49 million of federal government funding. More university students than ever are being funded by the federal government, hitting the Bradley target of 40 per cent of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds getting into university. More young people than ever are going to university. The University of Southern Queensland in Springfield has a broader reach and larger footprint than ever before. It is going ahead in leaps and bounds.


Up the road, however—in fact, beside it—are the Springfield campus and the Bundamba campus of Bremer TAFE. That TAFE is funded almost exclusively by the state LNP government. What have we seen there? Cutbacks to services, cutbacks to courses and cutbacks to funding. We have seen more barriers, more obstacles, being put in place to young people—particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds in the Ipswich and West Moreton region—getting access to higher education. We have gotten lectures from those opposite about education funding. Go to my electorate and you will see the difference between what a Labor government will do at a federal level in terms of tertiary education and what a coalition government will do in terms of vocational education and training.


I say to the member for Farrer: have a look at what the Howard government did in terms of VET education and what they failed to do. We saw fewer students than ever before going to university under them. More than 190,000 students have gone to university under us—more than ever. Have a look at what the coalition government in Queensland has done. She mentioned—and this is referred to in the explanatory memorandum of this bill—the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. These amendments contribute to our commitment given under that agreement. Why do I mention that? It is because the LNP government in Queensland signed up to that national agreement on skills reform.


The legislation before this chamber makes further improvements to HELP, including VET FEE-HELP, that were signed up to by various Australian governments. In my home state, the minister responsible for employment, training and education, John-Paul Langbroek, has said, 'We're not responsible for training; we are not responsible for tertiary.' The LNP state government has got a task force dealing with the students who go to the sorts of institutions in Queensland that this legislation relates to. Students who go to those TAFE institutions are having the number of campuses cut by that task force from about 82 to 44. In my electorate, we are seeing barriers and obstacles put in the way of students all the time. Courses are being cut. Those opposite come in here and lecture us about what they are doing and say that they will keep an eye on us. Keep an eye on our record, because our record when it comes to tertiary funding is very good compared to that of those opposite.


This legislation, as I said, is a result of COAG's national partnership agreement and is pursuant to recommendations made in the final report of the implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme back in September 2011. It also includes other amendments. What this is about is enhancing the quality and accountability of the whole education framework that underpins HELP by making sure that there can be an automatic revocation of providers in circumstances in which there is a risk to public moneys and a high risk to students. We are going to make sure that those educational institutes have integrity and character and can deliver what they say they can. We are going to strengthen the compliance framework underpinning HELP by making sure that a minister can provide a compliance notice to the provider of education services.


Why is this so important? It is important because these income-contingent loans are paid to those institutions to help eligible students with their tuition fees to make sure they can get assistance to get through those courses which will give them an opportunity in life and give them a leg-up to make sure they get financial security and achieve all they want in terms of their dreams, aspirations and goals. For kids from poorer backgrounds that is particularly important. If you are a kid from Basin Pocket and you went to the local state primary school, Ipswich East State Primary School, and your parents had never gone to high school or never gone on to university, the idea that you might be able to go somewhere like Bremer TAFE and get a trade or qualification is really critical. This is what this is about.


I mention that particular national partnership agreement on skills reform because this legislation comes out of that. What happened in Queensland as result of that? Guess what? There was a program in Queensland that was geared to helping students and geared toward helping the training of young people particularly—8½ thousand of them, according to the Deloitte Access Economics report in July last year—that actually provided assistance to those people who never would have got a job but for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program put in by the previous Labor government. They put $90 million towards it. Fifty-seven thousand people got jobs as a result of that program. The Queensland government, a week before the evaluation report came out—this is the government that signed up for the national partnership agreement here in April last year—decided they would get rid of this. They got rid of a program a week before the report came out. 


They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a report and guess what that report says? It says that 57,000 Queenslanders got jobs in vocational education training by the skilling that the previous government had undertaken. It said there was an additional $6.5 billion in state gross product and gross domestic product to 2020; an additional $1.8 billion in consumption in Queensland and Australia to 2020; an additional $1.2 billion in state tax receipts to Queensland by 2020. That is for $90 million of job training, particularly for disadvantaged people.


That is why we provide FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. If we have institutions that are not providing the services, we should clamp down on them. That is what this legislation is about. But why would you close down good institutions that are providing help for young people, particularly disadvantaged young people in my community like BoysTown, who were getting about $154,000; the Salvation Army Canaan School for Training and Development, who are getting $395,000 and $120,000 for two programs; or Worklinks, who got $128,000 for another program; or Riverview Employment and Learning Program through the Riverview Neighbourhood House Association, $147,000; or, indeed, Ipswich City Council, which also got $45,500 for its community literacy program; or Harvest Rain Adult Literacy Project, who got $95,000 for its community literacy program? Why would you close it down? Not a peep from those opposite about those sorts of programs. These are good programs. These people would never, ever get compliance notices by the minister under this legislation before the chamber, but the coalition in Queensland took the opportunity to close down the funding to good providers, taking away billions of dollars from the Queensland economy to save $90 million. The minister has the temerity in Queensland to say that he is not responsible nor is the government of Queensland responsible for training. He has got it in his title! Yet he takes the money away. They are persecuting working-class people in my community, putting barriers and obstacles to training in their way.


Good providers will not be affected by this legislation before the chamber. If they are bad providers, then they have compliance notices. We are improving the system, and what the Queensland government should do is reverse these stupid cuts that impact adversely on the Queensland economy and on people in my community. When it comes to Bremer TAFE, they should re-employ those people, put those programs back in place, and get with the program that we need to undertake to make sure that people get jobs, that the economy in Queensland remains sound, and that the unemployment rate can be reduced. So far, we have seen it go up—up, up and up—under the LNP government, all for its obsession for so-called cuts. There has not been a peep, a word or a whisper from any of those opposite. We had sanctimonious unction from the previous speaker about this sort of thing. Come to my electorate and see what your comrades and colleagues in the LNP are doing.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:50):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh. The Canberra celebrations have been all too much for you. Congratulations, too. It was a wonderful centenary function this morning and I know you participated with the member for Canberra. Indeed, today is a very important day for Canberrans. Canberrans also understand the need, the necessity and the importance of higher education. Canberra perhaps has more people with degrees per capita than any other capital city in Australia. We know how important a good education is; it is the great enabler.


I take issue with the previous speaker, the member for Blair, for his criticism of the shadow minister and, as he called it, her being sanctimonious on the issue. I listened very closely to the member for Farrer, my neighbouring electorate colleague, and I did not think she was sanctimonious at all. In fact, I thought she gave quite a good account of the bill. You would almost think that the coalition was not supporting this legislation from the way the member for Blair has just carried on. Once again, like so many Labor members opposite, he has tried to introduce state issues into what is a federal matter. If he wants to talk about state matters, he only needs to think about the Victorian election in November 2010, New South Wales in March 2011, Queensland in March 2012, the Northern Territory in August 2012, and Saturday's Western Australian election to see that many of the things that his government offers are not in the best interests of this nation and are being rejected by the voters at the ballot box. He should be very careful when he tries to introduce those state issues into what is a federal matter.


The federal matter before us is the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. You would almost think that we as a coalition were opposing this bill from the sentiments that the member for Blair expressed and the condemnatory way—the virtual assault—in which he described the things we are proposing and the sorts of things that state governments are doing. These are not even in line with what this legislation is about because those are state matters.


A post-implementation review of vocational education and training—the Higher Education Loan Program: VET FEE-HELP—was undertaken in 2011. This bill seeks to introduce some of the recommendations made. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enable the strengthening of compliance and accountability frameworks for VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP loans. The amendments also improve transparency between the tertiary education regulators and allow for more efficient administrative arrangements when changing business entity names of approved providers. So, there, I agree with what is proposed. The coalition is in support of what is being proposed. I am really at a loss to understand why the member for Blair continued his rant in the way that he did.


In 2005, income contingent loans were extended to full-fee paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP under the Howard coalition government. In 2008, income contingent loans were extended to the vocational education sector in the form of VET FEE-HELP. These loans ensure students wishing to pursue a vocation can be provided with financial assistance similar to that on offer to university students through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The Howard Liberal-Nationals government recognised the importance of vocations and higher education and of enabling people to have the assistance they require, through tertiary and vocational supporting programs, to get the best job and realise their full potential. Certainly it was done then. The Labor government now says it is doing the same. When it comes up with a proposal or a plan that the coalition can see will be beneficial to those people looking to better themselves, we are in agreement with it. The loan may cover or partially cover the tuition costs for the VET course, however, VET FEE-HELP is not available for Certificates I to IV and students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level, which is $49,096 for 2012-13.


In order for students to be able to access these loans, their registered training organisation needs to have approval to offer VET FEE-HELP. The eligibility criteria for offering VET FEE-HELP includes a provider being a body corporate with the principal purpose of offering education, proving their financial viability, having central management based in Australia, offering VET accredited diploma and advanced diploma courses, with credit transfer arrangements in place, and being a member of an approved tuition assurance scheme, or have exemption from this requirement. Of the 2,000 or so providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses, only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. That was certainly brought out in the speech earlier this afternoon of the member for Farrer, the shadow minister. As a result, the take-up of VET FEE-HELP has been low, with only 39,124 students accessing VET FEE-HELP assistance in 2011.


Given that the intent of extending income contingent loans to the VET sector was done largely to alleviate the inequity of access, it is apparent there is considerably more work to do. In addition there are some major areas of skill shortages which could be addressed by ensuring that the organisations which offer these qualifications are VET FEE-HELP eligible. When I speak of inequity of access, that is certainly a factor in regional areas. Because of a lack of all sorts of services and support programs students in regional areas have a more difficult job of actually gaining tertiary education and better vocations than do people in metropolitan areas and people in your own electorates and here in Canberra. That is why I know the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional education, Senator Fiona Nash, has been so strident in her advocacy for independent youth allowance. Whilst that is not part of this bill, it is something that is important and imperative for regional students.


Schedule 1 of this particular bill is intended to bolster the accountability frameworks for FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. These amendments specifically will enable the automatic revocation of registered training organisations' approval as a higher education or vocational education provider when any of the following have occurred: the relevant tertiary regulator has ceased the provider's registration; a court has made an order to wind up a provider; or ASIC has determined they can no longer operate. Until such time as all paths of appeal have been exhausted the provider will continue to be registered.


The proposed amendments in schedule 2 of the bill would allow the minister to change the name of the entity for HELP purposes through one legislative instrument, but only in cases where there has been no change in legal ownership. Currently, if a provider changes their name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be re-approved as a new applicant would be.


In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected—and this is most important, because the last thing we need is for levels of bureaucracy to be affecting students when they need to get on with the job of learning—the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. Therefore, the entity would no longer be required to reapply and go through a duplicate approval process, which is currently the case.


Schedule 3 of the bill will enable additional flexibility for managing provider noncompliance. Currently, the act has limited options available for the management of noncompliance by providers. As it stands, the only options available to the minister are to either revoke or suspend the approval of a higher educational or VET provider or to withhold provider payments. These actions may be excessive for many administrative breaches. Under these amendments, there will be provision for a provider to be given a compliance notice which specifies the breach, the corrective action required and the time frame for this to be undertaken.


Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculation of HELP repayment thresholds. This has become necessary as average weekly earnings data is determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data. This data was published quarterly; however, it is now published biannually.


Schedule 5 of the bill deals with other amendments and will see the consolidation of provisions related to the government's ability to seek information from relevant tertiary education regulators in the one division. These will improve the transparency—and we all want greater transparency—with the relevant tertiary education regulators and enhance arrangements to identify at-risk providers. Additionally, there have been changes to definitions to incorporate changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. These changes will help to enhance the quality and accountability frameworks underpinning the higher education loan program, will enable the government to better manage risk to students and public moneys and will effectively and flexibly respond to low-quality providers.


When it comes to enabling universities and other support mechanisms for students to gain better vocations, I am on record thanking and praising the government for initiatives which have helped Charles Sturt University, whose Wagga Wagga campus is in my electorate. I attended the opening of the life sciences hub along with the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills, the member for Cunningham. It is a tremendous facility and it will do so much not only for this nation but for regional Australia and for the Riverina electorate.


At the moment, there is a push in Wagga Wagga for a rural medical school. I know that the relevant ministers are well aware of this, and it is something I will certainly be pushing. I know how important these rural medical schools are to the recruitment and retention of doctors in regional areas. There are proposals being put forward by the University of New South Wales and Charles Sturt University. I am in support of those proposals. A collaborative effort, a whole-of-government approach, is something that would be very beneficial to Wagga Wagga, to the Riverina, to country New South Wales and to the nation. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill. The coalition supports this legislation.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:03):  At the outset, I acknowledge the comments of the member for Riverina, who has demonstrated his passion for his constituents with his ability to speak for an appropriate length about an issue of importance to him and to the chamber.


I was pleased when I was an academic at the ANU to work alongside Bruce Chapman, one of the architects of HECS, who put in place a truly world-leading piece of policy. It is easy to forget now that HECS, now known as HELP, has become so much a part of our social fabric. The notion of income-contingent loans was one in which Australia was stepping out as a world first. Milton Freeman mentioned the notion of income-contingent loans in the 1960s but it was Professor Chapman who really picked it up, put flesh on its bones and suggested it as a way of ensuring two big things.


The first was that, because with a university education there is the private benefit to the student as well as the public benefit, they should contribute a little bit back into the public purse. University education boosts earnings significantly, and HECS, now HELP, recognises that private benefit. But, secondly, it was the recognition that we needed to expand the sector. We needed to ensure that university education was not something just for elites but was attainable for all Australians. The only way of getting those additional resources into the sector was to ask students to give a little bit back.


So now, when we look at policies in which Australia is leading the world I think we should also look to the HELP policy—a policy which has proven its worth and is now being adopted by a suite of other countries around the world. The UK, Germany, Israel, Thailand and Chile are all adopting or looking at adopting the HELP policy. I suspect that will be the case down the track with policies such as plain packaging of tobacco and putting a price on carbon pollution—we are moving with other countries in the world to put in place policies that future generations will thank us for. What we are doing with this policy is ensuring that the thresholds are indexed at appropriate levels. When HECS was originally introduced, repayment did not start until you reached average weekly earnings. That was based on the simple notion that you should not have to pay back your HECS debt until your university education had begun to pay off in earnings for you. When the Howard government came to office, that model was changed and the repayment thresholds were brought down substantially. I am pleased that now the HECS repayment threshold have been restored so that they are around average weekly earnings.


This bill is a part of a major university investment by this government. Since Labor has come to office there have been more than 150,000 extra Australians studying at university and total funding for the sector has been increased substantially. At the Australian National University, just to pick one of the many excellent universities in my electorate, there has been an increase in enrolments from 6,350 students to 7,086 students, significant investment in education and significant investment in improving access to youth allowance and the quality of student learning and living areas through our investment in housing. That matters, because high-quality university accommodation improves the learning experience.


Recently, we had the ANU alumni awards recognising extraordinary alumni. I acknowledge Alumni of the Year joint recipients Anne Gallagher and Martin Parkinson; Vice-Chancellor's Special Commendations Adam Ford, Danny Bishop and Chris Duffield; International Alumnus of the Year Cheong Choong Kong; Young Alumnus of the Year joint recipients Sebastian Robertson and Jennifer Robinson; Student of the Year joint recipients Katrina Marson and Ray Lovett; and Student of the Year finalists Aditya Chopra, Julie Melrose and Georgia Majoribanks.


In closing, I also note some important reforms being put in place by the government in teacher education courses. This government recognises that it is important to improve the academic aptitude of new teachers. When I was at the Australian National University I did work with Chris Ryan looking at the academic aptitude of new teachers and those entering tertiary education, and what we found was deeply disturbing. From 1983 through to 2003 the share of teachers who were in the top fifth of their class measured on literacy and numeracy had halved. Over the same period, the share of teachers who were in the bottom half of their class had doubled. So we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the 70th percentile to the 62nd percentile, and we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of those entering teacher education courses from the 74th percentile to the 61st percentile. It is a development that had also been seen over that period in the United States and it is a development that concerns this government. Literacy and numeracy does not guarantee you are going to be a great teacher but, all else equal, we want those who are at the whiteboard to have strong literacy and numeracy standards themselves. So, as the minister has announced, we will be putting in place literacy and numeracy testing, a more targeted admission process for teaching courses and more assistance to help all teachers over every stage of their career, recognising that there is no more important job in Australia than teaching students, particularly disadvantaged students. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Minister for Small Business) (17:10):  I thank all honourable members who spoke in this debate. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013 provides legislative authority for the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP. FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assist individuals to access higher education and higher level vocational training by providing students with income-contingent loans to assist them in paying their tuition fees. By accessing HELP, students do not have to make any loan repayments until their income reaches a minimum threshold—currently $49,096. 


This bill builds on the amendments made in the Higher Education Support Amendments (Streamlining and Other Measures) Act 2012 and supports recommendations made in the Post implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme—final report September 2011. The amendments follow extensive stakeholder consultation and contribute to commitments made under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Schools Reform. 


The amendments will enhance the quality and accountability framework underpinning HELP by providing for the automatic revocation of providers in specific circumstances where there is a risk to students and public moneys. This will occur only after all appeal and review mechanisms have been finalised. The amendments will also enhance the government's ability to protect the integrity of HELP by improving the range of provider compliance mechanisms available to the government. The existing arrangements for seeking information from the relevant tertiary education regulators will be further enhanced by consolidating these provisions into one general provision. The amendments will also streamline administrative arrangements for changes to business entity names for approved providers. Further, the bill will enable individuals to continue to repay their HELP debt based on appropriately calculated repayment thresholds by updating the calculation of indexation to apply to HELP repayment thresholds. This amendment reflects the move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from quarterly to biannual publication of average weekly earnings data. Finally, amendments will provide consistency across the tertiary sector by updating qualification definitions in the act to align with changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. I commend this bill, and its purpose to strengthen and enhance the government's income-contingent loans program, to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:45):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor. As this is the first time I have seen you in the chair, I wish you well and hope that you are enjoying yourself in that illustrious spot. I rise to speak about recent natural disasters, because over the summer I have had three natural disasters occur in the electorate of Wannon: three significant and major bushfires. 


We started off with a large fire at Drik Drik down between Dartmoor and Nelson. This was a large bushfire which had to be brought under control using fixed-wing aircraft and CFA, DSC and SES crews. It was a major operation and everyone involved did a sensational job, first, to contain this fire in what was a large area. Much of the area where the fire was burning is inaccessible, yet through backburning everyone was able to mount a huge effort to ensure that the fire did not do significant damage. The major damage it did do was to get into a pine plantation where the bill will probably run into millions of dollars, which shows you the significance of being able to bring these types of fires under control quickly.


We also had the Chepstowe-Carngham fire occur in the electorate of Wannon. This was a completely different fire. This was in farmland. The fire occurred at a rapid rate of knots. It burnt 1,300 hectares of farmland. Nine houses, sadly, were destroyed and it left farms and native forests charred. It also led, as we have seen once again, to great community spirit. Once the fire was finished, once it was over, the community got together and worked out what they needed to do to help those who were impacted. 


It was a telling reminder for me as I drove down to fly to Canberra yesterday. As I was driving by in over 30-degree heat in the middle of the day, there were local community members fixing the charred fences which they had removed. There they were on a public holiday Monday putting those fences back together, all volunteering their time to do it for a farmer who had had all the fences destroyed. It is what country communities are all about and it was just very, very humbling to see these people going about their work, chipping in for their local community.


The other fire—and this is a more recent fire that we have had in Wannon—is the one which occurred in the Grampians. Again, this was a significant bushfire. It could have caused extensive damage. It very nearly led to houses being burnt to the ground. It very nearly meant that we saw large portions of farmland destroyed. Once again, the CFA, DSE and the SES did a wonderful job in bringing this fire under control. 


Some of the stories of how they did that are quite remarkable. At some stage the fire was sweeping down hills faster than the fire trucks could go. Usually, CFA members will tell you, fires travel quicker uphill than down hills, but in this case, given the steepness of some the country and the ferocity of the wind, this was not the case and the fire was actually moving at a rapid rate down the hills. This gave a new challenge to those that were fighting it.


The fire has been contained and, once again, the use of fixed-wing aircraft was very important in doing this. I must commend everyone involved in making sure that we had air crews to throw at fires as well as ground crews.


There is one important point would like to make about all these three fires. This is something that, as lawmakers, we will have to look at seriously. All of these three fires occurred in areas which are mobile black spots—that is, when the fires occurred, community members could not be informed of what was going on quickly by mobile phone and they could not communicate to the outside world what was occurring by mobile phone. One of the great technology uses we now have is the ability for CFA and DSE to alert communities through text to those areas which are potentially being threatened by bushfires. The trouble in these areas was there was no ability to do that because they were in mobile phone black spots. If we are to get serious about warning communities, if we are to get serious about making sure our emergency response services have all the tools available to them then we are going to have to look at mobile phone coverage. This is a real issue. I will just run through some of the areas in my electorate which are mobile phone black spots: Landsborough, Moonambel, Victoria Valley—where the Grampians fire was—Nareen, Tarrayoukyan, Carisbrooke, the outskirts of Marysborough—a town of 9,000 or 10,000 people, Bealiba, Marino, Digby, north of Casterton, Cape Bridgewater, significant areas around Balmoral and Harrow. These are all parts of my electorate which are still lacking proper mobile phone coverage.


As we look at this, we are going to have to ask ourselves: if we are going to have a proper emergency response to disasters, is there an obligation for us to look at mobile phone coverage? Is there an obligation for us to make sure that the government contributes to providing mobile phone coverage in areas where the commercial facts mean that the commercial providers will not do this? They will not do it without some sort of government assistance. I think down the track as we see mobile phone coverage spread and the importance of mobile phones not only as a provider of phone coverage but also as a provider of data and a provider of broadband services, we are going to need government to seriously ask these questions.


We have a universal service obligation for fixed line telecommunications. Do we now need to look at whether we would want a universal services obligation for the provision of mobile phone coverage? We probably do not have the finances to be able to do this at the moment but this is something that we are going to have to put on the agenda because these communities are missing out on this important technology. When it comes, in particular, to emergency services management, this tool is becoming more and more important. If there is a lesson from my electorate about the three natural disasters which occurred over this summer, it is that we need to look seriously at mobile phone coverage and whether the federal government is doing enough to play its part in warning these communities of the potential of natural disasters. We have to remember it can be a split-second thing which can save property and save lives. If we cannot get the message out to communities that there is the potential for a natural disaster to hit them quickly and rapidly, we put those communities a greater risk of being impacted severely by these natural disasters.


I will leave it there. On behalf of all the communities in Wannon I would like to place on the record my sincere thanks for the efforts of the CFA, both those who are paid and those who are volunteers, the DSC, the SES, the police and everyone else who was involved in making sure that these fires were contained and eventually put out. I would like to pass on my sincere sadness for those who had their homes burnt, who lost everything in the Chepstowe-Carngham fire. For those farmers who have had their livelihoods impacted on I would like to sincerely thank the VFF and the local branches, who organised to have fences repaired and have the damage done to farms fixed so that those farmers could get on, and, hopefully, once we get rain, see their livelihoods get back on an even keel. Natural disasters have occurred across our nation since time immemorial. They are going to continue to occur. But as we advance as a society we have to make sure we use every tool we can to deal with them.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (17:56):  On indulgence, I also would like to make a statement on Australian natural disasters. We have always been the land of drought and flooding rains. If you have lived in Australia for more than a holiday you will understand this. Add fires, cyclones and the very occasional earthquake, and we do have more than our fair share of natural disasters in this country. Fortunately, in the form of our volunteering we also have an enormous spirit in responding to these natural disasters. We do not just expect the government or the defence forces to come to the aid of those who have been inundated or burnt. We pull together as smaller or larger communities and literally help ourselves, with the support sooner or later of those who have a professional capacity to help. I think it is one of the amazing strengths of our Australian society that these very often unsung heroes come out again and again as the disasters occur year after year, as was the case with the floods in Queensland. During those floods people in very high risk areas were inundated for sometimes the third or fourth time. Again and again the same people come out to help them to mop up and start again.


In my particular part of Australia, we have a broad set of flat plains. Given our average rainfall of about 15 inches you would not expect that we would be inundated with floods. They have always been a fairly rare event, but over the past two years we have had extraordinary flooding rains. Before our flooding rains, which we have just commemorated—not celebrated, but commemorated—as they occurred one year ago and two years ago almost to the day, in the first weeks of March, we had the worst drought on record, some seven years of heartbreak, when we saw more than 50 per cent of our dairy farms forced to sell their water in order to survive financially. You can imagine that in an area like ours, which is dependent on irrigated agriculture, once you have sold your water you are no longer productive as a dairy farmer enterprise. And of course hanging off our dairy farming are our jobs in food manufacturing, transport and all the other logistical activities that make food manufacturing one of the biggest employers in the country.


Drought first of all occurred in my area as a natural disaster. It was a slow insidious drought that sapped the financial, physical and emotional strength of our families. Then, literally within weeks we saw the worst floods on record in those same formerly drought stricken areas.


Two years ago almost to the day the floods swept across what we call our northern plains. There was a tsunami of water moving from the south to the north pushing before it the fodder and the fences. There was an extraordinary loss of over $2 billion in both private and public infrastructure and assets. Those people, all in tiny communities—the biggest often had only about 2,000 people, some of which are districts and not towns at all—pulled together, saved lives, saved livestock and helped one another to recover by sharing farm equipment. We had farmers walk their dairy cows for seven hours to someone else's dairy, which had not been flooded. The cows stayed there literally for months while the original dairy could be put back into action. We had some loss of life later on when some tragedies occurred as people tried to clean up. In one very tragic circumstance one man fell into a fire he was making from the debris on his farm fences.


But, in the far west of the electorate of Murray, the community's spirit has been extraordinary. I want to reflect on the small town of Bridgewater, which is on the Loddon River. That town was completely inundated, to a depth of over several metres. Their caravan park was washed away and their shops were completely put out of action. You can imagine the distress in the town, given it is a very old, historic place. But I was there just a week ago, and it was like a phoenix risen from the ashes—or, rather, from the mud. That town is now celebrating a new bakery. It has had a huge influx of newcomers, who are going to the bowling club and celebrating the beauty of the town and its recovery from the flood. I have to commend the spirit of that community, who have fought back bravely and strongly. Of course, the Loddon Shire has supported them all the way.


Just 12 months ago we had the flood to the east of the electorate, over what we will call the Goulburn and Murray valleys. These floods occurred particularly in the shire of Moira, where 70 per cent of the entire shire area was devastated. It is the home of some of the best fruit and dairy production in Australia, so you can imagine the impact of these floodwaters not just moving across the country but then settling and staying for six and seven months in some places on what was highly productive land.


Twelve months after this devastating flood in, for example, the Moira shire, in March 2013, 70 per cent of the repair of roads, bridges and other infrastructure is still not completed. The March 2012 floodwaters destroyed, for example, the Numurkah Hospital. Twelve months on, that hospital has only just moved out of tents into an interim, temporary building. This temporary centre only opened a few months ago. For nearly 12 months this community, of 5,000 people in the town and many hundreds more farm families in the surrounding area, had its community health centre, its hospital, operating out of tents. I am not talking about Bangladesh or Pakistan; this is northern Victoria, only three hours drive from Melbourne. That community was expected to look after its sick, its elderly and its children, using tents, and that is what they did. They need $18.3 million to rebuild their hospital, which was devastated by the floodwaters. I want to commend the chief executive of the hospital, Jacqui Phillips. She has been magnificent. In particular, she has been so patient. We have to do better when we have flood devastated infrastructure as vital as a hospital. That $18. 3 million is, of course, a lot in a state which inherited a lot of Labor debt, but you have to look at priorities sometimes. That town has to have its hospital replaced some time very soon.


Floods do not just inundate and destroy; they also cause road closures. Some individuals from Numurkah, Nathalia, Katamatite, Tungamah and other small places simply could not travel to work along the closed roads to centres like Shepparton, Cobram and Yarrawonga for weeks. Often, small businesses could not afford to pay individuals during their absence from work. In some cases individuals were required to use their holiday time. All of the community, well beyond those whose houses or farms were flooded, bore the brunt of this natural disaster. I commend those who were so stoic about this situation, who spent their time when they literally could not get up the road to go to work helping their neighbours—mopping out homes, pulling out rotting furniture, trying to make safe animals that were stranded and comforting the very elderly. I want to commend those communities, whose strength was extraordinary. They now have legends which I am sure will be passed on to other generations, about the amazing saves that occurred; the extraordinary metal flood barrier that was built in Nathalia, behind hundreds of thousands of sandbags; and the young children, the SES, the CFA, the Red Cross and other community groups who manned and patrolled that flood wall day after day, daring it to overtop. As I said, tragically the western region of the Murray electorate had its experience of the flood two years before; in the east of the electorate it was one year ago—all following that seven years of the worst drought on record.


I want to talk about how we can help in the longer term, because we have a problem with, for example, the flood loans that were offered. These natural disaster loans were made available from the federal government via the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, who did their very best. But, if you have already had seven years of drought, obviously your farms and your small businesses have had their equity eroded, they have been going deeper into debt; so, when a government offer loans of up to $200,000 at some 3.2 per cent interest, they are very attractive, but unfortunately they are unavailable to many of the people who wish to borrow—they have had their equity eroded too far. Yet, with a break, these properties could be back being viable dairy farms, orchards or small businesses.


So I think we have to understand a bit more about the context in which loans are offered by the federal government, that we are going to be looking at a community of smallbusiness people and farmers whose equity is going to be very low but whose capacity to fight back, given a break, will be quite substantial—given the demand for food, the quality of their properties, the quality of their soils, the climate, what remains of their infrastructure, and their skills and expertise. In my area there was only $5.78 million lent to some 44 individuals in the shire of Moira, the city of Greater Shepparton and parts of Indigo. While 81 per cent of all the loans that were applied for were approved—54 were processed—and that may sound a good figure, so many of the people who came to my office and looked at the criteria just walked away sadly saying, 'We're not going to be eligible for these loans, given the erosion of our equity', and sadly those farms did need that support very much.


I am also very concerned about the exceptional circumstances drought support, which we have had for many years in Australia. It, of course, kept literally thousands of my farmers during the seven years of drought with food on the table. They were not able to make enough for their children to have even basic things like new school uniforms, or to go on school excursions—and they could certainly not take holidays. So the exceptional circumstances support, which gave them the equivalent of the Newstart allowance plus an interest rates subsidy, was an essential part of keeping numbers of our dairy farmers in business so our economies of scale could be maintained, which in turn of course kept our food factories in place, with all of the employment consequences.


Once we started to hear of a new regime of exceptional circumstances that Labor is proposing, you can imagine a lot of people sucked in their breath to see what might be proposed. I am not convinced that the new response to natural disasters that has been put on the table is adequate to deal with the situation where we are not looking at how to deal with prospective climate change but at when a natural disaster occurs suddenly. Whether it is fire or flood, and you have a devastating situation with a lot of loss, whether it is livestock, infrastructure or even lives, you do need an emergency response, you do need more than a low-interest loan which you cannot apply for because your equity has been eroded. So I am asking for this government to understand that there are extraordinary circumstances often in Australia, with low-interest loans not necessarily being the best way to provide support in the longer term. Rather, we need to be looking at how, in my part of the world in particular, we can better build our infrastructure—our rail and roads, which held up the water. The Goulburn-Murray Water Authority's infrastructure had not been built with the capacity to manage these floods. In fact, we know that the floods that occurred just two weeks ago again led to the inundation of the Shepparton East area, where Goulburn-Murray Water Authority channels seem to still be a problem in relation to of local flooding. We have to look at that infrastructure and how it can be better managed or built to withstand flooding, especially when we are told the new legislation related to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to put another 420 gigalitres down the Murray and Goulburn rivers in my part of the world with the deliberate intention of further flooding.


In finishing my remarks about natural disaster, I want to make the point that we are not responding sufficiently in my part of the world to fires. We have just heard from the member for Wannon about the devastating fires in his part of Victoria and we are very sympathetic for the loss that occurred in that Western District and in the beautiful areas around Stawell and Halls Gap and so on.


In my part of the world we have not had a history of bushfires because we had a lot of irrigation channels to intercept any fires such as grass fires or overland fires. We do not have that much mountainous country. But just after Christmas we had serious fires in the Violet Town area in the Shire of Strathbogie. The area does have quite inaccessible rough and steep and hilly country. That really drew to the attention of our local fire brigades, volunteers, Red Cross, our professional firefighters and to all of us the fact that you must have access to firefighting helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. They were the key to our being able to fight these fires in this very inaccessible country. The fact that those planes cannot fly after dark is a problem. I do not know how we surmount that. Fires that were being controlled during the daylight hours simply took control again after dark when the planes stopped dumping their loads of water.


The other problem with inaccessible country was that with a lot of these farm properties we were trying to send fire trucks in where the farm tracks and the farm creek crossings simply could not take the vehicles. We need to have better information for fighting fires in these areas. That means surveillance between fire seasons and information gathering so that we do not have loss of life or people or their equipment put at jeopardy because no-one quite knows the terrain or where the access tracks, fences, bridges and culverts are. I want to commend the Shire of Strathbogie, the local firefighters and volunteers who fed the firefighters, and the farm owners themselves who did everything they could to protect their own and their neighbours' properties. Fortunately there was no loss of life there.


There is a serious problem in Victoria. We have the world's biggest red gum forest in the shape of Barmah Forest which is a high-risk area. It is so fire prone that the local country fire authority refuses to go in there should there be a fire. They argue that there have not been sufficient cold burns. There are no longer cattle grazing in the Barmah Forest so there is nothing to reduce the fire load other than cold burns. These are not being carried out. The tracks into the forest are now overgrown. Trees have fallen on them. If you should send in firefighters on the ground in trucks, their lives would be seriously in jeopardy. That is why local firefighting brigades say that, until the state does the job and cleans up the forest and makes sure that there are proper fire access tracks, they are not going to risk the lives of their members.


Even more than that, we have a stupid situation where South Australia and New South Wales have a ban on any fires being lit in public areas, outdoors, state parks and state forests between the months of December and March through the fire summer season. Victoria, which has even more at risk country—especially along the Murray River—only has regulations which say that you cannot light a fire in the open on a total fire ban day. On any day in December, January or February which is not a fire ban day you can light a fire outside, with certain restrictions about the size of that fire. We had 10 unattended fires that our rangers had to put out at Ulupna Island on the Murray River this summer. Those rangers are very concerned that each one of those fires could have spread and burned Australia's biggest red gum forest, enormous numbers of wildlife—particularly a very vulnerable koala community. Yet we have this discrepancy between the regulations governing fire lit in the outdoors between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I am calling again on the Victorian government to consider bringing its fire regulations into line with the two other states which border it so that we can have a better chance of controlling outdoor fires during this fire-prone period which occurs in Australia every summer. 


I am pleased to make a statement about natural disasters in Australia. Clearly we depend on our volunteers in this country, and they are magnificent. We have seen sad loss of life through our fires in the past in Victoria; we have seen extraordinary loss of assets through flooding, in particular in my part of the northern plains of Victoria; we have also had drought, which has decimated families and left them so in debt that they struggle still to survive; and we have had fires—very happily, with this most recent fire, without loss of life, but I recall the Strathbogie fires of 1989-90, when there was loss of life. I thank the chamber.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (18:15):  I too rise to join everyone else that has spoken on this motion on the national disasters over the past few months. I wish to offer my sincere thanks and admiration to the people of Australia who have been affected by these natural disasters, but also those that have not and have made a wonderful effort to help those in need.


It is interesting to have listened to the member for Murray's contribution, and it reminds me of the words of Dorothea Mackellar's poem My Country. It goes, in part:


I love a sunburnt country,


A land of sweeping plains,


Of ragged mountain ranges,


Of droughts and flooding rains.


I think, given the events of the past two or three months, that is very relevant. It is certainly a country that has had many extremes: from the bushfires in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia to the drenching rains, the wild winds and the severe flooding unleashed on the eastern seaboard—not just once, but several times. Australians have definitely dealt with a range of natural challenges which have tested our resilience and resolve. For some people, the clean-up is a harsh reality, especially for those still rebuilding their lives following similar events in 2011. Once again, they have experienced the treacheries and trials of natural disasters and they have only recently been able to come up for air from the devastation that occurred previously. Many that we have spoken to have not yet even managed to complete renovations, repairs, replacements or relocations. They have yet again had to deal with the unpredictability of torrential summer rains. Following these recent events, particularly around Bundaberg and the Fraser Coast, people have still not been able to re-enter their homes or even to salvage what they can of their lifelong possessions. This in itself, I am assured, is most devastating.


We were fortunate once again in my electorate. Whilst there were widespread outages for our electricity et cetera, by and large we were spared the devastation of further up the coast and in the Logan, Albert and Coomera rivers. At last count, there were only some 15 houses that were inundated—some partially but some substantially—and the people in those places have lost almost all of their goods and possessions.


But through all of these fires, storms and floods, it is always heartening to watch that spirit of mateship—an unwritten Aussie code of conduct—that emanates across the country; whether it is Victorians heading to Tasmania or Tasmanians flying to Queensland to help out one disaster after another and to repay the favour of lending a hand to a mate when he is in dire straits. After recent floods in my electorate of Forde, which were some three inches or so below the 1991 flood—which was the last major flood that we had—I visited the Logan River Tree Farm, where they had at least 1½ metres of floodwaters through their mature tree nursery. When I visited, Ailsa Thompson and her staff were working frantically hand washing the leaves and stems of hundreds of trees with the few hoses they had. They were desperately trying to save seven years of hard work, which included the recovery from the 2011 floods.


My thanks go to the local council and the local fire station. After we contacted them and made them aware of the situation, they were able to make available a number of high-pressure water appliances to help make the job easier, particularly given that the trees were reasonably mature and on large concrete pads. Their main work was to clean the mud off those concrete pads to make access to the trees easier. My thanks also go to local councillor Jennie Breen for her effort in putting together a working bee, which was very well received by a number of people in our community, but there remains much work to be done.


As I said earlier, some 14 properties were affected by the floods and, in many cases, houses were also left without power for up to five days. One major piece of infrastructure that, fortunately, on this occasion was not damaged beyond repair—although it was significantly damaged in 2011—was the John Muntz Causeway at Upper Coomera. Fortunately, we have been able to reopen that piece of road, but it is operating on only one lane, as it has been since 2011. Thankfully, the federal government, out of the natural disaster relief funding, is contributing along with the state government to the replacement of that causeway. The result will be significantly better than what is currently there.


I remember the 1974 floods at my home in Waterford. It was interesting to see the current floods and note how much bigger the 1974 floods were than those we had recently. Thankfully, this year's flood level stayed well below the '74 levels; otherwise there would have been far more devastation. I saw a house that, on this occasion, had a small amount of water go through it, but I remember the effort involved in cleaning that up in 1974, when it was under about three metres of water that covered the roof.


I would like to commend the local councils, both the Gold Coast City Council and the Logan City Council, on the work that they did in trying to notify residents in at-risk areas. Also, as the water receded, they returned to each of these homes to assess the flood impact and offer clean-up assistance to affected homes. As with any of these things, some people were missed along the way, but this has been a great experience for the council to try to improve its processes. My thanks go to the SES, the local state MPs, the councillors and community groups, who were all out in force assisting affected people. I would also like to thank everybody on the Gold Coast weather website, which continued to put up information for people on what was happening around the neighbourhood, and also the people who started the Logan region weather and information page on Facebook. These same people also started a drop-in centre at Park Ridge for people who needed assistance. When people in the community are working together to help provide information to everyone else in the community and let them know what is happening locally, it makes dealing with these events so much easier for everybody involved.


The damage that has occurred during these natural disasters around the country has been phenomenal. Our thoughts go out to those people who have lost income, livelihoods and valuables, not only in my electorate but around the country. We thank the federal government for its support of those people in difficult times and also the various state governments, because they have their own disaster relief arrangements as well.


For those in my electorate of Forde, whilst Logan and the Gold Coast were not declared natural disaster areas for individuals, we have written to the Attorney-General on behalf of people and businesses affected for consideration on an individual basis. We do thank the government for the fact that a number of those people have already been assisted. We must not to forget them just because we are a month or two down the track. These people will take a long time to recover from what they have been through. I encourage people to continue to get behind those who have been through these disasters and assist them in rebuilding their lives.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (18:25):  I rise to speak on the natural disasters. As I was sitting here a while ago listening to my colleague speak, it struck me that it does not really matter what religion or god you believe in—if you are a farmer, you very definitely believe in Mother Nature. Just lately she has been a very, very tough lady. She can be absolutely wonderful, but just listening I realised that in the last month or so we have had fire, flood and drought all at the same time in our country. As the member for O'Connor will no doubt tell us shortly, we did have and still have very serious drought in WA. In western New South Wales, if you have not had the recent rain, you are still going into it. We have the repetition of floods in central and south-eastern Queensland and south-western Queensland. At the same time we have had fires in northern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, as we just heard the member for Murray talking about. They are all horrible and they all have an incredible effect.


Strangely enough, the greatest stock losses, and probably the greatest loss of human life, is not normally due to fire, except where you get an incredibly quick one—which you would expect—or to drought, although it can be if it goes on long enough; normally it is flooding that seems to take the most in human life and in stock, I guess because we do not take it as seriously as fire. But, by heaven, in recent years it has caused an enormous loss of life in Queensland and enormous losses in terms of our animals.


On the Friday and Saturday just after the worst of the flooding had subsided in Bundaberg and up in that area, in North Burnett, Banana and Gladstone, I was up there with my leader, Warren Truss, Paul Neville and Kenny O'Dowd, the member for Flynn. In Bundaberg it was quite something. It was a record flood; it was beyond anything ever seen. Two years before it had gone up to just under eight metres. This time it went over nine. It was just an amazing thing. That last metre of water is one heck of a lot of water. When you think how flat it is there, you are talking an unbelievable amount of water. There were something like 2,500 homes inundated, and, if it had not been for the helicopters, undoubtedly people would have been in a lot more trouble than they were. The same thing occurred two or three years before up in central Queensland, and of course a couple of years before, almost to the day, down in the Lockyer Valley. You do not expect Mother Nature to be quite so severe so at times close together in pretty much the same places.


I saw things with dairy through North Burnett and areas up there, where people, for three, four and five days, were unable to milk their cows. For anyone who understands dairies at all—and obviously a lot do not—they are not going to milk again after going out for that time. They go dry and get incredible complications.


One family that we saw there were just at the end of their tether. It was a father and son, and they had an electrician there. He could hook the power up, but they could not make anything work because most of the motors were still under water. They had to hand milk something like 400 cows just to try to relieve them, and that does not work that well—not with today's number of people to do it.


That was a family I really worried about, but they were not the only ones. There were others that had gone for days without milking—others had gone five. One bloke had pigs for 30 or 40 kilometres around. He would get a phone call to say, 'There's a couple of pigs wandering around here—are they yours?' At least they were alive; a lot were not. There were permanent plantings in orchards where there was just nothing there. I am talking about serious citrus trees, and it looked like a desert. It was pretty horrendous stuff.


I think that everyone had to be commended for hooking into it; governments—local, state and federal. I think that, by and large, people did what they could and did the right thing. It got to the point where, particularly up there around north Burnett and further up, they could not even ring. It was mobile country—the standing lines were down. But after a couple of days the mobile towers do not work because their batteries go flat. Embarrassing as it might have been for Telstra, that was the case for quite some time.


Sometimes there is only so much that people can take. At least Emerald, Theodore and those that have been belted twice in a couple of years were spared this time, but Bundaberg and the horticulture there—not to mention the domestic side within the town—certainly had Mother Nature give them some hurry-up over those two or three years.


As I said, the fisheries were totally wiped out two years before; cattle had ended up on North Keppel Island that time, and it is away out on the Great Barrier Reef. Certainly, once again beef cattle, as well as dairy cattle, have been scattered across the countryside. There were people who were missing a thousand cattle. At times like this you wonder why we farmers do it. We deal with flood, fire and drought and, as I said, this particular time it was all happening in our country at the same time.


In my part of the world—I grew up in an area in the Cobar shire—through the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and into the nineties we had serious fires every 10 years. My electorate, Calare, was pretty lucky with the fires. It did have some small ones, but nothing like in the north of the state and certainly nothing like in Victoria and Tasmania—thank heaven! We had flood last year—Forbes was cut into three—but, once again, not like the sorts of floods that South-East and west Queensland had over the last few years. One would think that that part of the world at least is going to be spared a repetition of it in the near future; these things do seem to even out. But I think we have to take our hats off to the people who have marched through it.


As I said earlier, I think that by and large the right thing has been done by the various levels of government. Certainly, when called upon the armed forces did their job as professionally and competently as they always do when asked to do it. Wherever it happens—not just agriculturally, but in all ways—I think we have to admire the people who shrug and get on with it and who say, 'Next time we'll be luckier.'

"Crook, Tony, MP",NatsWA,2013-03-12,"



Mr CROOK
 (O'Connor) (18:34):  Natural disasters like those in the Prime Minister's speech and those mentioned today by members in this place have also been affecting Western Australians, particularly in my electorate of O'Connor, where we lost a volunteer firefighter in the Two Peoples Bay bushfire west of Albany last October. Wendy Bearfoot suffered horrific burns to more than 60 per cent of her body when her truck was engulfed by flames caused by a freak wind change and, sadly, she passed away as a result of injuries. 25-year-old Charlene Hordyk was also badly injured with burns to 20 per cent of her body along with five other fellow firefighters.


I take this opportunity to acknowledge the bravery of these Australians who are risking their lives to help protect other people's lives and property. I would also like to offer my sincere condolences to Mrs Bearfoot's family including her husband of 30 years and her three children. To Charlene and the other injured firefighters I wish them a very speedy recovery and thank them for the outstanding contribution they have made to our community.


The Two Peoples Bay fire was only one of several bushfires around my electorate, with other major fires in Esperance on the South Coast, Bremer Bay on the mid-South Coast and Northcliffe last month. In all of the stories that members have contributed to this discussion there is a common theme and that is the remarkable work of emergency services personnel and the thousands of volunteers who support them.


Bushfires are not the only disasters to hit the O'Connor electorate, although they are the dramatic events that catch our attention most vividly and that demand our vigilance. Freak weather events are becoming more common across this vast electorate such as the storm that devastated the small community of Dudinin in the central wheat belt. While the east coast of Australia has been hit by similarly dramatic flood and fire, Western Australians and particularly Western Australian farmers have been suffering the much slower and less striking effects of drought and other unpredictable weather patterns.


I have been contacted by many of these farmers who are currently in dire straits. They have said that this season has been particularly difficult. In some parts of the state it is the culmination of five dry years in a row. Others are experiencing unseasonal rainfall patterns and freak storm events. WA farmers are under some of the most difficult agricultural conditions in the world, which appear to be getting more difficult with changing weather and increasing incidences of natural disaster.


As with all disasters there is one critical factor that enables us as individuals and as communities to prepare in advance, to manage the event while we experience it and to react to a worst-case scenario when it happens. That critical factor is information. Information is the key to working together in difficult situations. Information is the tool that allows us to assess past disasters and to plan for future disasters. The availability of information is a service we rely upon in the modern world to keep in touch with our loved ones, to make sure that they are all right and to check whether they need our help.


Information is critical for emergency services responding to big disaster events. It is also critical for farmers and communities struggling to cope with a series of lesser, progressive events that combine to create a disaster for their lives and livelihoods. Information is important for local governments, for health services including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, for the main roads, for industry, for tourists and travellers, and for people in their homes when these disasters strike. However information is the one thing that the firefighters at Two Peoples Bay were working without.


On 12 October 2012 Wendy Bearfoot and her colleagues were working in an area with limited radio network coverage and no mobile phone reception. There was little or no means of conveying critical information about changing conditions. There was little or no means of calling for help. In a dangerous situation where rapidly changing weather can make the difference between life and death, how can this be an acceptable set of circumstances for our emergency services to operating under? Yet this is the exact situation in many regional areas. In the Great Southern region around Albany, the local Chief Bushfire Control Officer, Mr Ross Fenwick, has been working with state member of the Legislative Council Mr Colin Holt to identify nine bushfire brigade sheds that receive no mobile phone coverage whatsoever and a further seven that can only access a signal via connection to an external antenna. These are the volunteer bushfire brigades that thousands of people are relying upon to protect them, their property and their livestock against bushfire events that are a serious threat, not just an outside possibility.


Again, it is not just the bushfire scenario we need to consider when we talk about the lack of critical information. The Bureau of Meteorology has recently decommissioned the Eucla weather radar on the Western Australian and South Australian border. I understand that the radio was old and that it was going to be costly to replace it, so it has been switched off. This is a service that provides critical weather information to emergency services, to the flying doctors, to the main roads, to the pastoralists and to the local and travelling community. It is a service that is seriously lacking in other parts of O'Connor as well, denying people the information they need to protect themselves and to defend themselves against weather events that can devastate their lives immediately in freak events or slowly over seasons and years.


My electorate offices have been approached time and time again by farmers crying out for government support. They tell me they need more information—critical weather information. They need to know when and where rain is falling so they can farm productively because, while the effects are not so obvious and not so immediately dramatic, drought is a natural disaster like flood and like fire. It has the power to take away people's lives and livelihoods. These farmers need to know what has happened in previous years so they can prepare for what seasons might look like in the years to come. They need weather radar so they can prepare for and respond to changing conditions so that those conditions do not become a disaster.


I understand that at least two weather radars are necessary, one in the wheat belt and one in the south-west. This is in addition to the existing weather services, which need to be protected and replaced when necessary. But what I am hearing is that the weather radar is being decommissioned, and it is not only Eucla that is getting the chop. I understand that the Bureau of Meteorology has undertaken a review recommending the enclosing of aerodrome forecasting equipment at 78 regional aerodromes around the country. This equipment, like the Eucla radar, is old and needs upgrading. I understand that the costs of upgrading these services is somewhere near $7 million. What I want to ask is: what is the cost of not upgrading this equipment? What is the cost of switching off these services and taking away this source of vital weather information for remote and regional areas? What is the cost to these communities that can no longer rely on the Royal Flying Doctor Service, because the flying doctor does not have the information required to get in and out of a particular aerodrome safely? What is the cost to the communities when the viability of their aerodrome services is questioned by operators that cannot afford the extra costs of contingency fuel supplies to make it into the next aerodrome in case the weather is found to be inclement upon arrival? And what is the cost of further isolation from emergency services, from essential services and from help? The cost is similar to that experienced by communities whose fire brigades cannot communicate effectively. It is a drastic and dangerous cost.


I implore members of this House to think more broadly about natural disasters, not just about how we help people to clean up and support them with crisis response initiatives and not just about how to assist communities struck by dramatic events. These communities are very worthy, and they must receive our help. But I implore the government and future governments to help and support the people on the ground who are preparing for, managing against and battling with the effects of all sorts of natural disasters, big and small, on a daily basis. In Western Australia this means that people in regional areas in O'Connor and across rural Western Australia must be provided with more information—equip them with the tools they require, arm them with the information they rely upon, provide them with critical information services and information communication services so that when things do go wrong they have the very best chances to survive and to carry on battling in the years to come. These people need mobile phone towers. They need weather radar and weather stations. They need to know that they will have the information they need when they need it. And they need to know now that the government takes the natural disasters they are experiencing seriously and will help them to protect themselves.


In 2013 in Australia, one of the most advanced, prosperous and privileged nations in the world, how can we justify denying a significant proportion of our population this kind of information? It is information that is so much more critical to those people living in remote and isolated communities amongst harsh and dangerous environments and far from major service provision centres. This information is taken for granted by the rest of the population and by populations across other developed nations. It is time that we brought our regional Australians up to date and provided them with these basic services. Australians in the regions need information and services for communication for their survival.


There is a huge anomaly in talking about supporting people in the face of weather driven natural disasters when we are taking away weather monitoring data services. There is a huge contradiction in providing services for emergency situations if those services cannot communicate effectively when the disaster strikes. The bottom line is always going to be very important, but in this instance the bottom line must not cost lives.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:28):  We had the privilege of being part of the fifth anniversary of Closing the Gap. This is without doubt an incredible achievement, not just for the parliament but for our entire nation. Closing the Gap is an important bipartisan effort that recognises that the way forward will depend on people working together, irrespective or race or background, to improve education, health and quality of life for all Australians. It is an effort that, I am pleased to recognise, both sides of the political spectrum are striving towards. As the Prime Minister said in her speech:


… the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people of this country have decided to walk the path of reconciliation together.


Importantly, the Prime Minister acknowledged:


The mistakes made in one generation are being repaired in the next. The gap is being closed. So for all the challenges we will inevitably encounter between now and 2031, this is a moment to savour. Not just because we reached a target but because we showed what we can do together.


The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, also rightly acknowledged the hard work that has gone into achieving the progress that has been made so far. Mr Abbott said in his Closing the Gap speech:


There is a new spirit in this land. There is a new spirit which reaches out to embrace the indigenous people of this country, so different from the spirit that was abroad when the Prime Minister and I were young. It is a tribute to so many people in this place and around our country that that is now the case.


I rise to add my voice to the support of the many in support of the continued work to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I am pleased to see the involvement of parliamentary colleagues over the term of this parliament making contributions to those debates on many fronts. We see positive changes in the number of Indigenous Australians in employment, with 47 per cent of Indigenous Australians now in mainstream employment. That is significantly up from five years ago. It means that they participate in the economic opportunities that this country affords those who wish to take the pathway into different jobs and ultimately earn incomes that benefit their families.


I also raise my concern that we do not lose focus at this critical point in our endeavours. I think if we take the headline messages out of both those speeches and walked into communities and the suburbs where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families live, we would see a gap that we would find hard to comprehend, given what we have heard in the parliament. Some of that gap is around missed opportunity in respect to education.


I also look at the incarceration rates that are continuing to climb in every jurisdiction. That means you have young Indigenous Australians taking a pathway into corrective services and, in some instances, into recidivism where their incarceration rates become cyclic. They spend time out and they go back in. It is an opportunity that is lost in terms of the hope and aspirations that we desire for all young people.


When I look at the Australian Public Service, I see Indigenous Australians employed within a number of agencies but there are very few in positions within the Senior Executive Service where they are contributing to not just the debate on the needs of Indigenous Australians but also the debate on the needs of the Australian public through the agency in which they work. For example, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health focuses on the health of Indigenous Australians and yet in its history I have never seen any Indigenous person appointed to the most senior position within the organisation or to the branch manager positions within state and territory offices. I have seen them appointed to levels much lower than that, which is a pity.


If we are truly closing the gap and changing the mindset we would have developed the capability for them to participate anywhere within the public sector. I hope that in 10 years we do not have identified positions within the public sector, that what we have is the same strategy that applied when we focused on equity for women. We did not create positions that were made for women as we do with Indigenous Affairs. Within the decade what I want to see is an Indigenous person holding a position at the deputy secretary or secretary level of a Commonwealth agency on merit and on the basis of the skills and capability that they bring. Although we have had gains, they are not significant enough to be uniform across the board.


We are closing the gap, we are making tremendous gains in leaps and bounds. But if we take the whole spectrum in terms of housing, community infrastructure and the number of people who are progressing in their quality of life, we see some disparities still. I would hope that, when we achieve the targets we have set under the national partnership agreements and through the COAG processes, we do not overlook all of those other factors that come into play. If we halt that then we will see a discrepancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. What I would also hope is that in the future Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs become the lesser pathway for progression within Australian society and a greater pathway of opportunity is created in a much broader context. I am always concerned, when we walk into Aboriginal communities, whether we really see the true story. That is why I have been a strong advocate of members of this parliament getting out into their electorates and identifying the gaps themselves. It is when you go and visit constituents, work with the organisations in the process of meetings, and understand the challenges and things that we have to change, that you will really see the gap close in a number of areas beyond just the five aspects we have targeted to achieve.


My concern is that some of the true nature of what is happening at our regional and remote Aboriginal communities is not accurately reflected in data. One of the things I love about data is that you can collect data, analyse it, bring it into a national construct and see where we have made change and differences, just through the trending of data. It is when we dig down and go back to the realities of families and communities that we see there are still gaps yet to be addressed. In a bell curve, 25 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made significant advances, both within their career pathways and in the income that they bring home on a fortnightly basis. They are highly successful and they do the same normative things as any other Australian family whose members work full-time—although there is still a cultural obligation that you support and help family members. I suspect that that is why you do not see too many Indigenous Australians as millionaires: because we tend to have a cultural obligation of sharing the grief and pain. 


As part of my work on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I have seen with my own eyes the work that still needs to be done in our country. I have listened to community members and service providers on the ground, who work hard to achieve improved access to services that many of us take for granted. There are still people living in abject poverty with no help and no hope for a better future. There is a sense of futility for some individuals because they see no horizon of hope from where they currently sit within the context of the continuum of opportunities that prevail within our broader Australian community. Many Indigenous people are living under substandard living conditions relative to other Australians in all settings—rural, regional and remote. 


Only recently, I met with a group of Indigenous leaders in my own electorate and they talked about the substandard housing that some of them are living in and their frustrations in working with government agencies to try and remedy the problem. One of the elements that I really appreciated when the NPAs—national partnership agreements—were being framed was that the National Indigenous Reform Agreement had a set of principles as to how government agencies would work with Indigenous communities, organisations and people, whereby they were equal partners in shaping the way programs, services and initiatives would roll out to make a difference. Sadly, that has not occurred to the extent that I would have thought. 


Life expectancy, employment rates, childhood mortality rates and literacy rates still show a marked difference between our Indigenous Australians and the rest of the Australian population in rural and remote regions. We still have a distance to travel to close the gap in Australia. We still need to fight for many families and young children who are facing an upward battle to have access to the same healthcare and education as children living in the metropolitan areas. One of the key challenges that still remain, as I said earlier, is the youth incarceration rate. I once participated in a review of imprisonment programs, and the element that came through in that was the normative thinking and expectation that imprisonment was a pathway in life—that it was just the normal process of living. 


We have really got to focus on dealing with that issue. We also need to initiate long-term, lasting change. One excellent example of this is the training of Indigenous doctors. Doctors are making a tangible, positive difference in closing the gap. I saw the beginnings of the medical school in Newcastle, where Dr Sandra Eades graduated as one of the first Indigenous doctors. From that grew the pathways for many others. We now have in excess of 120 doctors. Kelvin Kong in New South Wales has completed the requirements to be a surgeon. 


So we have made strident gains in some key areas but we need that uniformly. We need to see individuals go into the financial sector and into areas that will generate opportunities for a rethinking of the contribution that can be made through the financial gains available to all of those who seek to invest and seek those opportunities. Young men and women are establishing their own enterprises and are being successful in a slow and steady way. Joe Proctor is a financial adviser and investor with Macquarie Bank. Terri Janke is the owner of Terri Janke and Company. Natalie Walker is the CEO of Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council. David William is from Gilimbaa. Quinton Tucker is at BYAC Contractors. All of them are employing other Indigenous Australians as part of their workforce but are engaging external people to skill them. Eventually they want to become strong economic entities in their own right to participate not only in the mining boom. 


Isabelle Adams at Vision Network has had her own consultancy company for some time and has made a tremendous contribution to some of the reforms. Whilst we can acknowledge that we have closed the gap in some key areas, there is still much more work to be done. There needs to be a greater effort of consistency. The other element that has to be considered as a gap is the active participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being equal partners in the delivery of government services and programs. There is still a desire for the control to sit with state and Commonwealth government agencies. If the change occurs then we will see real ownership of many of the facets of the gaps that are still there and I think we will see improvements within the decade that parallel the achievements we have made thus far. 


I hope that we see within the next two terms of parliament further reporting on other key areas that demonstrate that we are on the path to success and that we are on the path where all Indigenous Australians work very closely and are part of the leadership of this nation in every field of endeavour—not just in Indigenous affairs but in the institutions, the financial structures of this country and the corporate sector. I congratulate both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their fine speeches that reflect the gains we have made thus far.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (19:43):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Hasluck in this important debate on closing the gap. He is the only Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which is an indication of one gap that we need to work to close. Were Indigenous Australians to be represented in this place in proportion to the number in the Australian population there would be at least five Indigenous members in parliament and many debates, this one included, would be richer for that. I hope we will see Nova Peris joining the next Senate, but we still will have further to go. It is an indicator of how many of these gaps take too long to close.


I am proud to represent an electorate which is the home of the Ngunawal people. Often when I am looking for stories of Indigenous Australia I turn to Stories of the Ngunnawal, an excellent book which discusses some of the stories of the Ngunawal elders. One story by Dorothy Brown Dickson reminds us of how tough it was for some of the Ngunawal people. Ms Dickson grew up in an Aboriginal reserve in Yass. She refers to how tough life was for the young men. She says:


They couldn't have a drink in peace. They had nowhere else to have a drink and socialise as they weren't allowed in the pubs. People would come up there all the time arresting them, and taking them down to the lock-up. When the police needed slave labour to look after their yards and cut wood, there always seemed to be someone in jail to do it.


She goes on to say:


Even the shop-keepers were prejudiced. You had to wait until the white people were served first in the shops. When Aborigines went to the picture theatre they had to sit down the front by themselves. And the welfare would come up there all the time, checking on people.


She goes on to talk about her friend Betty Russell, who she used to walk to school with. She says:


One afternoon I went to Betty's place. Betty was quiet and her mother was sad. I asked What's the matter?' Betty said the welfare was sending her mother and brothers and sisters to Walgett. I was really sad. It really broke my heart but nothing could be done. I never saw Betty for years after that.


It is vital that we report to parliament on progress on closing the gap. Progress on closing the gap is a multifaceted challenge. It involves issues of the heart, such as the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the Constitution; symbolic acts of recognition, such as our existing practice of acknowledging traditional owners of the land in formal speeches; and perhaps in the future other practices, such as that adopted across the ditch, of dual naming of places. Today being Canberra Day it is appropriate to note that Canberra is the only Australian city that carries an Indigenous name rather than the name of a European settler or a respected European. We ought to have more cities in Australia carrying traditional Indigenous names.


I wanted to speak today about a number of pieces of work being done to close the gaps. They are not all directly connected with one another, but I do not think many of these efforts to close the gap are directly connected with one another either. One issue that I have been active on as a member representing a large number of public servants is ensuring that the Australian government meets its target of 2.7 per cent Indigenous employees in the Australian Public Service. This is of particular concern to me as a result of an issue raised by the CPSU here in the ACT recently—that the share of Indigenous public servants in the Australian Public Service has not been increasing but in fact declining, falling from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent. In an effort to work out what we can do to increase the share of Indigenous employees I wrote to all ministers asking what strategies they are employing to improve the share of Indigenous employees in their departments, and I thought I might share some of those strategies with the House today.


Several departments have structured mentoring, leadership or buddy programs for Indigenous Australians, focusing on career development and ensuring retention. Other departments hold national conferences for their Indigenous employees as an opportunity to share ideas and experiences. Some departments have Indigenous apprentice, cadet and graduate programs as well as particular Indigenous strategy teams within their human resources divisions. In certain cases those human resources divisions have developed memoranda of understanding with Indigenous studies centres at universities as a way of partnering with those centres to get talented university graduates. There are departments that already exceed the 2.7 per cent target and are aiming higher. They have set aspirational targets for 2015. One minister has an Indigenous advisor working on his staff and has had that advisor for a number of years. Several departments participate in the Learn Earn Legend! Work Exposure with Government program, administered by DEEWR. It is a program that aims to give Indigenous Australians exposure to work in the offices of parliamentarians and in the Australian Public Service.


There is also work being done across the APS through its Diversity Council to make diversity issues visible, and there have been efforts to make sure that public servants are offered leave for cultural and ceremonial purposes which are appropriate to the needs of those employees. Those include up to two days leave with pay for participation in NAIDOC Week activities and cultural and ceremonial events.


The targets are 2.7 per cent for departments that were below that threshold as at 2009, or a 20 per cent increase for departments that were above the threshold. I do hope that we will see the share of Indigenous employees in the public sector track upwards, perhaps even through use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment agencies, better working with existing Indigenous staff to design and deliver cultural appreciation training and through identified Indigenous positions—meaning not that the person who is successful in getting the position need be Indigenous but that they must understand Indigenous issues and take responsibility for communicating effectively with Indigenous people. Such positions may well be an important step towards increasing the share of public servants who are from an Indigenous background.


A second issue to which I want to draw the attention of the House is work being done by Canberra public servant Daniel Billing, which has been publicised in the Canberra Times by their excellent education editor, Emma Macdonald. Mr Billing is working to provide home Kindles to Indigenous students. He noticed how his own seven-year-old took to the Kindle intuitively and enthusiastically, and so came up with a plan to fund Kindles for Indigenous students in an effort to boost their interest in reading. The ACT's only participant is Forrest Primary School sixth-grader Yulcailia Hoolihan-Mongta. At the time she received her Kindle, the 11-year-old had a reading age of nine and spent just 45 minutes a week reading. After 12 weeks with the Kindle she has increased her weekly reading to two hours and 20 minutes and gained about a year's worth of reading activity—a year's worth of reading activity just in that three-month period, according to her teacher, Gemma O'Brien.


I commend Emma Macdonald for her work in publicising the Indigenous Reading Project and Daniel Billing for his activism, as well as the many generous philanthropists who have donated towards it. But one philanthropic body is notably absent, and that is Amazon.com. Amazon.com has Australian sales, I would estimate, of around $1 billion a year. Based on the available estimates, they hold about one-10th of the $13 billion online sales market. And yet Amazon.com pay no GST, they pay no company tax and they make no charitable donations to a single Australian charity—$1 billion in sales, and not a cent in charitable donations. I asked Amazon.com how they could defend this, but I got no comment. I think this is unacceptable; I think Amazon ought to recognise their duty to Australia to behave as a good corporate citizen. And I cannot see a better charity for Amazon to support in Australia than the Indigenous reading project. So, as a Kindle user and a keen consumer of their products, I do encourage Amazon.com to become a better Australian corporate citizen.


Third, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the July 2012 report Evaluating new income management in the Northern Territory: First evaluation report by J Rob Bray and co-authors. This is an important report because it cuts through much of the ideology that has surrounded new income management in the Northern Territory. It focuses on the empirical evidence relating to income management.


It notes that there are few consistent impacts of new income management. Instead, there have been diverse outcomes. The report notes wide and inconsistent views and experiences of income management. There have been many who wish to remain on the program, which has had a positive impact on their lives. There has also been a statistically significant improvement in the ability to afford food among those in the treatment group relative to the control group. There were other positive and negative aspects noted. The Basics card has been valued, but the loss of autonomy resented. Some subject to income management have noted that they find it restrictive or frustrating. There is a sense of a disempowerment.


We need more empirical evidence of this type. I commend Minister Macklin for commissioning this important research. It is only through taking a clearheaded look at the empirical data that we will be able to craft better policies. If closing the gap were easy, it would have been done by generations past. It is because this is a difficulty task that we set ourselves to it.


Finally, let me acknowledge the Indigenous softball program, which I had the pleasure to be engaged with at the Hawker Softball Centre at an event last year. Softball has been a leader among sports in engaging with Indigenous Australians, particularly women's softball. There are Indigenous softball clubs springing up across urban, regional and remote Australia. I commend the work of Softball Australia in this area. Sport can help change lives and provide a sense of self-esteem and an enthusiasm to be involved in the community. Sport will play an important part in helping to close the gap. I commend the statement to the House with a sense of optimism about the goals but also with clear-eyed realism about how far we have to go.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (19:57):  I also appreciate the opportunity to speak in relation to the Prime Minister's fifth annual statement on Closing the Gap. In doing so, I would like to commend both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for the manner in which they contributed to the debate in February this year. Both the tone and the content of their respective speeches to the parliament reflected very positively on them and on their efforts to address Aboriginal disadvantage throughout our nation.


Much has already been said by other speakers about the successes and the failures in reaching the ambitious targets set in 2008 in relation to life expectancy, mortality rates, early childhood education, reading, numeracy and writing, year 12 achievement and employment outcomes. I would like to acknowledge the Prime Minister's comment that this will be the work of an entire generation of Australians. We should not become disheartened by any early setbacks or indeed become complacent about any of our successes. Every gain in this space will be hard won and it will be difficult for us to consolidate those gains. As the Prime Minister said:


Let's always remember: closing the gap is not inevitable. Keeping it closed is not inevitable either. We must guard our gains and never allow a backward step.


Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition remarked in his speech that this must be a national project with a focus on results on the ground. As he is a member who above all others in this place has lived the creed in terms of going out and working in the Indigenous communities and delivering practical results on the ground, I will quote from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition in which he said:


… the sad truth is that it is easy to spend money but it is hard to make a difference. That is why it is so important that we focus on not just what is happening here in his building, what is happening here in the administration, but what is happening on the ground. The focus should not be on what Government is doing but it must also be on what people are doing in response to the initiatives of government, because it doesn’t matter what we do in this place. All our fine words, all our noble sentiments don’t matter if adults aren’t going to work and if children aren’t going to school.


I endorse those comments from the Leader of the Opposition. This is about making a real difference in the lives of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.


I have said repeatedly in my time in this place that you do not need to travel to rural or remote communities in the Northern Territory to witness Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. Regional towns right throughout Victoria, including in my own electorate, and right through New South Wales and Queensland provide examples of Indigenous communities struggling to meet ends meet and get ahead in their lives.


I do endorse the building blocks of the Closing the Gap initiative, which have been supported through the COAG process. It is about early-childhood development, schooling, health, economic participation, healthy homes, safe communities and governance and leadership—governance and leadership from this place and also from the communities themselves. These building blocks are very easy for us to talk about because they do make sense. It is a matter of getting the kids to school, healthy, at an early age and making sure that they are actually attending school by giving them that good start in life so that when they reach those early years of education they are ready to learn. It is helping them and their families to value an education with the prospect in the longer term that at the end of their education or training journey there will be a real job for them, and they can have their own economic independence.


I believe that we have a role in this place to help provide the leadership, but it has to be in partnership with the communities that we are talking about. There must be a level of responsibility accepted by the community leaders themselves, by the individuals and by the Aboriginal elders to help their own communities. I think we have a very important role in this place by helping to provide the framework to ensure that there is a safe living environment for those people.


I want to talk about a slightly different gap from the nature of other speeches that have been made this evening and earlier, and that is the gap in Aboriginal participation in the social and civic life of our communities. I would argue that the relationship of most white Australians with Aboriginal people does not really extend beyond the abstract. We might cheer for them in their sporting pursuits, whether it be in the AFL or in rugby league, and some of us may have the opportunity to work with Aboriginal people in their professional capacity. We do get the opportunity to read about their issues in the media, in particular the Australian has done an extraordinary job in recent years of highlighting areas of Aboriginal disadvantage in our nation. I would argue that most of my colleagues in this place—and, in fact, most of my white Australian friends—would not have a single Aboriginal person they could say is their personal friend. I would argue that most of us have never actually sat down and had a cup of coffee or shared a meal with an Aboriginal person or their family outside, perhaps, the professional role they may have in the community. There is a real social and civic life gap in the lives of Aboriginal people and the relationship with white Australia. I think there is an enormous gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and there are very few opportunities at the moment for that social engagement, particularly, I would argue, in our city or suburban locations.


It is probably a bit different for us who are fortunate enough to come from regional towns. We are often involved more directly in our communities, whether it is through our sporting or community activities. I would argue, still, that it does not always extend to a friendship or a social engagement between white Australians and Aboriginal Australians. Once the footy game is over  there is very little actual social interaction. I think it is to our enormous loss as a nation that we do not find the ways to bridge that gap. It is a gap that, I think, all of us can address in our daily lives. There are simple things like making sure that the young Aboriginal children in our communities are involved or included in our sporting clubs, that we actually invite the young Aboriginal children to our own children's birthday parties and go out of our way to make sure that those bridges are built across the cultural divide. I think we can extend the hand of friendship beyond the grand speeches that we might make in this place or the grand gestures of the Apology by the member for Griffith. These are all important gestures but, unless they are backed up by practical action on the ground by each and every one of us, it will all be for naught. It is all about taking some small and practical steps to understand each other and to show respect for one another.


I had the good fortune as a young person growing up in Gippsland to know many Aboriginal people and to still regard them as both friends and family members. My family link, if you like, is through my dad's cousins, Jack and Edna, who fostered and provided safe homes for many Aboriginal people. In times of great need they provided refuge for young Aboriginal people. Theirs is quite a remarkable story. My Uncle Jack was prisoner of war in the Thai-Burma Railway. He was a POW for several years yet, when he returned, despite experiencing all the atrocities endured on the Thai-Burma Railway, he harboured no ill-will towards his Japanese captors, which I find quite staggering. When he returned to Australia he had a renewed commitment to serve others who were less fortunate than himself.


His calling, as he described it to me once, was to work with Indigenous people. He moved his family to a little place called Newmerella, which is on the outskirts of Orbost, not far from the banks of the Snowy River, and during his lifetime he either fostered, adopted or provided refuge for up to 20 Aboriginal children. It is an extraordinary life story. He was able to provide for them with his wife, Edna, and their own children a stable, safe family environment for these young Aboriginal people who could not, for whatever reason, live with their blood relatives in the township. 


Those young Aboriginal people were part of my formative years growing up. We spent a lot of time with them quite often because, obviously, with a large number of children in his own house, Jack and Edna needed a bit of respite and some of the young Aboriginal people would come and stay at our place in Sale in the school holidays. So we had a lot of exposure and a lot of experience with young Aboriginal people, and we regard them as our cousins. I am sure there was no actual blood relationship at all, but we regard them as cousins, and to this day I still regard them as my cousins. Many of those young people went on to achieve good educations, they went on to achieve stable jobs and they have been able to fully participate in the economic and social lives of the Gippsland community. At the same time, they have been able to retain their cultural identity. This is a microcosm of what can be achieved by working in partnership with Indigenous people in their own communities—making sure that they are healthy, making sure they have had the chance to go to school and achieve an education or training and then have the realistic aspiration or expectation of achieving a job at the end that time.


Just a month ago, I introduced the Prime Minister to one of those kids—one of those young Aboriginal people. I should not call him a kid because—his name is Lionel Dukakis—he is actually 50 now. When the Prime Minister visited Heyfield, I dragged Lionel out of the crowd and made him come over and say g'day to the Prime Minister. It was a great moment, and Lionel got his photo taken with the Prime Minister, and I am hoping that Lionel still votes for me in September. Nevertheless, he had his photo taken with the Prime Minister and it was a lovely moment. Lionel trained as a builder, he has gone off and worked in the mines and now he works as a cultural liaison officer with the Department of Sustainability and Environment. He has been a terrific role model for other young Aboriginal people in the Gippsland region. He has raised three successful children who have all done well in both their education and their employment. I wonder many times, when we see the extent of Aboriginal disadvantage and Indigenous disadvantage in my community, what he would have achieved and what his brothers, sisters and kin would have achieved without Uncle Jack and Aunty Edna's guidance. 


What was great about that relationship was that it provided structure to their lives, and for a lot of Aboriginal people in my electorate there is a lack of structure. They lack positive role models. There is, unfortunately, an intergenerational welfare dependency which has developed over 20 or 30 years, and it is a blight on our community that we have not been able to help these people and rescue these people from their perilous situation. So I welcome this opportunity in this place to talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives but in doing so I hope that we continue to remember that the these fine words we hear in this place need to be backed up with action on the ground.


It concerned me as I prepared my notes for this evening's comments that, with the exception of the member for Hasluck, we have a lot of white voices in this place talking about Aboriginal issues and not enough Aboriginal people themselves in this building making a contribution to our nation's great democracy. I thought rather than just have me talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives, I would ask a few of the Aboriginal people in my community for their comments on how they thought we were progressing after five years. I asked several people in the community for their responses, and they were generally quite positive in the fact that they thought we were making progress and that we were actually heading in the right direction with the Closing the Gap initiatives. But there was, of course, a cautionary note that more needs to be done. 


One of the young men I spoke to was a fella by the name of Will Carter. Will, typical of a lot of the Aboriginal boys in my community, is a gun footballer. In fact, I think he has won quite a few club best and fairests and a couple of league best and fairests as well. Will now works in the employment industry for young people, not just Indigenous people but other young people as well. He says, in relation to Closing the Gap, that it does have the right intentions—he is heartened by that. But he says that there needs to be more of a focus on the placement into jobs with the generous employers that have been so willing to be part of something so big and there are other ways it could be better approached in terms of getting the major multinationals like Coles and Woolworths involved more directly in our community. I take up Will's suggestion that the major multinationals have a lot more to offer in making sure Indigenous young people have the opportunity to get casual work and then go on to full-time employment.


He also makes the point, and I think it is a very good point, that Reconciliation Week and other activities need to be driven by the young Aboriginal people in our community. The best place to start is the education system. He believes there are great opportunities to ensure that young Indigenous people still appreciate their own culture but also have the willingness and expectation they will gain paid employment.


Some comments I received were from a lady by the name of Aunty Phyllis Andy. Aunty Phyllis is an absolute doyenne of my local community and an elder of the local Aboriginal people. She works with the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association and makes the point that the East Gippsland region is going from strength to strength but trying to deal with the demands of health, housing and education has become very difficult for the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association. She calls on both state and federal governments to renew their focus in the growing health needs of our community.


The last person I consulted was a fellow by the name of Wayne Thorpe, who does some great work in my community. I will quote directly from Wayne's brief email to me.


As my uncle said to me, which way is best for Aboriginal people? One way open the gap. Culture will close the gap for our people. Kids need to learn culture as well as adults. We have tried the Australian western values. It is Aboriginal culture that will fill the empty void created in our lives. When our cultural beliefs are respected and are part of our daily lives then we can engage in the other cultures of Australia.


That was from Wayne Thorpe, who is a traditional custodian of the Gunai people. These are wise words from people in my community. The general response I receive is that we are making progress. It has been a long journey and it has been extremely painful at times, but we must continue to work together for the benefit not just of Indigenous people but of the broader Australian nation. I commend the motion to the House.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr McCLELLAND
 (Barton) (20:12):  I start by commending the member for Gippsland. I thought that was an outstanding contribution. In my 17 years, as of 2 March this year, in federal parliament, I have not sensed such a unity between the parties on any issue as on this issue. I think it is a great thing for our country and it is an opportunity to take some really significant steps. We have done a lot, but there is a long way to go. My contribution today will focus on what I believe to be a necessity in the Closing the Gap targets—that is, added to those six specific targets, we should be adding the target of reducing both victimisation and incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.


In terms of victimisation, statistics show that Indigenous people are almost twice as likely as non-Indigenous people to have been a victim of physical or threatened violence. Indigenous women are 31 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be admitted to hospital for injuries caused by assault. Their children are 31 times more likely to witness their mum, their grandma or their sister being the victim of an assault than the broader Australian community. In remote areas Indigenous people are hospitalised as a result of family violence at 35 times the rate of the rest of Australia. In Indigenous communities the victim and offender are intimate partners 60 per cent of the time as compared to 24 per cent of the time for non-Indigenous Australians. Indeed, in the case of homicides, similarly, 60 per cent of homicides in Indigenous communities are between intimate partners whereas it is one-quarter of the homicides in the broader community. These are appalling figures, and there is no question that the people who commit those crimes should be incarcerated. That is unquestionably an appropriate response to those crimes.


Equally, we need to assess whether our strategies are appropriately graduated. There is a strong argument that high levels of incarceration, particularly for minor offences such as traffic offences and non-payment of fines, may ultimately undermine our objective of safer communities. For instance, in New South Wales I think you have to get about 120 hours of driving experience up before you get a licence. The expense of that for some members of Indigenous communities is prohibitive. If they are at a remote location and they require transport, whatever may be the need of the journey, they will frequently drive unlicensed. The consequence of that is a fine if they are apprehended. The consequence of non-payment of those fines, in some states at least, can be incarceration. There are strategies in place, and a number of volunteers are now in Indigenous communities teaching young people to drive, to prevent the rate of fines and, consequently in some communities, incarceration. That is a lateral approach to imprisoning young people because they are driving without a licence.


I can give you some of the percentages in terms of the broader community. Today Indigenous Australians make up only 2.5 per cent of the population but they account for 26 per cent of the adult prison population. The incarceration rate of Indigenous adults is 14 times higher than non-Indigenous adults. Between 2000 and 2010 the rate at which Indigenous women were incarcerated increased by 58 per cent. That is, in our most recent past decade, the rate of incarceration of Indigenous women increased by 50 per cent. The rate at which Indigenous men are incarcerated increased by over a third to 35 per cent.


Of greatest concern, however, is that those figures are even higher for Indigenous juveniles. Only five per cent of young Australians are Indigenous, but half of the young people in detention—in prison and juvenile detention—are Indigenous. Indeed, Indigenous young Australians are 28 times more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous Australians. We have apologised, and we had reason to apologise, for the stolen generation. We are at the precipice of a lost generation because of the rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In fact, Indigenous young people are more likely to be incarcerated today than at any time since the release of the reports of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody more than 20 years ago. In other words, the situation is getting worse; it is not getting better, and this is not good enough.


Experts have talked about the marginal effect of incarceration in terms of reducing crime. Indeed, evidence suggests today that excessive imprisonment rates, particularly for those relatively minor offences that I have referred to—fine default, traffic offences and so forth—may actually cause more crime in the longer term. Professor Dave Brown, who must be getting on a bit because he taught me at university, makes the point that prisons can become schools of crime which result in the fracturing of family and community ties, hardening and brutalisation, and poor mental health outcomes for those who have been incarcerated. After an offender is released they are likely to have lost essential life skills, have an increased reliance on criminal networks that they have built up in prison, and experience reduced employment opportunities and access to social programs. This is a profound and worrying situation in Indigenous communities because it simply leads to recidivism, where they go around the cycle again and then end up in either juvenile detention or prison. Prof. Brown also points out that studies have shown that there may be a tipping point for certain communities where, once incarceration reaches a certain level, crime in the community will actually increase. Instead of it being a deterrent, it becomes a rite of passage where it is an expectation—or indeed a thing of pride—to have served your time in prison, as opposed to what we know: that prison should be very much a deterrent and very much the local community saying that this conduct is unacceptable. 


Concerningly and tragically, this trend is intergenerational. The Corrective Services NSW Women's Advisory Council's submission to the Doing Time inquiry, which was a report of this parliament—and I commend that report to all members; I think it is an outstanding report—gave the account of one of their experts. The expert said, 'When I was going to Mulawa prison,'—this is the women's prison—'a young woman came up to me and introduced me to her mother and grandmother, who were also incarcerated.' Three generations: grandmother, mother and child were incarcerated. They had all been in custody and were all in Mulawa, in the women's jail, together. It was not remarkable to them; it was simply something that happens. That is three generations, all living generations, incarcerated in the women's prison—and I spoke earlier about the rates of incarceration of Indigenous women increasing 50 per cent from the period 2000 to 2010. If we do not turn these trends around it is difficult to see—if not impossible to see—how we are going to make the other Closing the Gap targets in terms of health, in terms of education and in terms of employment if we do not have functional communities.


In the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap speech she referred to the need for there to be an availability of places in educational institutions, and the Leader of the Opposition said that yes, there needed to be places in those educational institutions for young people. But he went a step further: he said that there need to be places and those kids needed to turn up. I say that they are both right, but I go a step further: not only do they need to turn up, but they need to be functional—and I can give you a firsthand example of that. When I was Attorney-General, I was taken on a tour of Kununurra one evening by police officers in Western Australia. The first thing those police officers did was take me where there were Indigenous youths on the streets—some as young as seven, they pointed out to me. The police were obviously worried about that because of the welfare of the young people, but also from the point of view of what those bored young people may get up to on the street. The next thing they did was take me to their homes a few blocks away, and that provided the answer: drunkenness was rife, with all its associated ugly antisocial behaviour; the noise, the tension—quite frankly, the sense of bedlam—was profound. I am not a small person, but there is no way that I would have walked down those streets. In fact, it was distressing to see that those hardened police officers became quite emotional in advising me that the kids we saw in the streets had to wait until alcohol induced sleep had set in before venturing back through the streets to their homes. Yet those kids were expected to turn up at school the following day and be functional. Clearly, in the circumstances that I saw, that was going to be an impossibility.


There are a number of successful programs. Indeed, in Kununurra, I was able to fund a program that was a drop-in centre so kids, instead of being on the street, could drop into the centre; that is one of the advantages of being a minister. I returned 12 months later and saw the centre up and running. It was pointed out to me that the cost to government of the centre was some $200,000 a year. It was pointed out to me at the same time that the cost of the centre, with capacity for 50 kids to drop in, was the cost of incarcerating one Indigenous youth. That was an example of a successful program and there are obviously more sophisticated programs to prevent recidivism that require the intervention of social workers, employment experts and so forth. 


There are a number of very successful programs around. As the member for Gippsland pointed out, the vital importance of those programs is that they are being developed in partnership with Indigenous communities. My fundamental point is this: there are many, many examples of very successful programs, but unless and until we make a specific target for Closing the Gap to reduce rates of victimisation—that is, people who are victims of crime—and rates of incarceration of Indigenous Australians, we have Buckley's of making the other Closing the Gap targets.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (20:26):  In my contribution I will not recount some of the known challenges that we as a nation face in ensuring that our Indigenous brothers and sisters achieve all that they are capable of doing. I hope to point to some opportunities that would bring about the kind of change that we all aspire to but in some respects the Closing the Gap account provided to the parliament reflects modest progress in these areas.


The speeches delivered by the parliamentary leaders were excellent. I am reflecting primarily on the Leader of the Opposition's eloquent words about the importance of work. Some years ago I had the honour and privilege of being concurrently the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs with oversight responsibilities for AusAID and the Parliamentary Secretary for Indigenous Affairs. One thing that frankly bewildered me was why the two policy groups did not speak more with each other to learn from each other's experiences and draw insights and inspiration from what was succeeding. As I represented our nation at the millennium development goal discussions, I had the honour and privilege of speaking in Jakarta for our region and at the UN headquarters in New York about progress. There I could point to the hundreds of millions of citizens in our region that had lifted their lives out of poverty. There was no magic bullet to doing that. It was enabled by the only durable strategy in human history that has ever worked—that is, sustainable economic growth.


One can transfer wealth between peoples or countries and that may mitigate some of the harm you see from abject poverty and many of the social challenges that have been discussed in this debate. But to achieve a durable lift in opportunity, in quality of life, in incomes and in living standards there is no substitute for economic growth. That was clear when we applied our policy minds and rigour to our overseas development assistance, but it seems to be something that we were not prepared to talk about in our own poverty alleviation and hardship challenges here. It was as if what worked for the away game we could not talk about for the home game. To this day, I remain bewildered about that disconnect—where the learnings are not cross-pollinating between our poverty alleviation and hardship actions overseas and what we do at home.


As I listened to the eloquent words of the Leader of the Opposition, it reminded me of a few insights that I gained over that time—insights that I urge the government today to embrace with much more vigour than I have seen to date. They were simple concepts that there is more opportunity to contribute to the economy than simply working for someone else. The Leader of the Opposition spoke eloquently about FMG and Twiggy Forrest's strategy, where he said, 'If I have the jobs I can train people for them.' That was an excellent insight into the matching exercise that is so crucial to having people see a pathway for their own improvement—in fact, how they can achieve their own sense of economic independence and individual self-determination.


It was contrasted with some of the aid initiatives, particularly in the Pacific, where we were training people for jobs that did not exist. It was a cruel hoax on people, to urge them to engage in study and training for years when there were no economic opportunities for which those learnings and skills could be applied when they completed their courses of study. Twiggy Forrest's and FMG's approach says, 'We have jobs; we will prepare people for them.'


But one thing that I am urging the government to take a look at, recognising the resourcefulness and resilience of Indigenous people and Indigenous communities, is the delicious opportunity for self-employment and small business formation. I know through my travels that major investments in communities with significant Indigenous populations would be welcomed more warmly where there were Indigenous economic opportunities arising from that investment. I know that even from CDEP programs, where you see Indigenous people engaged in support for their communities, they are using the very same skills which, if supported by appropriate guidance, advice and qualification recognition, could see those very same participants transform themselves into small business people—to be self-employed. This could transform, say, some home maintenance work in a CDEP program into a home maintenance business. Yet where is the support for that kind of transformation? Where is the effort for the Indigenous community to activate and to make their own self-employment and small business opportunities in our country and, in particular, in our regions?


I am concerned, and I think a lot of it is because the government, through its own rhetoric, often would not know enterprise if they fell over it. There is this conception that the only modality of economic contribution is a person working for somebody else. Yet we know that the entrepreneurs, the self-employed and the independent contractors are crucial to our economic prospects—the courageous men and women of small business who take risks to create opportunities for themselves and for those around them, and who add an economic vitality to their communities.


That is why I pay tribute to Debbie Barwick—she is the chairperson of the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce—and to Professor Dennis Foley. He is a professor of Indigenous research at the University of Newcastle. They have been onto this for some time, and I hope their efforts get more encouragement than has been seen to date.


There is scope for it within existing funding. I am not here saying that there needs to be more money thrown at a policy solution that is not proven: no, that is not right at all. There are resources available—there is a head nod to this opportunity—but it is all backswing and no follow through. There is a need to follow through on some of the glib terminology that surrounds some program description that talks to self-employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship but then does not result in any meaningful and sustained engagement and support to see it actually materialise.


In the area of the Indigenous employment program there was a notional thought that about 80 per cent of that funding should go to employment and about 20 per cent to economic development—supporting the infrastructure that enables Indigenous people to create their own opportunities and their own businesses, and to give method and structure to their own instinctive entrepreneurial characteristics. We believe that, instead of that 80 per cent to 20 per cent split, about 97 per cent of that funding is going to employment programs and a small fraction, around three per cent, is going to economic development. Yet—I go back to my original observation—economic growth has been proven throughout the ages to be the only durable way of sustainably lifting economic opportunities and alleviating poverty.


Why has the government frozen some Indigenous economic initiatives? Organisations have gone through extensive tender processes to get on panels, to have someone to hear them, only to be told that the government is not in a position to support them, and that there has been overspending in some areas—an excessive commitment of resources to employment and nothing left in the cupboard to support economic development. Big, profitable companies have been supported in implementing employment strategies, yet we have not seen any support of substance going to organisations like the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce, a trusted, active and proven organisation to which Indigenous people can turn to support their own small business formation and self-employment opportunities.


Parliamentary inquiries have identified this opportunity, yet the support is not there. Even the 2008 draft, through to the 2011-18 Indigenous Economic Development Strategy under priority 4, supported the need for a commitment to organisations and agencies that could provide a one-stop shop to support Indigenous people in organising themselves and engaging with commercial opportunities, with self-employment and with small business start-ups. Yet that head nod, that acknowledgement, has not been followed through with resources. This is not to discount the action needed to alleviate the harm that others have talked about. This is about constructive steps to restore the hope that things can be better, to provide a purpose for learning that might see academic participation increase and to provide context and meaning to the encouragement from, for example, the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, in his observation about joining up the Closing the Gap education initiative to encourage a greater degree of vocational and higher education participation.


It is about saying enterprise and self-employment is crucial to the economic future of the Indigenous community but it needs support. There is chapter and verse on how—and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, in their inquiry into being 'open for business', developing Indigenous enterprises in Australia, showed this—big corporates would love to interact with Indigenous enterprises as part of their rounded approach to their economic life and to the key performance indicators they communicate to their shareholders, and on the idea of Indigenous business chambers, hubs and one-stop shop models. This is supported by the Minerals Council, which points to that very policy measure as being crucial in ensuring that small businesses are run, owned, operated and guided to the benefit of Indigenous people and in ensuring that Indigenous people are able to take up economic opportunities.


In Message Stick's submission to the committee inquiry, Michael McLeod and Dug Russell, talk about the need for government to understand business and entrepreneurship and to put in place support programs that would see young Indigenous people not only recognise sporting excellence as a way out or an opportunity for individual self-determination and economic independence but also celebrate the heroes of Indigenous business. Young Indigenous boys and girls would be able to see someone had already walked that path and created opportunities for themselves and their communities. It is a grossly underdone area of the suite of policy tools that are broadly badged as the Closing the Gap initiatives. I urge the government to get behind that excellent work that Debbie Barwick and Professor Dennis Foley have undertaken.


In the few minutes that are left I want to point to another area where I think there is great hope, and that is private sector collaboration. I touched on it in terms of enterprise, entrepreneurship and self-employment, but I will go further. In my own community, two outstanding local people, Mr and Mrs Paul Williams, are providing Indigenous education opportunities through their philanthropic efforts in the Woomera Educational Scholarship Trust. This is a remarkable, selfless and generous statement by two local members of our community who have been very successful in their business careers and accumulated wealth that they want to put to virtuous and worthy causes. They have chosen to provide outstanding educational opportunity for young Indigenous people at some of the nation's leading schools, in particular the Peninsula School in my electorate of Dunkley.


They provide for tuition support where Indigenous people, largely from the north-west of Western Australia, come as boarders. The private trust also has to fund travel home for students who would otherwise be eligible for ABSTUDY and therefore able to reach out for travel expenses to return to their families with stories of their educational success and to reconnect with their communities where they are outstanding role models and inspirations. Yet if that same opportunity was funded publicly that travel expense would be funded and supported by the taxpayer.


I think that private philanthropy which provides world-class education opportunities for Indigenous students should be supported, whether it is funded by the taxpayer or by remarkable individuals like Mr and Mrs Williams. I have written to Minister Garrett saying this has to be a bureaucratic oversight, that surely we want to support this sort of private initiative. Doing so would open up an opportunity to provide another scholarship for another young Indigenous person to go back to their community as a remarkable role model and a statement of what application and commitment and making the best of the opportunities within your reach can do for you. That is a message I would like to see more of in Indigenous communities. There are some examples.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (20:41):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate in response to the Prime Minister's report to the parliament on the Closing the Gap report for 2012. The annual report to parliament has occurred each year since Prime Minister Rudd offered the official apology to the stolen generation on behalf of the nation in 2007. I was very pleased, as I am sure many of us were, to have been able to be present in the chamber on this very significant and moving occasion. At the time I said:


… there is so much that was stolen because of these policies and it is so important that we reach out. We do … through to an ongoing commitment to make sure that Aboriginal people's opportunities in our country are improved.


I finished my contribution with the comments of many of my local constituents who also wished to express their support for the apology and the commitment to closing the gap. I concluded:


There is no doubt that each of us in this place will be particularly keenly endorsing and supporting the current government's commitments to closing the gap so that the apology issued last Wednesday will actually be the beginning of a whole new period for Indigenous Australians and an opportunity for them to take some of the many privileges that are their rights as citizens of this nation.


In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a set of targets which included firstly, the close the life expectancy gap within a generation—that is, by 2031; secondly, to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018; thirdly, to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013; fourthly, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for children by 2018; fifthly, to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 and, finally, to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018.


Subsequent to the apology and the COAG agreement, both Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard have provided a full report to the parliament on the release of the Closing the Gap report each year. On 6 February this year, Prime Minister Gillard provided the most recent accounting for 2012. 


In introducing her report, she told the House:


Closing the Gap is a plan of unprecedented scale and ambition, a plan not only to uplift the lives of Indigenous Australians but to do so in a shared endeavour of partnership and respect. That high level of ambition commits us to two decades of annual reckoning until we bridge the gulf that stands between us. Few if any of the men and women who sit in this parliament today will still be here when a future Prime Minister delivers the final Closing the Gap statement in 2031. A short walk to this despatch box that we hope will mark the end of a monumental journey. Wherever we are on that day, the people of this land will want to hear one thing. That we have, at last, accorded Indigenous Australians the health care, education, job opportunities and community services they deserve.


This is a legacy that I am sure any of us would be pleased to see outlive each of our individual careers.


This is a significant year. As the Closing the gap report identifies, it is the 20th anniversary of the Native Title Act being passed, it is the fifth anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations and it is the year in which the first of the targets set back in 2008 will be achieved: ensuring all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years—that is, by 2013. In her speech, the Prime Minister reported that the Closing the Gap target, for all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities to have access to early childhood education, will be achieved this year. This is particularly important, as it is well established that the early years are critical to the establishment of healthy, happy children and that being well-prepared for formal education is an invaluable investment that more than returns the cost of the investment.


The Closing the gap report itself identifies that children who attend quality preschool programs are more likely to be successful at school, stay in school longer, continue on to further education and training, and fully participate in employment and community life as adults. The report identifies the following achievements:


Data from 2011 reveals that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas are enrolled in a preschool program. This data, consistent with the governments' commitment regarding delivery, indicates that the target of 95 per cent enrolment will be met this year. The Government is working with Indigenous communities, large and small, to ensure children are enrolled in school and get to school and that the benefits of attendance are realised. Providing access to quality preschool programs is an important basis for better school attendance.


I am personally very interested in the education based targets for the reason that educational achievement is inextricably linked to overall improvement in life outcomes. The report on the fifth target tells us:


Results from the 2011 Census show the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Year 12 or equivalent attainment is narrowing. In 2011, the proportion of Indigenous 20-to-24-year-olds with at least Year 12 or Certificate II was 53.9 per cent—a 6.5 percentage point increase on 2006. This means progress against the target of halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is ahead of schedule.


The report continues in addressing the fourth target, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous within a decade:


… between 2008 and 2012 the percentage of Indigenous students at or above the National Minimum Standards in Year 3 Reading increased by 5.9 percentage points. However, overall progress is mixed. Of the eight cases where the NAPLAN results in 2012 can be compared to the progress points set for 2012, three results are above or close to the 2012 trajectory points. In the other five cases, progress will need to accelerate if the target is to be met.


In her speech, the Prime Minister reflected these mixed results, including the fact that 'in year 9 writing the 2012 gap is almost double that—35 percentage points' and that 'year 3 reading actually declined in 2012 after improving between 2008 and 2011'. The Prime Minister stated:


I cannot conceal that these literacy and numeracy results are a source of personal disappointment.


I feel that we would all share that disappointment and would have a determination to turn those results around and, very importantly, sustain the achievements that have been made.


The full report provides extensive details on the progress of all of the targets and the related initiatives aimed at achieving the target outcomes. I encourage members of the public who are interested in this issue to look at the full report. It is undoubtedly the case that health and life expectancy, housing and employment, and security and participation are all important components of a full life to which all Australians deserve access and which far too many Indigenous Australians are often blocked from achieving. To quote the Prime Minister once more, she said:


It is the work of an entire generation and work that has begun with us.


I feel that it is a heavy responsibility that we should gladly carry as it is inconceivable that we would put this task down and walk away, as too many have done in the past.


I commend the Closing the gap report to the House and, in particular, encourage people to remain committed to achieving the six targets, as I am sure that all in this House remain committed to their achievement.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (20:51):  I rise tonight to speak on the Prime Minister's speech on Closing the Gap. I would like to say from the outset that the Parkes electorate, after the seat of Lingiari, has more Aboriginal people than any other electorate in Australia. According to the 2011 census, there are 21,891 Aboriginal people in my electorate. I take the responsibility of representing those people in this place very seriously. I also take it as a great honour to represent those people. But, unfortunately, an Aboriginal boy born today in the electorate of Parkes has a life expectancy 15 years less than a white boy born on the same day. The median age of Aboriginal people in my electorate is just 21. That indicates that the life expectancy is, indeed, very short of the other end of the scale.


I have been the member for Parkes for just over five years. Achieving things for Aboriginal people in my electorate has been my greatest challenge. I do not take any joy in the fact that, of the things I do as a member of parliament—things we can all achieve as members of parliament—I should be doing a lot better for Aboriginal communities. When representing Aboriginal people, it is all about personal contact. People ask me what the views are of my Aboriginal community, and I say, 'I haven't got an Aboriginal community; I've got a hundred Aboriginal communities.' Each of those communities is individual: each has its own thoughts, aspirations and problems. The nominated targets for Closing the Gap are very relevant to the people that I represent. This is not all about bad news. There are a lot of good things happening in my electorate. The Aboriginal Employment Strategy, which has been very successful, was spawned in the town of Moree.


When I go around my schools, I see that the student leaders and some of the younger people are doing remarkable things. There was a young lad I first met when he was as a student at Moree High School. Last year he was a member of the youth parliament, and he came to Canberra and he mixed it with the best. He now works for a department here in Canberra and is into a successful career in the Public Service.


But, as we talk about Closing the Gap, I think we need to do a lot better. There have been some government decisions made over the last five years that have been detrimental to some of my communities—for instance, the removal of the CDEP. While it was far from perfect, and while it was never intended to be permanent employment and in some cases ended up being such, it was at least something. When the CDEP was removed from the village of Toomelah, the overall situation in that community deteriorated quite a lot. Unfortunately, quite often, from Canberra, we do things with lines on maps. In 2008 Toomelah and Gunnedah—which was then in my electorate—Narrabri and Moree were no longer considered to be remote and so CDEP would be removed. Now that line has moved further west and the communities of Coonamble, Walgett and Lightening Ridge are going through the same pain. While in theory it may be fine, and these services will be replaced by other providers, it does not take into account the personal relationships that are involved in providing these services. In all these country towns, the personal relationships that you build over a period of time are particularly important.


The other thing is that, if we are going to do the best thing by our Aboriginal people, we must not accept lower standards than we would for the rest of the community. By accepting lower standards and glossing over the problems, and praising things that are less than adequate, we disrespect those people we are trying to protect.


Unemployment is a big issue and is at the core of a lot of the problems in my communities. But it is not that there is a lack of work—unfortunately, the nature of my communities, and the nature of employment with agriculture, is such that a lot of the work that Aboriginal people did has now changed. The real challenge is to give the younger people the skills required to take up those positions. It is a great disappointment to me that we have people from all over the world working during the wheat and cotton harvest, and in the foundries, the workshops and the mechanical shops in my electorate that could be done by local people—but that has to be addressed through education.


I would like to speak about another couple of issues. One of the programs I am working on at the moment is in relation to the coalition's Green Army policy, should there be a change of government at the next election. I would be very keen for a training program, particularly the Boggabilla-Toomelah area, into full-time work in skills of resource management—weed control, river bank stabilisation: outdoor manual work that would be appropriate and that these people would enjoy. On the Macquarie River trails there is a great program, RiverSmart, looking at highlighting the benefits of the river, basically to help ensure the health of the river but also to promote it for tourism. It is a wonderful opportunity for Aboriginal employment, not only in constructing walkways and things like that, but also in guiding and tourism type work. That is something that I certainly hope we can get off the ground.


Another shining light in my electorate is the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College. The Seventh Day Adventist Church have constructed a boarding school at the village of Gongolgon which is about 100 kilometres south of Brewarrina on the Bogan River. I went to the opening of the school and I was very, very impressed with what the Seventh Day Adventist Church are trying to achieve. They are drawing children, mainly from disadvantaged families and dysfunctional homes, from right across eastern Australia and the children are going to the school in the middle of, basically, nowhere. Those school children went to Canberra last year. They were well presented, enthusiastic and keen to learn about our parliament. They were as good as any school that I have escorted around this building. They were a real credit to the teachers and staff at the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College, and those boys and girls were also a credit to themselves. That college is in danger of closing. They were hoping for some sort of financial assistance, maybe through Aboriginal Hostels Limited, particularly from the government to keep going. They will be in Parliament House tomorrow or the day after for some meetings to try and obtain funding assistance to keep the school open. That is real benefit and real achievement and is making a difference in these young people's lives.


I would like to close by speaking about the Clontarf Foundation. I have just come from a function where the Governor-General was the special guest as the Patron of the Clontarf Foundation. Of all the programs I have seen since I have been an member of parliament in any sphere I have never seen a program that has been more successful in obtaining the outcomes that they desire than the Clontarf Foundation. The foundation have four academies in my electorate that have been open for less than 12 months. Last Tuesday morning I had the privilege of attending the Clontarf Academy in Moree. I went on the bus with the tutors and we picked up the kids from their homes. The sun was not up—it was pitch black—but the kids were ready to go. We had an hour of training in rugby league. It started off in Perth with Aussie Rules but it has been adapted in New South Wales to Rugby League.


Twelve months ago many of the boys were not attending school. One boy had missed a whole year of school. They were now enthusiastic and were attending school. They were polite and respectful and they had a real purpose in their lives. As a member of parliament very rarely do you actually get to see a program that works like that. There are many places where the Clontarf Foundation could roll out. At the moment, I think, there are 9,000 boys in the academies across Australia. The foundation have identified double that number that could benefit from the academy. I would recommend all members in this place to look at the work of the Clontarf Foundation. There is a great potential to help the boys in Dubbo, Wellington, Nyngan, Cobar, Lake Cargelligo, Condobolin, Narrabri, Walgett and any other number of possibilities. Tonight we heard from a man, Geoffrey, who is 28 and who started with the academy as a teenager. He was a wayward Aboriginal boy and is now fully employed as a boilermaker working in a mine. He has a partner and two children. The Clontarf Foundation have helped him all along the way and now he is being a real father to his son and daughter. He spoke tonight—and it is as good a speech as I have ever heard in this place—about his lifelong journey from an errant boy who was not attending school to a proud father with full-time employment raising two children in Western Australia, if anyone wants an endorsement of what this can do.


The apology given by Kevin Rudd in 2008 is still very special to the Aboriginal people in my electorate. They talk about it still. That was a milestone. But we really need to embrace programs that work. We need to accept no less a standard for our Aboriginal brothers and sisters than we do for ourselves, and we need to put our energy, our emotion and our commitment into genuinely closing the gap so that by the time these children are adults the Aboriginal community and the Australian community are one, in every aspect of their lives.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (21:05):  I want to commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their fine speeches in parliament in relation to Closing the Gap targets, delivered annually. Across Australia, according to Reconciliation Australia, governments spend about $25 billion a year on programs aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. But, sadly, the trust between both groups is still too low, and there is still perceived prejudice between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Nearly half of all Australians believe it is harder to achieve success if you are an Indigenous person.


But we have seen some improvements. We have seen betterment of our Indigenous brothers and sisters, but it has been too slow—painfully slow. We have seen reconciliation action plans initiate so many improvements in the lives of people, and I commend those companies—there are currently about 358 organisations with reconciliation action plans. These are focused on employment, Indigenous business and education, and there are even pro bono organisations. There are others concerned with cultural competency. It is known that reconciliation action plans improve the contact between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The attitudes—the pride, the prejudice—will go. And they improve trust. As the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the House of Representatives, along with the deputy chair, the member for Murray, I have written to the presiding officers because there is no reconciliation action plan in this parliament. We are urging the presiding officers to think of a reconciliation action plan for this particular place.


There are a number of other things I want to say, but first I want to mention the fine speech by the former Attorney-General, the member for Barton, and commend him on his 25th Lionel Murphy lecture: 'Vigilance against injustice in the justice system'. As I heard him speaking tonight I recognised the tenor of that speech. I commend to those who may be listening, and to other members, this fantastic speech by the former Attorney-General in relation to the challenges regarding the injustice that is experienced by Indigenous Australians.


When we did the Doing time—time for doing report we discovered, as the member for Barton said, that in the 20 years since the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody the condition and situation for Indigenous Australians has got worse. Indigenous juveniles are 28 times as likely to be in detention as non-Indigenous juveniles. Indigenous juveniles make up more than one-half of the detainee population on any given day in Australia. Indigenous young adults are 15 times as likely to be in prison as non-Indigenous young adults. Sadly, the dysfunction continues across generations: poverty, despair and despondency—simply the expectation that as a rite of passage you would visit and live with your parents and grandparents in incarceration premises.


We made many recommendations in our report. These were motivated by the prisoner census data, which show that between 2000 and 2010 the number of Indigenous men and women in custody increased by 55 per cent in the case of men and 47 per cent in the case of women, and also that if you were an Indigenous woman you were 35 times as likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse as a non-Indigenous woman.


We made many recommendations to the government: endorsing justice targets that states and territories in the Commonwealth could come to, supporting an inclusion of safe community building blocks, and also putting serious money towards getting agreement across the jurisdictions for this. We also recognised the social norms that impacted families and communities through mentoring, sport and recreation: the fact that there were fewer people able to be mentors to Indigenous boys particularly; the fact that FASD—foetal alcohol spectrum disorder—was such a curse, particularly in Indigenous communities. I commend to the government the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, chaired by the member for Moreton, and its many recommendations in relation to FASD—a report which flowed from our Doing time report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I commend the many recommendations made. The idea that finally FASD be recognised as a registered disability—that is, a condition for eligibility for support services in health and education systems—is something which needs to be done in this country.


We also need to look at better alternatives to Indigenous young people entering the criminal justice system. We need a more holistic intervention. The New Zealanders had Maori youth courts. We have not got much empirical evidence across the Tasman, but we can certainly see that the anecdotal evidence supports alternative systems for Indigenous people. Sadly—I did not intend to make a political speech here—the Murri courts in my home state of Queensland have been closed down by the LNP state government. This is a terribly retrograde step, a really bad result for the Queensland community, and I think it is going to cost the Queensland community not only in dollars but also in social justice.


We need to make sure that we look at education. One of the things we discovered was that schools which were connected to Indigenous communities did better—their kids did better. A perfect example of that is in my community. We have a very large Indigenous community in Ipswich; we have Indigenous medical centres and schools, but Leichardt State School—Lee Gerchow is the principal there—is probably as well connected to its 25 per cent Indigenous school population as any other school in Ipswich. The school's improved results since its better connection with the Indigenous community are outstanding. We have put a lot of money in there—$723,000 recently for support programs, mentoring and cultural improvements—but that is because the school took the initiative; that is important. We should focus more upon that in our school communities. Simple things like amplification devices in schools—too many Indigenous young people cannot hear properly, and we need to think seriously about that; more school pools and better pools and recreation facilities in Indigenous communities. Things like alternative accommodation—we found that too often Indigenous people had nowhere to go so were kept in detention—and alternatives for bail so that they can get out. We do not have the data collection in this country to see the full extent of the challenges we face. The member for Barton, in his fine speech in the Lionel Murphy lecture, talks about these issues. The government has taken up many of these things that we have recommended, and I urge it to be more vigilant about those sorts of things.


One of the things that our committee has recommended—the government is yet to respond; it is to do with Closing the Gap—deals with a report called Our land our languages. We dealt with what Paul Keating said in his Redfern speech:


… bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans …


Mabo was a very controversial decision on 3 June 1992. At the time of white settlement in this country, there were 250 Indigenous languages; there are now only 18 viable Indigenous languages in this country spoken across all generations. We have not done enough maintenance on the revitalisation of Indigenous languages. There is so much more that we can do.


In our report Our land our languages, we made an number of recommendations, including the recommendation to:


… include in the Closing the Gap framework acknowledgement of the fundamental role and importance of Indigenous languages in preserving heritage and improving outcomes for Indigenous peoples.


We have recommended twice now—twice—a national Indigenous interpreter service. We did it in our Doing time report—it had been done 20 years before in a previous parliamentary report—and we did it again in Our land our languages. We recommended to the government a national interpreter service, and I urge the government to think about this. Too many people go to jail, too many people get poor diagnoses on health outcomes—go to the Northern Territory and you will find this—and too many kids have an inadequate education because we have not got a national interpreter service. We need that, and we have recommended it to the government in the Our land our languages and Doing time reports.


We have, through the Doing time report, come up with another inquiry—it is underway and we are going to report in May—that is, the role of sport in closing the gap. The participation rate in sport for non-Indigenous Australians is 74.3 per cent, while, sadly, it is only 65.5 per cent for Indigenous Australians. The difference is even worse for Indigenous women. The reality is that not enough sporting organisations have reconciliation plans. The evidence we have heard in the public hearings is that the AFL and the NRL are doing a great job; they are doing great work. Some of the sporting organisations, at our public hearings and on the public record, could not even tell us how many Indigenous people play their sports. They could not tick a box; they could not tell us what efforts they were making to help Indigenous young people. There is not enough sporting equipment—not enough barbells and dumbbells, tennis courts, pools, football fields and basketball courts, not enough basketballs and footballs—and sporting organisations just go in there, fly-in fly-out, do a clinic, and then go away and leave these people on their own again.


Not enough effort is being made in sport to close the gap. I look forward to our report and deliberations. I expect it to be a bipartisan report, as were the other two. The member for Murray has been a tremendous advocate in this area; we have worked very closely on this issue. I expect some very strong recommendations from this committee in relation to this issue, but we have a lot to do. It is not just about plucking elite athletes from Far North Queensland and the Northern Territory to go and play in the NRL and the AFL; there is a lot more that we can do.


The member for Dunkley mentioned business. We are doing a lot in helping business. In my area, we have an Indigenous Business Enterprise Centre established with seed funding from DEEWR—federal government funding. We have seen 85 Indigenous people go into full-time work in 18 months in my community; the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre has an Indigenous focus as well. I want to give an example of a particular individual. I am proud to say I have his painting of honey ants in my electorate office. His name is Robin 'Tallman' Wakkajinda and he is a local artist. He had drug problems and he had alcohol problems. He comes from Gayndah, from the Wakka Wakka Jinda tribe. He is a mentor. This fellow is a fantastic artist. He has turned his life around with the support of the local IBEC. He is a business success. I was pleased to be there with the Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, to help open Robin's exhibition of his paintings at the Old Ipswich Courthouse. They are brilliant. I have seen this fellow go around with young Indigenous people in my community. They love him. Sadly, he is disabled in his hand, but he is one of the most brilliant artists you could ever see. His artwork sells for lots of money and he has turned his life around. He is a business success. He has talent, and with the support of great people like Clive Pearce, from the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, he has succeeded. This is the sort of help that we can provide.


The funding was given via a flexible funding pool to develop and pilot a unique enterprise program in Ipswich. This is an Australian-first initiative, and that is what we have got to do. I am all for rights, but we have got to have responsibility as well. People have got to pick themselves up. We can give them a helping hand to do that and we have got to get them on their way. We live in a free enterprise economy. People want to develop their talents and their dreams and their potential, and 'Tallman' is a perfect example. If we do this across the country, the member for Dunkley will be proved wrong. We can do it. We should fund it. Have a look at those reports. We should support the likes of the IBEC in Ipswich with additional funding. It is an Australian first. This should be a prototype for Indigenous business enterprise centres across the country. We should do it. I commend the Closing the Gap target. This will help in closing the gap if we do it across the country.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2013-03-12,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (21:20):  Regardless of where Australians live, there is little doubt they are moved by the plight of Indigenous Australia. Attitudes and knowledge vary markedly from our major cities where many people have met few Aboriginals and have little firsthand knowledge of the issues and circumstances facing people of Aboriginal descent, to regional towns and outback communities where residents deal with the reality of Indigenous communities living within their midst, with both the successes—and there are many—and the excesses and failures of the system and individuals and the penalties the larger community pays for those failures.


It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister report the increase in mainstream Indigenous employment from 42.4 per cent in 2006 to 44.7 per cent in 2012. While I have no hard figures to back this up, I think I can see small but positive improvement in my major regional communities, in places like Port Lincoln, Port Augusta and Ceduna, where there is apparent growth in Aboriginal families with mum or dad, or both, at work, living in better housing, driving better cars and getting their children to school. There is still quite a way to go in many instances, but I sense that progress is being made.


Employment is simply one of the most important, if latter, keys to the puzzle. I say 'latter' because long-term productive employment is very difficult to achieve if an individual has poor education, poor language skills and a negative experience of being raised in a dysfunctional household. This is no truer with Indigenous communities than with the population at large. Not having a stable and loving household, good language skills and a reasonable education does not mean an individual cannot break the barriers and become a productive, fully integrated member of our society, but it elevates the degree of difficulty many times. So while the apparent rise in employment is encouraging, it is a concern that by far the majority of Indigenous jobs are in the government sector and, more particularly, in the Aboriginal industry. That sector should play an important role, but we will never achieve true equality in Australia until the workforce is truly integrated. While we have jobs that are perceived as black or white, prejudices are reinforced rather than broken down. It is important for the general advancement of Indigenous Australians that they are seen as 100 per cent part of mainstream Australia, and to do so they need to be represented in the mainstream workforce at similar levels to the mainstream population. However, I add a point of balance and congratulate those in the resources sector who have made a dedicated effort to raise Indigenous employment.


Overall, I am more encouraged than discouraged with the progress in employment in regional centres. However, it is in the remote communities where I fear outcomes are at best stagnant. All of the remote Indigenous communities in South Australia are in my electorate. Aboriginal communities like Oak Valley and Yalata in the west, Nepabunna in the central region and the APY lands in the far north are joined by regular towns of mixed populations like Coober Pedy, Oodnadatta and Marree. In all, those who identify as Aboriginal in my electorate make up about seven per cent of the population, or 10,000 persons. Of that, about 4,000 live in remote communities. The biggest group of these live in remote, isolated Indigenous lands, and by far the best known of these are the Anangu, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands in the far north-western corner of the state, where about 2,500 people live. The APY lands are by no means the only area where the problems exist, but they are a very useful tool for assessing the issues facing communities closer to the mainstream because they are in every way isolated from the rest of the state. 


It is in the APY lands where the gap is the largest and, despite the very best efforts and an annual expenditure by the taxpayer of between $150 million and $250 million—it seems that no-one has any real idea how much—it is difficult to see progress. It is worth pointing out that this is around about $100,000 a head. Huge amounts have been invested in housing, schools and health clinics. While further housing would be desirable, these physical facilities are by and large very good—the kinds of facilities that most communities in Australia would be happy with. But it occurs to me that despite the best efforts of those who work within them, the net result in most cases is no improvement. There is a paradox that exists in these communities.


I try to visit the APY lands a couple of times a year. It is a one-week trip each time. My guess is that there are around about 80 different organisations on the lands, government and non-government, all trying to make a contribution to improving the lot of the locals. When I speak to people from any of these organisations they give convincing and enthusiastic evidence that they are making a real difference and closing the gap, if you like. I must say that when I look at the work most times I am convinced. However—and here is the rub—if all these programs and organisations were doing such a good job, then why aren't we making progress? Why in most cases are things getting worse? Why are there communities that are theoretically at least alcohol free with still unacceptably high levels of alcohol- and drug-driven violence? Why is there sexual assault on minors, very poor school attendance, astronomical incidence rates of diseases like diabetes and impaired hearing in up to 95 per cent of the children?


Noel Pearson has argued far more eloquently than I ever will that the root cause of these evils is passive welfare. He is right. Helping people is a double-edged sword. When we assume responsibility for a commitment in a person's life that would normally be their responsibility, we diminish their future obligation to perform the task. Eventually, if we do it often enough, everything becomes the government's responsibility.


Apart from the art centres, there are almost no business enterprises on the lands that provide employment outcomes that are not dependent on government. They are the only businesses on the lands that produce a tradeable resource, thus actually providing genuine market-driven work-related income to the communities. In the very high expense environment of the APY lands, even the art centres are not able to be self-supporting industries and require ongoing taxpayer support. However, they are the best that we have and I congratulate them for their progress and sincerely hope that the market will continue to support the growth of these centres. Virtually all other jobs related to income come courtesy of the taxpayer in industries providing services to the rest of the population or in environment driven jobs where locals are funded to care for country.


It is worth noting as this parliament is presented with more legislation on native title that the APY lands are owned freehold by the communities. That is not title guaranteeing access, not traditional ownership and not pastoral leases but the most secure title to land available—freehold. It was gifted to the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara people by the Tonkin Liberal government in 1981. While I support Indigenous people to establish their links with the land, I send a strong word of caution to those who think that ownership in any form is the silver bullet that will address the breakdown of traditional culture. The APY lands are a 32-year demonstration that that is clearly not the case. In so many areas, things are no worse, and that is certainly in the area of employment, alcohol and drug abuse and levels of literacy.


In fact, in some ways I wonder if the granting of ownership has made things worse. One would wonder how that could possibly be. Perhaps there was an air of expectation that with ownership would come wealth and the work to generate that worth was expected to be performed by others. Certainly jobs on committees and on boards, accompanied by cars and travel benefits, are seen as real jobs. Jobs cleaning schools and health centres cannot be filled and have to be performed by teaching and medical staff. Perhaps it was the interfamily battles over the spoils that to this day debilitates attempts at governance. Appalling governance has led to repeated failures. The APY Lands Council, for instance, has once again just recently been bailed out by the state government to compensate for funds that have been lost to shoddy management.


If we are truly to close the gap, there must be a consolidation of the plethora of local boards ultimately funded by taxpayers on the lands. The amalgamated bodies must be given more responsibility but also face a far greater responsibility to meet the same demands of probity that local government must meet. If these bodies cannot meet those levels, as with any local government that suffers chronic failure, administration must be installed. Part of the malaise of remote Indigenous Australia is that we set a lower expectation of Indigenous communities. That is, we set the bar lower. Eventually this is totally unproductive and leads to accepting lower employment performance, lower standards in schools and lower levels of compliance with the law of the land. The idea that we accept this because people are Aboriginal is condescending. It is offensive and racist and should not be accommodated.


I will draw your attention to the schooling system for a short while. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on schools on the APY Lands—in one case as much as $4 million at a school which is now closed barely four years later. Yet for all this expenditure, according to the study collated by Professor Mark Hughes, an academic extremely well regarded in this area, South Australia is the worst performing state in Australia in Indigenous education, according to the NAPLAN information. The schools in themselves are fascinating and seem to be mostly staffed by dedicated teachers. Teacher-student ratios are extremely low. Breakfast and, in some cases, lunch programs are common. A plethora of travel, excursion and life education programs exist. Yet attendance rates are appalling.


The attendance issue is exacerbated by cultural activities, with perhaps the most disruptive and unpredictable being sorry camps. These camps are yet another example of how the culture of the Indigenous peoples has been distorted by its head-on collision with the modern world. I visited a sorry camp that had been sitting for almost 6 weeks, camped in the rubbish which accumulates around such camps and within 800 metres of a small town with running water, toilets, housing and showers that was empty for the duration. There were infants in the arms of mothers amongst the flies and filth, and children some hundreds of kilometres from home, absent for weeks from their normal schools. Traditionally, the deceased would have been buried within a day or two. The cultural guardians of the Anangu simply must sort this issue out, and I acknowledge that they are making some efforts to do so in this area.


To return to the schools, apart from sorry, attendance is still an issue, and I am pleased that at least there has been a move to income management on the lands, albeit as a voluntary model at this stage. More than 250 people have signed on to the program, and it is at least implied that the compulsory management may be enforced if parents fail to get their children to school, although it is yet to be seen whether governments are prepared to commit to the tough love required to enforce this outcome. I watch that space.


Classroom teachers are faced with the dilemma of trying to get children to school with no other incentive than making learning a fun experience with small bribes. It is concerning to see children dribbling into schools over an extended period in the morning. This is hardly an ideal start to the day. The problem with having to be constantly entertaining and fun is that the core tenets of education get demoted. This is a tragedy because we know that those lessons are the ones which will, in the long term, deliver the mainstream jobs that I spoke about earlier. I have spoken before in this place about my visit to Cape York, and I am very pleased the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is here to hear this. The Cape York Institute is run under the direct instruction method by Noel Pearson, and I can only say that all of Australia's remote communities should be interested in the package. I urge the South Australian government to at least make the package available at some trial sites in the state.


All of this raises this issue of the difficulty of ever closing the gap in this remote world where there is no genuine economy. Certainly we must support these communities and allow the adults of today to live their lives as best we can provide for. But every effort must be made to break the cycle and educate the next generation to equip the new generation, as Noel Pearson says, to walk in both worlds. That means having good English language skills. It means having strong basic maths and an understanding of the social demands of living in the outside community. Denying these children those keys means that they are tied to a region where there are few jobs, and it will condemn them to the uselessness of a life on welfare. I do not doubt the good intent of the political class in Australia to address the deep-seated problems of remote Indigenous Australia. But I think in so many cases we are addressing the symptoms rather than trying to apply a long-term vision to the issues at hand. What is needed is an independent analysis of the economic possibilities of the communities and honest assessments of the population these communities are capable of properly supporting, and then making appropriate and evidence-based decisions about their future. Maintaining, supporting and encouraging new generations to live in communities that cannot ever support them will not only destroy the individuals but will destroy the culture of those whose future we are seeking to advance.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (21:35):  I want to follow on from the member for Grey's contribution and spend a moment reflecting on and acknowledging some of those remarks that the member made. It is the case that he serves an electorate where there is a significant amount of social disadvantage amongst people, particularly those living on what is referred to as the APY lands. The member posed the question to the parliament: why aren't we making progress? He was also prudent enough to acknowledge that the political class, as he put it, does want to see delivery of greater achievement potential for people in regional and remote Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but thus far, notwithstanding the amounts have been appropriated to the goals and the many programs and efforts of a range of successive governments both at the national level and at the state level, we cannot say with any great degree of pride that we have succeeded.


I do not presume to have the intimate knowledge of the member's electorate that he has, but I think part of the answer, particularly when we look at the educational attainment levels of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities, is the remoteness. The fact is that Aboriginal people are in a particularly difficult situation if they are still living effectively within clan culture on country and a long way away from the services and the economic and social activity that characterise our regional centres, our suburban Australia and our cities. The disjunct between the way in which people still want to live there and the way in which the remainder of the Australian polity organises itself is a great one. 


Like the member, I have been to a number of communities and seen what I think are some signs of disengagement that are at such a level that you really do wonder what the prospects for young people growing up in these communities will be. At the same time you see underneath that the great strength of family and culture that has seen people occupy these lands for tens of thousands of years. In part it is the time that we live in, the time that we are here as legislators, as politicians, in this parliament when we are witnessing that great gap. I think it is to the parliament's credit and to the credit of governments that there has been a national intention to try and close the gap, recognising that it is there, and that the Council of Australian Governments itself, the highest council in the land, if you like, has set itself this task. But it is by no means easy and I do not think there are any quick or convenient solutions. One thing I do know is that we have to persevere, that we have to have open and honest dialogue. We have got to try policy initiatives but we have also at all times got to engage and involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future.


I want to communicate to the member for Grey that I have had some invitations to visit the APY lands. I hope to get out to that part of Australia sometime in the not-too-distant future.


As I was remarking, the Closing the Gap framework has six targets set by the Council of Australian Governments. It is a national approach to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We did have some good news from the Prime Minister recently when she spoke to the parliament and reported on Closing the Gap and also an identification of the areas in which we need to do much better.


We do know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children do start school developmentally behind. So it was particularly satisfying that the Prime Minister was able to announce that the first of the six targets had actually been met, and that is that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education by 2013. That is particularly important for the prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on community, because it is at the very early stage of life when their brains are still in what is described as a high degree of plasticity, and also learning habits as well both of young people and mums in particular can be engendered and there can be confidence that when kids go into a schooling system, which is quite often subject to disruption, as the member for Grey pointed out, that they are able to still keep learning.


I also want to reflect on the levels of investment from government. I do sometimes hear contributions and read commentary about whether or not money is or is not well spent. What I can say is that with the investments we are putting in the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education, we are seeing more children than ever participate in preschool or kindergarten programs. So I think to that extent with this result it is definitely an investment that is bearing some fruit.


We are also on track to half the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander year-12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. That is pretty important, because the transition from school to work is one which is a significant and sometimes almost unreachable journey for many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Halving that gap in year 12 attainment is a huge part in equipping them for the prospects of either future study or potentially work as well.


I want to quickly addressed in NAPLAN tests as well, because we did have disappointing results in the 2012 NAPLAN tests. I think it is important to remember that the trend from 2008 to 2011 was actually quite encouraging and we need to keep building on that. We will have ACARA, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, examine the 2012 student performance to see if there are underlying reasons in that result. I can actually identify some of the reasons, particularly in the Warlpiri triangle, where we have a growing population of young people enrolled in school but in an area that has been subject to some significant community unrest over the last 18 months to two years. There, I think, the opportunities that children had to attend school regularly unfortunately were reduced; notwithstanding that, we are seeing improvements, particularly in reading. We are seeing some improvements in year-3 reading both across Australia and more specifically in some of the states with a high proportion of Aboriginal kids in remote communities. We are also seeing some improvements in year-5 numeracy. But there is no question that there is much more to be done. 


What do we need to do in terms of making sure that we are maximising the opportunities for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to both achieve well at school and go on to work as well? One of the things that has been particularly important has been to do work with another eminent Aboriginal educator, Dr Chris Sarra, and his Focus Schools Next Steps Initiative, to which we provided significant assistance—funding of about $30 million. There are a number of focus schools where the focus is particularly in this case on improving school attendance, on classroom engagement and the academic achievement of around 9,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. That is done in cooperation with states and territories who are running the government school systems where the majority of young Aboriginal students are, through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed by the states to support children's readiness for school, building good practice in schools, developing community based school leadership and parental engagement, and boosting attendance and literacy and numeracy. There is significant investment from this government of around $128 million.


The plan identifies 55 actions at a national, systemic and local level. It has been endorsed by COAG. I think the key thing about the plan is that it is not just a bunch of words that governments have agreed to; it is a set of specific actions, which we need to see every single school that has a proportion of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students attending, apply themselves to. It is my intention, under the National Plan for School Improvement—the response by the government to the recommendations of the Gonski review—that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan will be given greater focus. I am disappointed that in some states we have not seen school systems apply themselves specifically to that plan, given the amount of work that went into it and the fact that it identifies the range of components that you need to have operating at the same time in a school setting over a consistent period in order to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student attainment.


As the members listening would know, we have investments in Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory, and that includes some school attendance measures which are described. And we are providing an additional 200 teachers for literacy and numeracy support. Of course, we have maintained support for the school nutrition program at a cost of around $9 million per year in the Northern Territory. People and members listening would know that this government—and governments in the past—have provided support through ABSTUDY. As well, we have provided opportunities for students to attend school through boarding facilities.


I want to speak briefly about attendance, because attendance is one of the greatest challenges in making sure that young Aboriginal students can progress through their school careers. Regrettably, attendance is poor from day 1 in year 1, and it gets worse by year 10. I can see, in Western Australia for example, government schools recording a gap of 13 per cent between year 1 Indigenous students and others. And that gap goes up to 24 per cent by year 10. The figures are actually worse in the Northern Territory.


My School reports attendance rates for all schools. For schools in Indigenous communities that have a 100 per cent, or almost 100 per cent, Indigenous school body, there is a year-on-year tracking of attendance. But the fact is that without attending school consistently, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students will not develop the skills and education levels necessary to effectively operate in the job market so that they can take care of themselves over time and support their families and their communities—nor will they reach their full potential. It is something that requires urgent attention. I know that it is on the minds of education ministers, teachers and others working in the regions but it is something that requires commitment by communities and families, as well, recognising that a good education for a young Indigenous student is a passport out of poverty. We do now have schools and teachers who are ready, willing and able to teach, but it is important, now, that the kids are at school.


I attended the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Conference in Darwin in 2011. We had a range of presentations, including by principals of schools where they had succeeded in bringing their kids through both primary school and secondary school by doing a number of things. They underscored the priority areas: readiness for school; engagement and connection with community; attendance, which I have referred to; leadership in quality teaching and workforce development; and consideration of the post-school opportunities. Where these six areas have been addressed by leadership in schools, through the principal and the teaching community, and where the community and family—and, where necessary, local authorities—are engaged, then we start to see a difference in education outcomes. 


When I look at a school like Bega Valley Public School in New South Wales, where students are benefiting from strong leadership and evidence based whole-school processes monitoring performance, I see targeted support at the school, personalised learning plans and the employment of an Aboriginal school learning support officer—just those things. This is not that far from here—just down the coast—and what have we got? We have NAPLAN results show an increase in the proportion of students who achieve above the national minimum standards in year 5 in reading and numeracy by 26 per cent and 21 per cent respectively over 2008 and 2011. As well, the proportion of highest performing students in year 5 reading and numeracy have increased by 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Another example that is well known to some of us is Cairns West State School in Queensland—again, concerted case management, a teacher coaching program underpinned by high expectations, and significant improvements in results in the school.


At the end of the day, we will continue to commit ourselves to closing the gap. In this parliament, that is amongst our most urgent tasks. Some progress has been made. We acknowledge it and we welcome it, but we recognise that there is a great deal more that we need to do.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (21:50):  It is a pleasure to follow my colleague the member for Grey and certainly the member for Kingsford Smith, the education minister. I know the work he has done through his music, with Midnight Oil, to help the Indigenous cause in singles such as The Dead Heart, Beds are Burning, and Truganini. We can all sing along—as I often do when I am driving to Canberra on a Sunday night—to Midnight Oil. I do not always agree with the member for Kingsford Smith, but certainly his music touched the hearts of many. At a time when Indigenous issues were far more controversial than they are now, he helped in some sense to close the gap before Closing the Gap really became a common phrase in Australia. I know he has worked as a parliamentarian since 2004, and I acknowledge him for that—for doing what he can to help bridge that divide between Indigenous Australia and the rest of society.


In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments committed to six targets to help close the gap for Indigenous Australians. These targets relate to life expectancy, infant mortality, education and employment. Closing the gap—Prime Minister's report 2013 outlines that there are still serious gaps across the board. Even the Prime Minister herself has stated her personal disappointment that it appears that they are failing to close the gap. I commend the Prime Minister for her words in opening this particular—I will not call it a debate—series of speeches. It is not a debate; it has bipartisan support, for something that really is important to all Australians.


I also recall the fine words of the opposition leader, who goes out of his way each and every year to live amongst Aboriginal communities to see how tough they are doing it. I know that if the coalition is fortunate enough to be voted in as the government and he becomes the Prime Minister he will do some fabulous work in this important area for all Australians and particularly for Indigenous Australians.


Currently Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders live substantially shorter lives than the rest of the Australian population—up to 20 years less in some cases, with the current gap generally estimated at 11½ years for males and 9.7 years for females. That is not acceptable—not in this day and age. It is simply unacceptable. Over the past 30 to 40 years there has been a decline in Indigenous mortality rates while life expectancy has increased, and that is good. While the rise in life expectancy is good, it will be challenging to meet the target. Whilst working towards increasing Indigenous life expectancy, non-Indigenous life expectancy will also be on the rise. The 2013 report says that the target of closing the gap on life expectancy will not be met until 2031, and that is still a long 18 years away. Health outcomes also need to be achieved to help combat mortality rates, with circulatory disease, cancer, injury—including, sadly suicide—respiratory disease, and endocrine, metabolic and nutritional disorders being the leading causes of Indigenous mortality between 2006 and 2010.


The target to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five years of age by 2018 is on track, thankfully, and can be achieved, based on mortality rates between 1998 and 2011 declining at a rate of 29 per cent, faster than the decline in non-Indigenous mortality rates. Ensuring access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2018 is set to be achieved this year—and that is fantastic. The target sets the benchmark at 95 per cent. It is a shame it is not 100 per cent, but 95 per cent at this stage, given what would have been the case perhaps even only a decade ago, is still certainly a staggeringly good statistic.


Data from the new National Early Childhood Education and Care Collection showed that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas were enrolled in preschool programs in August 2011. The Prime Minister's report states this target will be met, based on the latest available data and the commitment by state and territory ministers to the target. Progress on halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children by 2018 has been only mixed, based on NAPLAN data. Currently, only three of the eight literacy and numeracy outcomes are on track to be reached by 2018. That is unfortunate. The data also revealed that Indigenous students in metropolitan areas are achieving significantly higher results in literacy and numeracy than those in rural areas. We all know that the tyranny of distance is such a factor in that regard. Seven per cent of constituents in the member for Grey's electorate are Indigenous and I know how remote some parts of his electorate are. I have visited those areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia and even New South Wales and outer Queensland where the great distances are certainly a factor in disadvantaging Aboriginal children.


There is promising progress on halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rate by 2020, with the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians closing by 4.3 per cent, whilst attainment rates amongst Indigenous students grew faster than amongst non-Indigenous students. However, to meet the target there will need to be continued rapid improvements from 2011 to 2016, according to the Prime Minister's report.


The 2011 census data shows the gap in total employment outcomes has widened since 2006 by 2.2 percentage points, which is due to a decrease in the proportion of Indigenous Australians aged between 16 and 24 against a rise by non-Indigenous Australians in employment. This data works against the target of halving the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018.


My electorate of Riverina had almost 7,000 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons identified in the 2011 census, with a very young median age of 20 and an almost 50-50 split between men and women. I spoke with Roger Penrith, who is the Indigenous community liaison officer at the Griffith City Council, to ask him what outcomes he would like to see achieved under Closing the Gap. Before I talk about Mr Penrith's comments, I should commend also the member for Gippsland on his extraordinary contribution to this series of speeches earlier this evening, in which he spoke of his personal experiences but also of the outcomes that they are achieving in his Gippsland electorate. It was, as I say, quite a remarkably good speech. The member for Gippsland always makes good speeches, but this one was of particular relevance. Anybody who is perhaps reading these words should backtrack in the Hansard to a bit earlier in the evening and read that contribution by the member for Gippsland. It was quite a wonderful speech.


Mr Penrith identified four key areas which need further attention in his local community. These were health, housing, community and aboriginality. Whilst there are some key improvements amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Mr Penrith mentioned that there are still a number of ongoing health issues that Indigenous persons in his area are struggling to overcome. Many people are still not seeking medical treatment for matters relating to the eyes, ears, nose and throat and in Griffith there are a large number of Aboriginal children who are not being treated for otitis media, an ear infection which can have long-lasting effects on hearing.


Many Aboriginal people are also not seeking dental treatment, which has the potential to create further health issues. Oral health is such an important issue amongst all Australians, but it is particularly important for Indigenous Australians. Whilst a simple filling may not seem like a life-and-death matter, the risk of infection increases and, in turn, has the potential to make someone extremely ill. If Aborigines were accessing dental care, this may be able to circumvent later medical visits for illnesses related to the initial problem.


The issue of child mental health, which Mr Penrith raised with me, has also been brought to my attention by many other Griffith organisations. People of Griffith would love to see a headspace organisation in their region. I have spoken to the member for Reid about a petition I have received with almost 2½ thousand signatures and he is helping me to ensure that it is tabled in parliament, because Griffith and the entire Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area needs such a facility to help give children, particularly Aboriginal children, a place to go to seek assistance in a friendly and safe environment. There are serious concerns about access to emergency housing for clients. Mr Penrith signalled that whilst there are houses designated for Aboriginal people these are also being offered to non-Aboriginal persons.


A wealth of talent and experience is held by many Aborigines within the business community. The Griffith City Council would like to see more enterprise opportunities made available by both state and federal governments for Aboriginal business, as well as more consolidated funding and better funding opportunities. Griffith is an extremely multicultural city—it puts out flags for 100 different nations on Australia Day. I believe it is the cradle for multiculturalism in Australia. There are concerns about non-Indigenous persons getting access to assistance reserved for those who are Indigenous. There is a feeling amongst the local Indigenous community that a more stringent process needs to be put in place to ensure that funding which is directed towards only those who are eligible and need it the most actually reaches that particular group of people.


One organisation in the area which is making great progress in helping Indigenous students gain year 12 qualification or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is Tirkandi Inaburra, located between Coleambally and Darlington Point. Tirkandi Inaburra is managed by Anthony Paulson and is a community-run development and education centre offering Aboriginal boys aged between 12 and 15 a residential program aimed at reducing future contact with the justice system by strengthening cultural identity, self-esteem and resilience. I heard a lot of the speakers earlier this evening talking about the higher than proportional incarceration rates for Indigenous people. This is something that really needs addressing, not just by people in this place but by our state parliamentarians as well, to ensure that those incarceration rates are substantially lowered. 


To be eligible to apply to become students at the wonderful Tirkandi Inaburra centre, the boys must live in communities located between the Lachlan and the Murray and between Balranald and the western side of the Blue Mountains. The boys must be prepared to make a commitment. They must be first time and/or non-serious offenders who are willing to make the shift to change their lives. They may be dropping out of school and are catching the attention of the police. If successful, the boys embark on a three- to six-month journey where they engage in educational, sporting, recreational, life, living skills and cultural activities which have been developed especially to develop their skills and abilities. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Nigel Scullion, has visited this centre and believes it is so good it should be replicated across Australia. It is unfortunate that this is currently the only centre in Australia offering this particular opportunity. We should be promising more such centres in an effort to help achieve the goal of more graduates by 2020 and, in doing so, to help close the gap.


Australia is on the way to closing the gap, but there is still significant work to be done by governments right across the country. Speaking of Tirkandi Inaburra, I had a visit on 20 February with the Clontarf Foundation's Chief Executive Officer, Gerard Neesham, its Chairman, Ross Kelly, and also Brendan Maher, who is in Parliament House tonight for a dinner for the foundation. It is an education and mentoring program for Indigenous youths to discuss plans to help better their lives and provide educational outcomes. I know the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Julie Bishop, has had a powerful influence over the years in helping to promote and fund Clontarf, which exists to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and, in doing so, equip them to participate meaningfully in society. It has certainly played a great part in helping realise some of the Australian Football League dreams of young Aboriginal boys and it is now trying to branch into rugby league. If Aboriginal boys see that there is a pathway for them to a better life through sport such as football it helps their educational outcomes as well. 


The foundation believes that failure to experience achievement when young coupled with a position of underprivilege can lead to alienation, anger and more serious consequences. As a prelude to tackling these and other issues, participants are first provided with an opportunity to succeed and, in turn, to raise their self-esteem. Gerard Neesham is a wonderful fellow. He is a former AFL coach. He is a wonderful motivator of people and he has a particular love and passion for improving the educational outcomes for young Australians, particularly young Aboriginal Australians. I commend him for his wonderful work with Clontarf. I hope the government sees fit to give Clontarf the funding it requires to help replicate this right across Australia. Gerard Neesham had important meetings in Wagga Wagga and throughout the Riverina to help develop the sort of program that is needed there. I commend Gerard for his work and I commend Clontarf for its involvement with Aboriginal youths. It is certainly helping to close the gap. Finally, can I say that improving the health outcomes for Aboriginal people is a wonderful initiative and we as parliamentarians should be doing everything we can to help that cause.

Ms Gambaro
  asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 27 November 2012:


What process does the department have in place to advise and inform permanent residents before leaving Australia of the requirement to have a valid permanent visa should they want to re-enter Australia.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Mr Brendan O'Connor:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is:


Permanent residents have several channels by which they may be informed prior to their departure, of the need to obtain a Resident Return visa (RRV) to allow them to re-enter Australia:


(1) The visa grant notice issued to successful applicants for permanent visas outlines the initial entry expiry date, the travel facility (multiple entry), and the 'must not arrive after' date. It also states that the permanent visa holder is able to remain in Australia indefinitely. Permanent visa holders are also generally given information in that notice about their ability to travel out of and into Australia until their specific 'must not arrive after' date (five years from the date of grant of the permanent visa), and the need to apply for an RRV should they wish to travel internationally and re-enter Australia after that date. 


(2) The department's website provides information for Returning Residents by following the links provided at: www.immi.gov.au/migrants/residents/


(3) Clients contacting the department through the client service phone line (131881) seeking clarification of their eligibility to return to Australia on their current permanent visa, are advised to check the expiry of the travel facility on that visa, and where required, provided with advice about the RRV. Where a permanent resident has a visa label evidenced in their passport, the valid travel facility is indicated by a ""must not arrive after"" date stated on that label. Alternatively, a permanent visa holder can check the details of their visa (including any expiry dates) using the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service at: www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/vevo.htm 


(4) There are two Resident Return visa (RRV) related system prompts used at the border for departures. These prompts appear on a Customs and Border Protection officer's screen when the travel component of a passenger's permanent visa has expired or will expire within 14 days. The Customs and Border Protection officers are trained to advise the passenger that the travel component of the visa has expired, or will be expiring, and that they must hold a valid RRV before returning to Australia. They are also asked to advise the passenger that they may be unable to board their return flight if they do not have a valid RRV. Where a passenger requires further information they are referred to an officer of the department.
