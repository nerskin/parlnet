"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-25,"—I move:
That the Senate calls on the Government to make a reference to the Productivity Commission requiring modelling of alternative emissions trading schemes including:
a conventional baseline-and-credit scheme;
an intensity model;
a carbon tax;
a consumption-based carbon tax; and
the McKibbin model;
with a view to determining which scheme design (including the Government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and schemes with higher targets) provides the best environmental and economic outcomes.
That the Productivity Commission’s report on modelling under paragraph (1) be laid on the table by 6 August 2009 to inform the debate on the CPRS bills.
That there be laid on the table by 6 August 2009 all documents held by the Productivity Commission relating to the design and economic impacts of the Government’s CPRS.",SENATE,<title>EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,17,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—The government does not support this motion, because what it represents is outsourcing to the Productivity Commission the development of a range of completely different policies. The government was elected to implement a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. I would note that the members of the opposition were also elected to implement a cap-and-trade emissions scheme. It has taken us over a decade of debate and analysis to get to this point. We have already done the work to know that this is the best way for Australia to tackle climate change. To do what Senator Xenophon is proposing would be to go right back to the drawing board and junk all the work that has already been done and the commitments we were elected to implement. On those bases, the government cannot support the motion.",SENATE,<title>EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME</title>,<title>Order</title>,Motions,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-25,"—by leave—In the interests of gaining information, we are not going to stand in the way of this motion. However, I note that, if given effect, it would call on the government to make a reference to the Productivity Commission requiring modelling of alternative emissions on a big range of things. We do not have before us information which would indicate that the Productivity Commission can do that modelling, let alone whether it should do it. We had that reservation about the matter. It would have been helpful to have the Senate informed as to the wherewithal of the Productivity Commission (a) to do this modelling and whether it is the best place to do it and (b) whether it could do it within the time that is being allocated.
—Could we have an indication of which way senators are voting? I am reluctant to call an unnecessary division.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-06-25,—by leave—This is a matter that seems to crop up now and then in relation to membership of committees.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—This morning we have seen that senators have tried to make on the run a number of decisions in relation to the composition of Senate committees. The composition of Senate committees is carefully considered; it is in the standing orders. One of the motions that was withdrawn this morning would have changed the whole nature of the balance on that committee from one where the government had a majority to one where a minor party had the controlling vote. At any stage, when there is a move to change the numbers, not the composition, of committees, it should always go to the Procedures Committee before it is brought into the chamber for discussion.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,18,1,speech

Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—I was going to speak on the substantive motion. However, unfortunately, with chamber management the way it is this morning I missed that opportunity. If I can confine my remarks—I may seek an extension—very briefly, it is a short matter and I do not want to put a lot on record about it other than that we are seeking to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. In answer to Senator Xenophon, we understand that this matter has already been referred by Senator Heffernan in another way to the Privileges Committee for it to be dealt with.
There is a strong precedent for this matter to normally be referred to the Privileges Committee. It is usual for that to be granted to the senator moving the matter to go to privilege. It is a rare occurrence—in fact, I can only think of one occurrence where it has been denied—for the matter not to be referred to the Privileges Committee. The reason is that parliamentary privilege is an ancient and important protection that allows the parliament the ability to operate freely and inquire into what it must. It also exists to ensure the integrity of the parliamentary process by ensuring that parliamentarians and witnesses to parliamentary committees are free to speak and are free from concern. However, parliamentary privilege is just that. It is a privilege that allows us to do our job but it ought not be abused. The Privileges Committee of each house exist both to guard against the breach of parliamentary privilege and to protect against its abuse.
Over the past week, unfortunately, we have seen the most extraordinary series of events that go right to the heart of parliamentary privilege. We have seen allegations of a false Commonwealth document—a forgery it appears, in fact—used to dupe a Senate committee. We have seen testimony given, perhaps based on the same document, that is highly questionable. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—There is only one thing that Senator Ludwig just said with which we agree, and that is that it is rare to deny or oppose a reference to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. But in this case the opposition very strongly opposes this reference. We believe the government has completely misunderstood the motivation of Senator Heffernan. I speak honestly here and I hope that we will be dealt with in good faith.
Senator Heffernan, acting as a backbench senator, was concerned about the treatment that a witness to the Economics Legislation Committee received last week after he gave his evidence. If you read Senator Heffernan’s motion it says:
Whether any adverse action was taken against Mr Godwin Grech in consequence of his evidence before the Economics Legislation Committee ...
This is not directed at government senators in any way whatsoever. Senator Heffernan, of his own volition, was concerned about the treatment of a witness after he gave his evidence. The government seems to have interpreted Senator Heffernan’s motion as directed at government senators, and here we have a tit-for-tat motion designed to attack Senator Abetz because of his quite genuine and proper endeavours to establish the veracity of evidence given to that committee and information to hand.
It would be quite extraordinary for a committee of privileges to be examining the basis upon which a senator was seeking to establish the veracity of evidence before them, and the government’s motion completely misunderstands and misrepresents the motivation that Senator Heffernan had in his reference, which was quite properly about the treatment of a witness after he gave his evidence. Therefore, we are very strongly opposed to this reference and we hope the Senate will join us in opposing it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-25,"—by leave—Senator Minchin is quite right that matters that go to privilege are quite extraordinary. They are not ordinary matters and that is why the Privileges Committee is there. The events of the last couple of weeks, and events unknown which led up to them, are in that category of quite extraordinary. Senator Heffernan brought in a motion to have the matter in part referred to the Privileges Committee, and the Greens supported that.
We have great faith in the Privileges Committee and its record. I have been repeatedly surprised by and admiring of the work of the Privileges Committee. It is a committee which time and again brings down a considered, sensible and largely unarguable finding, though we do have robust debates in here as a result of it.
This motion put forward by Senator Ludwig ought to go as it is to the Privileges Committee for consideration and there ought not be political positions taken on it. I do not think any of us should be concerned that the Privileges Committee be confined to any particular persons or exclude any particular persons, including senators. Therefore, the Privileges Committee should not be denied the opportunity to look at the matter in the terms that Senator Ludwig has put forward.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech

—A forged document in a Senate committee and you don’t think it’s serious.
—No, I am sorry; I believe there is politics being played. Basically, you should not turn Senate committee hearings into forums for playing politics.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-25,"—by leave—I will not reflect on that vote, but I want to have it noted that I treat the matter of the exclusion of the purview of the Privileges Committee to senators—that is, to any of us, if that is what we have seen—as a very serious matter. We are not, in access to the Privileges Committee, above other citizens. We are not a law unto ourselves—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I know Senator Brown started by saying he is not reflecting on the vote that has just been had but I ask you to really consider whether that is reflecting on the vote.
—You are in order, Senator Brown. Continue, but I advise you not to reflect on the vote.
—Nor would I. That is why I said at the outset that I would not. However, we must not be gagged from debating the seriousness of any ability of the Senate to protect senators from the reach of the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee is there to defend the Senate itself. We know that from time to time citizens complain about the behaviour or the statements of senators in here. Very often the Privileges Committee looks at that and rules in their favour without asking the senator before the Privileges Committee.
There are very serious matters being debated in the public arena at the moment. I am concerned that the Senate not be put in the position of appearing to be shepherding, defending or protecting any of our number as against the rights of other citizens.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—As I understand it, where we are now is with the last remaining motions about the chamber management for the remainder of the day. The government’s preference in relation to this is to continue to pursue the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We want to amend Senator Xenophon’s motion to try to achieve that and we do want to press that with a division. However, having had extensive consultation around this chamber, we do understand that the numbers are, in fact, against us in relation to this matter. We do understand that we will not be able to achieve that. We do then have to consider what our next position will be in foreshadowing that next position. It is a way of at least trying to manage the remaining time that we have available. The time, everyone rightly has pointed out, is slipping away from us.
The next position we would seek is support for a motion which would deal with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in August. That would be the sensible course of action because we want to be able to conclude the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is a matter that the Rudd government took to the election. We do want a cap-and-trade system in place. We do want the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme finalised. That motion would give us the opportunity to do just that in August. It is not our best or preferred position; however, I foreshadow that that will be our course of action. The government will then seek to move a motion to deal with the hours for the remainder of the day, so that we can finalise those bills that are required to be dealt with before the winter recess.

That being said, we see the priority the government has on the climate change legislation in this chamber and it ought to be determined in the sitting. We are not in favour of the idea that there can be no limit put on that debate or no resolution gained now but that, magically, in August we can.
What is more, we can see forward to August, in some way or other, and decide there will be a guillotine in place at the end of the first week in August. Yet apparently the House cannot decide to do that this week. We will be moving to support the government—if it holds its resolve, and it appears to be crumbling—to have the climate change legislation dealt with and brought to resolution. We will not be supporting a failure to do that now and the long-range view that that ought to be imposed in August. We will wait and see the circumstances in August. We want to see a resolution on this matter, but we are not going to commit to something in August that the other parties in this place seem not able to commit to right now.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,24,1,speech

—Two minutes.
—Leave is granted for two minutes only.
—I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Parry’s contribution, which was, whether intentional or otherwise, really quite inaccurate. He claimed that the opposition was happy to debate the CPRS. Anybody who has watched or was in this chamber at the beginning of the week will know that those opposite have thrown all their resources, every procedural and political game, every aspect of their strategy, at not having a vote. That is their position on climate change this week. ‘We are going to fight really hard to not have a vote.’ That has been their position. I want to pay some tribute to Senator Joyce because at least he was honest about this. At least he went out and said—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Show some guts.
—Order, on both sides! Senator Sterle, it is disorderly to call out across the chamber, but, also, you are not in your seat.
—As I was saying, I pay tribute to Senator Joyce, who at least was honest. He went out to the Australian people and said, ‘We are going to filibuster and delay.’ But for Senator Parry, after doing what he has done as whip this week and what others have done—delayed this vote by every tactic and strategy they have—to come in here and say, ‘Actually, it is Thursday morning we are prepared to debate it,’ has to count as one of the most hypocritical contributions this chamber has seen.
I just would say this. I saw a newspaper article where Senator Bernardi was saying that the Liberal Party should stand up for its principles. Well, what are those principles? Because this week those principles have been the high and lofty principles of avoiding and ducking a vote on climate change.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,24,1,speech

That goes with being a minority government in this chamber. We put up with that for nine of our 11 years in government. We know exactly the frustration that Senator Evans is experiencing. We experienced it at the hands of the Labor opposition for nine of those 11 years. They did all they could to frustrate us in our endeavours to take legislation through this place.
I suspect that Senator Evans does not understand the extent to which there has been very good cooperation between the two managers of business in this place—Senator Ludwig and Senator Parry—to ensure that, subject to members of the government not interfering and not making statements at every opportunity, we can get on and debate those bills which we accept are urgent and which do need to be passed today. As soon as members of the government shut up, we can get on with those bills. We believe there is ample time to deal with those bills today. We have had very productive discussions with Senator Ludwig to make sure that occurs. Indeed, we have gone so far as to say that we believe that before six o’clock there may well be the opportunity to return to the second reading debate on the CPRS. We have made it clear that we are perfectly happy to do that, because we believe there will be time.
We have acted in good faith throughout this week to ensure that the government can get those bills dealt with that we agree are urgent and do need to be dealt with this session. We have cooperated with that to the full extent.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-06-25,"—by leave—I just wanted to say in relation to this matter of the AQIS fees and charges that the Greens had real concerns, as did many people in this chamber right across the parties, about the impact that a 40 per cent increase in fees would have on the rural sector, particularly at this time when many of those export industries are already struggling because of the drought and various other matters. But the concern was that disallowing all of these regulations would impact across all sectors. That of course means that the meat, grains, dairy, fish and live export sectors would all be affected as well as horticulture. I had representations from all those sectors saying that they had signed an agreement with the government to proceed with the reform agenda and that if we disallowed all of the regulations, it would affect everybody. So I worked with the minister to reach an arrangement whereby half of horticulture’s $2½ million share of the $40 million reform package would be spent on rebates over 12 months to take into account the seasonal nature and also an agreement to have a work plan in place with timetables by 1 August. I have postponed until 20 August, so that there is the opportunity to revisit it, but I do not expect that will have to be the case if the minister delivers on this agreement.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-06-25,"—At the request of Senator Abetz, I move:
That the Directions in Relation to Coercive Powers, made on 17 June 2009 under section 11 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005, be disallowed.
The opposition seeks to disallow the ministerial direction on the basis that it not only goes beyond the minister’s powers under the existing Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act but seeks to put the issues that are the subject of the ministerial direction beyond the reach of parliamentary process, beyond the reach of parliamentary scrutiny and beyond the reach of parliamentary will.
The government will attempt to say that what the minister is trying to do in the ministerial direction is simply to put in place what is already in the existing Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. If it is in the existing act then why is a ministerial direction needed? The answer is: because it is not already in the existing act, and putting it in the act requires parliamentary process, parliamentary scrutiny and the exercise of parliamentary will, as should be the case. The government does not have the political courage to put the matters that are the subject of the ministerial direction before parliament, as part of parliamentary process and scrutiny and subject to parliamentary will. It knows that this parliament will not pass legislation to the effect of the ministerial direction because it would be a very clear breach of the government’s election promise that the existing powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission will remain as they are until January 2010.
The ministerial direction clearly goes beyond the minister’s powers under the act. Under the existing act, the minister does have the power to specify the manner in which the Australian Building and Construction Commission must exercise its powers and functions. But the ministerial direction goes far beyond ‘the manner in which the Australian Building and Construction Commission must exercise its powers and functions’. It goes directly to those powers and functions themselves. It cuts back those powers and functions; it curtails those powers and functions. Two clear examples: firstly, the ministerial direction requires the Australian Building and Construction Commission to provide a person subject to investigation with the ability to object to that process through a court or tribunal. What is the ABCC to do with the proposed investigation if a court or tribunal upholds the objection? If that aspect of the ministerial direction is designed to stop the Australian Building and Construction Commission exercising the investigative powers that exist at the moment, then it very clearly curtails its power. If that is not the intent of that part of the ministerial direction then why is there a need to make it?
The second clear example is the supposed requirement in the ministerial direction that the Australian Building and Construction Commission, before proceeding with an investigation under section 52 of the existing act, must provide a report to a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, acting in their ‘personal capacity’—whatever that means—about the proposed investigation and then take into account the views of that member of the AAT before proceeding with the proposed investigation under section 52. Again, if the intent is not to require the ABCC to desist with the investigation if the views of the AAT member are negative—that is, that the investigation not be proceeded with—then why have that provision in the ministerial direction? If that is the intent of that aspect of the ministerial direction then clearly the ministerial direction curtails the current investigative powers of the ABCC. Those are but two examples of the ways in which the ministerial direction clearly goes beyond simply directing the manner in which the ABCC must exercise its powers and functions and, rather, directly cuts and curtails those powers and functions.
The government does not have the courage to put these matters to this parliament as a legislative amendment. These matters are not in the existing legislation, and the government does not have the courage to put them before parliament to subject them to parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary will because it knows it is in clear breach of its election promise to keep the existing powers of the ABCC in place until January 2010. This motion must be supported.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT ACT 2005: DIRECTIONS IN RELATION TO COERCIVE POWERS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,31,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-25,"—The Australian Greens have been consistent in our opposition to the ABCC. We have always argued it is unacceptable to have workplace relations laws that take away the right to silence; deny people their choice of a lawyer; provide powers to compel evidence, with the possibility of jail for noncompliance; and impose severe restrictions on the rights of workers to organise and bargain collectively. The direction from the minister in relation to coercive powers, the subject of this disallowance motion, restores basic procedural fairness and democratic rights to workers subject to the extraordinary powers given to the ABCC. It is a direction that, in the Greens’ view, is too little too late. In our opinion, the minister should have given this direction 18 months ago. For us, it is outrageous that the ALP government has left in place for so long these undemocratic practices of the ABCC. We will not be supporting this disallowance motion. Our position has always been and continues to be that the ABCC should be abolished immediately. In fact, I introduced a bill to that effect last year.
What the minister’s direction does is, firstly, to allow persons to have legal representation of their choice and for their lawyers to engage in the basic practice of representing their clients. Jeez! That’s a breakthrough, isn’t it! For example, they can sit next to their clients, consult with them and speak on their behalf. The extraordinary restrictions on legal representation under the current practices of the ABCC are contrary to our basic democratic practices. Building workers should not be treated as members of organised crime syndicates. The coercive powers of the ABCC can be and have been used in situations where workers have taken industrial action for whatever reason, including occupational health and safety concerns. These circumstances are in no way comparable to the types of crimes that usually attract and can justify such powers and restrictions on legal representation.
We labelled the ABCC a Star Chamber from the beginning, and in our opinion the restoration of the basic rights of legal representation is long overdue. Paragraph (b) of the directive requires an agency established under Commonwealth law to comply with the Commonwealth’s obligation to act as a model litigant. We would say this is hardly controversial. Paragraph (c) provides that a person can raise objections to a particular exercise of section 52 power and for that objection to be tested in a court or tribunal. Again, the Australian Greens agree with this direction. We must bear in mind that the extraordinary coercive and investigative powers in section 52 include the powers to compel information, documents or the giving of evidence. Further, there is little investigatory threshold, and the extreme consequence of not complying with a notice from the ABCC is imprisonment. Given that ordinary building workers can face jail merely for not attending an interview in relation to a union meeting—indeed, in South Australia there is a worker currently facing a jail term—this discretion is an important safeguard in the exercise of these powers to make sure they are used appropriately. We are not talking about serious crimes against persons or the community. Rather, we are talking about instances where workers are exercising their democratic rights to take industrial action. Again, we would say this is hardly controversial. Paragraphs (d) and (e) similarly insert entirely appropriate safeguards in the use of these very extraordinary powers. The Greens note that these two paragraphs do not prevent the ABC Commissioner from using his powers but merely put in place additional steps with the intention of ensuring that the use of these powers is appropriate and necessary.
We think these changes are long overdue. These are about restoring basic democratic rights to a group of workers in this country who have been unfairly picked on by this draconian legislation that puts in place the ABCC. We strongly support these moves. We do not think they go far enough. As I said, the government should have done it 18 months ago.

I come from the state of Victoria, where, when you really think about it, there have been notorious issues in the building industry area. The Labor Party’s Forward with Fairness policy implementation plan clearly states on page 24:
… Labor will maintain the existing arrangements for the building and construction industry …
The ministerial direction is clearly a breach of that particular statement. It is quite clear that it is. The Australian Building and Construction Commission is such an important body that its very existence has seen a dramatic improvement in workplace behaviour in the industry, and I am opposed to any attempts to water it down. I am happy to have the debate in parliament, but I do not think that to go and do it sneakily through a ministerial direction, knowing that this is a contentious issue, is the right way of doing it. Under the ministerial direction, all objections will be allowed to be taken to court. This can be used just as a tactic to delay proceedings and will cause the commission to be hampered and hamstrung in their ability to continue to keep the industry clean. So, to keep it very short and sharp—because someone asked me to keep it tight—we will be supporting the disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT ACT 2005: DIRECTIONS IN RELATION TO COERCIVE POWERS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,31,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-25,"—I indicate that I will be supporting the disallowance motion, but I want to put a number of caveats in relation to that. I want to acknowledge that I had lengthy discussions with both the coalition and the government in the last 24 hours in relation to this. I also indicate that this morning I spoke to Martin O’Malley, who is a senior official of the CFMEU in South Australia. We had a good discussion, and he is someone with whom I have a very good working relationship and whose views I take into account. His view, obviously, is that this disallowance motion should not be supported, but I support it for these reasons. I indicated to the government that I did not have a difficulty in relation to parts (a) and (b) of the directions, but I understand the government’s position that it is a package of measures and directives, and they have a position that all the directives should be a part of this. I did not have a problem with respect to (a) and (b) because they reflect what is already in the act to make it clearer, firstly, in terms of the issue of legal representation and, secondly, in relation to the Commonwealth’s obligation to act as a model litigant. I think that, if the government is minded at some other stage to issue an amended directive, I would certainly support those without hesitation.
Secondly, in relation to parts (c), (d) and (e), they relate to an alteration of the section 52 powers, and I think it would be fair to say in an objective sense that the matter that is the subject of the ministerial directive is also, in a substantive form, the subject of the legislation that will be before the Senate in the spring session to deal with the whole issue of the ABCC’s powers and the extent to which those powers ought to be curtailed or modified as a result of the Wilcox review. My principal difficulty is one of process, in that what we are seeing is that the minister, by virtue of subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) in her directive, is pre-empting, in a sense, both the Senate inquiry process and the legislation that will come before the Senate to consider this. That is something that I think is quite unusual and goes beyond what I think would be a reasonable exercise of the minister’s powers. Senator Fisher alluded to the issue of whether it could have been subject to, at the very least, administrative challenge in terms of going beyond the powers.
It is also fair to indicate that, in relation to coercive powers, the powers in section 52 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act are similar to the ACCC’s powers in section 155 of the Trade Practices Act, the Australian Taxation Office’s powers in section 353 of the Taxation Administration Act and ASIC’s powers in section 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. They are not unprecedented, but the issue is whether those powers have been exercised reasonably, whether they ought to be curtailed and whether the issue of unfair work practices ought to be curtailed by legislation. The powers should also relate to the issue of unreasonable action by employers. I think it would be fair to say that the ABCC has done little or nothing to deal with the issue of behaviour of employers that I think would be unacceptable in any reasonable workplace. These are matters that I think need to be looked at.
I refer back to my conversation this morning with Martin O’Malley from the CFMEU in South Australia. Where I share common ground with Mr O’Malley is on the issue of occupational health and safety. I think we need tougher occupational health and safety laws. If there is industrial action on a legitimate occupational health and safety ground, the ABCC should exercise its powers very cautiously and ensure that workplace safety is of primary concern. I also have a concern in relation to the matters of process and I have indicated to the minister my position on this privately. I look forward to working with the government so that we can have some comprehensive reforms of the ABCC legislation or of legislation that will perform a similar function but with the excesses curtailed. I look forward to that debate when the matter is dealt with in the spring session of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT ACT 2005: DIRECTIONS IN RELATION TO COERCIVE POWERS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,31,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I do not think it is surprising—it certainly does not surprise me—that Senator Fisher and other coalition senators would be maintaining their hardline, ideologically driven approach to industrial relations. The Work Choices legislation may be dead and buried, but the same ideology is still alive in the Liberal Party and on show again today.
I say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to coalition senators: there is not too much to worry about here. Coalition senators have obviously not read the directive notices. If they had, they would have realised that the Deputy Prime Minister is not attempting to weaken the ABCC with these directions or to water down the coercive powers. Also, we are not breaching an election commitment, as Senator Fisher has claimed. In no way does this breach our election commitments. Any informed and unbiased reading of the directions would show that the Deputy Prime Minister is simply reinforcing measures and guidelines already in place and seeking to ensure consultation by the ABCC when using its coercive powers.
The Rudd government will never tolerate unlawful action, intimidation or thuggery in the workplace and is 100 per cent supportive of keeping a tough cop on the beat in the construction sector. These directions will improve the operation of the ABCC and help allay fears concerning procedural fairness and treatment under the law. In the end, despite all the bluff and bluster that we have heard from Senator Fisher today, all these directions are really about is ensuring that existing rules, guidelines and standards are followed by all parties fairly and without bias or prejudice.
It is worth noting how we got here. Prior to the 2007 election the Labor Party promised it would retain the Office of the ABCC until 31 January 2010, when it would be replaced by a specialist fair work inspectorate. Labor is committed to implementing a strong set of compliance arrangements for the building industry, and the Rudd government has consistently stated that anyone who breaks the law will feel the full force of the law.
Labor also committed to consult extensively with industry stakeholders to ensure the transition to the new arrangements would be (1) orderly and (2) effective. On that basis, in June 2008 the Deputy Prime Minister asked the Hon. Justice Murray Wilcox QC, a retired Federal Court judge, to consult and report on matters relating to the creation of the specialist inspectorate. Mr Wilcox provided his report in March this year, having consulted with industry participants. His report has been described as ‘thoughtful and balanced’ and I entirely agree with the assessment. It is important to note that, in discussing the need for coercive powers, Mr Wilcox observed:
… the point does not go to the question of principle some people have argued, but rather the protections that may be necessary to avoid inappropriate use, or misuse, of the interrogation power.
Mr Wilcox had concerns and found problems in relation to these powers and noted that things could be done better and that some of the current practices were not best practice.
The ministerial directives take this into account. All agencies of the Australian government must conduct their affairs in accordance with best practice. The Deputy Prime Minister’s direction emphasises the need for the ABC Commissioner to comply with existing safeguards and requires the commissioner to comply with two new safeguards. As Senator Fisher has tried to point out, direction is a power that the minister has. The minister may make directions under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005, so it is entirely within the minister’s remit.
The minister’s directions relate solely to the exercise of the coercive powers. They do not in any way affect the ABCC’s general investigative, compliance and prosecution powers. The minister’s directions include five detailed directions to the ABC Commissioner, listed (a) to (e). The first three of those just formalise the ABCC’s existing practices. The two new measures are in relation to consultation with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is about consultation, process and procedural fairness. In no way is it trying to water down the ABCC.
In conclusion, we have tried to strike a balance: a tough cop on the beat in the construction sector but, at the same time, procedural fairness and the application of the law in relation to workers’ rights. That is what these directions are about. I therefore ask senators to not support the procedural motion.
 (Senator Bernardi)—The question now is that the motion moved by Senator Fisher at the request of Senator Abetz be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT ACT 2005: DIRECTIONS IN RELATION TO COERCIVE POWERS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,31,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-25,"—On behalf of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I present the committee’s report entitled Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians revisited: report on the progress with the implementation of the recommendations of the Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians reports, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
A number of the members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee are in the chamber and we would like to speak very briefly to this report. We would like to speak for longer but our time has been limited, so we have agreed to allocate the time amongst ourselves. I found this committee inquiry probably the hardest I have ever done because of the stories I heard about the forgotten Australians and their time in institutions in this country. It was very harrowing. I think all the committee members who heard about the pain and suffering also found it very tough participating in this committee.
The report makes 16 recommendations for further work that we believe needs to be done. Progress has been made in implementing the recommendations from the Lost Innocents and the Forgotten Australians reports, but there has not been enough progress. So we have made a further 16 recommendations, to which my fellow committee members will also speak. The first two recommendations relate to the need for an apology. These recommendations resulted from the call for an apology from virtually every witness before the committee. It was therefore essential for us to have this in our first recommendations. We believe there needs to be a formal statement of acknowledgement and an apology to the children who suffered hurt and distress or abuse and assault in institutional care. We believe this recommendation has not been picked up from the Forgotten Australians report, and we have reiterated the need for that.
We also believe there is a need for the Prime Minister to write to the relevant churches and religious agencies requesting that they provide formal statements concerning the need for such bodies to make reparation to children who suffered abuse and neglect in their care in the last century. We believe there needs to be further work done in the provision of redress schemes in the states that do not yet have redress schemes—those states being South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. We are calling for government and Commonwealth leadership in this area to encourage these states to pursue putting in place redress schemes. We note there is a range of redress schemes around the country—some are better than others—and we believe there needs to be better coordination of those redress schemes. We have suggested that the Council of Australian Governments looks into these issues.
We believe that this action is very strongly needed. We also believe that the churches need to take steps to ensure that the processes for handling abuse allegations are consistent across all jurisdictions across this country. We have heard various stories from all our witnesses that the redress schemes across the country are different. They have had different support and receptions from various church organisations. We believe there needs to be greater action by the churches and religious organisations in providing support, redress and reparations to the children who were in their care. In view of the time, I seek to continue my remarks at a later date and thoroughly recommend this report to the Senate. I urge the government to implement the recommendations. It is a crying shame that the recommendations from the previous two reports have not been fully implemented, and we urge the government to take on these recommendations very rapidly and see that they are implemented.
An incident having occurred in the gallery—",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,33,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of a number of people who are survivors of care in this country as well as those people who support them and members of their families. Today I want to acknowledge their patience in waiting for this report to be brought down and I also reflect that that patience is part of the lives that they have led, because they have been forgotten—in fact, they have been lost. Those were the issues that were the titles of our previous reports in this place. In 2001 and 2004, the Senate brought down inquiries that exposed the horror of some experiences of care in this country.
At that time, there was great media interest. There were statements made. I still believe that the day in 2004 that Forgotten Australians: a report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children was brought down was one of the most moving experiences for everybody in this place. However, our Community Affairs References Committee believes that, whilst there were so many recommendations made in those previous inquiries, there was a need to go back to have a look at just how much work had been done and whether in fact there had been real implementation and acceptance of the recommendations. We all know that recommendations are made and not always agreed, but our committee felt that time had gone by and we had continued to have experiences working with the people who had given their own lives to our committee. They had come to us talking about their experiences and expressing their pain and frustration, and so many of us shared those experiences. We felt we needed to go back to see what had occurred.
Senator Siewert has pointed out most of the recommendations our committee has made, and I promise this gallery and this place that we will not forget the people who are known as forgotten Australians or those people who are identified as child migrants.
An incident having occurred in the gallery—
—For the sake of the process in the Senate, I ask the gallery if it could not always applaud; we can do that outside! I know there are other members of the committee who wish to speak.
This issue will continue. There will not be a process of being forgotten by anyone in this place. We will work with governments—we must. I think there will be some disappointment, because I do not think we will be able to meet all the needs that people have expressed. But in terms of making a commitment from the people who have worked together so strongly on this issue over many committees—I see that Senator McLucas, who was the chair of the committee in 2004, has come in. Today I also want to take particular note of Senator Andrew Murray, who did so much in this place and outside in the committee to keep these issues on the agenda. Whenever we have discussion in this place about the work for people who are known as ‘lost innocents’ or forgotten Australians, Senator Andrew Murray’s name will be held high, because his work continues as well.
Where do we go from here? This committee report will be put on the process today. We will go back to the government and also to the governments at state levels because we know there is a shared responsibility here. We must continue to work together on these issues. These people’s lives must now be acknowledged; no longer can people be referred to as ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’.
 (Senator Bernardi)—Before I call the next speaker, I remind the gallery that it is inappropriate to burst into spontaneous acclamation, no matter how happy you are with the proceedings of the Senate. I ask that you remain quiet while the speakers are speaking.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,33,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-06-25,"—I also had the privilege of sitting through and participating in the forgotten Australians inquiry and the more recent inquiry, the report of which comes down today. ‘Privilege’ may be a strange word to use in respect of that process, because it was searing and heartbreaking to hear stories told by Australians of a tragic and disgraceful chapter in Australia’s history. We saw evidence of so much neglect and abuse that Australians would not have imagined was going on in their own communities over so many years. In earlier reports we made recommendations to ensure, firstly, that the processes were properly brought to the public’s attention and, secondly, that means of redress were put in place for those who had experienced those tragic outcomes.
We went further in this most recent report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee in order to bear witness to the reality that much of the work we recommended be done through those earlier reports has not yet occurred. There is not a need for further research into what has occurred. There is not a need for further analysis of what steps governments need to take. There is a need for action. That action is missing, particularly on the part of a number of state and territory governments. The action is missing on the part of many churches and other institutions that are and were responsible for the delivery of care to people in their charge. The purpose of this committee’s report is to bear witness to the fact that that work is not yet concluded and must be prosecuted by the necessary authorities.
We recommend that the Commonwealth plays a leadership role in this exercise. The Commonwealth was not directly responsible for the administration of many of the facilities where children received abuse, but the Commonwealth funded, through child endowment, the care of those children and the Commonwealth today plays a leadership role in these matters. The call for action to be pursued by the states through the agency and intervention of the Commonwealth is perhaps the most important recommendation of the committee. I particularly note and endorse the call made by the Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Siewert, that the government should focus on the need for the Prime Minister to seek from providers of care a statement of their position on redress, reparation and apology to those who were abused in their care and table the result of the work of that inquiry here in the parliament so that the Australian community can see what it is that has occurred and what is yet to occur. These Australians should not be forgotten. They should be honoured for their experience and given every support they need in order to participate fully in the community of which they are part.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,33,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-25,"—I would like to talk briefly about this important report. Whilst I was not part of the committee process, I am sad to say that this issue is something I know a great deal about because a significant amount of the abuse detailed in the report occurred in South Australia. In South Australia we had the Mullighan inquiry into this. The victims of wards of the state who were the subject of systematic abuse were dubbed ‘take-away kids’, and their plight first came to light during a series of reports by the local version of the Seven network’s Today Tonight program. I am pleased to say that Rohan Wenn, who works with me, was the reporter that broke those stories, and it is something that we still discuss on a regular basis because it made such a profound difference in triggering the Mullighan inquiry.
For many years there have been claims by former wards of the state that they have been the victims of systemic abuse and systematic abuse; that children have been taken from state care and abused and then simply returned to have their reports of abuse ignored. I would like to pay particular tribute to Ki Meekins, a survivor of state care and a shining example of the resilience of the human spirit. It is because of the strength of people like Ki that these shocking stories have finally been told and acknowledged. We now need to focus on making amends and helping survivors of state and religious institutions. This report is an important step in that process. It is a valuable report. It is a report that needs to be acted upon with a great degree of urgency because the hurt is still there. These victims are still suffering and we need to make amends.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,33,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-06-25,"—I would very much like to endorse the comments made by my fellow members of the Community Affairs References Committee on this report and inquiry. I did not have the honour of being involved in the previous two inquiries but from the work that we did on this I now have just a small taste of the problems that have been experienced by the forgotten Australians and the lost innocents. My own particular area of interest is disability, and within the disability sphere there have been many, many examples of horrific abuse and trauma experienced by people, not only by those who are present in the gallery today but by many others as well.
I particularly acknowledge the support of the secretariat in producing this report at what has been a very busy time. The secretary of the committee, Mr Elton Humphery, was involved in the earlier inquiries and the wisdom and patience that he was able to bring to this inquiry was very helpful to all of us. I would also like to pick up on the comment made by my colleague Senator Humphries in his description of this as a ‘disgraceful chapter’ in Australia’s history. It is a disgraceful chapter in the history of not only Australia but also many other countries. The reports of the Irish inquiry are horrific in their description of abuse, time after time, in church-run institutions. Government departments just let it happen in the case of more than 250,000 children in Ireland.
It was a disgraceful chapter in Australia’s history, but it is not a closed chapter. In my view there are two reasons why it is not a closed chapter. It is partly because we have not fully redressed the hurt and injuries done to the lost innocents and forgotten Australians. As the report points out, what this requires is a full and real apology from all the players involved—the federal government, the state governments and real action from the churches. I would like to read briefly from our report:
The Committee received very little evidence in relation to statements issued by churches and agencies since the Forgotten Australians report, which reflects the fact that there has been little action by churches and agencies since that time.
We hope that our call for the Prime Minister to use his authority to push the churches into real action—real apology and real attempts at redress rather than public relations stunts that sweep things under the carpet—will actually happen. The other reason that I think this is not a closed chapter is that although it is far more subtle and far less out in the open, institutionalisation is still happening in Australia and the damage of it is still being felt by Australians. Time after time we have been having state governments, supported by federal government funding, developing institutions. They might be smaller but they are never going to be any better. I would like to briefly conclude by using a quote from the Irish Times in relation to the Irish inquiry which I think is just as relevant to us here. It said, ‘Abuse was not the failure of the system. It was the system.’
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

I would like to pay particular tribute to Ki Meekins, a survivor of state care and a shining example of the resilience of the human spirit. It is because of the strength of people like Ki that these shocking stories have finally been told and acknowledged. We now need to focus on making amends and helping survivors of state and religious institutions. This report is an important step in that process. It is a valuable report. It is a report that needs to be acted upon with a great degree of urgency because the hurt is still there. These victims are still suffering and we need to make amends.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,33,2,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-06-25,"—I would very much like to endorse the comments made by my fellow members of the Community Affairs References Committee on this report and inquiry. I did not have the honour of being involved in the previous two inquiries but from the work that we did on this I now have just a small taste of the problems that have been experienced by the forgotten Australians and the lost innocents. My own particular area of interest is disability, and within the disability sphere there have been many, many examples of horrific abuse and trauma experienced by people, not only by those who are present in the gallery today but by many others as well.
I particularly acknowledge the support of the secretariat in producing this report at what has been a very busy time. The secretary of the committee, Mr Elton Humphery, was involved in the earlier inquiries and the wisdom and patience that he was able to bring to this inquiry was very helpful to all of us. I would also like to pick up on the comment made by my colleague Senator Humphries in his description of this as a ‘disgraceful chapter’ in Australia’s history. It is a disgraceful chapter in the history of not only Australia but also many other countries. The reports of the Irish inquiry are horrific in their description of abuse, time after time, in church-run institutions. Government departments just let it happen in the case of more than 250,000 children in Ireland.
It was a disgraceful chapter in Australia’s history, but it is not a closed chapter. In my view there are two reasons why it is not a closed chapter. It is partly because we have not fully redressed the hurt and injuries done to the lost innocents and forgotten Australians. As the report points out, what this requires is a full and real apology from all the players involved—the federal government, the state governments and real action from the churches. I would like to read briefly from our report:
The Committee received very little evidence in relation to statements issued by churches and agencies since the Forgotten Australians report, which reflects the fact that there has been little action by churches and agencies since that time.
We hope that our call for the Prime Minister to use his authority to push the churches into real action—real apology and real attempts at redress rather than public relations stunts that sweep things under the carpet—will actually happen. The other reason that I think this is not a closed chapter is that although it is far more subtle and far less out in the open, institutionalisation is still happening in Australia and the damage of it is still being felt by Australians. Time after time we have been having state governments, supported by federal government funding, developing institutions. They might be smaller but they are never going to be any better. I would like to briefly conclude by using a quote from the Irish Times in relation to the Irish inquiry which I think is just as relevant to us here. It said, ‘Abuse was not the failure of the system. It was the system.’
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-06-25,"—The coalition supports the introduction of the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Bill 2009. Its clear intent is to provide a government service coordination function that has been identified as absolutely vital in the Northern Territory intervention. For those who are listening to this debate, the vernacular for the Northern Territory intervention, the terminology, is now ‘closing the gap in the Northern Territory’, but they mean the same thing. This concept clearly is not new. To be effective, I believe that there are some significant and serious challenges that the coordinator-general has to overcome.
Anyone who has had close association with Indigenous communities will be painfully aware of the lack of coordination between government departments over years and years and the confusion and the substandard delivery of service as a consequence of that. I suppose one of the realities is that, as an Indigenous community leader, you would think that you would have a special certificate in being a professional meeting attendee, given the numbers of meetings that are required. People land in aeroplanes and they say, ‘Where are the leaders?’ and they are all supposed to jump out there and be keen. That is a huge load on those leaders, and they often do not even understand the results of the meetings or what happened, so they are very confused.
What is proposed to occur through this piece of legislation I think will make it a lot better, although we need to be very careful about this. I am certainly reminded of an attempt by the Northern Territory government in 2001, with Bob Beadman. I think the intent was clearly to have a very similar effect to that of the coordinator-general as indicated in this piece of legislation. It had some successes, but inevitably the system failed because individual departments within the Northern Territory and individual departments within the Commonwealth were not able to communicate successfully. This is nothing new. Anybody who has had anything to do with bureaucracies knows that we have silos: ‘They are your silo of responsibility.’ There is no mischief in that; that is just the way the system is built. But, unless we are able to deal with desiloisation in a coordinated way, the proposal before us will fail as others have before it.
We still think that this is a very important proposal. I think it is very important for us to understand—and perhaps, in some sort of response, the minister may indicate—the nature of the relationship between the coordinator-general and other individuals who are responsible for the running of what is now called ‘closing the gap in the Northern Territory’. Certainly government business managers have provided a number of pieces of coordination, and I think they—to a greater and lesser degree, depending on who you talk to and which business manager you are talking about—have been quite successful.
As an exemplar, I was recently in Milingimbi, and there is actually a letter of agreement between the individual who runs the shire and the shire operations and the government business manager to have a meeting on any issue that affects either of their jurisdictions. I understand that there are only two other communities in which that occurs, and the coordination of the service delivery between them just works a lot better. They are all very busy people in these communities, but we have to have a dictate that says: ‘You are going to have to meet with these individuals. You’re going to have to ensure that this happens.’ To simply set up another head of something will fail as surely as did the process that introduced Mr Beadman.
I am not sure how it can be done, but all governments at all levels have to provide the necessary support to this individual to ensure that this works very well, and we need to do that very carefully. Indigenous Australians do not need any more promises; they deserve real action. I think this is a significant part of ensuring that we deliver that, but, without the support of all government departments across the board, that is not going to happen. Perhaps, Minister, those particular notes are not at hand, but I am sure you will be able to provide that advice to me at some stage. Certainly, if that advice is not available at the moment, it will not change our position on supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COORDINATOR-GENERAL FOR REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I will be brief in my response. I thank Senator Scullion for his contribution, but he has asked me to briefly deal with some matters—I will do that as best I can briefly in summing up.
The Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Bill 2009, as you would realise, Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, allows for government investment to be prioritised and coordinated to ensure that each priority location has the infrastructure and services to support and sustain healthy social norms so that people can reach their potential and communities can thrive. This position has been established to address the practical problems associated with designing, sequencing and rolling out myriad programs in remote communities. The bill provides for consultation with relevant state or territory governments before the minister specifies a remote location in a particular state or territory. The bill also makes provision for the coordinator-general to arrange with the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for the services of APS employees from the department to be made available. The state or territory coordinator-general for remote Indigenous services will be the first point of contact when the coordinator-general is exercising his or her powers in relation to a specified remote community in that state or territory.
To move specifically to the issues that Senator Scullion raised in his speech on the second reading—or those I am able to address at the moment—I can say that, when there is an issue requiring urgent remedy, this bill will give the coordinator-general the powers to require people to provide information and/or documents, to require people to attend meetings, and to request assistance from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. If the coordinator-general is not satisfied with the response from the head of the agency, the coordinator-general may report the matter to the minister and also to the Prime Minister, if necessary. The coordinator-general’s approach will be to work with other parties collaboratively. The coordinator-general will provide regular reports to the minister on progress made by all Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. The coordinator-general will ensure that the delivery of all government programs in the specified remote communities is coordinated between governments, instead of being planned and delivered in isolation. If the coordinator-general fails to receive an adequate response from an agency official, this bill allows for the matter to be reported to the head of the relevant Commonwealth state or territory agency.
In conclusion, again, I thank Senator Scullion for his speech on the second reading. I will make sure that his comments are referred to Minister Macklin so that she is aware of the views that he has expressed in the chamber today.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-06-25,"—The Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009 amends the Migration Act 1958 to ensure that all personal identity information obtained by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is subject to the access, use and disclosure regime in part 4A of the act. It follows provisions first enacted in the Migration Legislation Amendment ( Identification and Authentication ) Act 2004 which provided for the collection of biometric data by immigration officials. By strengthening the power of officials to collect personal identifying information, in turn the integrity of our immigration and border protection system was strengthened. Part 4A of the amended act contained provisions restricting access and disclosure of this personal information. Use of personal information outside these provisions carried significant penalties, including up to two years imprisonment.
In 2007, the coalition introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Bill 2007, which sought to broaden the circumstances through which personal identifying information could be accessed. These amendments were particularly important in improving the process of dissemination of information throughout the government, particularly for security related purposes. We are now advised by the government that recently acquired legal advice suggests that, in some cases, personal information collected by the department from other domestic and international agencies may not be protected by part 4A of the act. The coalition will be supporting these amendments to ensure that all personal identifying information held by the department is protected by part 4A provisions.
In the other place, the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Dr Stone, gave detailed background to the context and importance of this bill. Her remarks were in stark contrast to the misguided, ill-informed and politically-driven comments which were levelled by those opposite her, most particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, who chose instead to use his second reading speech to attack the opposition and, most remarkably, to defend himself over the recent Auditor-General’s report on his department’s actions in the allocation of grants, including to his own electorate of Reid. Mr Ferguson appeared to lose sight of the important legislation at hand, instead embarking on a desperate attempt to defend himself and Labor’s actions.
So let us look at ‘whiteboard mark 2’, and how Labor was found to have ignored its own guidelines on grant allocations. In a report dated 21 May 2009, the Auditor-General found that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship breached guidelines on the allocation of funding for the 2008-09 Settlement Grants Program. In Senate estimates on 28 May 2009 I was told that, of the 399 applications from 244 organisations, 230 new projects were funded under the program in 2008-09. When additional monies became available, the department identified five projects for funding. Four more projects were identified after discussions with the parliamentary secretary. No record was kept of this conversation. Of the four additional fun-ded—surprise, surprise!—two were in Mr Ferguson’s own electorate of Reid. It seems strange that, of all the remaining 170 projects that could have been chosen, two out of the four were from the parliamentary secretary’s own electorate. The Auditor-General’s report goes on to claim that it is not clear whether the ‘most deserving projects on the basis of merit’ were funded. The report is very critical: ‘without adequate documentation, departments are not able to demonstrate that all applications have been treated equitably.’ This incident makes a mockery of the so-called reforms to the administration of grants programs advocated by Labor after it came to power. This is indeed shades of the whiteboard and indeed can be aptly described as ‘whiteboard mark 2’. Instead of explaining the importance of the legislation, Mr Ferguson embarked on a feeble attempt to defend his actions—actions which have been criticised by the Auditor-General. In conclusion, the coalition will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTION OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009. I do not agree with the observations and interpretation she advanced; nevertheless, she was speaking in support of the bill.
The bill provides the appropriate framework for handling personal identifiers in the future. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Act 2007 made an amendment to the definition of ‘identifying information’ in paragraph 336A(a) to provide that it is any personal identifier provided under section 40, 46, 166, 170, 175, 188, 192 or 261AA of the act. However, these amendments to the definition in 2007 made these provisions more limited than the original policy intention.
Recent legal advice suggests that personal identifiers belonging to the department’s clients that are not currently protected by part 4A include those collected from other agencies, domestic or international; unsolicited external sources; and from law enforcement agencies often shared with the department as part of an investigation. In relation to these personal identifiers DIAC has been adhering to part 4A of the Migration Act and the Privacy Act where applicable, so there is no question of either act being breached. In order to ensure that the rights and privacy of persons whose personal identifiers are provided by international and external sources are protected under the act and to ensure our Australian and international partners that the data they will provide will be given this protection this bill will subject all personal identifiers collected by DIAC for immigration purposes to the same statutory regime, that being part 4A of the act. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-25,"—I rise today to speak on the Disability Discrimination and Other Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The coalition will be supporting this bill. This bill will amend a range of antidiscrimination legislation, but most importantly the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. It will also see some technical and cosmetic amendments, such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission changing its name to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Many of the amendments this bill makes arise from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission’s 2004 review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, which was commissioned by the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon. Ian Campbell. The majority of the amendments in this bill seek to enact recommendations which were accepted by the previous coalition government.
Australia was one of the first countries, under the former coalition government, to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in March 2007. The then coalition government consulted widely with stakeholder groups, including disability sector representatives, to gain an informed position on the key issues. With the ratification of the convention in 2008, it is important that we now move towards shifting attitudes in Australia in respect of disability.
To the greatest extent possible, we need to break down the social and economic barriers that prevent participation in mainstream community life by people with a disability. We need to move away from the thinking that sees disability support as welfare. A person with a disability has the entitlement to participate in the community and the workforce. And a person with a disability, with the right support, can make full use of their skills, their talents and their capacities. This bill goes some way to ensuring the positive duty to make reasonable adjustments for a person with a disability—reasonable adjustments so an individual can exercise choice and more easily engage in the workforce, reasonable adjustments that will give a person with a disability independence and choice. The aim is to overcome restrictions that limit opportunity and provide particular challenges and barriers to seeking work. Reasonable adjustments, by balancing net benefits for the community without imposing undue hardship on the organisations required to make them, will, when the amendment is adopted, make it much easier for a person to apply for a job without feeling that they have to hide any possible disability.
I hope that with this amendment we will see more people with a disability in the workforce. I hope that individuals will feel more inclined to disclose in advance to a potential employer any disability related needs or modifications which are required for them to perform the duties of the job and that they will not feel they have to opt not to make a job application for fear of being rejected due to a disability.
People with disabilities are underrepresented in the workforce due to the attitudes of society and a lack of support. One of the greatest challenges facing people with disability is acceptance by the community. To be able to dine with friends, do the grocery shopping or be in a public place are aspects of life that we all take for granted. Acceptance of a person with a disability sometimes requires people to accept not only the person with a disability but also their use of an aid or their reliance on an individual—a carer—or on an animal, as assistance that they need to take part in daily life.
This bill clarifies the requirements for an assistance animal to be recognised and also provides that discrimination on the grounds of a person having a carer, assistant, assistance animal or disability aid is equivalent to discrimination on the grounds of disability. The bill also makes clear that the definition of disability includes genetic predisposition to a disability.
Access to community life and independence are important objectives for us all. I think all senators are committed to supporting initiatives to provide and improve accessibility, equity, opportunity and choice for all Australians. It is easy for any one of us to mouth those words; it is much harder to deliver. I will just give one instance. The Productivity Commission’s 2004 review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into this bill both recommended implementing more accessible voting procedures for voters with a disability.
The coalition’s commitment to independence saw the introduction of a trial, at the 2007 federal election, of electronically assisted voting for electors who were blind or vision impaired. It is my belief that blind and vision impaired people should be able to take up their right to a secret ballot in future elections. The 2007 trial was seen as a success by stakeholder groups. To quote from Vision Australia’s submission to the committee inquiry into the 2007 federal election:
… it marked a milestone in Australia progressing toward a society which is fully inclusive of the needs of people with a disability.
It was therefore very disappointing on 17 March this year when the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters announced in a media release:
The committee has recommended that electronically assisted voting for blind and vision impaired electors … be discontinued.
After that release, I think very much in an admission of the committee’s failure to canvass alternatives, the committee chair, Mr Melham, said:
I don’t feel good about making the recommendation.
I think Mr Melham was recognising that simply saying that the trial will not be continued and there will be no future provision for blind and vision impaired people really was not an adequate response.
As I said, my belief is that that option of a secret ballot should be there for blind and vision impaired people. The coalition government’s trial certainly provided a positive experience for many voters. Mr Graeme lnnes, Human Rights Commissioner and Disability Discrimination Commissioner, said of the trial in 2007 and his ability to cast a vote:
I had tears in my eyes … I was able to exercise what I regard as a very important democratic right.
I believe that is a right which should be available. It remains to be seen what the Rudd government will do and how it will provide a secret vote for blind and vision impaired people. I hope that the government does see its way to facilitating blind and vision impaired people to access that right.
The coalition supports measures in this bill that widen opportunities for people with a disability to gain independence and participate in the community. These amendments, by placing responsibility on all relevant parties to work together, will remove much discrimination that is currently faced by people with a disability. This legislation is a move forward to achieving a more equitable society. I commend the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-25,"—in reply—I would like to thank Senator Fifield for his contribution and the support of the Liberal-National Party for this legislation. The amendments in the Disability Discrimination and Other Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our antidiscrimination system. There has been broad support for these amendments in both chambers.
This bill makes changes that have been reviewed and carefully considered not only by the government but also by respected bodies including the Productivity Commission, in its 2004 review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992; the Australian Law Reform Commission; and committees of this parliament. Key amendments in the bill will clarify the obligation of employers, service providers and others to remove discriminatory barriers for people with disabilities.
Other important amendments in the bill include removing the ‘dominant reason’ test from the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and amending the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 to formally change the name of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the Australian Human Rights Commission.
The bill was recently the subject of an inquiry and report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I am pleased to report to the Senate that the committee recommended that it be passed subject to an amendment in paragraph 30(3)(a) to clarify the onus of proof in cases involving unlawful requests for information. The government accepts the merits of the Senate committee’s recommendation and I can foreshadow that in the committee stage of this bill the government will move a minor amendment along these lines. The proposed amendment puts beyond doubt that the evidence must be provided under section 30 and that there was no unlawful purpose for which the information was sought.
The committee also made four other substantive recommendations of a more general nature which the government accepts in principle and to which it will give further consideration. Once again I thank Senator Fifield for his contribution to the debate and his support for the bill. The bill is another step towards ensuring our laws continue to promote equality, equal opportunity and a fair go for people with disability. It does so in a practical and measured way, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-25,"—The Senate is considering the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009. The so-called ‘special purpose vehicle’—SPV, dubbed OzCar—was established to help car dealers unable to obtain ongoing finance because of the credit squeeze. I remind the Senate that the credit squeeze was exacerbated by the mismanagement of the credit squeeze by Labor. Firstly, Labor’s ill-thought-out bank guarantee saw a flight of capital from credit companies to the banks. The consequences are there for all to see. Also, Labor’s huge spendathon, which has now sucked up $200 billion—and it is ever increasing—from the credit markets, made the credit supply all the more difficult. I still do not know how Mr Rudd and Mr Swan say with a straight face that somehow you deal with a credit crisis by putting a greater demand on credit resources by borrowing an extra $200 billion, which, by the end of it all, I think will be $315 billion.
—Bizarre.
—It really is, as Senator Fifield says, quite bizarre. It is an act of economic stupidity and long-term vandalism to the rightful inheritance of the next generation of Australians. When Labor make these economically irresponsible decisions there are flow-on consequences. And, of course, the flow-on consequence for car dealers was that they found themselves in real strife. That is what happens. Once you start unsettling one part of the economy, there are flow-on consequences. Therefore, a mechanism was needed to assist the car dealers. That mechanism was established with the great announcement and great fanfare of the $2 billion OzCar fund. We now know, courtesy of Senate estimates—and it was never issued by way of press release—that although the $2 billion was announced with great fanfare, it shrank to $850 million, and we think it is now down to $450 million. There was no further discussion by way of media releases as to that, but we found that out.
We have also found out that OzCar, the special purpose vehicle facility, would not be in existence but for the need of Ford Credit, for which the parameters of the original OzCar were substantially changed. Indeed, the incontrovertible evidence is that, but for Ford Credit’s needs, OzCar would not even have been established. What was the importance for Ford Credit? Very simply, Ford Credit provides funding to the car dealerships which, not surprisingly, sell Ford motor vehicles. If the car dealerships that sell these vehicles cannot exist, there is then—and this is interesting—a knock-on effect to Ford manufacturing in this country. Therefore, this facility is needed, and we support the government in establishing the facility and expanding the parameters to allow Ford Credit into the scheme, something which it was not designed for originally. These are the flow-on, knock-on consequences of the irresponsible decisions which Labor has taken.
There has been some questioning around the issue of Ford Credit’s involvement in the OzCar scheme, and I want to place a few statements of fact on the record. But, first, I want to deal with a number of smokescreens that have been put up. Firstly, there has been a deliberate campaign by Labor to suggest that the opposition created a fake email. There is no evidence, and, might I add, it is a completely false assertion. Are we actually to believe that somebody from the opposition, on the evidence known, broke into Treasury to create it on a Treasury computer? That is fanciful stuff. I know there have been a number of journalists anxious to ask me questions. Given that it was created on a Treasury computer, I just wonder why they do not ask Mr Rudd and Mr Swan, ‘Do you believe that somebody from the opposition actually went in there to create this fake email?’or whether he will now apologise. I think we know what the answer will be. They will not even bother to ask Mr Rudd that question, unfortunately. The second point and the second smokescreen is that the whole case of the opposition against Mr Swan was based on the email. Can I simply say that that email bore no relationship whatsoever, in any way, shape or form, to the allegations that still stand firm against Mr Swan—and they remain very firm.
I will make some other observations, especially in relation to my friends in the media who, all of a sudden, seem very interested in me: some of your members have been willing to risk imprisonment for not revealing their sources. It is a matter of great honour to them, yet they apply a completely different standard to the opposition when the opposition says, ‘We will not reveal our sources.’ It is interesting. Remember when Mr Rudd was going on about the Australian Wheat Board and he had cable after cable leaked to him?
—Where did he get those from?
—You could ask that question, Senator Fifield, but, interestingly, Mr Rudd was not asked by the media: ‘Reveal your sources.’ No such demand was made. Why not? Where is the standard here? I say to those journalists who rely on information provided to them: be very careful with this push—and I would in fact invite them to read the editorial in the Australian.
Can I also say that I am astounded at the language used. It seems that if a public servant gives information to a Labor opposition, all of a sudden they become a hero and they are a whistleblower. If a public servant gives information to a Liberal-National opposition they are a mole—an interesting change and nuance in the language employed by our very objective friends in the media! I would invite them to consider, and consider very carefully, their use of language and the way that they have sought to pursue this matter.
In case anybody is interested, the Hansard is up. On Friday, 19 June there was a hearing of a Senate committee, and I invite everybody to read that Hansard and the statements contained therein. May I say that the questions that I raised therein were proper for any opposition to follow up on the basis of information received. If certain questions had not been asked and journalists had somehow found out that certain information may or may not have been received by the opposition, the headlines would have been that we are gutless and that we do not know what the role of opposition is. The role of opposition is to test the material that is supplied to us from time to time. Read the Hansard, even upside down if you like, and you will find nothing other than a testing of information, a testing of propositions, which, as we now know, the witness was not allowed to answer because of the deliberate interference of Labor senators and the senior officer at the table.
But let us get back to the facts that do not rely on any email whatsoever. The facts are these: the Treasurer of this country knew via emails going to his home fax that a Treasury official would raise the issue of a Mr John Grant at a meeting on 23 February 2009—a crucial meeting. Without its $550 million requirement of guarantee Ford Credit would be sunk and, without Ford Credit, Ford manufacturing would be sunk. This was the seriousness of the proposition; there were thousands of jobs at stake.
We weasel into the discussion courtesy of a Treasury official with the specific instruction of the Treasurer: ‘By the way, there’s a fellow called John Grant who needs financing for his car dealership. By the way, I just happen to have with me his mobile telephone number. It might be helpful. By the way, he is a mate of the Prime Minister, but that is all irrelevant and the mobile number’s here. Give him a ring.’ And the Ford officials rang Mr Grant that very day and arranged to have further discussions a few days later. Can you imagine the immense pressure on Ford Credit? They were fighting not only for Ford Credit’s life but also for Ford’s manufacturing life in Australia—$550 million for Ford Credit plus all their investment in Ford manufacturing.
It was a huge burden and I lay no blame on Ford Credit for ringing Mr John Grant. But I do blame the Treasurer of this country for using his officers to ask for such an accommodation for Mr John Grant. Out of all the car dealers that had problems in this country, not a single one got the favoured treatment that John Grant did. Why John Grant, a mate and benefactor of the Prime Minister of this country? No questions about that. That is the absolute truth. That is the absolute situation. Mr John Grant, out of all the car dealers, was offered that special deal. Indeed, in trying to run his own defence—and the media should see this as very contemptuous of the parliament—Mr Swan put down a press pack of emails. He did not table it in the parliament where he was under attack but gave it to the media late in the afternoon so the opposition could not see it and respond to it until the next day. See how Labor is always driven by the media cycle? But finally the media did provide us with a copy of the emails and, as a result, the opposition could go through them.
Those emails are very telling, because they disclose that those car dealers on which Treasury officials were working had a detailed analysis attached to them: somebody was not in a financially sound position; somebody else was an elderly couple, but the children did not want to take over the family business and there was no succession plan. And so the detailed analysis went on. Where was the analysis of Mr John Grant’s business? It was not even John Grant. I think it was just ‘John tells us he fits the criteria’. That was the rigorous assessment that the Treasurer demanded. What a rigorous assessment: ‘John tells us it’s OK’. What else do the emails tell us? Every other car dealer was referred to by the name of the business. What about Mr Grant’s? Was it John Grant Motors? Was it even Mr Grant? Was it even John Grant? No, the emails flowing to the Treasurer’s home fax spoke of ‘John’: ‘John this’; ‘John that’; ‘John said.’ The familiarity just reeks of Labor Party mateship and Labor Party deals. No other car dealer was referred to only by their Christian name in these emails emanating from Mr Swan’s office which reported progress back to Mr Swan’s home fax. No other car dealer got that sort of special treatment.
Our case against Mr Swan is based on his misleading advice to the parliament that John Grant was dealt with in no special way; that he was dealt with no differently. We now know for a fact that it was only John Grant’s case that went to the Treasurer’s home fax. We now know from the information released that the only car dealer who was referred to by Christian name only was our dear friend John, Mr John Grant. We know that it was the only case raised on that particular Monday, 23 February with Ford Credit. Others had been raised with Ford Credit previously, but it was the only case on that particular Monday at the crucial meeting in Melbourne which was to help determine whether Ford Credit would be accommodated. The case of John Grant was raised and his mobile phone number handed over with a message ‘He’s a mate of the Prime Minister.’ It was all done with the full knowledge of the Treasurer, and when the bureaucrat got back to Canberra he sent an email outlining what he had done and that then got shot off to the Treasurer’s home fax as well.
The case is now clearly established that Mr Swan can no longer maintain and sustain his argument about Mr Grant. Mr Swan cannot say in any way, shape or form that John Grant was not treated in a preferential manner. He was treated in a preferential manner, and when the bureaucrat first got the message from the Treasurer’s office it was made perfectly clear that this was no ordinary constituent. There was something special about this man; he was a mate of the Prime Minister.
The legislation before us is necessitated by Labor’s poor handling of the economy. The credit crisis has been exacerbated by Labor’s foolish bank guarantee, which has had a flow-on consequence with people withdrawing money from credit companies into banks, and as a result the credit companies cannot provide the credit assistance that they have in the past. And if Ford Credit—and that is basically the only company that is now being accommodated by this—were not accommodated, Ford dealerships may well collapse around the country which would have dire consequences for Ford Australia’s manufacturing.
If Mr Swan’s involvement in Mr John Grant’s case had happened in the state of New South Wales, it would, without any measure of doubt, have been referred to ICAC. I thought my home state of Tasmania were the limbo champs with the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Senator Parry and Senator Bushby, who are sitting here with me, know that when somebody is caught misleading the parliament—even in state Labor—they do the decent thing and actually resign. And here is Mr Swan continuing to assert that nothing special was done. Clearly, something very special was done, and to suggest that the opposition’s case against Mr Swan relies on the email is simply false. It is untrue. The evidence is there for itself.
In my time as a lawyer and as a parliamentarian, I have always told people, ‘You can rely on my assurance that I will not breach confidences.’ If something is given to me confidentially, it will remain so with me—even if it becomes uncomfortable for me and even if it does become easier to reveal my source. My own personal integrity and my own professional integrity say that you cannot be concerned about yourself; it is about those people to whom you have given a promise and an assurance. So I say to my friends in the media and the Labor Party: do you really want a senator to breach a confidence and pursue that or do you want to pursue a Treasurer who, on the documentation that he has tabled in his flawed defence, shows that he has misled the parliament not once, not twice, but on more than half-a-dozen occasions over the past week or so. So, I indicate that the opposition supports the bill.",SENATE,<title>CAR DEALERSHIP FINANCING GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-25,"—The Greens will not be supporting this legislation. I will give cogent reasons for that in a moment. First, I want to refer to the contribution from Senator Abetz. He has turned his guns on the journalists today, saying that some of the members of that group have been prepared to go to prison rather than reveal their sources. But there is no journalist who has the power in the first place to veto a court that might hear the case that would lead to that outcome. This is not so with Senator Abetz. Today in this parliament, when a motion was put up by Senator Ludwig to refer matters to the Privileges Committee, the coalition and Senator Fielding effectively abolished the court, by refusing that reference. So there is not a clear analogy here at all. What should have happened, of course, was that the reference to the Privileges Committee—which, by the way, meets in camera and does protect sources—should have gone ahead. But it was blocked. Senator Abetz may have fled the chamber at the time of the vote—
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. Firstly, it is a reflection on a senator to suggest that I ‘fled’ the chamber. Secondly, I was paired. Given that the motion related to me personally, I thought that I should not be casting a vote and that a pair was appropriate. But Senator Brown cannot help himself; he has to reflect on me.
—As I was saying: Senator Abetz fled the chamber, through the pair mechanism, and that is on the record. Senator Abetz has at least now—
 (Senator Carol Brown)—Senator Brown, I ask you to withdraw your comments about Senator Abetz ‘fleeing’ the chamber.
—Absolutely. He left the chamber—if you see a difference there, Madam Acting Deputy President. He said he did himself.
—Senator Brown, I ask you to withdraw your statement about Senator Abetz ‘fleeing’ the chamber.
—I did and I do. He left the chamber, as he said, and was not present for the vote. What we have established now is that Senator Abetz knew—I did not—that the reference to the Privileges Committee involved him. That is his own admission. He said, ‘I invite anyone to read the Hansard.’ Well, I do read the Hansard. On page 35 of the Hansard of the economics committee proceedings last week, Senator Abetz says, ‘A person, a journalist in fact, has suggested to me that there may have been a communication from the Prime Minister’s office.’ I asked Senator Abetz to say who that journalist was, and—
—I don’t reveal my sources.
—He is not going to reveal his sources! I asked him if he would talk to that journalist and say, ‘Do you mind if you have me reveal the source?’ You see, what is happening is that there are double standards; one applies to journalists but the other applies to—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators will remain quiet and we will listen to Senator Bob Brown in silence.
—There is one set of standards that applies to journalists, who Senator Abetz has turned his aim at. But the other set of standards applies to unknown people, who he says are journalists—and only he can tell us whether they are fictional or not—that he wants to protect. He says that the role of the opposition is to test material provided. Well, so is the role of the Privileges Committee. Its role is, above all, to defend the integrity of the committee system and this chamber and to make sure that there is no avenue for deceit, cover-up, misinformation or the Senate being left without information which ought to be before it. If there were integrity and honesty in the stand of Senator Abetz, who now identifies himself, he would have ensured that, rather than being paired, he came across and voted for the inquiry, because the inquiry would have enabled him to clear any inference at all about him. But instead—in a very sad day for the Senate—the numbers were used in a political exercise to block the Privileges Committee from defending the interests of this Senate and its committee system. I would ask all members of the coalition and Senator Fielding to reflect on that. That motion should be back in here and reversed before the day is through, and it is up to them to decide whether they are going to do that or not. But, of course, there is no chance, because there is a political influence on the vote in this chamber to defend the opposition.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Brown is referring to a vote of the Senate early today which, under standing orders, he is not allowed to do.
—Senator Brown is allowed to refer to the vote. I do not believe he is reflecting on it.
—Senator Parry has not been here nearly as long as I have, or he would know better than that.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, could I ask you to refer that matter to the President. That matter was reflecting on votes. Senator Brown asked us to come back and vote again. That is reflecting on a vote of the Senate.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I heard the point of order as I was entering the chamber and, in a disorderly comment, I actually said that you are able to refer to a vote in the chamber. Madam Acting Deputy President, you may well accept Senator Parry’s invitation to raise that matter with the President, but I would make this point to you: there is nothing to prevent any senator at any time from referring to a vote in the chamber. There is, of course, a standing order that relates to reflecting on a vote in the chamber. When Senator Parry made his point of order, he actually used the terminology ‘referring’, and I made a comment as a result of that. But I would respectfully suggest that that is a very different issue from a point of order that might be taken—a matter for ruling, of course, by the chair—about reflecting on a vote of the Senate. There is a substantive difference, and I would respectfully suggest that Senator Parry needs to take account of that.
—I do believe Senator Faulkner may be correct about my terminology being incorrect. However, I still ask that the President review this matter, look at Hansard and determine whether or not Senator Brown was reflecting on a vote of the Senate.
—I will refer it to the President.
—I endorse that reference, Madam Acting Deputy President. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation. We believe there is a much better use for this guarantee money than the use to which the government now wishes to put it. But we do not want to back an estimated $550 million more of taxpayers’ money going to this industry. It must be seen in the context of a much wider support base for the industry from government in Australia. The fringe benefits tax concession was worth $1.9 billion. The Commonwealth recently gave $149 million to Holden for the production of four-cylinder cars. The government announced last year a $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund. The government is carrying on the Howard government’s move to continue to provide $2 billion more to industry over the period 2006 to 2010 through tax credits on imported cars. The Rudd government has committed a further $3.4 billion in assistance for the industry, which it plans to roll out from 2011 to 2020.
The addition $550 million in support for car dealerships stands in contrast to the outrage expressed by the industry against the increase in the luxury car tax in 2008. There are legitimate questions over why this industry is supported above funding for the public transport sector. The government indicated in the last budget that it will spend $3.2 billion on metro rail over five years at an average of just $637 million a year. This is just one-third of the annual assistance provided to the car industry from the fringe benefits tax. Surely, that is totally out of whack in an age of climate change and an age of a very great need for infrastructure to go into the public transport sector. Such funding further institutionalises car dependence, increases our vulnerability to rising oil prices, and creates costs to our health and our community.
In the second reading debate the coalition indicated they are largely supporting this bill because it will support and protect jobs in country areas. We believe the money could be much better spent not just on protecting jobs in country regions but through a green new deal creating thousands more jobs in the country. The government ought to be equally concerned about the impact of climate change on many more jobs in rural and regional areas, including 128,000 jobs in the Murray-Darling Basin and 63,000 jobs on the Great Barrier Reef. It ought to be willing and prepared to support a higher renewable energy target and a higher greenhouse gas abatement target. That will do much more to generate employment than ensuring the car industry in the diminishing way in which this program has been put forward. It is public money. There are alternative uses. There are better uses for creating jobs in rural and regional Australia. The Greens have put those uses forward, and we want to see the money go in that direction instead.

—The reason why we have government debt in Australia is a consequence of the world economic and financial crisis. As I have pointed out on a number of occasions—and indeed yesterday Senator Coonan, the shadow minister for finance, referred to this—the Commonwealth revenues have been significantly affected by the global financial and economic crisis, to the tune of $210 billion. There are two forms of debt: gross debt and net debt.
—I asked about gross debt.
—Yes, I heard your question, but I point out that there are two forms of debt. There is gross debt and net debt. The Liberal opposition have lapsed into a bad habit of only referring to gross debt. When they were in government, they would refer to net debt generally. So in terms of the gross debt for the 2008-09 financial year, the estimates have shown $111.9 billion.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-06-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to public hospitals.
This government have been an absolute failure when it comes to health. They have not fixed public hospitals despite an unequivocal pre-election commitment by the Prime Minister to do so by the middle of 2009. They are putting additional pressure on public hospitals through their misguided ideological attack on Australians doing the right thing by the health system by taking additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. It is an ideological attack on people with private health insurance. They are now running away, at a million kilometres an hour, from the equally emphatic pre-election commitment that if sufficient progress had not been made by the middle of 2009, the Rudd government would take to the Australian people the proposition that the Commonwealth would take over the running of Australia’s 750 public hospitals.
We have a health minister who is more occupied with doing the bidding of the Treasurer, being the propaganda machine for the Treasurer, than with focusing on implementing and pursuing sound public policy on health. If we had a minister that was more focussed on fixing public hospitals rather than being out there doing the Treasurer’s bidding, perhaps our public hospitals would be a little bit better off. Today I asked a series of questions of Senator Ludwig. I asked, ‘Are Australia’s public hospitals fixed?’ He talked us through a whole series of bureaucratic processes that go on within government. Any government can provide a running list of all the great things they do, but it is outcomes that we are interested in. The Prime Minister did not promise that he would go through a whole series of bureaucratic processes. He promised that Australia’s public hospitals would be fixed. There is evidence in state after state after territory that they are not fixed. We had another half-a-dozen questions to ask, giving examples from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia that Australia’s public hospitals are not fixed.
Even the Prime Minister realises that he will not be able to achieve his emphatic pre-election commitment. Quietly, quietly, hoping that nobody would notice, he made a little change to his website where he talks about the government’s commitment to the health system. This time last year the Prime Minister’s website listed its commitment on health under a headline ‘Fixing our hospitals’. Do you know what it says now? It says, ‘Improving our hospitals’. Last year he was going to fix our hospitals; this year he will be improving our hospitals. I bet he did not think anybody would notice. This was done quietly, sneakily, so that nobody would notice. There is all this back-peddling: ‘We do not want people to think that we are not doing what we are saying we are doing, so we are just going to change what it is that we allegedly promised.’ So ‘fixing’ our hospitals has become ‘improving’ our hospitals.
There are a few other ‘minor’ linguistic changes that I am sure the Senate would be interested to know about. This is what the Prime Minister said last year:
… if significant progress towards the implementation of the reforms—
the national health care reform, in partnership with state and territory governments—
has not been achieved by mid-2009, the Government will seek a mandate from the Australian people at the following federal election for the Commonwealth to take financial control of Australia’s 750 public hospitals.
So last year he referred to ‘significant progress towards implementation’. Now he says, ‘We will develop a long-term reform plan.’ So it is no longer ‘significant progress towards implementation’; it is, ‘By the middle of 2009 we will finalise a plan.’ So the government have gone from, ‘We promise outcomes; we promise to fix hospitals,’ to bureaucratic process language.
This is an absolute disgrace. This government have been a failure in health. They are so blinded by their ideological hatred for private health that that is what has been guiding their first 18 months in office. They have not focused on the main game. They have not focused on what is required—to actually ensure that we have a health system that works. Everything that we have had from this government is spin and rhetoric, no substance whatsoever. It is time that somebody held this government to account for their absolute failure in health.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Hospitals</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,42,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I did not have a chance this morning to check the Australian, because I know that in the last few days you had to look at what was in the Australian to see what the questions were going to be. I have not seen it yet today; there could well have been a paper issue on health, because that was the focus today.
I am really pleased that Senator Cormann is such an astute reader of the Prime Minister’s website. This came out during the Senate estimates process, where he was able to quote chapter and verse from the Prime Minister’s website. We appreciate that, Senator Cormann. It is really useful to know that those websites are being well read and that the linguistics of the process are being looked at. Maybe what we should be looking at is what the government said they were going to do, which is that they were going to work with the states. They said that no longer were we going to use the old blame game process that we saw year after year in this place. When there were any questions about the health system, the previous government had a really quick answer: it was the state’s fault; it was always somebody else’s fault. When we came into government we saw there was a problem.
First of all, we acknowledged there was a problem. We actually said we would put in place processes that would look towards fixing the public health system. We used those terms, because we saw there was a real problem. Immediately, the government decided that they needed to have the whole process engaged. So we developed the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. We gave that group a mandate to independently look at what was going on in the process, to provide feedback to the government and to talk to people across all states—professionals, people in consumer groups, people in state government and everybody who had an interest in our health system. This commission was carefully appointed with people who represented those areas to feed back to the government and look professionally at what we could do with the health system, because we acknowledged that the public health system needed some help. That process came out and there were discussion papers and interim reports. It has gone back out now to the community, and we are waiting for the next round of that to come through so that, then, that can work with the COAG process—once again, engaging with all the states—to see what we have to do. This is after the government has already made the public announcement of the $64 billion package over a period of five years to look specifically at the health system and $600 million to look at reducing elective surgery waiting times—and, most particularly, effectively looking at training packages to ensure that we have appropriate, trained professionals at every level of our health system to provide that service.
I note the questions that were given by senators, such as Senator Nash, about particular issues in rural Australia. Her questions, quite rightly, were looking at rural New South Wales. Nobody is running away from those questions. I note Senator Cormann’s issues about running away. No-one is running away from that. But I well remember—when similar questions were asked by Labor senators on that side of the chamber—being lectured to by various members of the then government about how long it took to train professionals. I well remember the special day we were told that it took a long time to train a doctor. Well, we have actually responded to that. In terms of what happened with our government, we are working with the professional groups so that we can put specific methods in place to engage with professionals to ensure that we can respond to the need, because the issues Senator Nash raised were particularly about having trained professionals working in regional Australia. We also looked at the particular needs of a regional and rural health program. And that is on our record. In terms of the process, certainly there needs to be engagement at all levels. No-one is running away from that. But we also need to have a little bit more understanding. Rather than standing up in this place and saying ‘the government has failed’ because on a certain date it has not fixed everything in the health system, we need to go forward.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I understand. We will look at pre-election promises. That is a very easy thing to do. Many senators here can pull those out, chapter and verse. We can read websites as well. We have those skills. In terms of process there needs to be work done to look at what has to be done with our health system. The Rudd government is going to do that work. We will move forward and we will ensure that our system is improved in the future. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-06-25,"—What an extraordinary display of spin today from the Labor government. There is a very simple principle here. The Prime Minister has said, ever since Labor came into government, that they would honour all their election commitments and promises. And they have not. It is a bit unfortunate that I cannot bring some props in here—we are precluded from doing so. If I had one, it would be the size of the front of a newspaper, it would have a very big smiling picture of the Prime Minister on it, it would have a very big smiling picture of Justine Elliot on it, and the caption would be: ‘Kevin Rudd will fix our hospitals’. It does not matter how much spin the other side try to put on this, that paper, in the electorate of Richmond, promised those people in that electorate, and in all of the other electorates that it went to around the country, that Kevin Rudd would fix our hospitals. It is a simple premise.
The other thing he said was that, if there had not been an improvement in the state hospital system, he would move to take over the 750 public hospitals around the country. Neither of those two things can possibly be in dispute, because they were in writing at the time from the Prime Minister. As far as I can tell—and I do not think I am particularly stupid—they are election commitments. So, on the one hand, we have the Prime Minister saying, ‘I’m going to honour all our election commitments’; and here we have some that are about to be broken. This is not something that has come from this side of the chamber; this has come from the Labor government. It was the Labor government that said, ‘We will fix the hospitals.’ It is their promise that they have broken. It is their commitment that they are not going to honour. The improvement is simply not there.
Everybody on this side of the chamber knows that, obviously, on the other side of the chamber they do not spend enough time visiting hospitals—particularly not regional hospitals which are suffering so badly and at which there has been no improvement. And there has been no improvement. You have only got to look at places like Dubbo Hospital, where they have had to go to their local vet to borrow bandages. If that is an improvement, I am completely at a loss. Or look at Coonabarabran Hospital, where they had to stop offering their patients meat, because the local butcher simply could not be paid. Again, if that is an improvement, I am completely at a loss. It is simply wrong to say there has been any improvement. Every single person I talk to in regional communities right across the state tells me that there has been no improvement. And this is no indictment of our doctors and nurses, who do an absolutely brilliant job under the conditions they are asked to work in, in providing those services as best they possibly can for our regional people. For the health minister to come out on 25 May and say there have been ‘positive signs of improvement’ and ‘significant developments’ and ‘improved outcomes’ is bureaucratic rubbish. It is the same bureaucratic rubbish that we heard from the minister today in his answers to questions. He had simply no idea. I am not sure he was even listening to the questions, because the answers he gave bore no relation whatsoever to the questions that were asked. It was bureaucratic rubbish!
From Senator Moore, on the other side, we had more bureaucrat spin about ‘reviews’ and ‘we’re working with’. I think she actually indicated that it was her understanding that what they promised during the election campaign was to work with the states. Rubbish! Their promise was to fix the hospitals. Regardless of what other Labor senators are about to say, that is the absolute truth. They promised, very simply, two clear things. The Prime Minister said he would honour all his election commitments, and fixing our hospitals was one of them. If our hospitals are not fixed, he has broken an election promise to every single person across this country. Every single person across this country should be aware of that. They would remember that, because people talked about it at the time. They would come up and say, ‘Kevin Rudd says he is going to fix our hospitals.’ Weren’t they living in a pipedream thinking he might actually come through and do it! Because he has not. Unless he can pull a rabbit out of the hat in the next five days and fix the hospitals, he has broken an election promise. There are no two ways about it. If he thinks there has been an improvement in our hospital system then he must believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden. Every single person out in our communities knows that our hospitals have not been improved. The Prime Minister should live up to his election promise.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Hospitals</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,42,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2009-06-25,"—What never ceases to amaze me in this place is the hypocrisy of those opposite. After 18 months in government, I would put our track record up against theirs any day of the week—on health or any other issue. In fact, in the future I will be extremely happy to put up the 12-year record of the Rudd Labor government against the Howard-Costello mess of 12 long years in government. It was really interesting to hear Senator Cormann, who believes he is the new champion of health, talk about what is happening in every state around the country. As usual, the opposition, as they did when they were in government, have neglected Tasmania. They never mention Tasmania. Why? Because it is so embarrassing. If you want to talk about health, let us talk about the Mersey Hospital on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Let us talk about the Howard government intervening in health, shall we? Let us talk about John Howard and his election promises.

—If you could give me the courtesy of allowing me to make the point of order, Senator Cormann, that would be useful. A bit of interjection is the usual practice, but those of us on this side listened in relative silence to the contributions of those on the other side.

—There is no point of order. Senator Polley.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. We on this side realise we have hit a nerve when they—
—Mr Deputy President, just to clarify: are you ruling that interjections are in order?
—No. Senator Wong, I have been in the chamber for a long time today and I have heard much louder interjections than what I heard in the past minute or two.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I always feel like I have hit a home run when they start interjecting. They do not like to hear the facts. They do not want to go back to the history of 12 long years of neglect by the Howard government. We are talking about the Mersey Hospital on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I notice that there are not any Tasmanian coalition senators here, because they are embarrassed—
—Yes, there are.
—I do not hear them interjecting about the north-west coast. If it is Senator Parry—I can only see a bit of a bald head—he would be joining me, because he has been on record in the media in relation to how he felt about the Howard-Costello intervention in the Mersey Hospital and the damage that was done there. At least he has the courtesy to listen rather than interject. As I said, I would be very happy to stand on this side of the chamber in 12 years and put the Rudd Labor government’s record up against yours any day of the week.
When it comes to health, can we talk about what has really happened. I take Senator Nash’s concerns. I understand that she has a genuine concern on regional and rural health. I acknowledge that. I also acknowledge that Senator Humphries has a genuine interest in health. But I do not think there are many senators who can talk more about rural health than those on both sides of the chamber who represent Tasmania. I represent Tasmania and my home city of Launceston. I want to put on record that it is not just spin by government senators, as has been indicated by Senator Nash.
—Order! The clock has been frozen at three minutes and 40 seconds for some time. It takes a very powerful speech, Senator Polley, to stall the clock!
—I hope I am not going to be robbed now, because I am really enjoying the opportunity—
—I think we are being quite generous to you, Senator Polley. You may get some extra time.
—And so you should be! Thank you, Mr Deputy President. It is important for the Australian community and, in particular, the Tasmanian community to have their voices heard in this place. I am talking about the huge injection of funds into the Launceston General Hospital and what it is going to mean to all Tasmanians and, in particular, those in the north of the state. In fact, some $40 million has been allocated to enhance the services that are already provided by the Launceston General Hospital. What that means to the local people is that there will be better services. There has been an injection of money to attract nurses back into the field. Because of the neglect of the Howard government in terms of skilling, we are trying to ensure, as a responsible government would, that we have more GPs and doctors trained. We are trying to ensure that we have an environment where nurses want to continue in the workforce and where those who leave the workforce to have a family will have an enticement and an inducement to come back into this very important area.
In relation to promises and election commitments, I think it is a bit rich for the other side to lecture us, after 18 months in government, on not delivering on election commitments. When we talk about the buck stopping with Kevin Rudd, yes it does. But this week we are seeing the buck stop with Eric Abetz and Malcolm Turnbull.
—Order! Senator Polley, you have been in this place long enough to know to refer to people by their proper titles.
—I will respectfully refer to Senator Abetz and to Mr Turnbull. In terms of the blame game, we acknowledge that this is not the entire responsibility of the federal government in terms of our state public health system; it is also the responsibility of the state and territory governments. I have been listening to the opposition for 2½ years constantly blaming the states over health. We have actually taken some decisive action. The health system will not be repaired quickly; I think it is totally unrealistic of those opposite to come in and expect us, after 12 years of neglect, to be able to fix everything in 18 months.
—You made the promise.
—I welcome the interjection, because what I am doing is hitting a raw nerve in those opposite. They do not like to hear about the truth and they do not like to actually have the facts. What they want to do is engage in rhetoric because they have no substance, they have absolutely nothing. If we want to talk about commitments and flip-flops, I think that trophy goes fairly to those on the opposite side. But I think you will find that the Australian public has, as I know the Tasmanian community has, welcomed the strong and compassionate interest that this government has demonstrated very clearly in the first 18 months of where we see the future of health in this country. We are the ones who are working to ensure that there are more GPs. We are the ones who are working to ensure that there are more nurses coming back. We are the government that is doing more for regional and rural health and acknowledging the difficulties that the community in those areas experience. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2009-06-25,"—Despite an extended period of time for her contribution, Senator Polley did not really touch on the issue raised by Senator Cormann, namely the minister’s inability to explain how in five days time the government is going to keep the promise made by the Prime Minister to fix our public hospital system. Of course, the answer that the minister could not bring himself to utter is that he can’t and they won’t, and the government has made an empty and vacuous promise which is going to leave a great many Australians disappointed.
Senator Cormann in his contribution made a very appropriate and very timely point in this debate, which is that we have a system today which responds to outcomes, which is about outcomes as far as Australians are concerned. Australians do not go into their public hospital and go to the emergency department at 10 o’clock at night and sit there until five o’clock the following morning waiting to get some ailment dealt with and say, ‘Thank goodness the federal government has pumped another $64 billion into our public hospital system. We would have been here until midday.’ They do not say that. They want to know what happened to the promise to fix the hospital system. If there was evidence available to the Australian public that there were actually improving outcomes in public hospitals around the country, there would be some basis for thinking that perhaps we had not quite fixed them but we were at least fixing them or in the process of doing that. But the evidence is to the contrary: waiting lists going up, times for elective surgery increasing. It was 34 days last year, two days longer than the previous year. Waiting times in public hospital emergency departments are going up. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are having to wait 2½ times the rate of other Australians to get elective surgery. There is a whole list of statistics indicating that Australia is going backwards.
The reliance on the question of inputs, on what we are doing and what we are putting into the system, rather than what is coming out of the system, underlines the mistake the Labor Party is making. There is an issue about how you deliver reform in our public hospital system. You guys are relying on shovelling X billion dollars into the state hospital systems hoping it is going to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the evidence is absolutely compelling that it will make the problem worse rather than better. We have no indication that these people have any capacity to deliver better outcomes no matter how much extra money is pumped in. The consultation you are undertaking, the extra dollars you are throwing in, may not be the best way the public can see better outcomes in the system. Certainly to date they have not seen those better outcomes. Have the decency to tell the Australian people what you mean by ‘fixing the public hospital system’. Tell them what you mean by that. What can they look at as an indication that things are getting better in their public hospital system? If you cannot do that much, your promise is not worth very much. Your promise about improving the system even is not worth very much if you cannot tell us now what the benchmarks are that you are going to use to reflect the improvements that you say you are going to make to our system.
The solution to this issue is very simple: have the guts to do what you did with, for example, that promise to create a department of homeland security. It was a silly promise. You worked out after a few weeks of government that it was not going to make any sense, you had a little review and you quietly dumped the idea; no more department of homeland security. Well, next Tuesday is a good time to come clean, for Kevin Rudd to get up there in one of his media conferences and say, ‘Look, by the way, I said something 18 months or two years ago which was a little bit on the stupid side. I promised to fix our public hospital system by today. I haven’t done that. Sorry about that. We will find some other measure to work out how we are going to make things better in our public hospital system.’ And we would respect him for it. Unfortunately, the government’s response to the failure of its promise is more frightening than the fact that the promise has been broken. Its response has been simply to channel vast amounts of money into state government bureaucracies which have demonstrated a spectacular lack of ability to actually make a difference in a positive way. You are not the first government to pump extra money into our system; it has been happening for years and years. It happened under the Howard government as well. Unfortunately, the vehicle for doing that leaves a great deal to be desired.
You held the tantalising hope out to the Australian people that you might take on responsibility for Australia’s public hospitals. That appears to be part of the cruel hoax that you engaged in when making that promise. You apparently have no intention of putting that to a referendum anymore or considering that issue anymore. If I am wrong, tell me so. The fact is that you have broken your promise big-time and you should admit it. (Time expired)

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:

Anti-Terrorism Laws Reform Bill 2009

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

The Bill outlines specific provisions in the Criminal Code 1995 related to the definitions relating to terrorism offences, provisions relating to the proscription of `terrorist organisations’, offences relating to interaction with ‘terrorist organisations’, ‘reckless possession of a thing’ and the offence of sedition, provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 relating to detention of terrorism suspects, provisions in the Australian Security In formation Organisation Act 1979 relating to the questioning of terrorism suspects and the detention of terrorism suspects; and repeals the National Security Information Act 2004. The Bill seeks to implement the recommendations and findings of reviews that have been held in response to particular situations arising from the terror laws, Haneef etc, and the objections of leading legal organisations and advocates to particular provisions of the anti-terrorism laws, which were passed in haste. Australia’s parliament and community did not get an opportunity to hold a thorough, calm and considered debate over the terrorism laws when they were introduce, an inquiry into these components of the laws offers such an opportunity.

Name of bill:

Anti-Terrorism Laws Reform Bill 2009

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

The Bill outlines specific provisions in the Criminal Code 1995 related to the definitions relating to terrorism offences, provisions relating to the proscription of `terrorist organisations’, offences relating to interaction with ‘terrorist organisations’, ‘reckless possession of a thing’ and the offence of sedition, provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 relating to detention of terrorism suspects, provisions in the Australian Security In formation Organisation Act 1979 relating to the questioning of terrorism suspects and the detention of terrorism suspects; and repeals the National Security Information Act 2004. The Bill seeks to implement the recommendations and findings of reviews that have been held in response to particular situations arising from the terror laws, Haneef etc, and the objections of leading legal organisations and advocates to particular provisions of the anti-terrorism laws, which were passed in haste. Australia’s parliament and community did not get an opportunity to hold a thorough, calm and considered debate over the terrorism laws when they were introduce, an inquiry into these components of the laws offers such an opportunity.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-06-25,"—by leave—I move:
That, on Thursday, 25 June 2009:
the routine of business from not later than 3.45 pm shall be government business only;
consideration of government documents under general business and consideration of committee reports, government responses and Auditor-General’s reports under standing order 62(1) and (2) shall be proceeded with;
divisions may take place after 4.30 pm; and
the following government business orders of the day shall be considered: Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009
Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009
Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and two related bills
Just for those who may have a range of pieces of paper relating to hours on their desk today, I will outline the routine of business. From not later than 3.45 pm it shall be government business only. The three bills will be the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009, which we are part of the way through debating, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and two related bills.
In addition, divisions may take place after 4.30 pm. I will also seek leave to withdraw government business notice of motion No. 6 when this is agreed to. What that effectively means for the remaining part of the afternoon is that we will go through and deal with those bills. There will come a point at about 6 pm when we will return to government documents, by which time we should have finished dealing with those bills. We will continue to monitor the chamber to ensure that happens.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,45,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-06-25,"—I would like to clarify with the minister that the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill is no longer on the proposed list and express the Greens’ view that it should be. We are prepared to debate and consider that bill until it is dealt with. I do think it is a matter of urgency. I have spoken with numerous people, even just today, about how this is impacting on their daily lives. A further deferral of this issue would have an impact on many people’s lives and I do not think there is any reason why we should not deal with it tonight.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-25,"—I rise to speak on the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009, which has been the backdrop of some current events over the last week. The opposition will not be opposing the passage of this legislation. Car dealers are encountering serious and genuine difficulties obtaining finance in the current economic climate. We do know that the global financial situation has contributed to a freezing up of global credit markets, with risk averse lenders re-evaluating many of their businesses and reluctant to lend. But there is no doubt that the Rudd government’s ill-considered bank deposit guarantee has made the situation far worse, as foreign banks and other financial institutions have come under enormous pressure as nervous customers seek the safety of government guaranteed deposit-holding institutions.
These factors contributed to two major finance companies, GE and GMAC, withdrawing from the car dealer wholesale floor plan finance market earlier this year. Many concerned dealers, who rely on readily accessible finance to drive their sales, have understandably found themselves in a very vulnerable financial situation. I understand that potentially hundreds of dealers, particularly in rural and regional Australia, were at very serious risk of becoming financially unviable if they were not able to access alternative sources of credit.
The coalition has always held the view that the best way to assist these dealers is to persuade GE and GMAC to withdraw their participation in the car dealer finance market in a more ordered and considered way rather than simply pulling up stumps on 1 January, as they advised they were going to do. Thankfully, both companies have opted to withdraw more gradually, and many other finance companies have stepped in to offer finance to these dealerships. This means the expected amount of guaranteed funds has declined from $2 billion to the most recent estimate of around $450 million. So the government is pushing ahead to establish a special purpose vehicle it has dubbed the OzCar fund, and the major beneficiary will be Ford Credit.
An important fact is that Ford Credit was not originally targeted for the government scheme. The parameters were changed to accommodate Ford Credit when it became clear it required assistance. The coalition does not quibble with Ford Credit’s inclusion in the scheme. However, the process of negotiation with Ford Credit raises serious questions about the government’s behaviour. These questions go to the heart of the saga which has unfolded over the last week. They go to the heart of this government’s credibility and they raise serious doubts about the Treasurer and his honesty.
All the available information suggests that Mr Swan has misled the parliament. In previous governments, misleading the parliament was considered a serious and sackable offence, certainly an offence which the previous government took very seriously. But the current government is intent on playing a game of smoke and mirrors to obscure serious questions that Mr Swan must answer. Mr Swan has repeatedly stated that the now very well known Mr John Grant, a personal friend and donor to the Prime Minister, an associate of the Treasurer and someone from whom he bought a car, has received ‘no special treatment’. Mr Swan told parliament on 15 June, referring to Mr Grant: he ‘received the same assistance as any other car dealer’. Mr Swan had previously said, in the House of Representatives on 4 June, in relation to the representations by his office:
I have no idea what the outcome of that was.
He said so in subsequent media interviews as well. Both Mr Swan and the Prime Minister have said that they stand by those comments 100 per cent. But we have good reason to be very sceptical about the Treasurer’s statements.
Let us consider for a moment the chronology of events which led to this saga. Mr Bernie Ripoll, a Queensland Labor backbencher, referred the case of Mr Grant to the Treasurer’s office. A senior staffer in the Treasurer’s office contacted a Treasury official who was responsible for OzCar to see if he could assist Mr Grant. That Treasury official has stated that it was clear to him that Mr Grant was ‘not your average constituent’ and was an ‘associate of the Prime Minister’.
The government has called into question the testimony of that particular Treasury officer, but we do not have to rely on his testimony to gauge the importance which was placed on the case of Mr Grant. There is ample evidence which testifies to the importance that the Treasurer’s office placed on this case. Firstly, the officer who was assisting Mr Grant, at the request of the Treasurer’s office, took extraordinary steps to assist Mr Grant. The officer met with Ford Credit, who were seeking access to up to $450 million in taxpayers’ money from the government. That meeting took place in Melbourne on 23 February. At that meeting, the officer raised the case of Mr Grant on behalf of the Treasurer.
There were two unusual facts about the request he made to Ford Credit for their assistance to Mr Grant. Firstly, Mr Grant operates a Kia dealership, not a Ford dealership, and Ford Credit only services Ford and Volvo dealerships. Secondly, the Treasury officer gave representatives of Ford Credit Mr Grant’s mobile phone number with instructions to contact him and see if they could assist. This raises very serious issues. Mr Deputy President, place yourself in the shoes of Ford Credit. They desperately need finance to assist their dealers around the country who face financial ruin if they are not able to access credit quickly. But Ford Credit was not originally eligible for the scheme, and they were engaged in a lobbying effort for the scheme’s parameters to be altered to include them. At a meeting with the Treasury official—who would have significant influence, you would think, on whether or not they gained access to the scheme—they were asked to do a favour for someone they would not ordinarily assist, someone who did not operate a Ford or Volvo dealership. It was a favour for no less than a personal friend of the Prime Minister. It becomes pretty clear what is expected of them in that situation, and it is highly inappropriate. It was not what Ford was expected to do—you cannot blame Ford—but the expectation that was placed on Ford by the government that was inappropriate. It is telling that the government is not able to point to any other instance where a senior Treasury official, acting at the instruction of the Treasurer’s office, provided the mobile phone number of a dealer in need of help to Ford Credit, and it is also telling that it was provided at a point where Ford Credit was most likely to be eager to please.
But these are not the only issues in the case of Mr Grant. In an effort to demonstrate that Treasury officials and the Treasurer’s office were going to equal lengths for other dealerships, Mr Swan’s office has released a series of emails about other dealers—emails which Senator Abetz referred to in his contribution. One of these was raised by a Liberal backbencher. The government exclaimed: ‘Aha! Gotcha! See: the government were willing to help anyone who needed assistance. The PM’s mate got no special favours.’ That is the thesis from the government. It is a great argument except for a few inconvenient truths. We know from emails originally provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics that the Treasurer took a very personal interest in the case of Mr Grant. Emails on the matter to and from his staff and the Treasury officer were cc-ed to the Treasurer, and his staff even went to the extraordinary length of faxing all email correspondence from Treasury to Mr Swan’s home fax machine.
The Treasurer has attempted to suggest that he was very interested in this issue generally and concerned about the plight of all car dealers. If he were being truthful, I think most of his fellow ministers would have to hang their heads in shame. Do they all have constituent inquiries of that nature, in that detail, faxed to their homes too? I would be surprised. But, unsurprisingly, other dealers did not get this rolled-gold treatment. Of all other emails made public by Mr Swan’s office, none state that they are being faxed to his home—not even cc-ed to Mr Swan. Why, then, the special treatment for Mr Grant? Is it possible that it just might be because he happens to be a friend and donor to the Prime Minister, or is it simply a coincidence that Mr Swan followed every email on Mr Grant’s case with the Treasury?
The government have attempted to make this debate about the opposition. They say the opposition have smeared Mr Rudd and Mr Swan, that we have pursued this issue too vigorously and that we should all just let it be. In effect, they are saying, ‘Move on; there’s nothing to see here.’ I am sure all governments would love it if oppositions did not pursue allegations of misconduct—you cannot blame them; it is fair enough—but, unfortunately for Mr Rudd and Mr Swan, that is not going to happen, because it is our job to follow up inconvenient matters. That is what the parliament is here for. That is why we have Senate committees: to uncover the truth about government behaviour—maladministration and inappropriate behaviour.
It seems, however—I hate to say it—that Senator Hurley missed that particular civics lesson at school, judging by her disgraceful conduct in the Senate hearing last Friday. Efforts by opposition senators to uncover the truth about contact between Treasury officers and the offices of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were repeatedly derailed. Senator Cameron, who served as the Treasurer’s—
—Senator Fifield, I have just been reflecting on what you have said, and I think your comments about Senator Hurley should be withdrawn.
—I withdraw them, Mr Deputy President. On the subject of Senator Hurley, her colleague Senator Cameron served as the Treasurer’s mailman at the committee, delivering Treasury emails. After all, you have to find a job for Senator Cameron, and it is good that the government found one for him. Senator Cameron was also the chief interference runner, repeatedly interjecting as Senator Abetz was questioning witnesses.
—He scored some own goals.
—Indeed he did, Senator Parry. On other occasions Senator Hurley, in the chair, asserted that the Treasury officials had answered Senator Abetz’s questions before they had even been given an opportunity to respond. Senator Hurley also repeatedly asked witnesses if they would like to answer the questions. Mr Deputy President, you would know that it is not the role of a chair to determine which questions have to be answered, and it is certainly not the role of a chair to tell witnesses that answering a senator’s question is an optional exercise. That is a matter which I think needs to be looked at at another time, because the role of chairs in this parliament goes very much to the integrity and good functioning of this parliament.
Mr Deputy President, witnesses before a Senate committee are effectively under oath. They appear before the Senate to answer its questions and are expected to do so to the best of their ability. As I say, I do not think the unprecedented intervention by the chair helped uncover the truth at that committee. It is important, I think, that all senators take very seriously their responsibility to uncover the truth and ensure that Senate committees fulfil that task. It is clear that the government has a lot that it wishes to hide in relation to OzCar. They would not be engaged in the unprecedented smear campaign against the Leader of the Opposition through the media and the parliament if they were not worried—and, for that matter, also the smear campaign against Senator Abetz.
The publicly available evidence makes it clear that Mr Swan does have serious questions to answer. His suggestion that Mr Grant was the recipient of normal constituent services is laughable. Mr Grant was clearly the beneficiary of special treatment. No other car dealer received the care, attention and assistance as promptly or as comprehensively as Mr Grant did. Mr Swan needs to answer the charges against him. He needs to fully disclose any other matters which are relevant to this case, and I hope he does so for the proper functioning of this parliament—that is, that ministers are open, honest and transparent. That is all the opposition is seeking: answers to legitimate questions.
Just before I conclude, I cannot finish without responding to some of the comments and some of the contributions of Senator Brown earlier in this debate where he said that the coalition had vetoed a reference to the Privileges Committee. He said that the Senate, and the opposition, had effectively vetoed a reference to a court—viewing the Privileges Committee as a court of the parliament. I think the Senate took the right decision. The Senate did the right thing. The Privileges Committee has never been used for partisan political benefit and it is important that this chamber ensures that the Privileges Committee is never used for that sort of purpose. One of the great strengths of the parliament is the Privileges Committee. Its operation goes to the integrity of the parliament. A Privileges Committee operating correctly and appropriately is one of the safeguards ensuring that the parliament and senators are behaving appropriately. It is for that reason that I believe the Senate took the appropriate decision—took the decision that it did—that the Privileges Committee not be embroiled in what was clearly a very partisan and political reference to it. That is not the purpose of the Privileges Committee.
The Senate has made its decision. It is not a decision that Senator Brown likes. Senator Brown is something of a sore loser. He has lost a few things recently—I think there was a court matter and now he has lost a vote here on the floor of the chamber. I think Senator Brown was upset because the Senate had the temerity to defy ‘the will of Bob’. But the Senate has made its decision and it was the appropriate decision. Senator Brown also, I thought in a very cheap point-scoring exercise, criticised Senator Abetz for, in his words, ‘fleeing the chamber’. Senator Abetz did not flee the chamber; Senator Abetz was paired. Senator Abetz has stated to the chamber that he thought that, given the matter which the Senate was deliberating on related to him, the appropriate thing was not to be in the chamber. I think Senator Abetz was right to do that. I can imagine how, if Senator Abetz had stayed in the chamber and cast a vote on the matter, Senator Brown would be screaming and hollering how inappropriate it was that Senator Abetz was involved in the deliberations.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Fifield has reflected on comments that Senator Brown made in relation to Senator Abetz fleeing the chamber. My understanding is that Senator Brown then withdrew that and replaced those words with ‘leaving’.
 (Senator Trood)—I am not sure that is a point of order.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, it is about correcting what is on the record, and I would like Senator Fifield to take that on board.
—I invite Senator Fifield to address that matter if he chooses to do so.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I am not sure I have to correct anything here because those words were uttered in the chamber. I think it was a cheap and unnecessary point made by Senator Brown. Senator Abetz did the right thing. If he had stayed in this chamber and taken part in the deliberations on that matter then Senator Brown would have been screaming and hollering that it was inappropriate for him to be here. So I feel for Senator Abetz. He really cannot win when it comes to Senator Brown. Senator Abetz is a man of great integrity. He is a good and honest servant of the parliament. He has conducted himself appropriately at all times. I think the reflections that have been made on him in this place and outside are totally unwarranted. He has been fulfilling his duty as a senator—which is to seek the truth. It is not always comfortable and it is not always convenient, certainly not for those who are being questioned, and it is not always convenient for the person asking the questions. But he is fulfilling his obligations as a senator and as a shadow minister. With those remarks, I will conclude and commend the bill to the chamber.
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Macdonald, you are not on my speaking list. Do you wish to speak?",SENATE,<title>CAR DEALERSHIP FINANCING GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-06-25,"—No, I was not. But, yes, I do wish to speak. As a senator in this chamber I would like to exercise my right to speak on any bill.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is this appropriate? The normal courtesies of the chamber and the way in which we operate are that we are informed in advance as to who is going to speak on a bill. That has not happened in this case. Senator Macdonald, I would accept, has a right to speak on a bill, but the courtesy and the way the chamber operates in practice is that people are notified.
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Sherry, there is no point of order. As you point out, any senator has a right to speak when recognised by the chair. I am recognising Senator Macdonald.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was not listed to speak. I did not intend to, but I was swayed by the eloquence of the previous speaker, Senator Fifield, on this. I thought I should take just a couple of minutes of the Senate’s time to, first of all, support what Senator Fifield said about Senator Abetz. A more assiduous, honest and competent representative in this chamber you would not find. Everything Senator Fifield said about that I agree with. I also support what Senator Fifield said about the actual bill before us, the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009.
I just wanted to raise in relation to this bill a matter of particular interest to an area of Queensland where I spend some time, and that is up in the north and out in the west. I heard on Radio National this morning an interview between James Carleton and a person called Jane Colvin, who is from the Holden dealership in Longreach. I will read parts of the interview and will not say much more. I will then conclude my contribution on this bill. Ms Colvin was asked by the interviewer about what assistance the Holden dealership in Longreach got in relation to supporting finance. Jane Colvin said:
We rang our local federal member and he did email us back with the initial press release on 5 December. We then emailed him—I think it was on 7 December and again on the 15th—asking him what to do, how to go about chasing it up—
that is, getting some support for their floor plan. She went on:
We also had our local bank manager trying to chase it up—just how to go about getting the assistance that they were all talking about. And bear in mind that this whole thing is not about any of us getting money for free; it’s simply about the government guaranteeing funds so that the companies can lend it back to us. We’re not going to run off with the money. It’s not free money; it’s simply a guarantee of a loan. We never received anything back from the politicians after that, basically. We contacted others as well as our local member, but we really did not get any information.
James Carleton said some things and then he said:
You’re in the central west—that would be Flynn, a marginal Labor electorate in central western Queensland. I would have thought that your local MP would have been onto this very quickly indeed, given the state of his political contest in that electorate.
Ms Colvin answered:
Well, we basically thought so too. We did actually contact some of our senators and so forth … they did raise it with various people for us, but as far as getting any information—which probably needed to come from Chris Trevor’s office—it was just a blank.
Then there was another question and Jane Colvin finished by saying:
We actually are waiting to find out who is being supported by OzCar. This program—
that is, the Radio National program—
has actually given me more information than I have been able to achieve through my politicians and so forth. So, yes, we will be getting onto that.
Here is a motor dealership in Longreach, in central western Queensland, desperately trying to get information about this from the local Labor member, and they do not even get a return phone call. They tried a couple of times, emailed him, and they could not get any response. Compare that with John Grant Motors. Not only did John Grant get a call back from his local member, I assume, but he got a call from the Treasurer. The Treasurer of our nation actually sent emails to him, got the secretary of the Treasury to be involved and got people to talk to Ford Credit about this issue.
There seems to be one rule for people who happen to know the Prime Minister or the Treasurer and another rule for those motor dealers in Longreach in central western Queensland who are desperately trying to find out from their Labor member what this is all about and cannot even get a return phone call.
I thought I read somewhere that Mr Swan said that the guy in Mr Rudd’s electorate was just treated as any normal constituent would be. Well, if he was treated the same way as this dealer in Longreach was, he would not have got a phone call from anyone, he would not have been given any information and he certainly would not have had the highest officers of our land approaching Ford Credit about him. He would have been ignored, as were these dealers in Longreach in central western Queensland.
I think this highlights the issue Senator Fifield was talking about in just how this issue has been dealt with by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I do not want to take the time of the Senate any longer. I appreciate I have another 15 minutes, but I am conscious that there are other bills to deal with, so I will not address other issues which I think have been well covered by Senator Fifield. In that respect, I support his remarks.",SENATE,<title>CAR DEALERSHIP FINANCING GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-25,"—The Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009 is an important component of the government’s response to the fallout from the global financial crisis. The bill is essential to support the operations of the special purpose vehicle, the SPV, that has been established to facilitate liquidity for commercially viable car dealerships and it will in turn provide support for hundreds of small businesses and thousands upon thousands of jobs in this sector.
On 5 December last year, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced that the SPV would be established, with the support of Australia’s leading banks, to provide liquidity to car dealer financiers who have encountered financing difficulties as a result of the global financial crisis. The SPV, otherwise known as OzCar, was to provide critical wholesale floor plan financing to commercially viable car dealerships that were financed by GE Money Motor Solutions or GMAC, both of whom at that point had announced their intention to exit the Australian dealer floor plan financing market.
As flagged in December, the Treasurer announced on 13 May 2009 that the OzCar facility will provide for the rolling of Ford Credit into the facility in light of the serious funding pressures confronting Ford Credit. This will support the availability of critical wholesale floor plan finance to car dealerships, helping them to stay in business over the next 12 months.
The government has taken the action, and I might indicate that it is being supported by the Liberal-National Party, to ensure that commercially viable car dealerships will have continuing access to finance. In the absence of the finance, the car dealers may be forced to close. If the car dealers cannot obtain finance they may be forced to close. That would put at risk thousands of jobs in the Australian car industry. According to the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the MTAA, which is the representative organisation for car dealerships, there would be up to 75,000 jobs at risk. This government believes in being prepared. It believes in decisive action in the face of the global financial and economic crisis. It believes it is appropriate to be prepared for eventualities that may occur as a fallout from the world financial crisis. The government is simply not prepared to allow tens of thousands of jobs to be lost in the car dealership sector of the motor industry.
At this stage it would be useful to briefly describe how OzCar will actually operate and, subsequently, the importance of this appropriation bill that has been the subject of debate today. In order to provide liquidity to commercially viable car dealerships, the OzCar SPV will raise funds by selling securities to the four major banks: ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac. The SPV will finance eligible financiers who on-lend the funds for wholesale floor plan finance to car dealerships. Given the very difficult and tight global capital markets, the support of the four banks is essential to secure buyers of OzCar securities and hence facilitate liquidity.
Ozcar can raise funds only if it is able to sell securities. The government is supporting the OzCar SPV by putting in place a Commonwealth guarantee on various securities issued by the SPV. This guarantee is required because the participating banks have agreed to provide liquidity to the OzCar SPV only through the purchase of securities on the basis that non-AAA rated securities will be Commonwealth guaranteed. This legislation provides for an appropriation to support this guarantee. Whilst the government guarantee was executed on behalf of the Commonwealth on 23 December last year, an appropriation is required to provide comfort to the purchasers of OzCar securities that the Commonwealth will meet any payments required under the guarantee.
The SPV does not require any capital contribution by the Commonwealth and will not have a direct impact on the budget bottom line—other than in the very unlikely event that the guarantee is called upon. The SPV will be open for 12 months and there will be an orderly six-month wind-down after that. So there is a sunset provision. It is expected that, once OzCar facilities wind down, those dealers who relied on the SPV for financing would be able to secure alternative finance in improved global and domestic capital markets. This situation will need to be reviewed if there is no marked improvement or if the market further deteriorates.
The contributions from Liberal-National Party senators opposite covered a wide range of issues other than the actual guaranteed appropriation which we are dealing with, and I respect their right to range far and wide about a whole range of issues that they claim are relevant. I am not going to take the time of the Senate to respond, but I will make a couple of points about some of the claims that have been made by Liberal-National Party senators. With respect to the last contribution, from Senator Macdonald, Senator Macdonald rose to speak without observing the due courtesies of the chamber, which are to notify, on a list that is provided, that you intend to speak on a piece of legislation. He has breached the conventions and the courtesies that this chamber operates on. I make that observation.
But I think it is a little worse than that in terms of Senator Macdonald’s contribution, because we have had extensive discussion and debate on motions today and finally reached agreement on how the chamber would proceed in terms of the legislation before us. No less than the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, indicated that certain pieces of legislation would be dealt with, and there was a commitment to that. I respect Senator Minchin; I have always believed that he is someone who, when he gives his word, keeps it—on behalf of the opposition. And what do we have? We have Senator Macdonald getting up here to speak in contravention of the normal courtesies in the chamber—on top of Senator Minchin having given assurances that the legislation would be dealt with in a considered and orderly fashion. That is the way Senator Macdonald wants to behave; that is a reflection on him.
Senator Abetz made a wide-ranging contribution, and there are two particular sets of issues I want to go to. Senator Abetz’s basic argument on this appropriation bill—and firstly he was supporting it—was that this appropriation was necessary because ‘the world financial crisis has been exacerbated by various acts of economic stupidity and economically irresponsible decisions of this government’. I strongly refute that. I strongly reject that argument. It is amazing that there is almost no-one in Australia, or indeed the world, who believes that the issues that we are dealing with here—including this guarantee appropriation in the case of car dealer finance—has been brought on by the actions of this Labor government, other than some members of the Liberal-National Party opposition.
The fact that we are dealing with extraordinary pieces of legislation for extraordinary times is a consequence of the world financial crisis, which had its genesis in the United States. Unfortunately, that financial crisis led last year to the almost total seizing up—to use a car term, I suppose—or collapse of world financial markets. Confidence in banks was collapsing, particularly in Europe, the UK and the US, and interbank lending was grinding to a halt. In that context, a range of governments were placing guarantees on bank deposits, bank transactions and interbank lending, and the Rudd Labor government acted decisively to provide a guarantee. As I say, they are extraordinary circumstances.
—You should have put it on GMAC and GE Finance as well.
—The reason that we are considering this legislation is to provide a level of certainty in another form. If Senator Williams had cared to carry out even some modest examination of the guarantees put in place around the world—
—I spoke to you about it.
—The guarantees around the world have largely—if not exclusively—been confined to banks, credit unions and building societies. There is an extensive range of other types of financial instruments—property trusts, margin lending, superannuation funds or pension funds and, in this case, commercial financing arrangements for car dealers—and, overwhelmingly, they were not the subject of a guarantee in other countries.
I accept that Senator Fifield has a considerably greater understanding of current economic circumstances and a considerably greater degree of financial literacy than Senator Abetz. But for Senator Abetz to come in here and assert that we are dealing with these sorts of consequences of the world financial crisis because the Labor government has carried out ‘acts of economic stupidity’, ‘economically irresponsible decisions’ and has exacerbated this is just patent nonsense. I referred in question time today to the observations of the OECD and the IMF, leading world economic institutions, who have pointed out that the Australian economy is doing very well. In fact, it is the best-performing economy in the world compared to the 29 other countries in the OECD. Of comparable economies, the Australian economy is the only economy that is not in recession. And whatever people might think about the actions of this Labor government or the former Liberal government, I think the observations of the IMF and the OECD in terms of the government’s interventions—in supporting those interventions and drawing a reasonable conclusion that the Australian economy is stronger as a consequence—are correct. So the broad thesis and theme of the critique from Senator Abetz is just totally wrong.
I would just make a couple of points about Senator Abetz’s comments—which were, I think, partly in defence of himself and partly a continued and unjustified attack on the Treasurer. In terms of the Treasurer’s comments to parliament on the Hansard of 4 June—and all of the debate, questions et cetera that have been posed over the last week—the Treasurer has done nothing that contradicted what he said in parliament on 4 June and he stands by those statements. On 4 June the Treasurer, Mr Swan, said:
… there have been numerous representations made to members of parliament from car dealers right around the country—numerous representations which have been forwarded on to my office and in turn forwarded on to the responsible officials in the Treasury for consideration. There is nothing abnormal about that.
        …         …         …
It is the case that Mr Grant made representations to my office, and he was referred on to the SPV, just like everybody else. I have no idea what the outcome of that was.
And, of course, there were others who were referred on to the SPV and the staff in Treasury—it was not just Mr Grant. There were inquiries from Mrs Kay Hull, National Party member for Riverina; Mr Bruce Billson, Liberal Party member for Dunkley; Mr James Bidgood, Labor member for Dawson; Mr Bernie Ripoll, Labor member for Oxley; Mr Rowan Ramsey, Liberal member for Grey; the Hon. Sharman Stone, Liberal Party member for Murray; and obviously some other Liberal and National party members. The Treasurer has said:
… I have had no discussions with the Prime Minister about this matter whatsoever—none whatsoever.
        …         …         …
… in the case of the Prime Minister and me, there were none.
On the Hansard of 15 June, the Treasurer said:
Mr Grant would have received the same assistance as any other car dealer who was referred through that process received.
The second fact is that Mr Grant received no special benefit from OzCar and no outcome whatsoever from Ford Credit. Fact 3: there were steps taken to help other dealers, and that has been borne out in the course of investigations. The Treasurer did this because there were jobs at stake in the community, as I have outlined in this legislation, and because it was his view in his office that the Treasury should do whatever they could to help dealers who approached the Treasurer’s office. The Executive Director of the Motor Trades Association of Australia, Mr Michael Delaney, said:
The treatment that Mr Grant, a member of mine, got was no different from the treatment all of my other members got on my intervention on their behalf to Mr Grech. They were all treated in the same way, and for the same good reason: there was no other way to do these things. In fact I think Mr Grant has been treated less well because he went to the Treasurer.
Over the last week in the middle of a world financial and economic crisis, we have seen a Liberal opposition that could make only one firm decision in the Senate. The one firm decision they could make was to defer the emissions trading scheme. They decided to put it off because they are so divided. Other areas in which they have decided to make decisions where they are clearly divided are the migration regulations and the alcopops tax. We have heard a lot about smoke from Senator Abetz. Whatever the smoke, I suggest that the fire has well and truly burnt the case that the opposition were trying to advance against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, for the obvious reason they were relying on a fake email. I am sure a lot more will come out as a consequence of that.
This legislation is important. When I referred earlier to it being very unlikely the guarantee will be called upon and, hence, impact on the government’s bottom line, it is possible that the guarantee will be called upon but we think that is unlikely. Obviously, it is more likely that the special purpose vehicle will be called upon to provide financing in the case of car dealerships. This is an important part of the government’s response to the consequences of the global financial crisis. Any forced closure of otherwise viable car dealerships would have a direct and adverse impact on the Australian automotive industry, including component suppliers, at a time of significant economic challenges. This had potentially grave consequences for the Australian economy, hundreds of small businesses and thousands upon thousands of jobs. The passage of this bill is crucial to the successful operations of the OzCar SPV, and failure to pass this bill would risk the loss of thousands of Australian jobs in the automotive industry.
I am pleased to see the Liberal-National Party are supporting the legislation. They have spent the week scouring second-hand car yards. I suggest they refocus their attention on the issues of the day which will undoubtedly be issues for the next number of years: how to protect and cushion jobs in Australia in the face of this world economic and financial crisis. Nevertheless, I thank them for supporting this legislation. At least they have finally decided to do something positive in the face of this world financial and economic crisis.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CAR DEALERSHIP FINANCING GUARANTEE APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-06-25,"—I continue my speech from yesterday in the second reading debate on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. Retirees can subsequently lose their pension or receive a lesser pension. On this topic of the change in taper rates, I quote some figures from Dr Hickman from SA Superannuants.  These figures were brought to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill by the Australian Council of Public Sector Retiree Organisations. Dr Hickman’s figures show that after the change in the taper rate a pensioner would be $673 a year worse off after four years and that this would rise to a maximum of $3,854 after 10 years. This modelling was done by an economist from the Australian Council of Public Sector Retiree Organisations and it suggests that the guarantee given by the government that grandfathering will ensure that no pensioner will be worse off because of the change to the taper rate is not in fact true.
I would also like to bring to the Senate’s attention yet another example of the problems that develop when legislation is hastily inquired into and hastily looked into and the problems involved in what Ms Clare Martin referred to as ‘less equitable and more complex legislation’. The National Council on Intellectual Disability has today also published some work suggesting that people on disability support pensions will be worse off. The National Council on Intellectual Disability asks why people with disability in receipt of a disability report support pension who choose to work and earn income are treated differently from people in receipt of the age pension who choose to work and earn income. Yet again we have an example of multiple tiers developing. The NCID says:
There now exists a double comparative disadvantage. Young people in receipt of the Disability Support Pensioner do not have access to the Work Bonus and also do not have access to the Senior Australian Tax Offset.
They point out that the changes to the income test taper reduce the incentive to work, and this is a policy contrary to the government’s alleged interest in social inclusion and in reforms to employment services. They point out:
The base pension increase is quickly chewed up by the new taper for those who will enter the workforce as new workers.
The effective marginal tax rate … means that a worker only receives a net benefit of approximately 34 cents for every dollar earned.
We are talking here about people on disability support pensions. They go on to say that treating the contribution to work of young people with disabilities as less than that of aged workers sends a very strong message devaluing people with disabilities.
The NCID have used the average weekly wage of $345 because this is the average received by people with intellectual disabilities working in open employment who are assisted by Commonwealth services. Using that figure, they point out that a person with a disability in receipt of the pension earning $345 a week in comparison with an age pensioner earning the same is at a significant disadvantage at both levels. They earn $56.13 less in net income if they are currently working, using the current taper test, or nearly double that for new workers currently in receipt of the disability support pension. They are $83.73 a week worse off in net income.
The coalition have said that we will not oppose this legislation. However, we will be monitoring its working very closely. We have the government’s guarantee that no-one will be worse off because of the taper rate, that the grandfathering clause will work and will mean that people do not have money ripped out of their pensions when they most need it. But, given that age pensioners are nearly $4,000 a year worse off after 10 years, and given these figures that have been released today by the National Council on Intellectual Disability showing that workers can be $83 a week worse off if they are recipients of the disability support pension, the guarantee is not in any way, shape or form watertight. This is certainly something that I will be monitoring very closely. We in the coalition will ensure that the government keeps its promise.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PENSION REFORM AND OTHER 2009 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-25,"—The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 implements key elements of the government’s secure and sustainable pension reform package announced in the May budget. They are the most significant reforms in the 100-year history of Australia’s pension system, they are reforms that deliver a fair go for pensioners and they are reforms of which this government is very proud. I am pleased to be dealing with this legislation on behalf of the government.
The retirement income system in Australia is effectively composed of a government guaranteed defined benefit age pension and, on top of that, a range of superannuation, compulsory and voluntary. In the context of total retirement income for Australians, obviously superannuation is very important. However, the age pension has been long neglected because the reality is, particularly for those older Australians either in retirement or approaching retirement, the majority have very little superannuation or no superannuation, because they simply were not in the workforce for long enough or they retired before superannuation became compulsory—another major and important retirement income reform, initiated in 1987 by the former Hawke-Keating government.
The secure and sustainable pension reform package improves the adequacy of the pension system. It makes its operations simpler and more responsive to the needs of pensioners and secures its long-term sustainability. It prepares Australia to meet future challenges, including the ageing of the population. In addition to providing significant increases in payments, the reforms will make the pension system simpler and more flexible.
At the centre of these reforms is a much-needed increase in pension payments. From 20 September 2009 single pensioners will receive an increase of $32.49 per week, comprising a $30 per week increase in the maximum base pension rate and a $2.49 per week increase in the new and increased pension supplement. Let me repeat that: single pensioners will receive an increase of $32.49 per week. Pensioner couples will receive an increase of $10.14 per week combined, delivered through the new pension supplement. That is an increase of $10.14 per week for pensioner couples.
These are the most significant reforms in the 100-year history of Australia’s pension system. Australia’s 3.3 million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife and widow B pensioners, bereavement allowance recipients, special needs pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from these increases.
The single pension will increase as a proportion of the pension paid to couples combined from 60 per cent to 66.33 per cent. This ratio will also apply to the new pension supplement and the seniors supplement. The pension will continue to be benchmarked against wages using the so-called MTAWE, which was the last major reform of the pension base in Australia. I think it was 1983 when the Hawke Labor government introduced the automatic indexation of pensions to MTAWE. That was the last major reform, but this reform is the most significant in the 100 years since the age pension was introduced, in terms of the base rate of the age pension.
The pension will continue to be benchmarked to wages, and the benchmark for the single rate of pension will increase from 25 per cent to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, which is an increase of 10 per cent. Following these reforms, the new total weekly pension plus supplement will be an estimated $336.68 for singles and $507.50 for couples combined, which amounts to $17,507.36 a year for singles and $26,390 for couples combined. The actual figures to apply from 20 September will depend on indexation and on final inflation and wages parameters that are not yet available.
The range of supplementary payments and allowances currently paid to pensioners will be simplified and made more flexible through the introduction of a new pension supplement. The value of current allowances will be maintained and increased in the new pension supplement. The new seniors supplement will be introduced to benefit eligible self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth seniors health card. A new pensioner and beneficiary cost of living index will be introduced from 20 September 2009 to better reflect the costs that pensioners’ households face and will be used along with the consumer price index and the new wages benchmark to determine annual increases in the base pension.
Pension advance payments will be more flexible and we will bring greater consistency to the portability rules for overseas study among income support payment recipients. To better target the pension, the income test withdrawal rate will be increased from 40c to 50c for each dollar of private income over the free area. This is one of the tough decisions needed to make the pension system more sustainable and to target the biggest pension increases to those who need them most.
Transitional arrangements will be put in place to protect existing pensioners who would otherwise have faced a payment reduction because of these changes. The transitional rules will maintain existing payments in real terms and give an increase of $10.14 a week. Pensioners will be able to access the transitional rules for as long as necessary and will be moved to the new system once it delivers them a better outcome.
To help pensioners keep more of the money they earn, a new work bonus is being introduced as part of the new income test arrangements which will help pensioners maintain some part-time work while they receive a pension. This bill will close the Pension Bonus Scheme to new entrants following a recommendation of the Harmer review. I note that the shadow minister admitted in his remarks that the scheme, which was introduced by the former Liberal government, had not achieved what it was supposed to. Now is the time to close it and replace it with a more effective incentive.
Other minor amendments are made to the pension system, including exempting certain payments being made by the Western Australian government from the pension income test. The bill also contains measures that change indexation arrangements for family payments to make family assistance more sustainable. This brings indexation arrangements for family tax benefit part A minimum rates for children under 16 into line with other indexation across the family tax benefit system.
This bill takes the tough decision to raise the pension age. The age pension was first paid in 1909, and next month marks the centenary of—
—What happened to this urgency you were talking about?
—Sorry?
—You were talking about getting these bills through this afternoon.
—I think I actually have a duty and an obligation here, because decisions are sometimes made in court based on second reading speeches—
—This isn’t your second reading speech.
—and responses to proposed committee amendments. At least I am on the speakers list! Since the first pension was paid in 1909, the pension age for men has been set at 65. The pension age for women is currently increasing—another tough decision taken by a former Labor government—and will reach 65 in 2013. As part of these reforms and to improve the long-term sustainability of the pension system, the qualifying age for age pension will increase for both men and women from 65 to 67 years.

Senator Williams interjecting—

—Have you got something to say as well?
—We’ve heard all this before.
—I am anxious to conclude. The increase in the qualifying age for age pension will begin to be phased in from 1 July 2017 and will be fully implemented on 1 July 2023. Phasing in the change over this period will allow affected individuals time to plan for their retirement. The change to the age pension age will allow the government to respond to the long-term cost of our demographic changes.
This Labor government is serious about addressing these demographic changes. We are determined to make our pension system both adequate and sustainable over the long term. That is why we had the pension review that was initiated in May last year, receiving almost 2,000 written submissions. The review was supported by a reference group made up of a range of experts and industry organisations. The reference group canvassed all the issues surrounding pension reform.
The need for action has been reinforced by a recently released report by the OECD, Pensions at a glance, which shows that the poverty rate for older Australians is double the OECD average. The report’s analysis is based on pension figures from 2006, during the time of the previous government. Australia has the fourth highest poverty rate for people aged over 65 in the OECD. Only Ireland, Korea and Mexico have higher rates of old age poverty. Along with Ireland and Switzerland, Australia’s old age poverty rates are double those of the rest of the population, and poverty rates for singles are worse than for couples. The reforms to the pension system contained in this bill will improve its adequacy, make the system simpler and more responsive to pensioners’ needs and secure the sustainability of the pension system as the Australian population ages.
These reforms to Australia’s pension system are essential and they are overdue. In the early months of this Rudd Labor government, we heard extensively from the former Liberal-National government and, indeed, from the crossbenchers, about the need to increase the base pension. I accepted the argument being put by the crossbenchers—the Greens and Family First and Senator Xenophon. They had raised that issue consistently over a long period of time. But, upon moving into opposition, the Liberal-National coalition finally decided it was time to increase the age pension after they had done nothing about it for almost 12 years.
Then we have the rank hypocrisy from the opposition, who attack the government on debt—given the outcome of the global financial economic crisis—and who demand an increase in the age pension, having done nothing about it for 12 years. The cost over the forward estimates I think is between $11 billion and $12 billion approximately. But, of course, they did not indicate anywhere savings could be made, either direct monetary savings or savings via the recognition of the demographic changes and the age at which the age pension should be accessed. It is sheer hypocrisy from the Liberal-National coalition: do nothing for almost 12 years, go into opposition and demand an increase in the age pension—having done nothing about it for 12 years—without even bothering to indicate how it would be paid for. It is absolute hypocrisy from those opposite.
We are, indeed, very proud of these changes. The increase in the age pension in this country is long, long overdue. The changes will improve long-term security and certainty and ensure that over time the pension system is both adequate and sustainable. The reforms included tackle the reality of the ageing population and the challenge this represents.
I know concern has been expressed about the increase in the pension age. The longer you leave reforms in this area, the more difficult reform will become.
—2017!
—Yes, 2017. I notice that Liberal shadow minister Abbott was critical of us for not phasing in the pension access age of 67 faster than we had otherwise indicated. I think you have to be just a bit careful about phasing in increases to the pension access age. People have got to have some reasonable notice. I think Mr Abbott, the Liberal shadow minister, is being a bit harsh about criticising the Labor government for not doing it fast enough, particularly as the former government had done nothing in 12 years anyway.
I do not often use my family in these circumstances—
—Usually not a good idea, ever.
—Senator Macdonald! I want to quote you the demographics. My daughter, Mia, is nine years old. She was born in the year 2000. You hate to talk about your family in the context of people who work in retirement incomes, but I talked to an actuary about life expectancy. He said, ‘Well, if your daughter lives to five’, which fortunately she has, ‘her average life expectancy will be 93.’ So my daughter, having been born in the year 2000, on average will now live to the year 2093. And the odds are she will probably live to see the year 2101. It is simply unsustainable, sadly and unfortunately, for my daughter not to work either in retirement or in education for 45 years of her 100-year life, if she lives 100 years. It is simply not sustainable for any society to have individuals either studying up to, say, their early twenties and then going into retirement at the age of 65. It is simply not possible to have individuals not participating in society in some form of economic involvement.
The longer you leave these reforms, the worse it gets. Frankly, some of the European countries have got themselves into a mess. Some have tackled the issue of the pension access age; some have not. But if you look at the long-term debt projections—and I will give some credit to the Liberal-National coalition, because they, like us, are supporting this legislation and they, like us, have at a range of times closed the unsustainable defined benefit funds that exist in this country.
—You have filibustered for 15 minutes now, Nick.
—These are all important issues, Senator Macdonald, and this is a very substantial—
—They are all in the second reading speech.
—No, they are not. The comments I have made in the last seven minutes are not in the second reading speech, Senator Macdonald.

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—Again, you are wrong, Senator Macdonald, and because you do not listen and you interject and speak when you are not on the speaker’s list you just fail to listen and understand.
This is a very, very important issue. I do not think reforms of this magnitude should go unremarked on by the government in closing the debate. The reforms deliver a fair go for Australia’s pensioners and I commend the bill to the Senate. I thank all those senators who have contributed, and I thank the Liberal-National coalition for supporting the package and the bill.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Siewert’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PENSION REFORM AND OTHER 2009 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-06-25,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing the appropriation bills notwithstanding that they relate to what is perhaps the worst budget that we have seen in the last couple of decades.
I ask that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, might be able to indicate to me if my understanding is wrong. I speak on the understanding that at six o’clock we will break to deal with other matters of the Senate and then return to finish the speakers list on the appropriation bills. I just need some actual confirmation because the length of my contribution will depend on it. Whilst perhaps you are considering that, I note that Senator Sherry took 20 minutes on the second reading summing-up of the previous bill, which mainly consisted of a rehash of the printed second reading speech. So it is quite clear that the government has been filibustering to prevent proper discussion on the appropriations and it has left us with 10 minutes to discuss the complete appropriation bills. I know there are probably a dozen coalition members who would like to say something on the bills. I have more than 20 minutes to speak on it, but if we are to finish at six I will curtail my contribution so that hopefully my colleagues can have a couple of minutes.
 (Senator Hutchins)—I am considering your request at the moment, Senator. Please continue until I can make a statement.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have looked at the speakers list and I have noticed Senator Brown is on it. I have got no idea how long Senator Brown will want to speak, but if we have to finish by six—
—As I understand it, at six o’clock we will go to the consideration of government documents unless leave is granted to do otherwise.
—This is an appalling way to run the chamber and it is typical of the way the Labor Party run the government. They have simply got no idea. They could not run a marbles match. Just have a look at the state of the economy. You will remember at the budget 12 months ago the euphoria that was around. The budget came in at a $22 billion surplus. I might say it was a surplus left to the current government by Peter Costello. The books were handed over with $20 billion surplus. Here we are 12 short months later and we are now debating a budget with a deficit of some $58 billion. How could anyone, even anyone as incompetent as the Labor Party, turn that around in 12 short months? We are now facing a deficit of over $300 billion that will have to be paid off by our children and our grandchildren in the years ahead.
While Senator Sherry filibustered on that previous bill so that we would not get adequate speaking time, there was a group of children up in the gallery. I was hoping that we could get onto this bill so that they could listen to the debate about it, because those young children, who I would guess were between the ages of eight and 14, will be the ones who will have to pay for the profligacy of the Labor Party in this year’s budget.
This is not new to us. Look at the states. Every state managed by a Labor government has racked up debts to an incredible degree. My own state of Queensland has a debt approaching the $96 billion which the last federal Labor government had. That is incredible. How could a state government, my state government, the state government of Queensland, which has been the resource state and which has been recognised for 40 years as the best run, most financially responsible state, have a deficit of almost $90 billion? The answer is pretty simple: it has had a Labor government for 10 years or so. That is all you need to say.
I was in this chamber during the term of the last Labor government—the Hawke-Keating government. That government, in its last term of office, racked up a secret deficit —they did not tell anyone about it—in one year of some $10 billion. That was unheard of in those days. We came to government, opened up the books and found that the Australian public had been lied to by the last Labor government on the state of the books. We found a $10 billion deficit for that year. Then we added up all of the deficits that had been run up by the Labor Party and found that they totalled some $96 billion. That is what Labor governments do. That is what they did federally. It took us seven, eight or nine tough years to pay off the Labor Party’s $96 billion debt. That debt happened during the term of the last Labor government.
We left the incoming Labor government with a surplus of $22 billion. Thanks to Peter Costello, there was $22 billion in credit put away in different funds. But 12 months later we are now debating on these appropriation bills a deficit of almost $60 billion. How could anyone possibly do that? I know they talk about the global financial crisis, but it has been exacerbated by the inexperience and incompetence of Mr Rudd and Mr Swan in dealing with our economy. What concerns me and, I think, an increasing number of Australians is the understanding that someone has to pay off the debts that have been racked up by Kevin Rudd. Someone has to deal with Mr Rudd’s debts—and it will be the children of the future.
There are many issues that we could raise about the budget. Since the Labor government have come in, they have spent something like $225 million a day. Money just goes through their hands like sand through the hourglass. It is always so easy to spend someone else’s money. It is much more difficult when you have to pay for it yourself.
I am concerned about the impact of the Labor Party’s mismanagement in this budget on rural and regional Australia, particularly Northern Australia, which I represent in a portfolio way. I want to just for a couple of minutes deal with the people who predominantly live in Northern Australia, and that is our Indigenous citizens, the original citizens of Australia. I want to point out how the Labor Party in concert with the Greens has taken Indigenous welfare back about 100 years. I want to quote some material from various sources that have indicated how Indigenous people understand that the Labor Party is paternalistic, does not want them to make their own decisions and wants to keep them on the welfare drip, and that, in doing that, they are being supported by the Greens for political purposes.
You only have to look at the furore over the Labor Party’s plan to create a World Heritage area on Cape York Peninsula and to declare wild rivers. Indigenous leader after Indigenous leader has pointed out that by doing that you are condemning Indigenous people to a welfare existence. Indigenous people quite rightly say that these so-called environmental initiatives are only being undertaken to get Greens preferences in the leafy suburbs of Brisbane—the same sort of preference deals that the Greens did with the Labor Party in supporting Labor candidates who were pledged to construct the Traveston Crossing Dam. I will quote Mr Noel Pearson. He said:
All of that (economic growth) is precluded because the premier has made sleazy political deals in the course of the recent political campaign …
It’s an absolute kick in the guts to us.
He went on to say that it was all because the Labor Party needed preferences from the Greens to retain office. Of course, the Greens who go along and pretend that they are interested in Indigenous matters simply continue to support Labor governments, particularly the one in Queensland, who seem determined to condemn Indigenous people to welfare.
—You’re obsessed!
—I beg your pardon? I am upset. I am very upset for the Indigenous people. I want to quote—and I am not going to have much time to do this, but perhaps when we resume I will take no more than five minutes to complete it—from a very interesting inquiry the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts conducted into forestry and mining on the Tiwi Islands. It was initiated, as I understand it, by the Greens and by Senator Crossin and it was to investigate certain, perhaps, malpractices.
 (Senator Trood)—Order! Senator Macdonald, it is six o’clock and the Senate is due to go to consideration of government documents. Is leave granted for consideration of these bills to continue until concluded?
Leave granted.
—I will curtail my remarks because I know others do want to speak. This inquiry into the Tiwi Land Council was set up because it was thought that because there was a forestry operation on the island there had been malpractices and worse. The committee went up there and I am delighted that I introduced myself into the committee. I quote from the Hansard Mr Ullungura, an Indigenous elder, who gave evidence. He said:
… the frustration they—
Indigenous people—
feel about always having to fight to use a very small area, less than five per cent, of their land for economic development—in this case, it is forestry. The potential for jobs is enormous. A harvest is going to happen; someone is going to have to harvest this stuff when it is ready. I know there has been talk about art and tourism and stuff, but you are never going to employ potentially hundreds of people directly, or there is the forestry camp that you guys were at today. People have to be fed and watered, there is a hospitality industry there and the roads have to be done. There is a lot of short-term stuff, when they do the harvest and get rid of the chipping, but then they have to replant it. The potential for employment is huge.
He went on to say:
If it was not for forestry, we would not be sitting here now, we would be sitting out in the long grass. It is not the $10 million or $15 million that the federal government put in, but the initial stages of the feasibility study and all of that was all paid through forestry. Education was recognised on the islands and especially at Wurrimiyanga, this mob’s country, as just a disaster, an absolute basket case. I am a teacher by trade, part of the system that was teaching at Nguiu, and we have been pumping out illiterate kids, 90 per cent plus—literally, kids who cannot spell ‘cat’—for 20 years.
These guys are trying to build a future with five per cent of their land. They recognise, as well as anyone, that they want to look after their endangered species, but there is 95 per cent of the land that is free for the dunnarts to go roaming and all that sort of stuff. These guys have been saying for years that the answer to solving Indigenous disadvantage is jobs, jobs, jobs. You get self-esteem; you get money; you get a fridge full of food to feed your kids. To go out bush, to go hunting—that is all good; you leave it all alone. But you need jobs to be able to buy your car to be able to get out bush to go to your country.
I recommend to colleagues that they read the full transcript of that and of how these Indigenous people want to do things. They want to get real jobs. They are doing it on the Tiwi Islands. But that seemed to find disfavour.
—There are nine.
—Sorry?
—There are nine jobs.
—Senator, I am quoting the Indigenous elders. As always, you in the Greens would know better than the Indigenous elders. With respect, I say to you that this is what is so wrong with Indigenous policy in Australia. People like the Greens and people like the Labor Party know more about what Indigenous people want. This lot of Indigenous people built this magnificent school and they were, by implication, criticised by a senator not from the coalition parties for building it in a certain place. They were actually questioned on why they were building it there. What the committee were told by the elders was that they wanted to get it away from the influence of drugs, alcohol and welfare dependency that the government policy had created. I could go on for hours with this but I know my colleagues want to speak. Suffice it to say that the coalition will be supporting the appropriation bills.",SENATE,"<title>

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-25,"—The Australian Greens support this legislation. One matter I draw the Senate’s attention to is the second reading amendment that I have circulated. It is about the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report on additional estimates 2008-09 that the government respond as a matter of priority to reports of the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee on the ordinary annual services of government. The amendment calls upon the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to respond immediately to the longstanding correspondence of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee on the matter. I wish to amend my amendment by replacing the word ‘immediately’ with the words ‘by 12 August’. In respect of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-10, I move the motion as amended:
At the end of the motion, add:
, and the Senate
again endorses recommendation 1 of the Finance and Public Administration Committee in its report on the additional estimates 2008-09, that the government respond to the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing reports on the ordinary annual services of the government as a matter of priority and
calls upon the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to respond by 12 August to the longstanding correspondence of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing on the matter.
I refer members to my speech on 12 March in this place on the same matter. It is a hugely important issue. This move is to prevent the drift we have seen with recent governments to include in the appropriation bills enormous spending matters that should not be there, therefore taking away the ability of parliament to debate them. For example, the multimillion dollar bill for tsunami assistance to Indonesia was put into appropriations and therefore was taken out of range of debate. The Northern Territory emergency response package of bills was put into appropriations, whereas it should have been separate legislation and brought before the parliament and accounted for in the usual way.
The tendency for this has been increasing since there was a compact in 1965 to not allow that procedure, but the 1965 compact did not really list clearly enough what governments ought not to be able to put into appropriations legislation. My amendment in March had the support of the opposition, and I hope that this amendment—which now gives the Minister for Finance and Deregulation a specific date, 12 August, to respond to the Senate on the correspondence from the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing—gets support.
While I am on my feet, I note that earlier today I sought advice from the President on the matter of Senator Abetz’s pairing in the vote on the No. 1 matter on the Notice Paper, a motion by Senator Ludwig on matters being referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges. Senator Abetz himself, in his submission to the chamber before question time, said:
Given that the motion related to me personally, I thought that I should not be casting a vote …
However, the question I asked of the President was whether, in getting paired, Senator Abetz was in fact casting a vote. If that was the case, I submit to the Senate that the intention of the Senate was not properly reflected in the outcome and that there would have been a reference to the privileges committee had Senator Abetz absented himself from that vote. He, in his own words, said he should not be casting a vote. This is an important matter. I hope, and I have asked of the President, that there will be a ruling on it before we rise this evening so that, if the President makes the ruling that Senator Abetz did cast a vote, there will be the opportunity to correct this morning’s vote wherein the Senate—that is, the coalition and Senator Fielding—blocked the reference to the committee.",SENATE,"<title>

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2009-06-25,"—I recognise the lateness of the hour today and that there is still other business for the Senate to conduct, so I will attempt to keep my remarks as brief as possible—I hope that my comments on brevity are not similar to those of colleagues who have gone before me! Nonetheless, it is a pleasure to speak on the appropriations bills, but it is a great disappointment to speak at such a late hour on the very last day of these sittings. The appropriations bills are important bills for this parliament to consider appropriately, thoroughly and diligently. They are the one opportunity, in particular, for this chamber to have a relatively free-ranging debate on the budget that has been just been handed down by this government. Regrettably, because of the mismanagement of this chamber by the government, we will in fact see barely any debate at all occur on these appropriations bills and the budget that the government has handed down. That is a grave disappointment to me. It should be a grave disappointment to all senators and, particularly, to the Australian public that this opportunity has been missed. It has been missed because, of course, rather than dealing with the 2009-10 budget in a timely manner, the government had to spend most of the week trying to talk about a program that they are seeking to introduce sometime in 2012. They did that rather than getting on with the business in an orderly manner and dealing with the priorities, the top priority being this budget—this budget debacle, of course—that they have handed down.
The opposition are, of course, supporting these bills, because we recognise the importance of them passing in a timely manner. That is why they will go through tonight despite the fact that we will not have the type of debate on the budget that the parliament and the Australian public deserve. However, I do have a number of concerns. As the youngest member of this chamber aside from Senator Hanson-Young, I have some concerns in particular about the fact that, whilst this budget whacks many Australians left, right and centre, it whacks younger people in particular. It whacks them in a number of ways.
—Mmm.
—Senator Mason is nodding. He, of course, is well aware of the hit in direct ways, such as the changes to the youth allowance and the devastating impact that will have on rural and regional Australians and younger people in those areas who seek to go and study further in higher education pursuits, and the disadvantage they will have in attempting to do so. In many ways, of course, it whacks future students, because it is claimed now that the education revolution we are having is in fact a ‘bricks and mortar’ revolution. So, rather than the government delivering on its promises of an education revolution—which would be a revolution in teacher standards, curriculum and class sizes and would be a revolution that delivered real teaching outcomes—we instead have a wasteful ‘bricks and mortar’ revolution occurring forcefully at every school around the country, building buildings that some of them do not necessarily want; they would rather have something else instead. But, no, they are being told, in the Stalinist sort of approach of the government, ‘This is what you will have.’
It hits younger Australians in the healthcare sector. Yes, there will be some short-term effects from the government’s decision to slash private health insurance and private health insurance rebates, but it will be younger Australians who feel it in the longer term as well, because what we will see from the escalating prices of private health insurance, which will increase over time, will be the steady decline of membership of private health insurance, and from that we will see a rapid escalation of prices. So younger Australians, because of those higher prices, will put off membership of private health cover when they do need it, when they start a family. When they do need it, later in life, they will find it is all too expensive and out of reach by then.
Of course, this stands as one of the great broken promises of the government from this budget. It was Ms Roxon, now the Minister for Health and Ageing and then the shadow minister, who made it crystal clear in a press release on 26 September 2007:
… Federal Labor has made it crystal clear—
they were her words—
that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates …
All of the existing private health insurance rebates! Guess what? She went on to say:
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.
This is absolutely untrue.
I am sorry, but our scare campaign on Labor planning to take away private health insurance rebates was not absolutely untrue. In fact, it was absolutely true. Like with so many broken promises from the government, what the Liberal Party said before the last election about what Labor would do turned out to be true. Reminiscent of Peter Garrett’s famous words, ‘Once we get in we’ll just change it all,’ what they said at the election just did not matter.
On general aged-care, superannuation, retirement and standard-of-living issues, again we see many people hit and dudded in this budget, but it is younger Australians in particular who will pay the price. In the debate on the previous bill considered by this place we considered the raising of the pension age and the impact that would have. There are some merits to the argument for doing so in terms of dealing with intergenerational shift in Australia. I accept that there are some good arguments as to why we should look at the types of reforms to the age pension age that have been implemented. That is why the opposition was supportive of that legislation.
However, good points were made by Senator Xenophon and other speakers that the national discussion about the need for the increase to the age pension age was not had. There was nothing at all. The government did not go to the last election suggesting there might need to be a change to the age pension age. They did not in their first budget last year suggest there might need to be a change to the age pension age or to the tapering rates which they have changed, which will have a particularly negative impact on part-pensioners. Nope, they did not do any of those sorts of things. They simply introduced it, snuck it into this year’s budget, hoped that nobody would notice and managed to get it through, without the public debate and discussion that these matters deserve.
You would think that, as a government, if you were going to make the age pension a little less accessible for future generations, maybe you would encourage superannuation more and maybe you would make super easier so that fewer people were reliant on the age pension in future. But, oh, no, not this government—it went and decided that it would change the superannuation taxes along the way. In this year’s budget the government reduced the incentives and made it harder for people to put money into superannuation. Guess what? That is another broken promise of the government.
Back on 12 November 2007, very close to the election date, the Prime Minister said, ‘There will be no change to the superannuation laws one jot, one tittle.’ I think you can safely say the changes that have been made represent at least one jot, at least one tittle, by this government, whatever a ‘tittle’ may be. I am sure a tittle is represented quite well in the government’s approach to things. If you took the Prime Minister at his word at the time and then looked at what the government has done in its budget this time around, you would be quite tempted to say, ‘Fair shake of the sauce bottle, mate.’ Surely Mr Rudd should have been taken at his word when he said there would be no change to the superannuation laws, not ‘one jot, one tittle’. But, no, future Australians will find the age pension less accessible, and superannuation will be an equally harder road for them.
The government decided that they would go on the attack over these matters today. In question time today the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, stood up in the other chamber and quoted from my recent budget newsletter that went out to thousands of households across the western suburbs of Adelaide. She decided to attack me for saying:
… the Labor Government has once again shown its mean and tricky colours by raising the retirement age …
I stand wholeheartedly by that comment in the newsletter. Whatever Ms Macklin might wish to say in the House of Representatives about the fact that the opposition allowed the legislation to go through today on the age pension rise, it makes no difference to the fact that the government’s approach on this matter was mean and tricky. It was mean and tricky because there was no consultation, discussion or dialogue. Future generations of Australians, with absolutely no input into this decision and no opportunity to comment, will find themselves paying the price for it.
There are many other ways in which this government and this budget let down Australians of all ages and, especially, future generations of Australians. The most important area, which I will finish on, relates to Labor’s debt. Future generations of Australian taxpayers will have to pay this debt off. Dollar by dollar they will have to pay it off. First of all they will suffer just by having to service the debt. Future taxpayers, although it starts with today’s taxpayers, will fork out billions of dollars each year in their taxes just to service Labor’s current debt. Those billions of dollars will mean less money for health care, schools, the environment and water, which is another area tragically overlooked in this budget. There will be less money in each and every budget of Australian governments of the future thanks to the profligate spending of the Rudd government in this budget.
We have seen the charade of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer when asked about those debt levels—ducking, dodging, weaving and doing the best they possibly can to avoid admitting what those debt levels may be. The budget papers make it clear that we are headed towards a $188 billion debt over the forward estimates. After much ducking, dodging and weaving the Prime Minister invented the term ‘peak debt’, which is allegedly $315 billion. That figure assumes the government lives up to its promise of having only a two per cent growth rate in spending, but after just 18 months of this government we know that that is an impossible promise for it to keep. The idea that peak debt will be $315 billion while this Prime Minister, Treasurer and government remain in charge of the Treasury coffers is just laughable, and future generations will pay for it.
This is a tragic budget for Australia. It undoes so much of the good work that had been done over the previous decade. It leaves a legacy for future generations that they will have to pay for. That is a sad day for Australia; it is unfortunate that the government has dug this hole and I regret deeply that younger Australians in particular will be paying the price for it for years and decades to come.",SENATE,"<title>

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-06-25,"—I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and related bills and, like my colleagues before me, indicate that I will not be opposing them. I will keep my remarks brief due to the government’s complete mismanagement of the program, and I remind them that there is no more basic function of this parliament than dealing with appropriations bills. Any attempt to prevent debate on them is completely misdirected, given their importance.
This budget represents nothing less than a massive betrayal of Australians today, Australians in past years and Australians in the future, because for so many years this country worked so very hard to ensure that there was a government free of debt, that we had the money to invest to care for our older people and to invest in schools and hospitals. This government have betrayed all that hard work and actually taken money out of the pockets of future Australians, with absolutely unimaginable levels of debt—$220 billion of deficits over four years and $315 billion of peak debt, in the terms that my colleague, Senator Birmingham, outlined. And they have done all this by using excuses—it is a global financial crisis and it is not their fault. When they put up their charts about other governments their defence is, effectively, other profligate governments in the OECD are worse, and they did it first. That is not the way to manage an economy, nor the government’s finances.
They talk about infrastructure; borrowing for pink batts is not infrastructure. What does it say, when you take money from kids tomorrow—when they will be working and paying higher taxes—and when you take money from people who are going to need aged care and health care in future years, to put pink batts in people’s homes? There is also the fact that you are saying to everyone out there: ‘Don’t go to the trouble of actually investing in your own pink batts. The government will take care of it for you.’
This budget is based on a flawed approach. There is no evidence and no consensus that this Keynesian pump priming, throwing out $900 rebates to people, actually works. There is no consensus on that whatsoever. It has not worked in western Europe—particularly in the UK—and there is no evidence it is working in the United States. This is not 1932, where for the first time we are reading Keynes’ General Theory. The world has moved on. But this misjudgment on the government’s part does have a real price, and that is debt.
The government does not understand the critical importance to Australia of a solid government financial position. We are a capital-importing country; we have been since the day that Australia was formed. We have been importing capital for over 100 years. For that reason a sound financial position for the Commonwealth is critical. It makes it easier to import capital, it makes it easier for people to buy their own homes and it makes it easier for businesses to invest and provide jobs, opportunities and economic growth. That is the core misjudgment of this government. I recall the 1980s, where one of the key driving forces for consolidation of government finances, at least until Paul Keating became Prime Minister, was the argument, with the support of the opposition, that it was important that the government stop accruing debt. Because when the government goes and borrows money to the extent it was in the 1980s—let alone the unimaginable amounts it is today—it does crowd out private sector investment. And it does actually have an impact for a capital importer and capital-importing country like Australia. The government has completely misjudged the role of its own budget in this, which is not to pump prime the economy but to ensure that others can borrow for productive investment that will do more for future years than pink batts.
There is another thing driving this budget and some of its aspects. I do not like to say it, but proposals like Ruddbank and OzCar provide opportunities for patronage. Opportunities for patronage tend to tempt governments; we have seen some of that over the last fortnight. But there should not be such opportunities for patronage and discretion, because the government’s role is to provide a sound regulatory basis—which the past government did for our financial system and which has stood it in such good stead over the last two years—and allow people to go on about their own business. For decades this country did do what the Prime Minister has said he wants to do again, and have government at the centre of the economy. For decades we did that and by the 1960s and seventies, starting with people like the then member for Wakefield, we realised that was holding Australia back. Over the last 20 years we have gone through a transformation, and the idea that we can wind the clock back, have the government at the centre of the economy and have the government making decisions to insulate people’s houses and to build second halls in schools is ridiculous. Driving that is the opportunity for patronage, which drives the Labor Party, and always has.
When the government borrow to this extent it is going to force up interest rates. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but a couple of billion dollars a week is going to be sucked out of financial markets over the next four years as this government run up unimaginable levels of debt. They based the servicing of this debt and the claimed repayment of it—which I do not think anyone believes—on some outrageously optimistic growth assumptions: 4½ per cent! We have not achieved year-on-year 4½ per cent growth in my lifetime. And I would like to point out to the government that in November 2007, when the Reserve Bank increased interest rates, growth was at 4.1 per cent and they were the ones screaming about capacity constraints.
Over the last few weeks we have heard the Treasurer and we have heard the Prime Minister say, ‘Oh, well, with a downturn, there is unused capacity in the economy. It can be used to provide a higher level of growth coming out.’ Firstly, how long does that last? And, secondly, it displays a basic misunderstanding of where the Australian economy is today because, three weeks after they were speaking about unused capacity, they were talking about how well the economy was going and claiming that they have avoided a recession over the last two quarters. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, ‘There is all this unused capacity in the economy, like there was in the last recession we had to have’—coincidentally, of course, under a Labor government. You cannot say there is all this unused capacity which is going to provide the basis for this 4½ per cent growth out in the future and at the same time run around saying that the economy is in great shape. One or the other is true, because what this budget will do and what those growth assumptions will do is either not be achieved or lead to massive inflation.
What does inflation do? It destroys jobs growth. It destroys investment certainty. Most importantly, it penalises those who have saved. There is no greater way to transfer wealth from the thrifty to those who have debt than to have inflation. That is what happened in the 1970s. Just like this government does not care for those who are investing in their own health care and want nothing more than to be left alone to look after themselves while contributing to a decent society through legitimate levels of taxation, it does not understand it has put in place a budget that will potentially lead to a decade like the 1970s. It is not just in Australia that this is being spoken about; it is all around the world. Governments are borrowing unprecedented amounts, and money is being printed in places we would never have thought would need to do so. This government says, ‘We have a global financial crisis caused by too much debt,’ and its response has been to go on the greatest borrowing binge imaginable. It talks about opposition scare campaigns. We would not have conceived of these numbers in 2007. It is unimaginable that a government would borrow this much.
On top of this, despite the government saying we are going to have incredible growth coming out of this downturn, this recession, whatever it turns out to be, it has put in place an industrial relations agenda that it has admitted, and experts have outlined, will put up the price of labour. The only spare capacity in this economy at the moment, sadly, is actually in the labour force. Under this Labor Party, we are seeing increased unemployment—again, something that was not on the cards two years ago. What is its response? Its response is to make employing people more expensive. Add to that huge borrowing binges, cash being thrown around, questions over the tender process and the value for money of the various projects being built—which was pointed out by my colleague Senator Mason this week—and the price of labour being forced up, and, yet, all of a sudden, the government says we are going to get 4½ per cent growth going forward. It is inconsistent. It is incoherent. It will cost Australia in the long run.
Finally, this is all being done at precisely the wrong time. In future years, we know we will have an ageing population. We want to provide decent care for our ageing and senior Australians. We want to provide them with the health care and the facilities which they have earnt as long-term contributors to our society. We want to ensure that they have pensions that the government of the day can fund. What have this government done? Just as we are going into this phase where the workforce is shrinking and the number of senior Australians who will call on future budgets is increasing, the government have racked up this enormous, unimaginable level of debt. This was the time to save. This was the time to put money in the bank, just like the previous government did, so that the taxation burden on a shrinking workforce was not higher. We know that higher levels of taxation decrease incentives to work and decrease productivity, and they lower economic growth. With increasing numbers of senior Australians, we should be investing to provide them with the best possible services and care that we can afford.
The government promised surplus budgets. However, there is one promise that has not yet been broken and I would like to flag this to the Senate this evening. It promised it would not raid the Future Fund. I am not holding my breath on that one. I will not be surprised to see within two or three years the Future Fund buying Commonwealth bonds or something similar. The Future Fund will be raided. This government cannot be trusted with the nation’s finances. It has taken away the income of future Australians and it has ensured higher taxes in the future. It has destroyed a decade of work that saw Australia in a position that was the envy of the world. Now we are just one of the rest—racking up government debt and taking money out of our children’s pockets.",SENATE,"<title>

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I am pleased to bring the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills to a close. Senator Ryan is certainly trying to crank up a scare campaign. The government is working to support the economy through the global recession. The government’s fiscal stimulus program started with supporting household consumption and then moved to small-scale investments that could be implemented within a relatively short time frame. This budget marks the start of the next phase of moving to larger and longer term nation-building infrastructure projects. The budget contains a significant infrastructure package: $22 billion over six years to improve the quality, adequacy and efficiency of transport, communications, energy, education and health infrastructure across Australia.
It is necessary to inject some balance and perspective into the debate concerning the government’s budget position. Australia’s balance sheet is strong and will continue to be one of the strongest in the world. After peaking at 13.8 per cent of GDP in 2013-14, net debt is expected to fall to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. In comparison, average net debt in advanced economies will continue to rise to a substantial 80.6 per cent in 2014. The government’s firm commitment to return the budget to surplus will ensure that fiscal sustainability is maintained. Meeting the commitment will involve further tough choices, but it is important because fiscal sustainability remains one of the key ingredients for sustainable economic growth.
Unfortunately, we cannot accept the amendment of the Greens. The matter was the subject of correspondence between the previous government, the then President of the Senate and the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. However, no changes to the compact were agreed.
To conclude, the government’s approach seeks to support the economy and to protect jobs. It does so by making substantial investments in worthwhile infrastructure. It is therefore a budget for all Australians and for future generations of Australians. I commend Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and the cognate bills to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I present the government’s response to the 412th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on its inquiry into audit reports reviewed during the 41st Parliament, and seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit
Report 412 – Audit reports reviewed during the 41st Parliament
Government Response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit Report 412 – Audit reports reviews during the 41st Parliament.

Recommendation

The Committee recommends that DSD formally remind all agencies of their responsibility to comply with the ISIDRAS reporting as required by the Protective Security Manual.

Response

DSD formally reminded all agencies of their responsibility to comply with Information Security Incident Detection, Reporting and Analysis Scheme (ISIDRAS) reporting in the March edition of the DSD Information Security Bulletin. This document is sent to all Chief Information Officers of both State and Federal Government agencies.
Additionally, after a comprehensive review and consultation with stakeholders, DSD has taken the following actions to ensure that agencies fully understand the scheme:
The scheme has been renamed ‘Information Security Incident Reporting’ (ISIR), so that the title more accurately represents the scheme’s function.
The number of reporting categories has changed from four to two so that it is easier for agencies to make the decision on what incidents they must report to DSD.
This information has been disseminated to Government agencies through a variety of channels including: a more informative section on incident reporting on DSD’s Government website www.onsecure.gov.au; a statement of policy in DSD’s 2008 Information Security Manual; and via statements at key security conferences (including the Attorney General’s Security in Government conference).
DSD experienced a 25 per cent increase in agencies reporting incidents during 2007. The number of incidents reported to DSD in 2008 was consistent with the number reported in 2007. Due to improvements associated with the ISIR scheme, the quality of information provided in incident reports is improving and agencies are reporting on the correct incident categories.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2009-06-25,"—I recognise that it has been a difficult week and that senators are anxious to escape this place and return to their duties in their various states. But I do wish tonight to reflect upon an issue of importance—that is, the continuing problems that bedevil the Middle East, particularly the issue of Palestine. I regularly, like all other members of parliament, receive an inflow of emails and articles on this issue. I try to read them all, or most of them. Some are fair and balanced. Unfortunately, some are extreme and indeed reflect the most anti-Semitic or anti-Islamic views. Fortunately those are in the minority.
In recent weeks, however, there has been a concerted campaign in this country by various people, described as academics, artists and professionals, supporting a petition calling for a boycott of Israel. This is being promoted by the group known as the Friends of Palestine, an organisation that I regularly receive emails from and whose publications I do read. Let me quote from an extensive email that I received on 25 June from the Friends of Palestine organisation. I want to quote part of the foreword by Sonja Karkar, a well-known spokesperson for that group. It says:
Israeli-born Professor Ilan Pappe urges the international community to begin cultural boycotts as “the longest and one of the cruellest Occupations in modern times” enters its 42nd year. Those who demand that “we leave culture out of our political actions,” he says, “provide immunity for one of the greatest atrocities of our time.”
That struck me because of its incredibly strong language. So I read on. Attached to the foreword by Sonja Karkar is an article by Ilan Pappe titled ‘The necessity of cultural boycott’. Throughout that article, which I do not have time to read in full, there are recurring attacks upon the state of Israel. It is referred to as an ‘apartheid system’, and I wish to come back to that particular reference. It says that Israel is guilty of ‘ethnic cleansing of 1948’ and, further, that it is a ‘charade’ of a democracy.
I make the point at the outset that this type of criticism is able to be freely disseminated in this country and read by all of us. I doubt if there are very many countries, certainly in the Middle East region, other than in Israel, where that sort of criticism of their own governments can be regularly read. In some cases, it is absolutely banned. You would have no access to emails or to the internet to read such material if it were directed at the country’s regime. Indeed, you could probably expect serious consequences to your person.
Dr Ilan is a well-known critic of Israel, being Chair in the Department of History at the University of Exeter. I wish to quote from his article:
In the last eight years the Israeli criminal policy escalated, and the Palestinian activists were seeking new means to confront it.
I interpose here to repeat ‘new means to confront it’. The article continues:
They have tried it all, armed struggle, guerrilla warfare, terrorism and diplomacy: nothing worked. And yet they are not giving up and now they are proposing a nonviolent strategy —that of boycott, sanctions and divestment. With these means they wish to persuade Western governments to save not only them, but ironically also the Jews in Israel from an imminent catastrophe and bloodshed. This strategy bred the call for cultural boycott of Israel.
Another phrase that is used is ‘the Israeli criminal policy’. The article states that Palestinian activists were seeking new means, having tried armed struggle, guerrilla warfare, terrorism and diplomacy. I was not alive in 1948 but I was a young person in 1967 and I particularly remember 1973, when the surrounding Arab nations tried to annihilate the state of Israel. So, contrary to what may have been suggested in this article, this is not a new phenomenon in the last eight years—a means for the Palestinian activists to destroy the state of Israel. Of course, we can all remember the various terrorist acts that occurred, whether it was at the Munich Olympics or whether it was the bombing of airports or the hijacking of ships and airlines that occurred in the 1970s, particularly following the 1973 war.
The criticism and this boycott is linked to this so-called ‘campaign against apartheid’. Of course what always runs through this type of criticism of Israel is the linking of the Israeli government and their policies either with the Holocaust or with the apartheid regime in South Africa, or both. I find that somewhat ironic at times because some of the very persons who use that terminology, such as President Ahmadinejad in Iran, at the same time essentially deny the occurrence of the Holocaust. There is this constant reference these days to a campaign against apartheid.
I remember the campaign against apartheid. I was involved in it. That was a legitimate campaign. It was not supported by everyone, but in my view, and I think it is accepted, that was a legitimate campaign of protests and boycotts against a regime that did not allow the majority of the citizens in that state to have even the most fundamental of human rights—the right to vote, the right to walk down the street side by side with a white person or even the right to use public facilities such as toilets in an unsegregated manner.
In my view to suggest that the campaign to support Palestinian rights should be founded upon a boycott of Israel, using the terminology or the argument that Israel is an apartheid state, is, as I said, an outrage. There are rights enjoyed by Palestinians and Arab citizens in Israel that do not exist for the Jewish people in some of those surrounding countries. There are members of Knessett in Israel who represent Arab citizens of Israel.
In February this year elections took place in Israel. If you have ever witnessed an Israeli election, you know that it is one of the most democratic elections ever held in the world. There are numerous parties that run. It makes this parliament look at times like a tame peace gathering—given the vigorous debate that goes on in the Knesset. In Israel people who want to oppose the policies of Israel with respect to Palestine are entitled to do so freely and democratically. Yet what we are seeing in Iran today is a continuation of the outrageous views expressed by President Ahmadinejad at the Durban II conference. He is now inflicting that very same campaign upon his own people. (Time expired)
