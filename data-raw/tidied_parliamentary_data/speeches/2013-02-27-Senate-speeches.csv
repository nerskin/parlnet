Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  A little earlier in the week I commenced my second reading debate contribution and spoke, I think, for all of 37 seconds about this important legislation—the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. I was about to mention that the bill reinforces the key values of fairness, equity under the law and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.


Slavery still exists. It is not a relic of the past. This bill takes head-on three modern manifestations of slavery—forced marriage, forced labour and organ trafficking—and it does so in accordance with Australia's international legal obligations. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Australia is obligated to take steps to fully realise rights recognised in these treaties, including marriage with the free consent of both spouses.


Forced marriage should not be confused with arranged marriage or religious custom. Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism require full and free consent to marriage. In an arranged marriage families usually play a significant role in promoting the idea of marriage to the bride and groom but spouses do have the right to refuse the arrangement. The International Family Law journal suggested in 2004 that many victims of forced marriage suffer tremendously. Cases have included emotional and physical abuse, abduction and kidnapping, genital mutilation, rape, enforced pregnancy, abortion and even murder.


This bill creates a new offence for forced marriages. While it may be argued that the broad definition of 'slavery' as found by the High Court in The Queen v Wei Tang allows prosecution under the existing Criminal Code, the government has chosen to codify the crime, leaving no room for uncertainty at common law. Proposed new section 270.7A provides a definition of 'forced marriage'. This expanded definition will allow for prosecution of servile relationships which are not legally recognised as marriage in Australia. Proposed new section 270.7B inserts two new forced marriage offences. One subsection will be used in the prosecution of those who are a party to the marriage. The other subsection allows for the prosecution of third parties who either use force or coercion to foster such a marriage or are reckless to the fact that the marriage is forced.


While many consider the face of 21st-century slavery to be forced prostitution, a recent discussion paper from the Attorney-General's Department noted that slavery also exists in industries such as hospitality, construction, and agriculture, as well as in domestic situations. One recent example of this was a horrific case in the Blue Mountains in NSW where a restaurateur was prosecuted after promising a better life to an Indian national. After his arrival in Sydney, this individual's travel documents were seized and he was forced to work hours on end without pay as a kitchen hand, accommodated only in a backyard tin shed.


This bill broadens the definitions and offences which were previously associated with sexual servitude and creates a number of new sections which will apply more generally to all forms of servitude and all forms of forced labour. The definition of sexual servitude is replaced with a definition of servitude. Also replaced is the offence of sexual servitude with a broader offence of servitude. The elements of the new offence are: causing a person to enter or remain in servitude, or conducting a business involving servitude.


The bill creates a continuum of offences, from forced labour where physical restraint is not proved, to servitude where ownership is not proved, to slavery. The bill allows for an alternative verdict for forced labour if servitude is not proved beyond reasonable doubt provided the accused is accorded procedural fairness with respect to the alternate crime.


The third arm of this bill relates to organ trafficking. Australia is obliged under the trafficking protocol to criminalise organ trafficking. This bill inserts seven new offences into the Criminal Code relating to organ trafficking based on two subdivisions: organ trafficking and harbouring a victim. The offences are designed to criminalise every element of organ trafficking. For example, the harbouring offence only requires the prosecution to prove recklessness in harbouring, receiving or concealing a victim. Factors which will trigger the aggravated offence—carrying a larger penalty—are: if the victim is under 18; if the victim is subject to cruel punishment; or if in the conduct of organ trafficking the victim or another person dies or suffers serious harm. The aggravated offence of harbouring will be triggered if the victim is under 18.


It is now 189 years since slavery was abolished in the British Empire This decision had effect in the colony of New South Wales in 1824. It is 147 years since the 13th amendment of the US Constitution banned slavery. It is 125 years since slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888. Nevertheless, this bill recognises that slavery remains a reality today. This bill will ensure more investigations, simpler trials and swifter convictions for those involved in such appalling exploitation and denial of liberty, and I support this bill.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (09:41):  I also rise to address the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As Senator Faulkner has just indicated, it is some hundreds of years, over 200 years in fact, since Wilberforce in 1807 brought the Slave Trade Act into the British parliament, and in 1837 the abolition of slavery. So many people when they look at films about slavery, like Lincoln with Daniel Day-Lewis who won the Oscar, tend to think about it as a thing in the past. 


But it is not. For many people around the world their basic freedoms, their liberties and their individual rights are being abused. The exploitation involved, normally in the form of people trafficking, can take a wide range of forms including sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, organ harvesting, as well as sexual or domestic servitude and including forced marriage. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that victims were trafficked from a wide range of countries, over 127 countries, and there were more than 130 places around the world where they were exploited. All of this looks at trafficking for people for forced labour or sex but it does not actually include things like forced marriage or forced adoptions, so there is quite a broad range of people.


It is difficult to determine the extent of it in Australia. There are discrepancies between the estimates of government and non-government operations, but the Australian Federal Police have undertaken 305 investigations around people-trafficking offences between 2004 and 2011. As of June 2011, 184 victims had been referred to Australia's Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program, which indicates that it is an issue here in Australia and not just in other parts of the world.


It is interesting to see that the people who are quite active around the world and here in Australia are groups such as World Vision and groups within the Catholic Church and other churches. It is a timely reminder that, for all the bad press that churches receive at times, when it comes to standing up for people's freedoms and their rights it is often people who are motivated by their faith who are actually taking steps and going out of their way to stand up for and to support people. Wilberforce was one of the earliest examples in this particular area, but I commend organisations such as World Vision for their extensive work and their campaigns of not trading lives.


It is an issue, though, in Australia. In South Australia recently we have had bills looking at things like decriminalising prostitution. Evidence has come from the University of Melbourne, for example, talking about the existence of trafficked prostitutes in Asia working in South Australia's illegal brothels and that decriminalisation would make the problem even worse. So there is evidence that this is not something that is just overseas, that is just in someone else's backyard. This occurs in our backyard and it affects our communities, so it is appropriate that this parliament does something about it. We need to support the work of organisations such as World Vision and Rahab, which was started by young women who reach out to and care for the women who are caught up in the sex industry, often having been trafficked, in places like South Australia.


It is also the case that whilst we tend to think of forced marriage as being something that perhaps happens in other countries, it does happen here in Australia. There have been a number of newspaper articles over the last few years highlighting the cases of young women who have sought the protection of the Australian Federal Police and others to stop them being sent from this country by their parents to end up in a marriage that they were not willing to be part of. The Australian Embassy in Lebanon, for example, handled around 12 forced marriage cases involving girls as young as 14, with claims that they were raped and kidnapped, back in 2005. So whilst the size of the problem is not definitely known, we do know that it is a problem.


This bill seeks to codify, for the first time, some of these offences so that we are making a very clear statement that what may be culturally acceptable in some countries is not acceptable here in Australia; that it is not only against our values and the freedoms and rights of individuals but, if those are not being respected, we will make it against the law so people realise what is expected if they live here in Australia. The objective of the bill is to strengthen and expand the capability of investigators and prosecutors to combat people-trafficking and slavery, in particular for the purposes of labour exploitation, and to facilitate the prosecution of these offences.


Specifically, the bill introduces new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a victim and organ trafficking and makes a number of consequential amendments. It ensures that the slavery offence applies to conduct which renders a person a slave, as well as conduct involving a person who is already a slave. It extends the application of the existing offences of deceptive recruiting and sexual servitude so that they apply to non-sexual servitude and all forms of deceptive recruiting. It increases the penalties applicable to the existing debt bondage offences to ensure they adequately reflect the relative seriousness of the offences, and again there are some consequential amendments. I will come back to that point later because I have some concerns that some of the priorities in terms of the potential sentences do not reflect correctly the relative seriousness of the offences.


The bill also broadens the definition of exploitation under the code to include a range of slavery-like practices and it amends existing definitions in the code to capture more subtle forms of coercion, including psychological oppression and the abuse of power or a person's vulnerability. It clarifies the phrase that 'omission to perform an act that by law there is a duty to perform', in subsection 4.3(b) of the code, encompasses not only those duties imposed under Commonwealth law but also imposed under a state or territory law or at common law.


The coalition does have some concerns with the bill, and coalition senators made additional comments in the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee which looked into this crimes legislation amendment bill. One of the concerns is around the very broad definition of coercion. The explanatory memorandum explicitly says the term has been drafted to be broad and non-exhaustive in order to supplement the existing framework and 'ensure the broadest possible range of exploitative behaviour is captured and criminalised'. But the failure to actually define what coercion means leaves open the possibility that a broad range of relationships in which power is unequal might be characterised as coercive. There are also some concerns around the strict liability provisions, and the coalition will be putting forward some amendments in that regard.


I would like to come to some specific issues that I have noted in both the information surrounding the bill and specific clauses. One specific issue I thought was worthy of note when I was researching the background for this speech and looking at the inquiry in South Australia is that evidence from a Melbourne university in relation to the South Australian bill looked at alternative models of legislation. I think it is worthwhile for this parliament to also consider alternative approaches to reducing the demand for services that create the market for people to traffic.


The Nordic model was discussed during evidence provided to the South Australian parliament. Under the model that was first adopted in Sweden, the clients of prostitutes commit an offence punishable with fines or even custodial sentences, while the prostitutes themselves are considered to have committed no offence. The evidence presented indicates that it seems to have been effective as there is now no known trafficking in Sweden. There are a small number of women, perhaps as few as 600, involved in prostitution now in Sweden, compared to Australia, where the industry believes there are some 17,000. There are no brothels and street prostitution is almost gone. Clearly, having a different approach and making the consumer of the service liable, as opposed to the provider, is a way to protect people who are often victims of life circumstances that force them into that line of work. By not making their conduct illegal but making the conduct of the client illegal, it seems to be effective.


I believe it is appropriate that this parliament should take note of some of those kinds of initiatives to make sure that we balance cracking down on these sorts of behaviours and these sorts of industries that exploit people with protecting the people who are exploited. I would particularly like to come to this concept of relative offences. Clause 270.7 talks about deceptive recruiting for labour or services. The penalty in the case of an aggravated offence is imprisonment for nine years or, in any other case, imprisonment for seven years. We heard Senator Faulkner talk before about the person who had been brought from the Indian subcontinent to Australia and who ended up essentially being made to work as a slave, living in a tin shed. That was deceptive recruiting, which led to slave-like practices. I completely accept that that is not appropriate. But if we move on to 270.7A, which looks at forced marriage, we find that in the case of an aggravated offence for forced marriage the imprisonment is seven years or, in any other case, the imprisonment is only four years. The relativity of that is, I believe, inappropriate. 


Let us look at some of the newspaper articles, and I go particularly to an article in the Australian in February of last year. It talks about a centre in Western Sydney where there is a lady who runs a support service for young women who have been caught up in forced marriage or who have had pressure from family around that. She talks about the fact that this is very common in Australia, that it is deliberately hidden by community and religious leaders and that it co-exists with family violence and the subjugation of women. The article talks about the fact that legal aid lawyers have told the courts that, in a number of cases, girls are subjected to violence or threats of violence, including being dragged around by the hair, hit when they refuse the marriage that has been planned for them, taken out of school, locked in their bedrooms until they agree to go through the ceremony, or psychologically pressured by being told that their female relatives will be kidnapped and raped if they continue to resist the plans that have been made for them. In the worst case recorded, workers in the Migrant Resource Centre in Tasmania told authorities there that local families were exchanging dowries before girls were even 14, and that they have a case of a girl's family in Australia who pinned her down while her new husband raped her to seal the deal. How can that be a lesser offence in terms of the penalties than the deceptive recruiting? In terms of the standards that Australia maintains for the respect of individuals, this legislation should be sending the message that that kind of behaviour is inappropriate, that it is unacceptable and that it will be punished to the full extent of the law. 


I also have some concerns as to the same section around strict liability. Clause 270.7B(2)(c) talks about the person who is not a victim of a forced marriage having committed an offence and says that strict liability applies to that person. What that means is that, in this case, if there is a young woman, a young girl who is 13 or 14 years old, who is forced by her parents to take part in a marriage, there is a strict liability upon the groom, whether that person is 18 or 48 or whatever age, to prove his innocence. Firstly, that is a fundamental change in the assumption of innocence that we normally have here, in Australia. Secondly, as we have seen in many of these cases, that person is in another country and, yes, he may be a party to the marriage, but the one who is actually guilty of forcing the marriage, who is guilty of the psychological or physical oppression, is not the groom; in many cases, it is the parents. If there is going to be strict liability then, surely, it would be on the people who have actually caused the physical or psychological harm, the people who have exerted influence and control over the young woman as opposed to the person who is the other party in what some would see as an arranged marriage. Clearly, for someone who is underage in Australia, those who are guilty of making this a forced marriage are the caregivers, which, unfortunately and unthinkably from our world view here in Australia, appear to be the parents. So I have a concern with the concept of strict liability in the first place of reversing that onus of proof, but I am particularly concerned that it may be applied against the wrong party. I believe it is something that needs to be considered in this bill. 


Having said that, I do support the bill for all the reasons I have stated. It is long since Abraham Lincoln and long since William Wilberforce, and so you would like to think that our world has moved on; but, clearly, it has not. I believe it is important to recognise that many of the practices we are talking about, particularly around forced marriages, come from cultures other than that which is considered mainstream in Australia. The citizenship pledge which people take when they come to this country says in its preamble that it is important for all Australian citizens to understand their responsibilities. It also talks about what it means to be a citizen, whether Australian by birth or by choice. It is a critical part of building our nation. People are required to make the Australian Citizenship Pledge at citizenship ceremonies and, in doing so, they are making a public commitment to Australia and to accepting the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. The pledge says:


From this time forward, under God— 


if you take the oath— 


I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.


So the strength of this piece of legislation is in the fact that it is saying that, in Australia, we do believe in democracy. We do believe that individuals have rights and liberties. We have extended a welcome hand to people to come and be part of this country, but if they will not respect the rights and liberties of all citizens, including their own children, then this parliament representing the people of Australia will make laws that highlight the standards that we expect in terms of upholding those rights and liberties.


The people who come to this country are welcome and expected, under this pledge, to share our democratic beliefs, to respect rights and liberties, and to uphold the law. I plead with them to leave behind those things that are not compatible with the expectations of this country, which they have chosen to make their new home in, in the interests of their dependants, their families and this community, so that we can build a strong, cohesive community as one people living in one nation under one law.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (10:00):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate about the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. We heard this morning that William Wilberforce introduced the bills to the British parliament 200 years ago to abolish slavery, and that over 80 years ago slavery was declared internationally illegal by the League of Nations. One would think that that was the end of it, but we know that there are an estimated 27 million slaves in the world—and that is at least twice the number of slaves that existed in the Roman Empire.


It is particularly disturbing for us in Australia because so many of the world's slaves—roughly 20 million to 22 million of them—are actually found in our region. Many of these people have been born into slavery, or have been enslaved close to home in a factory or on a farm, in a quarry or in a mine, in a restaurant or in hotels. A smaller number are caught in trafficking rackets, and we do not even know how many are subject to forms of slavery that occur in war and conflict or in systems of slavery such as child trading or forced marriage. We do have some numbers, and they are very depressing. There are an estimated 15 million bonded labourers in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal who are all slaves to their masters and have no rights. We have an estimated 2.4 million people trafficked each year and many, as we have heard this morning, are trapped sex workers.


Then there are the child soldiers. That is the story that really hits home. An estimated 40,000 children are captives in Uganda—40,000 children who have lost their childhood. It is an evil trade. We know that. Enslaved people across the world are deliberately harvested from groups, or from classes of people who have been excluded or marginalised, or set aside on the basis of their gender or race, their disability, their religion or their caste, and who are excluded from the benefits of the economic system, the social system, from systems for conflict management and, of course, from the justice system.


The government is committed to both a strong criminal justice response to, and protection for, victims of trafficking and slavery. It is an absolute violation of human rights, and it is not enough for us to simply express our moral outrage. We must act to redress it. As the Australian Human Rights Commission reminds us: every person has equal rights, just by being born human. We know that we have a responsibility to ensure that enslaved people are not excluded from the legal system, that their rights are recognised, and that those who take these rights away are guilty of crime. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012—a mouthful in itself—is designed to bring Australian laws into harmony with our obligations under antislavery conventions that we ratified in 1927 and 1958 in an attempt to ensure that our laws are comprehensive and apply to the current situation we face both here in Australia and in our region.


I am a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights which has the task of assessing the compatibility of all proposed legislation with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. In considering this bill, the committee has been thinking about what it means to be owned and thinking about the big questions. What is bondage in the modern world? Why is it slavery? Where does trafficking fit in the big picture of slavery, and above all, how can we stop it happening? In considering that process, I found the book Australians and Modern Slavery by Roscoe Howell to be very helpful, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone concerned with this human rights issue. It is an analysis of how Australia relates to each of the 11 forms of modern slavery and, frankly, it is quite eye opening. It brings to the fore behaviours that we do not often think about and which can easily be left in the too-hard basket and behaviours that, as we have heard, are happening in our own country as well as in our region.


Sometimes people in this country are married too young or they are trapped into a forced marriage, and this occurs under systems of belief where women are regarded as property, subordinate, or with identity regarded not as personal but as familial. It happens today in cultures and communities that are established in Australia or are coming to Australia. Cultural ceremonies are taking place here where women, and men and families, believe that they are subject to cultural practices and that cultural rules are paramount. What this legislation does is make it known and make it clear that the rule of law is paramount in Australia. We all have to be ready to adapt to changing circumstances so, of course, the time is right to reassess the laws relating to slavery, slavery-like conditions and people trafficking, when millions of people every year are being exploited by others for financial gain.


It is important that we amend the earlier legislation, the Crimes Act 1914, the Migration Act 1958, the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002, to establish the new offences. Senator Faulkner went through each of those offences in turn. They are offences of forced labour, forced marriage, organ trafficking and harbouring a victim.


This bill will do all that. It will also modify the scope and application of existing offences such as slavery, deceptive recruiting, sexual servitude and trafficking in persons, and increase the penalty for an offence of debt bondage—and debt bondage is something that we are hearing much more about. 


There has been extensive consultation on the proposed legislative change in this bill and there is very strong support from across the country and across advocates, lawyers, migration agents, migrant resource centres, charities, churches and all of those who are involved in dealing with the very difficult, seedy side of these kinds of practices and the industry that has been built around it. The bill will not only tighten the law relating to these crimes; it will help to raise public awareness of the issues, and that is one of the important things that we need to ensure occurs, to promote justice and to bring about the changes that we all want to happen. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee I was involved in the inquiry into the bill. I would like to put some time into putting a human face on the reasons this bill is necessary. As the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, has pointed out, we have some concerns and we will be moving some amendments, but in general we support very strongly the need for this legislation.


I was involved, a number of years ago, in the federal Liberal Women's Council's moves to change the law as it then operated in Australia, where women who had been brought to Australia as sex slaves, to work in prostitution, were being deported back to their home countries before they had the opportunity to give evidence of any sort against the people who had brought them here. As a government we were in fact inadvertently assisting the people committing the crime of turning women into sex slaves in Australia. I must admit that, at the time, I thought that that was probably the extent of the problem—that it was something that happened perhaps at Kings Cross in Sydney but nowhere else, that it involved poor women from Asia being brought to Sydney and Melbourne but not much else. It took some time for me to realise that this was a far bigger problem than we had previously thought. We still have serious problems knowing the extent of not just the sex slave industry but the slavery and human trafficking issues in Australia because it is very difficult to gather statistics.


It was probably about six years ago that I attended a presentation in Brisbane by the Reverend Tim Costello, who made the point while he was talking that right there, in suburban Brisbane, not very far away, there would be people who were living in slavery-like conditions, whether they were sex slaves, being exploited by strangers for their labour or being exploited by family for their labour. It was only then that the far greater extent of this problem really struck me.


One of the problems is that in some cases it can be very hard to identify who is in a slavery-like relationship and who is not. I know there are some small family businesses where children perhaps as young as eight actually have a role in the business and love their role in the business, and that is not something that I believe any government should interfere with. However, if that child is being forced to get up very early and stay up very late to take part in that business, then we do have a situation teetering on the edge of abuse and neglect.


Whilst the whole focus of the slavery and slavery-like conditions bill is around people who have been brought into Australia to be slaves, there are so many nuances within families, such as within forced marriages, as Senator Stephens was pointing out. One of our concerns about forced marriage is that, in many cases, both parties to the marriage can be very young. The suggestion that, if someone has been forced into marriage, the other party must be the guilty party is not necessarily the case. It can be far more nuanced than that. Both parties to the marriage, in fact, may have been forced into the marriage. So these are issues that we need to take into account in the way that we look at this legislation.


I want to go through a number of cases that have been brought to my attention by Anti-Slavery Australia—and it still strikes me as bizarre and awful that we need an organisation called Anti-Slavery Australia. The first case involves a woman—not called Maria but named Maria for the point of the exercise—who was 24 and came here from the Philippines. She had been working in a factory earning $10 a week to support her young son and her mother, and she was told that she could come to Australia to live with a friend's relatives and take English classes in her spare time, and that they would give her some money for a visa and an airfare. When she got here, she found that she was in fact supposed to be the fiancee of an Australian man. He took her passport and she was required to work in the fiance's family business seven days a week. She was never paid any wages. She felt that she could not leave, that she had to do what she was told by her so-called fiance or he and his family would hit her. She felt absolutely trapped, because there was no way that she could seek help from her elderly mother. She had been trafficked and enslaved—hardly the promise she had been brought here on—but perhaps from the outside it did not look like a case of slavery.


The next case involves a woman called Sun, who is 22 and came from South Korea and had come to Australia on a 12-month working holiday visa. She was actually someone who was doing sex work at home, in South Korea, to pay her way through uni. She heard from another sex worker that life was much easier both for study and to finance herself in Australia. She took out the 12-month working holiday visa thinking that she would study, and finance herself through sex work in Australia. But of course the agent who organised all this immediately had her collected from the airport and taken to a Sydney brothel, and the owner said she had to pay off her flight and her visa. She was working up to 20 hours a day, and she very rarely received any money at all because she was paying off this alleged debt to the brothel owner in Sydney.


A third person, a man called Prishen, who was 43 and came from India on a three-month holiday visa was going to work with the family's restaurant in Melbourne during his three months. They had paid for him to come, and in return he would help out in the restaurant. However, when he got here he was working all night and every night, and being paid about $50 per week. He could do what he wanted to do in his hours off during the day, but he was clearly being very heavily exploited by his family. The only way that this person could currently seek remedy would be through civil action and, of course, that is not a very satisfactory way for an impoverished person, whose primary language is Indian, to function in Australia.


The fourth person is an Indonesian called Abdul, who is 35. He came here on a 457 visa. He had an interview with an employment firm that linked him up with a subcontractor in Australia. He was sponsored to come out here to work on, 'large building sites in Canberra'. He was told his pay would be in line with Australian award wages.


When he got here, he was not able to read any of the signs or understand any of the safety briefings that he was given and he was told that he would be working a six-day week for $250. He thought that was a fairly low wage. He lived 30 minutes out of Canberra and he was taken to work by his boss in a van every day and taken back again. He was then told that there would $100 per week donated from his $250 to send home to his family. You might not be surprised to hear that his family never received any of that money.


It can be a very broad field when we are looking at slavery and slavery-like conditions. But it is, despite those balanced examples I have given, generally, a quite gendered crime. It is in the main women who are the victims of slavery and slavery-like trafficking. I am delighted that we now have this legislation before us. I would hope that we can follow it up with perhaps some more real action in the field of child marriage and in the field of female genital mutilation which, in my view, are part of the same power control that goes on over women, particularly those from cultures where it is more normal for the men to exercise the power.


The coalition members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee have put in some additional comments to this report. We agreed with the comments of the government members of the committee but we would like to see a few areas of this bill clarified, because it does finally bring us to the stage where there is an understanding, at least from the legislatures, of what is happening in some parts of Australia right now—right under the noses of everybody.


I think there is probably still more room for this information to be promoted, not just to the people who might be the victims of it but also to the general public so that they recognise slavery situations when they see them. Fifty years ago, domestic violence victims would certainly have passed under the radar, or just politely not be talked about; that is no longer the case. We need to get to the situation where everybody in the community is concerned and looking at whether what they are looking at is an equal relationship that both people want to continue, or if what they are looking at is, in fact, a form of slavery.


I commend the bill, and hope that the government will accept the amendments that we will be proposing.

The need for legal and cultural reform to ensure that all people are free from bondage is as pressing now as it was when Abraham Lincoln resolved, through the 13th Amendment of 1865, to hold together the American union on a foundation of liberty and basic human dignity. And we are all reminded now of the singular importance of that fight against slavery as we seek to protect and extend these freedoms today.


This bill is about the Gillard Labor government striving to make sure Australia remains a just society, where the rights of individuals are upheld, and those who aim to exploit individuals and remove their rights are brought to justice. We are a part of an ever-changing world, a global society where trends move fast and people, sadly, can be treated as a commodity. Human trafficking and slavery is tragically becoming a growing concern in the 21st of century, internationally and here in Australia. Research suggests that globally between 500,000 and four million people are trafficked internally and across state borders, and of those people being trafficked 80 per cent are women and girls. Australia is not immune to this terrible trade. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 305 investigations and assessments of people-trafficking related offences were conducted by the Australian Federal Police's Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team. One hundred and eighty-four victims of trafficking were provided with assistance through the Australian government's Support For Trafficked People Program and 13 people were convicted for people-trafficking related offences here in Australia.


The majority of cases were of women being trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Many of these tragic cases follow the pattern outlined in case study from Anti-Slavery Australia:


When she got to the Sydney parlour, the owner told her she had to repay a 'debt' of $25,000 that she'd 'incurred' by having her flight and visa organised. In order to pay off this 'debt' she worked 14 hours a day, 6 days a week and her boss pressured her to work on her day off as well. She wasn't paid any money until her 'debt' had been paid off. Sometimes, her boss pressured her to perform sexual services without a condom. She lived in an apartment adjoining the parlour and was not permitted to leave the premises unsupervised. The boss threatened Sun with deportation if she complained too much, refused a customer or tried to go to the authorities for help.


Women typically find themselves in this situation having come to Australia under the pretence of undertaking a course of study or sometimes with the expectation of reasonable work in the sex industry or in other fields. The emotional cost and enduring pain each person experiences through this degrading trade is a price that one should never have to pay. This bill, which was developed with the support of non-government organisations and subject to two discussion papers with broad consultation, strengthens the protection of those who may fall prey to this unforgiving trade of slavery. One life involved and subjected to this trade, I believe, is one life too many. I welcome the changes being made through this bill being debated today, such as the definition of exploitation which will be broadened to include a range of slavery-like practices and increase the penalties applicable to the existing debt bondage offences to ensure they adequately reflect the seriousness of this offence.


Slavery is not acceptable and the bill loudly proclaims the government will not allow it to take root in our society. Slavery in any part of the world should never be acceptable and it is rightly prohibited under the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. Australia strongly condemns the practice and in 2005 ratified the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. However, in our society, which is not immune to international trends, it is imperative we continue to provide strong leadership in this area. It is the Gillard Labor government which is taking this action and standing up for people of all ages and ethnicities who may unwillingly become subject to slavery offences and or human trafficking. In the 21st century, no individual should be forced or threatened to take part in work or physical labour without their consent. No individual should be coerced into a marriage through any form of pressure. No individual should be involved in the illegal trade of body parts and no individual should be subjected to sexual or non-sexual servitude.


Labor has implemented a strong whole-of-government strategy to target human trafficking, including sexual trafficking and forced labour. This bill reflects this strategy and helps further administer its four central pillars: prevention; detection and investigation; prosecution; and victim support and protection. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 brings Australia's laws on trafficking and slavery into line with Australia's human rights obligations. It ensures the Commonwealth can meet its human rights obligations and adequately deal with the criminal conduct taking place in the area of people trafficking and slavery offences. I strongly welcome, through this bill, the introduction of new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a person for the purpose of further offence of trafficking and organ trafficking into the Commonwealth Criminal Code.


The changing nature of this trade, and its global sophistication, can make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and prosecute its range of exploitive behaviours. That is why it is important that the bill enhances the power required by law enforcement agencies to adequately deal with this sort of criminal conduct in the 21st century. The bill strongly condemns the trade and its practice, clearly stating to offenders or those intending to take part in the trade, that it is a crime—a serious crime, one that our society will not stand for.


I am sure I am not the only senator here who has come face-to-face with a woman who is desperately seeking help and guidance because she is sadly facing the prospect of being forced into a marriage she has not chosen. Women in our society should not be facing this crisis. I call it a crisis because that is exactly what it is. When threats, deception and coercion are used to bring about a marriage or a marriage like relationship, it is a clear human rights abuse. Whilst forced marriage like slavery and human trafficking is not clearly evident in all areas of our society, it does still exist. I am concerned that, if we do not take action and introduce new measures through this bill such as the criminalisation of forced marriage, then these issues may become rooted in all other areas of our society.


To feel powerless, unheard and invaluable is not a life a woman should live. It is not a life anyone should live. We need to empower women. Women who are supported and empowered both economically and socially create a flourishing, productive, rich and diverse society. This bill will continue that proud Labor tradition of empowering women and protecting the vulnerable in our community. Through the support of this bill, we have a real opportunity to show global leadership in the area of slavery and human trafficking. By putting in place good policy, we can work towards the eradication as well as the prevention of this degrading trade in Australia and beyond. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:31):  I rise to speak in favour of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. I think it is really important to reflect in this place that often we have differing views about things yet it has been very humbling experience to listen to the passion and dedication of people on all sides of this debate today. It is obviously something that cuts across political borders. As fellow human beings we understand there can be no justification for forcing another person into that type of slavery or sexual abuse and assault.


It might surprise many people listening today that this type of activity even happens here in Australia because we are the lucky country. We do have the rule of law. We do ensure that we look after those who are vulnerable in our community and do what we can to ensure people are not exploited. Many people are shocked at the idea that sexual slavery, the slavery of individuals, even happens here on Australian soil. But the sad fact is it does. The inquiry into this legislation brought out that it is often occurring to those who are so vulnerable that it is kept silent.


One of the key problems in this issue is that we just do not know how many people are actually affected. There are NGOs and community based organisations that try and keep their finger on how many people access their services. Project Respect, for example, based out of Melbourne, helped over 900 victims of sexual slavery in the 2011-12 year alone. But there is no hard data as to how many people, and women in particular, are trafficked into Australia for the purpose of sexual slavery.


One of the recommendations made during the inquiry into this legislation was that we actually fund proper research into the demand for trafficked persons so we can keep a closer eye on just how many individuals and human lives are being destroyed and exploited through these means. To do that we would need adequate funding and partnerships resourced between academic institutions and other groups as well as, of course, government agencies managed by both state and federal government for policing and border patrol so that we can keep check on how many women are being affected by this awful hideous crime, which, I would argue, is a crime against humanity.


This bill goes a long way to ensuring that we put very clearly in the law the seriousness of these crimes against individuals. It ensures that there are tougher penalties for those who engage in putting women into these types of slavery conditions. Those types of penalties are welcome. They go a long way to sending the signal that this is a very serious crime. The bill includes penalties in relation to debt bondage, which we know is how many of these women, particularly young women, are caught in this hideous crime. They are often tricked into coming to Australia to study. A number of victims have study visas. They think they are coming here to learn English or to expand on their other skills they were learning at home only to find themselves bonded into debt by those who then force them to participate in prostitution and other types of slavery.


We need to have these types of penalties but we also need to do what we can to expand the support for victims. That is not what this bill goes to but I think it is very important that we use the motivation from around the chamber today, across the political divide, to advocate stronger support for the victims involved. One of the key recommendations from the inquiry was the setting up of a proper federal compensation scheme. One of the biggest problems in this issue is that victims' compensation is managed by the states but the people who are involved in trafficking individuals, particularly women, move their victims from state to state to avoid being caught. If a crime was committed in Victoria and the person has been moved to a brothel in New South Wales, it is unclear which victims of crime compensation the individual is actually entitled to. This is a federal issue. Many of the people are coming to Australia under the misunderstanding of their visa requirements. It is a crime now in the federal legislation and we should establish a federal compensation scheme to help those victims.


One of the other issues that are particularly pertinent in this area is that as part of the support for victims—whether that be through accessibility to a longer stay visa once somebody has been rescued, if you will, from these hideous circumstances—there should be an ability for that person to access a proper, valid visa that is in their interest, that is going to be supporting them as a victim of these hideous crimes and that is not just directly linked to whether their case is helpful for particular prosecutions. This is really, really important because we need to be able to allow the victims in this area to feel free, comfortable and able to come forward, tell their stories and ask for help and assistance. Because many of them have been flown to Australia under the guise of a different type of visa, once they have been found to be working in a brothel and it is found that they are not in Australia on a valid visa, of course we need to do something to ensure that they can stay here safely and with all the support necessary. That support and compassion offered to those individuals should not simply be linked to whether the prosecution team believe that their case is going to be helpful enough to any legal case.


We need to make sure that there is proper support through the visa system, and that includes de-linking those visas and supports from the criminal justice process. I believe it is really important that we have victims being able to speak out against how they have been treated so that we can keep the individuals who are responsible for these hideous crimes locked up—I absolutely believe that—but we also have to ensure that we look after the victims through that process. I have often called for some type of special humanitarian visa, which would be available for those women victims who have been trafficked. I think that would be a very simple way of being able to acknowledge that we owe these women all the care and support that they deserve. A special humanitarian visa for those who have been victims of trafficking and slavery would be one thing that I urge both the government and the opposition to consider in coming months.


I also believe that we need to do more in terms of educating our communities about these issues. As I said at the outset, many people are surprised that this even happens here in Australia, and yet many people who find themselves in these circumstances, because they are being brought to Australia under a false pretence, find it very difficult to explain to individual members in our communities. Whether they are at university or at TAFE, or at other learning institutions where often many of these young women attend, there is a disbelief about the fact that this is going on. When they ask for help, when they put their hand out for assistance, there is an unawareness amongst our community that this is going on. We need to ensure that we invest significant resources into community education campaigns, letting those victims of these hideous crimes know that they have rights in Australia, that this is not allowed to happen to them, that it is a crime and that the people doing this to them are criminals. We also need to let them know that they deserve help, support and assistance. We need to ensure that we have proper education campaigns targeting high schools, universities, TAFEs and the professions which these women come into contact with, so that anyone who may need assistance is able to be offered that and action can be taken.


As I said, we also need adequate funding for the research to ensure that we know exactly what is going on: how many women in particular are a subject of this awful, hideous crime. The other recommendation that has not been picked up in this piece of legislation, but that I think is worth considering in future debates, is the responsibility that must be taken by individuals who intentionally use these services. It should be a criminal offence to intentionally, knowingly or recklessly obtain sexual services from a trafficked woman. If it is a crime to put women into this circumstance—which it should be—it should also be a crime to knowingly use that service; otherwise we are simply turning a blind eye to why these services are even able to continue. It is absolutely paramount that we send a very strong message to both the criminals in these syndicates and the people who knowingly use their services that the Australian government does not accept this, that this is a standard that is unacceptable in Australia and that we do stand by the human rights as outlined under the various international conventions that stamp out slavery and that say that treating another human being like this is a hideous crime and will not be accepted. An individual who knowingly uses these services must also take responsibility for their continuation of the abuse of these individuals.


Further support for victims, as I have mentioned in terms of a special visa category, would go a long way to helping these women. Ensuring that we have a federal compensation scheme and these other legislative reforms, as I have outlined, are all things that we now need to move on to. This bill has been a very, very important step and I commend it to the Senate. But our work is not yet over. We have got goodwill around this place; let's try and see how we can work together over coming months to make sure that the victims caught up in these awful circumstances are actually looked after. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:44):  I rise too, with an enduring concern and interest to protect women from the most abhorrent crimes, as Senator Hanson-Young has referred to, to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As my colleague Senator Brandis noted earlier in this debate, most of the offences described as new by the government are in essence definitional changes to existing offences in the Criminal Code. However, there are important new offences in organ trafficking and forced marriage, and it is the establishment of two new offences related to forced marriage that I will confine my remarks to, largely because of my involvement in the inquiry which has been alluded to.


In saying that, though, I would just like to briefly mention that I support the strengthening of regulations against organ trafficking. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who would consider it to be anything but a heinous crime, but we have to recognise and be cognisant of the fact that this is an emerging and flourishing commercial trade that happens overseas and continues to happen today as we stand here to legislate against it. So this is a good move in the sense that it strengthens our position on it—legislating against it to make sure that we stamp out all possibility of this happening in Australia and of people overseas abusing the legislative program and framework here in Australia.


As I said, I support my colleagues' comments on the bill before me and in particular the concerns that they have raised, such as about the ambiguously wide definition of 'servitude', which could be misused in an industrial relations context. As always, on this side of the chamber we give the utmost care and consideration to ensuring that legislation that comes before us in this place does not lead to unintended consequences for our community. I call on the Gillard government to support our proposed amendments.


I will now focus the remainder of my comments today on forced marriage and the relevant offences that this bill addresses. It was just over a year ago that confronting media reports and stories from the community about young women being brought to Australia to be forced into marriage led me to co-author with Senator Cash an inquiry into this issue. While that inquiry looked at all aspects of prospective marriage visas, many of the submissions contained evidence and commentary relating to the incidence of forced marriage in this country. We heard from many witnesses who came forward about their concerns in this regard.


The definition that this bill inserts into the Criminal Code defines a forced marriage as one where, because of 'coercion, threat or deception', a person, the victim, 'entered into the marriage without freely and fully consenting'. It is inconceivable to many of us that any person, any woman, could be forced into entering a marriage against her will. As we understand, it is a cultural--and in some countries, a religious—practice, a tradition, where marriages are arranged between two parties, but I note that here in Australia that is not how we do things. Marriage is probably one of the biggest decisions that any two individuals will make in their lives. It is one of the greatest commitments that any two individuals can make between themselves, and so it should be. I strongly oppose anything that contravenes that, and I am particularly concerned that individuals may be forced into marriages here in Australia, when it is certainly not our tradition and it is not the Australian way of life.


Unfortunately, I have to say that the anecdotal evidence reveals that there is a hidden and disturbing problem here in this country. It may not be a huge problem. That is something that is very hard to identify, and Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has just spoken to the lack of anecdotal evidence that we have here, but there is certainly evidence that this is a disturbing problem here. There are reported cases of so-called marriage trafficking, where women are brought to Australia and forced into marriage, as well as the reverse situation, where women are taken overseas for the very same purpose. It is impossible for me to forget the widely reported plight of a 17-year-old Sydney girl who managed to save herself from a forced marriage in Lebanon with the help of the Australian Federal Police. There are also alarming accounts of women living in Australia being similarly forced into marriage here, particularly in the migrant community.


As I mentioned earlier, the difficulty that we have is that this evidence is anecdotal. The incidence of forced marriages in this country is an unknown factor. As Dr Tomison, Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, made clear in the recent prospective marriage visa classes inquiry, research into human trafficking and in particular the connection between marriage and human trafficking is in an infancy stage. In other words, there is and has been extremely little, if any, research undertaken to ascertain the significance of this in Australia. The AIC does intend to further examine these connections, and I wish them all the best in that critical work. There is no doubt that, as the AIC, as well as the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women in Australia, have argued, there is a need for greater research into and awareness of the issue of forced marriage.


In this respect, we can look to the United Kingdom, where this issue has been given significant attention and focus, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office even establishing a Forced Marriage Unit in 2005. This unit has a policy role in working with other government departments and community organisations to tackle the issue and has been responsible for, among other things, publishing guidelines to help front-line workers identify and deal with cases of forced marriage. It has been recommended to this government that it consider establishing a working group to investigate the incidence of forced marriages in Australia and to explore relevant options that can be provided to assist victims. I strongly call on the government to act on this recommendation which goes hand in hand with the legislation that we have before us today.


It is also imperative that we seize the opportunity to put the spotlight on this issue to protect current and future victims. We need more research into exactly how prevalent forced marriages are, we need to raise awareness of the problem in the community and we need to provide more information and support to women who tragically find themselves the victim of this heinous practice. We also need, as the prospective marriage visa classes inquiry recommended, to raise the minimum age of visa holders within the prospective marriage visa program to 18 years of age to help minimise the incidence of forced marriage and human trafficking in Australia. The current visa requirements allow for young women under the age of 17 to be brought to this country for nine months, be sponsored by someone here in Australia and come here under the age of 18 with the intention of them being married at the age of 18. The inquiry heard much evidence in relation to this, but we did determine that: that was too young; girls under the age of 18 were particularly exposed; they would potentially not be provided with proper protection and afforded the rights that they should be; it was a fragile age; and that is one immediate change that could be made to strengthen our position in relation to forced marriages. And now, this moment in time, is when we need to do all of this. We cannot afford to wait a moment longer because, if we do, another young woman could find herself trapped in a situation not of her own making.


I welcome the creation of two forced marriage offences in this bill. The Criminal Code does not currently explicitly criminalise the act of causing a person to enter into a forced marriage, but with this bill it will become illegal to both cause a person to enter into a forced marriage and to be a party to a forced marriage. The second offence is directed at the spouse who is not a victim of forced marriage. Some critics have raised concerns about criminalising forced marriage and the potential for victims to be deterred from reporting for fear of the court process and being ostracised. This is another issue raised during the inquiry that I will come to shortly and that I have serious concerns about. I agree with the majority of organisations, including the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, that work in this field needs to support criminalisation. We need to make absolutely clear that Australia condemns this practice of forcing women into marriage and that under no circumstances do we support it. Ours is a country where people are free to choose whom they marry, and so must it remain. I also believe that including these offences in the Criminal Code will help to raise awareness of the problem—a problem that often remains hidden but, once again, exists. However, the coalition does have concerns as to the strict liability imposed in the forced marriage offences. There is a reversal of the onus of proof so that, if the prosecution establishes a person was forced into marriage, the other party to the marriage is presumed guilty and must establish a lawful excuse. 


I will just reflect on a couple of issues that came out of the inquiry and that other senators have raised in their debate on these particular bills. Firstly, there is the need for a central register. Through the inquiry, we established that there is no one agency responsible for collating any information on this. If the police, the department of community affairs or the immigration office are advised of a matter, there is no one central agency that is advised of the incidence or the concerns expressed that an individual may be in a forced marriage and may be having issues in relation to that. There is no single body collecting this information. The example that we were given in the United Kingdom is one that we encourage the government to consider because it centralises the data collection process. Whilst that sounds clinical and cold, all we have here at the moment is anecdotal evidence which raises huge concerns. It is critical that we actually have analytical data to back up and provide the support for changing the current system in the way it applies. In my mind, having a central agency, whether that be the Department of Immigration and Citizenship or not, responsible for the collection of data is the number one way in which we could strengthen the process and the regulation that relates to this. I also note that, when we talked about forced marriages and we discussed the women who are victims in this so-called equation, it is very difficult to flush out this information because many of these women are very fearful of their circumstances.


So you have situations where women are brought here who do not speak English, who have no network of friends around them—when the husband leaves for the day, they have no-one else they can speak to—and who are not aware of their rights here in Australia. They may come from countries where they fear police, so they may come here with a culture of fearing police authorities. More importantly, they are actually unaware of their rights and they do not have anyone to speak to. The big issue is in ensuring that every woman who comes here under a sponsored marriage arrangement is apprised of their rights—and I think through the immigration department. Australian authorities should be assured and comfortable with the fact that that individual is fully across what their rights are in Australia, what our protections are for individuals and the support network that is available through the refugee network. If they should change their mind about the circumstances in which they have come here then they should feel that they genuinely have a network they can turn to that will provide support.


I support the comments that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young made in relation to humanitarian visas. That was something that was crying out for attention in this inquiry. These women not only are not aware of the support network but tragically are scared that they are the ones who will be returned to their country of origin. They are particularly scared because in many of these instances, because of the cultural practices and traditions of their countries, they will be blamed for the marriage collapsing. With that blame they are ostracised; with that blame they will be rejected by their own family. So if they are returned to their country of origin, they will be penalised by their family, whether formally or informally, will be blamed for the collapse of the forced marriage and will incur whatever the consequences may be.


In many of these instances it is fair and reasonable to suggest that they will be discriminated against on their return. It is not a black-and-white scenario where they come here to be married and the marriage does not work so they should be returned to their country of origin. They will be discriminated against. There is no question that they will face prejudicial behaviour and in many cases rejection from their own immediate family. There is a need for us to consider a carving off, if you like, in part of the visa framework of a humanitarian allocation for women who are in this incredibly difficult circumstance so that consideration can be given to them to stay here with clearly strong support from various agencies. They could stay here and not be forced to return home to what would be quite difficult circumstances.


I support this legislation. I am concerned that there may be unintended consequences, but I strongly support it. I look forward to further consideration of other ways in which we can strengthen the framework to support women who may well find themselves in what could be loosely described as forced marriages.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:04):  I want to begin by thanking the senators who have contributed to this important debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. Slavery, slavery-like practices and people-trafficking are insidious crimes that fundamentally violate the human rights and indeed the very dignity of victims. Sadly, these crimes are not just past injustices relegated to the history books. Throughout the world exploitative practices, such as slavery, servitude and forced labour, continue to be a daily reality for millions of our fellow human beings. Regrettably, Australia is not immune. While we are fortunate that the number of people identified as victims of slavery and trafficking in Australia remains low, just one person affected by such egregious behaviour is one too many. This bill sends a strong message that Australia will not tolerate any form of slavery, trafficking or related coercive practices.


The purpose of this bill is to clarify and strengthen the operation of existing slavery and people-trafficking related offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The bill will target those who facilitate exploitation by harbouring victims and introduce stand-alone offences of forced labour and organ trafficking to ensure that these practices are comprehensively criminalised. The bill will criminalise the unaccepted practice of forced marriage, ensuring that it is absolutely clear that marriage must be entered into freely, without duress or constraint. 


The bill will also amend existing definitions in the Criminal Code to ensure that the broadest range of exploitative conduct is criminalised. It expands the definition of 'servitude' to non-sexual servitude to capture a broader range of exploitative behaviour. I want to make it absolutely clear that the intent of the government is not to in any way lessen the seriousness of sexual servitude by creating this broader offence but rather to ensure that all people in all industries are not subjected to the injustice of servitude.


I will now, if I may, turn to some specific comments that have been raised by senators in their contributions to this debate. First, the additional comments that have been made by the coalition speak of arguing for a distinction between real and apparent consent. The government in the strongest possible terms rejects the proposition that this distinction should exist. This is a proposition from the 1950s. One might very well retort, 'No does mean no and that consent must be full and free as it is found in our bill.' This in our judgement is an antiquated notion and the government firmly sticks to the wording that is proposed in the bill.


We note that Senator Brandis indicated in his remarks that the opposition would not support a strict liability element within the offence of being a party to a forced marriage. But we note that the Liberal Party not only supported a similar strict liability offence but, indeed, introduced it in 2005. Philip Ruddock introduced drug offences involving children in division 309 into the Criminal Code in the Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Act 2005. Senator Chris Ellison took this bill through the Senate. The application of strict liability to the physical element that a child was involved was part of the original Liberal Party's bill, so we note that Senator Brandis is arguing a point here that is in defiance of his own party's history and previous conduct. 


In her remarks, Senator Boyce made the point that a child being coerced into work early in the morning or late at night might be a form of slavery-like conditions. The government is of the view that the Liberal amendments would allow this very egregious act to happen. They will remove the concept of taking advantage of a person's vulnerability from the definition of coercion in the government's bill. They are also removing the concept of psychological oppression from the definition of coercion. The government cannot support this. Senator Boyce's own examples would not even be covered by the Liberal Party's changes and we urge her to look carefully at the amendments she is purporting to support and to reconsider her position.


I would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its report on the bill which was released in September of last year. The government notes the recommendations made in the committee's report. A key recommendation of the committee was for the explanatory memorandum to be amended to better articulate that slavery-like offences may occur within intimate relationships. In line with this recommendation, an addendum to the explanatory memorandum was tabled in the Senate on 9 October 2012. The addendum clarifies that the offences of servitude and forced labour can apply whether the exploitation occurred in the victim's public or private life including in the context of intimate relationships.


The development of this bill has been a collaborative process. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the non-government organisations, industry associations, legal bodies, academics and members of the public, all of whom have provided input into this bill and made a valuable contribution. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 will ensure that our laws criminalising slavery, slavery-like practices and people trafficking are as robust and effective as possible. 


The bill is also essential in ensuring that our law enforcement authorities are adequately equipped to investigate and prosecute these heinous crimes. The bill reflects the government's commitment to doing all it can to prevent the reprehensible practices of slavery and people trafficking in all forms. In conclusion, I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

The effect of opposition amendments (1), (2) and (3) would be to omit two of the subcategories from the definition of coercion in section 271A. At the moment, coercion is defined to include the following conduct: force, duress, detention, psychological oppression, abuse of power and taking advantage of a person's vulnerability. The effect of the opposition amendments would be to remove from the definition the categories psychological oppression and taking advantage of a person's vulnerability. 


And we do that for one very straightforward reason. The terms are vague, they are undefined, they are potentially without limit, and they do not refer to established legal categories or concepts with an established legal meaning. Force, duress and detention, and, arguably, abuse of power—although I must confess that is somewhat wide itself—do. In particular it is very difficult to imagine that conduct which constituted duress would not be psychologically oppressive given that the legal definition of duress established over more than centuries of case law involves the overbearing of the will of the person alleging the duress. It is very difficult, equally, to see how 'taking advantage of a person's vulnerability' would not already fall within the concept of abuse of power, because the whole point of abuse of power is that in the relationship between two people there is a disparity of power so that one is in a position to take advantage of the other.


I stress that this bill is largely uncontroversial. It has the opposition's support. But, equally, it is important when we write new categories into the law that we do not conflate legal definition with rhetoric. Much as one would wish to see in an act of parliament statements in the nature of exhortation about the evils of the practice which is prohibited, statements in the nature of exhortation have no place in the definitions of concepts. The definitions of concepts, particularly where those definitions—as I said a moment ago—rely upon well-established legal categories, are more safely left alone or, if they are sought to be extended, they ought to be extended in a way that is not merely rhetorical but has meaning and actually lends something, adds something, to the reach of the statute by expanding the definition in a certain and specific way.


There is, in my view, nothing in proposed subparagraph (d) of the definition—'psychological oppression'—or subparagraph (f) of the definition—'taking advantage of a person's vulnerability'—that is not already captured by the other four subcategories. So all we are doing is introducing new and vague concepts without making this law, which the coalition supports, more effective. That is bad legislative practice.


So for those reasons, and only for those reasons—that these words add nothing but flummery, as it were—the opposition moves the amendments I have foreshadowed that would leave the definition of coercion as conduct which includes force, duress, detention or abuse of power.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:17):  I begin by noting that the opposition are indeed supporting the bulk of this legislation. But of course, Senator Brandis, you will, I am sure, not be surprised to learn that the government is not supporting the amendments proposed by the opposition. Let me address myself to that and endeavour to change your mind.


Items (1) to (3) of the amendments proposed by the opposition would, as articulated by Senator Brandis, remove the concepts of 'psychological oppression' and 'taking advantage of a person's vulnerability' from the definition of coercion proposed by the bill. Under those proposed amendments, coercion would be defined to include only coercion by force, duress, detention or abuse of power. 


Items (4) and (5) of the opposition's proposed amendments would remove one of the two proposed offences of forced marriage contained in the bill—that is, the proposed offence of being a party to a forced marriage—and I think it is probably appropriate that I speak to that now as well. That offence would capture the conduct of a person who is a party to a forced marriage, other than the victim, but who did not necessarily cause the victim to enter into a forced marriage, unless they have a reasonable excuse. While the opposition's proposed amendments insert a note, following the proposed offence of causing a person to enter into a forced marriage, to make it clear that a person who is a party to the marriage would be captured, the effect of removing the offence of being a party to the forced marriage would mean that, in order to be guilty of an offence, a person who is not the victim to the forced marriage would have had to have caused the victim to enter into the marriage—that is, the opposition's proposed construction is much narrower.


The definition of coercion proposed by the bill is designed to bring Australia's legislative framework further into line with our obligations under the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children. Under article 3A of this protocol, 'trafficking in persons' is defined as:


… the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purposes of exploitation.


Investigations into slavery, slavery-like conditions and trafficking offences have revealed that the exploitation of many victims in Australia does not involve abduction or violence or even physical restraint. Rather, offenders often use subtle, non-physical means to obtain a victim's compliance such as psychological oppression or taking advantage of a person's vulnerability. It is in these circumstances that it has proved challenging to convince juries that the offender's conduct constitutes the offence. Accordingly, the government does not support the opposition's proposed amendments to the definition of coercion.


In relation to forced marriage offences, in the government's view it is important to retain the offence of being a party to a forced marriage, in addition to the offence of causing a person to enter into a forced marriage, in order to ensure that the entire range of inappropriate behaviour relating to forced marriage is captured and criminalised. If the opposition's amendments were to proceed, there may be circumstances where a party to a marriage, person A, is aware that the person they are marrying, person B, is being forced into the marriage, but are able to escape criminal liability simply because they did not engage in conduct that caused person B to enter into the marriage and therefore their actions did not meet the elements of the offence of causing a person to enter into a forced marriage. Although they did not cause person B to enter into the forced marriage, person A's conduct may nevertheless be significantly inappropriate and warrant criminal sanction. Importantly, as noted in that example, per proposed section 270.7B(4) of the bill, the defence of reasonable excuse would apply to person A.


In terms of the definition of coercion, the situation of many victims in Australia does not conform to the popular image of slavery, slavery-like practices and trafficking involving abduction, violence and physical restraint; rather, offenders often use subtle non-physical means to obtain a victim's compliance such as psychological oppression or taking advantage of a person's vulnerability. Law enforcement agencies have, as I have already indicated, reported difficulties in successfully prosecuting cases where the offenders have used subtle coercive conduct. The definition of coercion proposed by the government in this bill is intended to capture both physical and non-physical coercive conduct—therefore capturing the broadest range of exploitative behaviour. The definition of coercion proposed by the bill will also bring Australia's legislative framework further in line with our international obligations. I note with interest that, in her remarks, Senator Boyce gave examples of children being coerced into work early in the mornings or late at night. And I note that, under the opposition's amendments, this very act, this very sin that Senator Boyce points to, would not be covered, because you are removing concepts of taking advantage of a person's vulnerability. 


Lastly, the government asserts that it is important that both the forced marriage offences proposed in the bill are retained. The government is sending a clear message that forced marriage is a crime, that those who perpetuate a forced marriage will face serious penalties and that those penalties will be in line with the seriousness of their crime. For example, it would be inappropriate for an individual who knew that their spouse was a victim of a forced marriage and who entered into the marriage willingly to escape liability simply because they did not cause the victim to enter into the marriage. Importantly, the offence of being a party to a forced marriage has been carefully drafted to ensure that it only captures serious, abhorrent conduct. As such, a person will only be guilty of the offence of being a party to a forced marriage if they are not the victim and if they did not have a reasonable excuse for entering into the marriage themselves.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:24):  I want to stress again that Senator Feeney and the opposition are trying to achieve the same thing here; but those who may be listening to this broadcast who think that this is merely a verbal quibble should be reassured that it is a little more than that. The opposition support the bill but there are two respects in which we think the bill is badly drafted. I feel sorry for Senator Feeney, because he was reading out a script that no doubt was written for him by a junior officer of the Attorney-General's Department. And I have to say to you, Senator Feeney, with great respect, what you say is wrong—what you say is wrong in law. For you to be right—if we can deal with the definition question first; the definition of coercion—it would have to be the case that there were conduct which you say is criminalised by this act and which constitutes psychological oppression or taking advantage of a person's vulnerability which was not force, which was not duress as the courts have developed the meaning of that term over many, many years, which was not detention and which was not an abuse of power. One can well imagine that there may be psychologically oppressive conduct which was neither detention nor force. But how could there be psychologically oppressive conduct that was not an abuse of power? And, as I tried to point out in my remarks a little earlier, given that the courts have always considered duress or the essence of duress as being the overbearing of the will of a person in a weaker position by a person in a stronger position, how could it not be duress? 


So the point we make is that there is no conduct that would not be caught by the opposition's amendment. We are not excluding or lowering the threshold, as it were, by introducing the amendment. We are merely trying to make the definition of coercion sharper by removing the rhetorical language of no legal consequence. 


I seek your guidance, Madam Temporary Chairman. I have only moved the first set of opposition amendments that is to deal with coercion. Senator Feeney has addressed those and also anticipated the amendments I have not yet moved—which is fine. But I suspect the first set of opposition amendments should be put and then I will seek leave to move together the second set of opposition amendments, and I will address them at that time. 




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin

 (Victoria) (11:28):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 7333 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (after line 21), after the definition of servitude in section 270.1A, insert:



   sexual servitude has the meaning given by section 270.4A.


(2) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (after line 25), after paragraph (a) of the definition of slavery-like offence, insert:


   (aa) section 270.5A (sexual servitude offences);


(3) Schedule 1, item 12, page 6 (after line 9), after section 270.4, insert:




270.4A Definition of 
sexual servitude



(1) For the purposes of this Division, sexual servitude is the condition of a person who provides sexual services and who, because of the use of coercion, force or threats:


   (a) is not free to cease providing sexual services; or


   (b) is not free to leave the place or area where the sexual services are provided.


(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the coercion, force or threat is used against the victim or another person.


(3) The victim may be in a condition of servitude whether or not:


   (a) escape from the condition is practically possible for the victim; or


   (b) the victim has attempted to escape from the condition.


(4) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (after line 12), after section 270.5, insert:




270.5A


Sexual servitude offences



(1) A person:


   (a) whose conduct causes another person to enter into or remain in sexual servitude; and


   (b) who intends to cause, or is reckless as to causing, that sexual servitude;


is guilty of an offence.


Penalty:


   (c) in the case of an aggravated offence (see section 270.8)—imprisonment for 20 years; or


   (d) in any other case—imprisonment for 15 years.


(2) A person:


   (a) who conducts any business that involves the sexual servitude of other persons; and


   (b) who knows about, or is reckless as to, that sexual servitude;


is guilty of an offence.


Penalty:


   (c) in the case of an aggravated offence (see section 270.8)—imprisonment for 20 years; or


   (d) in any other case—imprisonment for 15 years.


(3) In this section:



   conducting a business includes:


   (a) taking any part in the management of the business; or


   (b) exercising control or direction over the business; or


(c) providing finance for the business.


Whilst I and the DLP support the bill, we have serious concerns, as I have said previously, about what we believe will be its unintended consequences. We believe that the amendment differentiates in the case of assault and sexual assault, harassment and sexual harassment. Why should there not be a clear differentiation between servitude and sexual servitude? I remind the Senate that sexual servitude is an extremely serious offence and deserves legislative recognition and that 70 per cent of human trafficking cases involve sexual servitude.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:29):  Can I begin by indicating on behalf of the government that we will not be supporting Senator Madigan's amendment. Given the increase in the number of the victims that have been identified in other industries, one of the primary purposes of the bill is to expand the application of the existing offences beyond the sex industry. As such, the bill removes the existing offences of sexual servitude and conducting a business involving sexual servitude, and replaces them with offences of servitude and conducting a business involving servitude.


The broader offences in the bill will continue to apply to a person who is exploited in the sex industry, but they will also be able to be utilised by law enforcement authorities who are investigating instances of exploitation in other industries. We also note that the penalties outlined in Senator Madigan's proposed amendments are the same as those proposed for the broader offence in the bill. We also note that Senator Madigan's proposal does not aim to retain or reinsert the existing offence of deceptive recruiting for sexual services, which will be similarly broadened by the bill to an offence of deceptive recruiting applicable regardless of industry.


In addition, we note that proposed subsection 270.4A(2) of Senator Madigan's proposed definition of sexual servitude refers to 'coercion, force or threat' being used against a victim to gain their compliance, which is inconsistent with the remainder of the bill, which seeks to implement the broader concept of coercion, threat or deception. As the proposed amendments to the bill would not have any practical effect, our view is that there is not any policy justification for accepting the senator's amendments, which, in the government's view, would add unnecessary length and complexity to the statute book.


Given the increase in the number of victims that have been identified in industries other than the sex industry—such as hospitality, to name but one—one of the primary purposes of this bill is to expand the application of the existing offences beyond the sex industry. This is especially important in order to ensure that investigators and prosecutors have the most appropriate range of offences available to them where the circumstances of a matter do not amount to slavery, but nonetheless demonstrate significant inappropriate conduct. As such, the bill removes the existing offences of sexual servitude and conducting a business involving sexual servitude, and replaces them with offences of servitude and conducting a business involving servitude. The broader offences in the bill will continue to apply to a person who is exploited in the sex industry, but, as I have said, are also able to be used by law enforcement authorities regarding instances of exploitation in other industries.


As sexual servitude is already covered by the bill, we believe that the senator's amendment does not add anything to the government's legislation, and, as I have already indicated, the government will not be supporting the amendment.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:32):  Thank you, Madam Acting Chairman. I completely understand what Senator Madigan is trying to achieve and I am entirely in sympathy with it. I have spoken to Senator Madigan about it, however, like the government, we simply cannot see that what Senator Madigan seeks to achieve by his amendment would not already be dealt with by the existing section 270.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. I have engaged Senator Madigan; I have sought to see how it is that he feels that the existing provisions of the Commonwealth criminal law do not already cover that which he seeks to achieve by his amendment. I must say, I am at a loss to see how it is that this amendment does not address an issue that is already part of the law, so for that reason the opposition, respectfully, will not be supporting it.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin
):  The question is that amendments (1) to (4) moved by Senator Madigan on sheet 7333 be agreed to.


Question negatived.




Senator BRANDIS:
  by leave—I move opposition amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 7339 together:


(4) Schedule 1, item 12, page 10 (line 21), omit the heading to subsection 270.7B(2).


(5) Schedule 1, item 12, page 10 (line 22) to page 11 (line 4), omit subsections 270.7B(2), (3) and (4), substitute:


Note: For the avoidance of doubt, an individual may commit an offence if the person is a party to the marriage.


This is not an issue of definition; this is an issue of the substance of an offence. It is the proposed section 270.7B that would be added to the Commonwealth Criminal Code by this legislation. This is the provision that creates the offence of forced marriage, and let me take you through it. By proposed subsection (1), an offence is created where a person engages in conduct that causes another person to enter into a forced marriage as the victim of the forced marriage. That is the significant provision of the proposed section 270.7B, and the opposition supports it.


Our amendment would omit subsections (2), (3) and (4). Subsection (2) is a curious provision, which provides that a person commits an offence if they are a party to the marriage, the marriage is a forced marriage, and the person concerned is not a victim of the forced marriage. So, it provides that the spouse of a victim of a forced marriage commits an offence. I will come back to it.


Subsection (3) imposes strict liability in relation to that, and subsection (4) applies an exclusion so that subsection (2) does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse. We propose the omission of subsection (2)—that is, the offence of being a party to a forced marriage—for a very simple reason: that if a person is a party to or the other party of a forced marriage then it is very difficult to conceive of a set of circumstances in which they are not already in breach of the principal offence—that is, the offence created by subsection (1). It would be extremely difficult to imagine that a person who enters into a forced marriage is not a part of the conduct which causes the innocent victim to be in the forced marriage. So, in our view, subsection (2) is entirely unnecessary. We propose as well the insertion of a note to subsection (1), which would provide:


For the avoidance of doubt, an individual may commit an offence if the person is a party to the marriage.


So, if there were any residual reason to believe that this provision is necessary to fill what might be thought to be an unintended lacuna in subsection (1), then that is removed by the insertion of the clarifying note that we propose to be inserted at the end of subsection (1). As well, I should point out that there are no circumstances I can conceive of in which the existing accessorial liability—that is, the provisions of part 2.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code—would not apply to extend the liability for the offence created by subsection (1) to a person who is a non-innocent party to a forced marriage. 


On the other hand, let us suppose that I am wrong about that. It is almost inconceivable that this could happen, but let us suppose there is a case where a husband, let us say, engages in a marriage ceremony with a woman and he is genuinely and innocently unaware that she, because of, let us say, duress on the part of her parents, is not a willing party to the marriage. Now, as I say, it is very difficult to imagine in a practical sense how that could ever be. But let us say that the other party to the forced marriage was entirely unaware of and innocent of any of the coercion of his proposed spouse. Well, if the person were entirely ignorant of, unaware of, innocent of, any coercion of his proposed spouse, then how has he committed a crime? Where is the fault element? It is a terrible situation, of course, for the victim, but the person who has done the wrong is the person or people who are doing the coercion.


The reason, I suspect, that we have subsection (3), which imposes strict liability on the other party to a forced marriage, is that that is the only set of circumstances in which it is even theoretically possible that a party to a forced marriage could be caught by subsection (2) but not by subsection (1). And, if a person who is party to a forced marriage is completely unaware, completely innocent, completely ignorant, of the coercive circumstances, how have they committed a crime? If they are not unaware, if they are not ignorant, if they are not innocent of the coercion, then they have already committed the crime provided for by subsection (1). We should be very, very slow to impose strict liability for criminal offences but particularly in circumstances like these, where, if you analyse the provision, the requirement of strict liability is being sought to be invoked because the proposed offence could only theoretically apply when the person against whom the criminal conduct is alleged has done nothing wrong. Others have, but he has not.


Subsection (4) is merely confusing, because, having said that subsection (2) imposes strict liability, subsection (4) says it does not apply 'if a person has a reasonable excuse'. Now, this is a preposterously confused piece of legislative drafting. On the one hand, you have a conduct criminalised, where the person is innocent of any culpability, by the imposition of strict liability upon them; and then, in the very next subsection, the provision says, 'But if you have a reasonable excuse it doesn't apply to you.' So it is preposterous; it is confused. And, as I say, if a person who is involved in coercive conduct to bring about a false marriage, whether as the other party to the marriage, as a parent, as an employer or as a person who stands in any other relationship to the victim, that conduct would always be caught by subsection (1), the principal offence created provision, which the opposition supports.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:44):  I might deal more broadly with a couple of issues as we work through this, particularly forced marriage and the definition of 'coercion', which—




Senator Brandis:
  We've done that.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin
):  We have dealt with that. We are just dealing with opposition amendments (4) and (5) in relation to forced marriage.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I will be brief then. The nub of the argument seems to centre on, as I understand Senator Brandis's view, whether or not the person—person A, not the victim—knew. As I understand the way the clause reads, the spouse knew it was a forced marriage, and so the knowledge, in fact, could be present. But in this instance—at clause 270.7B(1)(b)—the focus is on the conduct which causes another person to enter into a forced marriage as the victim of the marriage.


It is not a question of knowledge but of cause. A spouse may know that it was a forced marriage, but did not cause it to be a forced marriage. That is in contemplation, and you could envisage circumstances where person A did know that it was a forced marriage and they did not cause it to be a forced marriage, but nonetheless they did acquiesce to the marriage. So someone else—be they a person interested in the marriage happening—caused the victim in this instance to enter the marriage, whilst the person A, who was not the victim, did not cause it to occur and may also have known about it.


On that basis I could imagine an argument around knowledge, but in this instance the reason we are putting is that you could look at either conspiracy or aiding and abetting offences. I am not sure they would go far enough in this instance to capture person A. We are trying to put beyond doubt circumstances which allow the AFP to prosecute successfully where there are those subtle coercive events that occur that create the offence.


In terms of the issue around the second part—dealing with the knowledge element—which I just came in and picked up, so forgive me if I am wrong about this: these are not unsurprising provisions. I go back to the Criminal Code itself—particularly around division 309, which contains a number of drug offences involving children. In those offences strict liability applies to the physical element in each offence where the individual is a child. This means that the prosecution would need to prove that the individual was a child, but not that the defendant knew this. Again, the defence of mistake of fact would be available to the defendant.


There are circumstances where these have been used before, particularly those issues around drug offences and, if my memory serves me right, also in respect of issues around the Child Sex Tourism Bill—I think it is one that you spoke on in 2010, Senator Brandis. I think this issue was included within it and not raised in it. They might be materially different in your view in this circumstance, but the offence and the shifting of the burden were the same, and the use of the defences were also very similar in that bill.


So these are matters that you could now confidently say that both the opposition, when they were in government, and this government, have used in legislation to ensure that we do provide our law enforcement agencies with effective legislation to deal with a range of circumstances—particularly those types of heinous crimes, and including these ones as well. If that has not covered all of it, then please let me—

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:49):  On the last point that Senator Ludwig makes, I am prepared to accept his assurance that there has been legislation passed by previous non-Labor governments or supported by the non-Labor side of politics in years gone by, which have contained in different contexts somewhat similar group liability provisions.


Senator Ludwig can I say to you, with awful candour, that I do not say that everything the opposition has ever done has been perfect. I do not say that everything that the coalition has done in government, or even said in opposition, has been perfect. There is no argument, with respect Senator Ludwig—and I see by your cherubic smile that you agree with me, or seem to agree with me—to say that because this mistake was made in the past it should be perpetuated again in the present. Or this error of judgement; if not mistake, this error of judgement—this error of legislative drafting judgement.


Coming to the substance of the issue: Senator Ludwig contends that the reason proposed subsection 2 of section 270.7B should remain in the bill is because it may operate in circumstances in which the other party to a forced marriage was aware of the coercion, but was not a participant in the coercion. That effectively is what Senator Ludwig is saying: that that person is the non-innocent party and is aware of the coercion, but was not causative of or instrumental in the coercion. Senator Ludwig I have to say to you with respect, particularly when it comes to the fulfilment of a ceremony of marriage, and especially in view of the breadth of the definition of coercion, it is very difficult to see how a person who goes to the altar or goes before a marriage celebrant knowing the other person has been coerced into being present nevertheless persists with the ceremony and says, 'I do'. It is almost inconceivable that they would not be regarded as thereby a party to, or at least an accessory to, the coercion; and therefore caught by, as I said in my remarks a little while ago, part 2.4—that is, the accessories provision of the existing Criminal Code. So I adhere to my view that the example you posit would be caught by the principal offence-creating provision, subsection1.


But what you have not addressed, Senator Ludwig, is this: you have said, 'Well, there might be a circumstance in which there is knowledge on the part of the other person who is to undertake the marriage ceremony that the putative spouse has been coerced'; but subsection 2 does not work on knowledge. Knowledge is not an element of subsection 2. The elements of subsection 2 are: the fact that the person is a party to a forced marriage, so subsection 2 depends upon the subsection 1 requirements having been established to show that it is a forced marriage and that they are not the victim—in other words, they are the other party. Knowledge of the circumstances of coercion—knowledge of the fact that it is a forced marriage—is not an element of the offence; which of course means that it not only would capture people in the circumstances that you posit, who as I say in my view would in any event have committed the principal offence, but it also captures people who were not aware of the coercion. The very, very unusual, but I suppose theoretically possible, circumstance of a party to a proposed marriage going through the ceremony unaware that his or her proposed spouse had been the victim of coercion does not depend on knowledge.


So you have not answered the question, with respect, Senator Ludwig, of why it is that somebody in that situation should be held to have committed a crime when, in the absence of knowledge of the wrongful conduct of the coercion, they have done nothing wrong. They, in a sense, are themselves a victim, not a wrongdoer. And the legislation, as I pointed out before, seems to implicitly concede that by saying, 'Well, the only way we can get you is by imposing strict liability'—because we do not absent the unusual requirement of strict liability, say to somebody who was completely innocent of the circumstances of wrongdoing, 'You have committed a crime.' So, Senator Ludwig, I hear what you say but the opposition is entirely unpersuaded by your arguments.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:56):  May I have one last valiant attempt, then, to persuade you? The way the construction of the forced marriage defences work is that strict liability applies only to the one element of the offence, which is being party to a forced marriage. We have established that. The element is that the person charged with the offence was not themselves a victim of the forced marriage; call that Person A. The use of strict liability means the prosecution—you would be more familiar with this than I am—must prove that the person charged was not a victim but does not need to prove any fault element for this physical element of the offence. Therefore strict liability has been applied to this element to avoid prosecution being required to prove that the defendant knew—and this is the point, even if they did not know—or was reckless about the fact that he or she was not the victim of the forced marriage. The issue which surrounds the knowledge element is that Person A may have been recklessly indifferent to others who caused A and B to wed.


In any event, if Person A did know that someone was causing the marriage, then the legislation seeks to capture their consent to the marriage on the basis that they are aware, or at least recklessly indifferent to, the fact that someone has caused the marriage—in other words a forced marriage in this instance. I would have thought, as you would think, that if you were aware or were recklessly indifferent to the fact and consented to a marriage where you knew there were others who had caused the marriage to occur through circumstances, that you would not go ahead with it. I certainly would not go ahead with it and I am confident that anyone in the opposition or on this side of politics would not go ahead with it, but in some circumstances it certainly appears to have happened.


On that basis I think they are culpable by acquiescing and going ahead with that marriage. Strict liability has been applied only to this element to avoid the prosecution being required to prove the defendant knew or was reckless about it. It is only that one element, and this is a question of fact. It would not be appropriate to require the prosecution to demonstrate the defendant was aware of a substantial risk—that they are not a victim. It would be very difficult to obtain evidence showing the defendant's state of mind, particularly in that circumstance, and the effectiveness of the offence would be undermined if the prosecution was required to prove just that one element. The prosecution would still, though, be required to prove that the person charged intended to be a party to the marriage and was reckless about whether it was a forced marriage. So it would still be a requirement—in other words, the onus would not shift—in this instance where the prosecution would still be required to prove that the person charged intended to be a party to the marriage and was reckless about whether it was a forced marriage. That is my best shot. If we do not agree we should get on with it.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:59):  I know Senator Fawcett has another point to make. We have exchanged our views, but let me simply make the point to you, Senator Ludwig, that all that proposed subsection 2(c)—that is, the words:


(c) the person is not a victim of the forced marriage.


could possibly mean is that they were not the person coerced; they were not the person who was the victim of the unlawful conduct. But one would still have to prove, as is clear from subsection (a), that there was a victim—that coercive conduct or constituting a forced marriage occurred. So it is not as if this issue, on which the prosecution of course bears the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, is not going to have to be dealt with by the court in any event. 


Anyway, I will not prolong it, Senator Ludwig. I simply restate the opposition's very clear view that none of the circumstances that you have posited, where there is any form of moral culpability on behalf of the nonvictim, would not be caught by subsection 1, and in the unusual theoretical circumstances in which they would be missed by subsection 1, then under no circumstances would the other party to the marriage have done anything wrong.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (12:01): Minister, I draw your attention to two points. Firstly, to the issue of the strict liability being applied to the party, who in this case would normally be the groom, the position you have taken, which is that he would be guilty because he probably would have knowledge, is very much the world view of the majority of Australians—that arranged marriages, hence forced marriages, are not the norm and therefore there could be some suspicion. But most of the circumstances that have been reported in Australia are where young women have been taken to another country where arranged marriages are quite often the cultural norm and where two willing participants may be commonplace. So it is well within the bounds of reason that somebody there may have no knowledge nor even suspicion that there has been coercion and forcing of the person—in this case the woman from Australia. So in regard to the oft quoted Edmund Burke who says that all it takes for evil to flourish is for a good man to do nothing, I concur that if there was knowledge by participating in the marriage that person would then commit an offence. But given the cultural norms in many of these countries it is quite conceivable that the other person is viewing this purely as an arranged marriage. So I have a concern that we would be making that person a criminal under Australian law when in actual fact they may have committed no crime.


My second point, and probably the one I am more concerned about, is the government's placing of strict liability on the other party. I ask you, Minister: who has done the greater harm to the victim, the other party or, as evidenced in the majority of the cases reported in the Australian media and brought before Australian authorities, the caregivers and, I believe, shockingly, the parents? It is they who have coerced or in some cases resorted to physical violence and imprisonment of their children in order to force them into the marriage. Surely they are the ones in the vast majority of reported cases who have inflicted the greater harm. So I wonder if you could explain to the Senate why the government has sought to put a strict liability on the groom—or, the other party—who may, because of cultural reasons, be quite innocent, and yet those who have actually inflicted the greater harm are not subject to a strict liability.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:04):  I can be short on this. The strict liability offence only applies to where the person is the victim, so you would still have—




Senator BRANDIS:
  No, the nonvictim.




Senator LUDWIG:
  The nonvictim, I should say. So you would still have it for those using your term—I am not sure I like the term—who cause person A and person B to marry. There are still provisions here, quite strong, to allow the prosecutions to occur. I am sure you are not advocating for a strict liability in those circumstances. I am not being facetious—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator LUDWIG:
  No, that is why I am pointing that out. Thank you, Senator Brandis. So on that basis the legislation is quite clear about where the strict liability applies and in only those circumstances and in only that very narrow one element of circumstance, not more broadly, and the legislation does encapsulate the broader issue around those people who may cause another person to enter into a forced marriage.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:06):  I think the problem with that answer, if I may say so, with respect, is that, although as you said before the strict liability merely applies to proposed subsection 2(c) so that the prosecution is relieved of the obligation to prove the person is not a victim of a forced marriage, it does not apply to subsection 2(a) or 2(b), which does require the prosecution to prove the character of the other party to the marriage and that the marriage was a forced marriage. In other words, to prove that which subsection 1, the principal offence-creating provision, establishes as the elements of the offence. So those who think that some burden has been lifted from the prosecution's shoulders by creating, as it were, a statutory presumption in relation to the one issue in subsection (2)(c), really, with respect to them, missed the point, because that issue is nevertheless—albeit from a different aspect of the case—still before the court. It still has to be proved by the prosecution and it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  A little earlier in the week I commenced my second reading debate contribution and spoke, I think, for all of 37 seconds about this important legislation—the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. I was about to mention that the bill reinforces the key values of fairness, equity under the law and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.


Slavery still exists. It is not a relic of the past. This bill takes head-on three modern manifestations of slavery—forced marriage, forced labour and organ trafficking—and it does so in accordance with Australia's international legal obligations. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Australia is obligated to take steps to fully realise rights recognised in these treaties, including marriage with the free consent of both spouses.


Forced marriage should not be confused with arranged marriage or religious custom. Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism require full and free consent to marriage. In an arranged marriage families usually play a significant role in promoting the idea of marriage to the bride and groom but spouses do have the right to refuse the arrangement. The International Family Law journal suggested in 2004 that many victims of forced marriage suffer tremendously. Cases have included emotional and physical abuse, abduction and kidnapping, genital mutilation, rape, enforced pregnancy, abortion and even murder.


This bill creates a new offence for forced marriages. While it may be argued that the broad definition of 'slavery' as found by the High Court in The Queen v Wei Tang allows prosecution under the existing Criminal Code, the government has chosen to codify the crime, leaving no room for uncertainty at common law. Proposed new section 270.7A provides a definition of 'forced marriage'. This expanded definition will allow for prosecution of servile relationships which are not legally recognised as marriage in Australia. Proposed new section 270.7B inserts two new forced marriage offences. One subsection will be used in the prosecution of those who are a party to the marriage. The other subsection allows for the prosecution of third parties who either use force or coercion to foster such a marriage or are reckless to the fact that the marriage is forced.


While many consider the face of 21st-century slavery to be forced prostitution, a recent discussion paper from the Attorney-General's Department noted that slavery also exists in industries such as hospitality, construction, and agriculture, as well as in domestic situations. One recent example of this was a horrific case in the Blue Mountains in NSW where a restaurateur was prosecuted after promising a better life to an Indian national. After his arrival in Sydney, this individual's travel documents were seized and he was forced to work hours on end without pay as a kitchen hand, accommodated only in a backyard tin shed.


This bill broadens the definitions and offences which were previously associated with sexual servitude and creates a number of new sections which will apply more generally to all forms of servitude and all forms of forced labour. The definition of sexual servitude is replaced with a definition of servitude. Also replaced is the offence of sexual servitude with a broader offence of servitude. The elements of the new offence are: causing a person to enter or remain in servitude, or conducting a business involving servitude.


The bill creates a continuum of offences, from forced labour where physical restraint is not proved, to servitude where ownership is not proved, to slavery. The bill allows for an alternative verdict for forced labour if servitude is not proved beyond reasonable doubt provided the accused is accorded procedural fairness with respect to the alternate crime.


The third arm of this bill relates to organ trafficking. Australia is obliged under the trafficking protocol to criminalise organ trafficking. This bill inserts seven new offences into the Criminal Code relating to organ trafficking based on two subdivisions: organ trafficking and harbouring a victim. The offences are designed to criminalise every element of organ trafficking. For example, the harbouring offence only requires the prosecution to prove recklessness in harbouring, receiving or concealing a victim. Factors which will trigger the aggravated offence—carrying a larger penalty—are: if the victim is under 18; if the victim is subject to cruel punishment; or if in the conduct of organ trafficking the victim or another person dies or suffers serious harm. The aggravated offence of harbouring will be triggered if the victim is under 18.


It is now 189 years since slavery was abolished in the British Empire This decision had effect in the colony of New South Wales in 1824. It is 147 years since the 13th amendment of the US Constitution banned slavery. It is 125 years since slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888. Nevertheless, this bill recognises that slavery remains a reality today. This bill will ensure more investigations, simpler trials and swifter convictions for those involved in such appalling exploitation and denial of liberty, and I support this bill.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (09:41):  I also rise to address the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As Senator Faulkner has just indicated, it is some hundreds of years, over 200 years in fact, since Wilberforce in 1807 brought the Slave Trade Act into the British parliament, and in 1837 the abolition of slavery. So many people when they look at films about slavery, like Lincoln with Daniel Day-Lewis who won the Oscar, tend to think about it as a thing in the past. 


But it is not. For many people around the world their basic freedoms, their liberties and their individual rights are being abused. The exploitation involved, normally in the form of people trafficking, can take a wide range of forms including sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, organ harvesting, as well as sexual or domestic servitude and including forced marriage. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that victims were trafficked from a wide range of countries, over 127 countries, and there were more than 130 places around the world where they were exploited. All of this looks at trafficking for people for forced labour or sex but it does not actually include things like forced marriage or forced adoptions, so there is quite a broad range of people.


It is difficult to determine the extent of it in Australia. There are discrepancies between the estimates of government and non-government operations, but the Australian Federal Police have undertaken 305 investigations around people-trafficking offences between 2004 and 2011. As of June 2011, 184 victims had been referred to Australia's Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program, which indicates that it is an issue here in Australia and not just in other parts of the world.


It is interesting to see that the people who are quite active around the world and here in Australia are groups such as World Vision and groups within the Catholic Church and other churches. It is a timely reminder that, for all the bad press that churches receive at times, when it comes to standing up for people's freedoms and their rights it is often people who are motivated by their faith who are actually taking steps and going out of their way to stand up for and to support people. Wilberforce was one of the earliest examples in this particular area, but I commend organisations such as World Vision for their extensive work and their campaigns of not trading lives.


It is an issue, though, in Australia. In South Australia recently we have had bills looking at things like decriminalising prostitution. Evidence has come from the University of Melbourne, for example, talking about the existence of trafficked prostitutes in Asia working in South Australia's illegal brothels and that decriminalisation would make the problem even worse. So there is evidence that this is not something that is just overseas, that is just in someone else's backyard. This occurs in our backyard and it affects our communities, so it is appropriate that this parliament does something about it. We need to support the work of organisations such as World Vision and Rahab, which was started by young women who reach out to and care for the women who are caught up in the sex industry, often having been trafficked, in places like South Australia.


It is also the case that whilst we tend to think of forced marriage as being something that perhaps happens in other countries, it does happen here in Australia. There have been a number of newspaper articles over the last few years highlighting the cases of young women who have sought the protection of the Australian Federal Police and others to stop them being sent from this country by their parents to end up in a marriage that they were not willing to be part of. The Australian Embassy in Lebanon, for example, handled around 12 forced marriage cases involving girls as young as 14, with claims that they were raped and kidnapped, back in 2005. So whilst the size of the problem is not definitely known, we do know that it is a problem.


This bill seeks to codify, for the first time, some of these offences so that we are making a very clear statement that what may be culturally acceptable in some countries is not acceptable here in Australia; that it is not only against our values and the freedoms and rights of individuals but, if those are not being respected, we will make it against the law so people realise what is expected if they live here in Australia. The objective of the bill is to strengthen and expand the capability of investigators and prosecutors to combat people-trafficking and slavery, in particular for the purposes of labour exploitation, and to facilitate the prosecution of these offences.


Specifically, the bill introduces new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a victim and organ trafficking and makes a number of consequential amendments. It ensures that the slavery offence applies to conduct which renders a person a slave, as well as conduct involving a person who is already a slave. It extends the application of the existing offences of deceptive recruiting and sexual servitude so that they apply to non-sexual servitude and all forms of deceptive recruiting. It increases the penalties applicable to the existing debt bondage offences to ensure they adequately reflect the relative seriousness of the offences, and again there are some consequential amendments. I will come back to that point later because I have some concerns that some of the priorities in terms of the potential sentences do not reflect correctly the relative seriousness of the offences.


The bill also broadens the definition of exploitation under the code to include a range of slavery-like practices and it amends existing definitions in the code to capture more subtle forms of coercion, including psychological oppression and the abuse of power or a person's vulnerability. It clarifies the phrase that 'omission to perform an act that by law there is a duty to perform', in subsection 4.3(b) of the code, encompasses not only those duties imposed under Commonwealth law but also imposed under a state or territory law or at common law.


The coalition does have some concerns with the bill, and coalition senators made additional comments in the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee which looked into this crimes legislation amendment bill. One of the concerns is around the very broad definition of coercion. The explanatory memorandum explicitly says the term has been drafted to be broad and non-exhaustive in order to supplement the existing framework and 'ensure the broadest possible range of exploitative behaviour is captured and criminalised'. But the failure to actually define what coercion means leaves open the possibility that a broad range of relationships in which power is unequal might be characterised as coercive. There are also some concerns around the strict liability provisions, and the coalition will be putting forward some amendments in that regard.


I would like to come to some specific issues that I have noted in both the information surrounding the bill and specific clauses. One specific issue I thought was worthy of note when I was researching the background for this speech and looking at the inquiry in South Australia is that evidence from a Melbourne university in relation to the South Australian bill looked at alternative models of legislation. I think it is worthwhile for this parliament to also consider alternative approaches to reducing the demand for services that create the market for people to traffic.


The Nordic model was discussed during evidence provided to the South Australian parliament. Under the model that was first adopted in Sweden, the clients of prostitutes commit an offence punishable with fines or even custodial sentences, while the prostitutes themselves are considered to have committed no offence. The evidence presented indicates that it seems to have been effective as there is now no known trafficking in Sweden. There are a small number of women, perhaps as few as 600, involved in prostitution now in Sweden, compared to Australia, where the industry believes there are some 17,000. There are no brothels and street prostitution is almost gone. Clearly, having a different approach and making the consumer of the service liable, as opposed to the provider, is a way to protect people who are often victims of life circumstances that force them into that line of work. By not making their conduct illegal but making the conduct of the client illegal, it seems to be effective.


I believe it is appropriate that this parliament should take note of some of those kinds of initiatives to make sure that we balance cracking down on these sorts of behaviours and these sorts of industries that exploit people with protecting the people who are exploited. I would particularly like to come to this concept of relative offences. Clause 270.7 talks about deceptive recruiting for labour or services. The penalty in the case of an aggravated offence is imprisonment for nine years or, in any other case, imprisonment for seven years. We heard Senator Faulkner talk before about the person who had been brought from the Indian subcontinent to Australia and who ended up essentially being made to work as a slave, living in a tin shed. That was deceptive recruiting, which led to slave-like practices. I completely accept that that is not appropriate. But if we move on to 270.7A, which looks at forced marriage, we find that in the case of an aggravated offence for forced marriage the imprisonment is seven years or, in any other case, the imprisonment is only four years. The relativity of that is, I believe, inappropriate. 


Let us look at some of the newspaper articles, and I go particularly to an article in the Australian in February of last year. It talks about a centre in Western Sydney where there is a lady who runs a support service for young women who have been caught up in forced marriage or who have had pressure from family around that. She talks about the fact that this is very common in Australia, that it is deliberately hidden by community and religious leaders and that it co-exists with family violence and the subjugation of women. The article talks about the fact that legal aid lawyers have told the courts that, in a number of cases, girls are subjected to violence or threats of violence, including being dragged around by the hair, hit when they refuse the marriage that has been planned for them, taken out of school, locked in their bedrooms until they agree to go through the ceremony, or psychologically pressured by being told that their female relatives will be kidnapped and raped if they continue to resist the plans that have been made for them. In the worst case recorded, workers in the Migrant Resource Centre in Tasmania told authorities there that local families were exchanging dowries before girls were even 14, and that they have a case of a girl's family in Australia who pinned her down while her new husband raped her to seal the deal. How can that be a lesser offence in terms of the penalties than the deceptive recruiting? In terms of the standards that Australia maintains for the respect of individuals, this legislation should be sending the message that that kind of behaviour is inappropriate, that it is unacceptable and that it will be punished to the full extent of the law. 


I also have some concerns as to the same section around strict liability. Clause 270.7B(2)(c) talks about the person who is not a victim of a forced marriage having committed an offence and says that strict liability applies to that person. What that means is that, in this case, if there is a young woman, a young girl who is 13 or 14 years old, who is forced by her parents to take part in a marriage, there is a strict liability upon the groom, whether that person is 18 or 48 or whatever age, to prove his innocence. Firstly, that is a fundamental change in the assumption of innocence that we normally have here, in Australia. Secondly, as we have seen in many of these cases, that person is in another country and, yes, he may be a party to the marriage, but the one who is actually guilty of forcing the marriage, who is guilty of the psychological or physical oppression, is not the groom; in many cases, it is the parents. If there is going to be strict liability then, surely, it would be on the people who have actually caused the physical or psychological harm, the people who have exerted influence and control over the young woman as opposed to the person who is the other party in what some would see as an arranged marriage. Clearly, for someone who is underage in Australia, those who are guilty of making this a forced marriage are the caregivers, which, unfortunately and unthinkably from our world view here in Australia, appear to be the parents. So I have a concern with the concept of strict liability in the first place of reversing that onus of proof, but I am particularly concerned that it may be applied against the wrong party. I believe it is something that needs to be considered in this bill. 


Having said that, I do support the bill for all the reasons I have stated. It is long since Abraham Lincoln and long since William Wilberforce, and so you would like to think that our world has moved on; but, clearly, it has not. I believe it is important to recognise that many of the practices we are talking about, particularly around forced marriages, come from cultures other than that which is considered mainstream in Australia. The citizenship pledge which people take when they come to this country says in its preamble that it is important for all Australian citizens to understand their responsibilities. It also talks about what it means to be a citizen, whether Australian by birth or by choice. It is a critical part of building our nation. People are required to make the Australian Citizenship Pledge at citizenship ceremonies and, in doing so, they are making a public commitment to Australia and to accepting the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. The pledge says:


From this time forward, under God— 


if you take the oath— 


I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.


So the strength of this piece of legislation is in the fact that it is saying that, in Australia, we do believe in democracy. We do believe that individuals have rights and liberties. We have extended a welcome hand to people to come and be part of this country, but if they will not respect the rights and liberties of all citizens, including their own children, then this parliament representing the people of Australia will make laws that highlight the standards that we expect in terms of upholding those rights and liberties.


The people who come to this country are welcome and expected, under this pledge, to share our democratic beliefs, to respect rights and liberties, and to uphold the law. I plead with them to leave behind those things that are not compatible with the expectations of this country, which they have chosen to make their new home in, in the interests of their dependants, their families and this community, so that we can build a strong, cohesive community as one people living in one nation under one law.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (10:00):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate about the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. We heard this morning that William Wilberforce introduced the bills to the British parliament 200 years ago to abolish slavery, and that over 80 years ago slavery was declared internationally illegal by the League of Nations. One would think that that was the end of it, but we know that there are an estimated 27 million slaves in the world—and that is at least twice the number of slaves that existed in the Roman Empire.


It is particularly disturbing for us in Australia because so many of the world's slaves—roughly 20 million to 22 million of them—are actually found in our region. Many of these people have been born into slavery, or have been enslaved close to home in a factory or on a farm, in a quarry or in a mine, in a restaurant or in hotels. A smaller number are caught in trafficking rackets, and we do not even know how many are subject to forms of slavery that occur in war and conflict or in systems of slavery such as child trading or forced marriage. We do have some numbers, and they are very depressing. There are an estimated 15 million bonded labourers in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal who are all slaves to their masters and have no rights. We have an estimated 2.4 million people trafficked each year and many, as we have heard this morning, are trapped sex workers.


Then there are the child soldiers. That is the story that really hits home. An estimated 40,000 children are captives in Uganda—40,000 children who have lost their childhood. It is an evil trade. We know that. Enslaved people across the world are deliberately harvested from groups, or from classes of people who have been excluded or marginalised, or set aside on the basis of their gender or race, their disability, their religion or their caste, and who are excluded from the benefits of the economic system, the social system, from systems for conflict management and, of course, from the justice system.


The government is committed to both a strong criminal justice response to, and protection for, victims of trafficking and slavery. It is an absolute violation of human rights, and it is not enough for us to simply express our moral outrage. We must act to redress it. As the Australian Human Rights Commission reminds us: every person has equal rights, just by being born human. We know that we have a responsibility to ensure that enslaved people are not excluded from the legal system, that their rights are recognised, and that those who take these rights away are guilty of crime. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012—a mouthful in itself—is designed to bring Australian laws into harmony with our obligations under antislavery conventions that we ratified in 1927 and 1958 in an attempt to ensure that our laws are comprehensive and apply to the current situation we face both here in Australia and in our region.


I am a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights which has the task of assessing the compatibility of all proposed legislation with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. In considering this bill, the committee has been thinking about what it means to be owned and thinking about the big questions. What is bondage in the modern world? Why is it slavery? Where does trafficking fit in the big picture of slavery, and above all, how can we stop it happening? In considering that process, I found the book Australians and Modern Slavery by Roscoe Howell to be very helpful, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone concerned with this human rights issue. It is an analysis of how Australia relates to each of the 11 forms of modern slavery and, frankly, it is quite eye opening. It brings to the fore behaviours that we do not often think about and which can easily be left in the too-hard basket and behaviours that, as we have heard, are happening in our own country as well as in our region.


Sometimes people in this country are married too young or they are trapped into a forced marriage, and this occurs under systems of belief where women are regarded as property, subordinate, or with identity regarded not as personal but as familial. It happens today in cultures and communities that are established in Australia or are coming to Australia. Cultural ceremonies are taking place here where women, and men and families, believe that they are subject to cultural practices and that cultural rules are paramount. What this legislation does is make it known and make it clear that the rule of law is paramount in Australia. We all have to be ready to adapt to changing circumstances so, of course, the time is right to reassess the laws relating to slavery, slavery-like conditions and people trafficking, when millions of people every year are being exploited by others for financial gain.


It is important that we amend the earlier legislation, the Crimes Act 1914, the Migration Act 1958, the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002, to establish the new offences. Senator Faulkner went through each of those offences in turn. They are offences of forced labour, forced marriage, organ trafficking and harbouring a victim.


This bill will do all that. It will also modify the scope and application of existing offences such as slavery, deceptive recruiting, sexual servitude and trafficking in persons, and increase the penalty for an offence of debt bondage—and debt bondage is something that we are hearing much more about. 


There has been extensive consultation on the proposed legislative change in this bill and there is very strong support from across the country and across advocates, lawyers, migration agents, migrant resource centres, charities, churches and all of those who are involved in dealing with the very difficult, seedy side of these kinds of practices and the industry that has been built around it. The bill will not only tighten the law relating to these crimes; it will help to raise public awareness of the issues, and that is one of the important things that we need to ensure occurs, to promote justice and to bring about the changes that we all want to happen. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee I was involved in the inquiry into the bill. I would like to put some time into putting a human face on the reasons this bill is necessary. As the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, has pointed out, we have some concerns and we will be moving some amendments, but in general we support very strongly the need for this legislation.


I was involved, a number of years ago, in the federal Liberal Women's Council's moves to change the law as it then operated in Australia, where women who had been brought to Australia as sex slaves, to work in prostitution, were being deported back to their home countries before they had the opportunity to give evidence of any sort against the people who had brought them here. As a government we were in fact inadvertently assisting the people committing the crime of turning women into sex slaves in Australia. I must admit that, at the time, I thought that that was probably the extent of the problem—that it was something that happened perhaps at Kings Cross in Sydney but nowhere else, that it involved poor women from Asia being brought to Sydney and Melbourne but not much else. It took some time for me to realise that this was a far bigger problem than we had previously thought. We still have serious problems knowing the extent of not just the sex slave industry but the slavery and human trafficking issues in Australia because it is very difficult to gather statistics.


It was probably about six years ago that I attended a presentation in Brisbane by the Reverend Tim Costello, who made the point while he was talking that right there, in suburban Brisbane, not very far away, there would be people who were living in slavery-like conditions, whether they were sex slaves, being exploited by strangers for their labour or being exploited by family for their labour. It was only then that the far greater extent of this problem really struck me.


One of the problems is that in some cases it can be very hard to identify who is in a slavery-like relationship and who is not. I know there are some small family businesses where children perhaps as young as eight actually have a role in the business and love their role in the business, and that is not something that I believe any government should interfere with. However, if that child is being forced to get up very early and stay up very late to take part in that business, then we do have a situation teetering on the edge of abuse and neglect.


Whilst the whole focus of the slavery and slavery-like conditions bill is around people who have been brought into Australia to be slaves, there are so many nuances within families, such as within forced marriages, as Senator Stephens was pointing out. One of our concerns about forced marriage is that, in many cases, both parties to the marriage can be very young. The suggestion that, if someone has been forced into marriage, the other party must be the guilty party is not necessarily the case. It can be far more nuanced than that. Both parties to the marriage, in fact, may have been forced into the marriage. So these are issues that we need to take into account in the way that we look at this legislation.


I want to go through a number of cases that have been brought to my attention by Anti-Slavery Australia—and it still strikes me as bizarre and awful that we need an organisation called Anti-Slavery Australia. The first case involves a woman—not called Maria but named Maria for the point of the exercise—who was 24 and came here from the Philippines. She had been working in a factory earning $10 a week to support her young son and her mother, and she was told that she could come to Australia to live with a friend's relatives and take English classes in her spare time, and that they would give her some money for a visa and an airfare. When she got here, she found that she was in fact supposed to be the fiancee of an Australian man. He took her passport and she was required to work in the fiance's family business seven days a week. She was never paid any wages. She felt that she could not leave, that she had to do what she was told by her so-called fiance or he and his family would hit her. She felt absolutely trapped, because there was no way that she could seek help from her elderly mother. She had been trafficked and enslaved—hardly the promise she had been brought here on—but perhaps from the outside it did not look like a case of slavery.


The next case involves a woman called Sun, who is 22 and came from South Korea and had come to Australia on a 12-month working holiday visa. She was actually someone who was doing sex work at home, in South Korea, to pay her way through uni. She heard from another sex worker that life was much easier both for study and to finance herself in Australia. She took out the 12-month working holiday visa thinking that she would study, and finance herself through sex work in Australia. But of course the agent who organised all this immediately had her collected from the airport and taken to a Sydney brothel, and the owner said she had to pay off her flight and her visa. She was working up to 20 hours a day, and she very rarely received any money at all because she was paying off this alleged debt to the brothel owner in Sydney.


A third person, a man called Prishen, who was 43 and came from India on a three-month holiday visa was going to work with the family's restaurant in Melbourne during his three months. They had paid for him to come, and in return he would help out in the restaurant. However, when he got here he was working all night and every night, and being paid about $50 per week. He could do what he wanted to do in his hours off during the day, but he was clearly being very heavily exploited by his family. The only way that this person could currently seek remedy would be through civil action and, of course, that is not a very satisfactory way for an impoverished person, whose primary language is Indian, to function in Australia.


The fourth person is an Indonesian called Abdul, who is 35. He came here on a 457 visa. He had an interview with an employment firm that linked him up with a subcontractor in Australia. He was sponsored to come out here to work on, 'large building sites in Canberra'. He was told his pay would be in line with Australian award wages.


When he got here, he was not able to read any of the signs or understand any of the safety briefings that he was given and he was told that he would be working a six-day week for $250. He thought that was a fairly low wage. He lived 30 minutes out of Canberra and he was taken to work by his boss in a van every day and taken back again. He was then told that there would $100 per week donated from his $250 to send home to his family. You might not be surprised to hear that his family never received any of that money.


It can be a very broad field when we are looking at slavery and slavery-like conditions. But it is, despite those balanced examples I have given, generally, a quite gendered crime. It is in the main women who are the victims of slavery and slavery-like trafficking. I am delighted that we now have this legislation before us. I would hope that we can follow it up with perhaps some more real action in the field of child marriage and in the field of female genital mutilation which, in my view, are part of the same power control that goes on over women, particularly those from cultures where it is more normal for the men to exercise the power.


The coalition members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee have put in some additional comments to this report. We agreed with the comments of the government members of the committee but we would like to see a few areas of this bill clarified, because it does finally bring us to the stage where there is an understanding, at least from the legislatures, of what is happening in some parts of Australia right now—right under the noses of everybody.


I think there is probably still more room for this information to be promoted, not just to the people who might be the victims of it but also to the general public so that they recognise slavery situations when they see them. Fifty years ago, domestic violence victims would certainly have passed under the radar, or just politely not be talked about; that is no longer the case. We need to get to the situation where everybody in the community is concerned and looking at whether what they are looking at is an equal relationship that both people want to continue, or if what they are looking at is, in fact, a form of slavery.


I commend the bill, and hope that the government will accept the amendments that we will be proposing.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:21):  I also rise to speak to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. I am proud to do so as I believe it is my duty—in fact, it is the duty of us all as elected members of parliament—to make certain we implement the very best possible safeguards for the protection of vulnerable individuals. I would like to thank Senator Boyce for her support of this bill and for highlighting some of the real-life examples of people who have fallen victim to slavery and human trafficking here in Australia.


The need for legal and cultural reform to ensure that all people are free from bondage is as pressing now as it was when Abraham Lincoln resolved, through the 13th Amendment of 1865, to hold together the American union on a foundation of liberty and basic human dignity. And we are all reminded now of the singular importance of that fight against slavery as we seek to protect and extend these freedoms today.


This bill is about the Gillard Labor government striving to make sure Australia remains a just society, where the rights of individuals are upheld, and those who aim to exploit individuals and remove their rights are brought to justice. We are a part of an ever-changing world, a global society where trends move fast and people, sadly, can be treated as a commodity. Human trafficking and slavery is tragically becoming a growing concern in the 21st of century, internationally and here in Australia. Research suggests that globally between 500,000 and four million people are trafficked internally and across state borders, and of those people being trafficked 80 per cent are women and girls. Australia is not immune to this terrible trade. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 305 investigations and assessments of people-trafficking related offences were conducted by the Australian Federal Police's Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team. One hundred and eighty-four victims of trafficking were provided with assistance through the Australian government's Support For Trafficked People Program and 13 people were convicted for people-trafficking related offences here in Australia.


The majority of cases were of women being trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Many of these tragic cases follow the pattern outlined in case study from Anti-Slavery Australia:


When she got to the Sydney parlour, the owner told her she had to repay a 'debt' of $25,000 that she'd 'incurred' by having her flight and visa organised. In order to pay off this 'debt' she worked 14 hours a day, 6 days a week and her boss pressured her to work on her day off as well. She wasn't paid any money until her 'debt' had been paid off. Sometimes, her boss pressured her to perform sexual services without a condom. She lived in an apartment adjoining the parlour and was not permitted to leave the premises unsupervised. The boss threatened Sun with deportation if she complained too much, refused a customer or tried to go to the authorities for help.


Women typically find themselves in this situation having come to Australia under the pretence of undertaking a course of study or sometimes with the expectation of reasonable work in the sex industry or in other fields. The emotional cost and enduring pain each person experiences through this degrading trade is a price that one should never have to pay. This bill, which was developed with the support of non-government organisations and subject to two discussion papers with broad consultation, strengthens the protection of those who may fall prey to this unforgiving trade of slavery. One life involved and subjected to this trade, I believe, is one life too many. I welcome the changes being made through this bill being debated today, such as the definition of exploitation which will be broadened to include a range of slavery-like practices and increase the penalties applicable to the existing debt bondage offences to ensure they adequately reflect the seriousness of this offence.


Slavery is not acceptable and the bill loudly proclaims the government will not allow it to take root in our society. Slavery in any part of the world should never be acceptable and it is rightly prohibited under the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. Australia strongly condemns the practice and in 2005 ratified the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. However, in our society, which is not immune to international trends, it is imperative we continue to provide strong leadership in this area. It is the Gillard Labor government which is taking this action and standing up for people of all ages and ethnicities who may unwillingly become subject to slavery offences and or human trafficking. In the 21st century, no individual should be forced or threatened to take part in work or physical labour without their consent. No individual should be coerced into a marriage through any form of pressure. No individual should be involved in the illegal trade of body parts and no individual should be subjected to sexual or non-sexual servitude.


Labor has implemented a strong whole-of-government strategy to target human trafficking, including sexual trafficking and forced labour. This bill reflects this strategy and helps further administer its four central pillars: prevention; detection and investigation; prosecution; and victim support and protection. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 brings Australia's laws on trafficking and slavery into line with Australia's human rights obligations. It ensures the Commonwealth can meet its human rights obligations and adequately deal with the criminal conduct taking place in the area of people trafficking and slavery offences. I strongly welcome, through this bill, the introduction of new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a person for the purpose of further offence of trafficking and organ trafficking into the Commonwealth Criminal Code.


The changing nature of this trade, and its global sophistication, can make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and prosecute its range of exploitive behaviours. That is why it is important that the bill enhances the power required by law enforcement agencies to adequately deal with this sort of criminal conduct in the 21st century. The bill strongly condemns the trade and its practice, clearly stating to offenders or those intending to take part in the trade, that it is a crime—a serious crime, one that our society will not stand for.


I am sure I am not the only senator here who has come face-to-face with a woman who is desperately seeking help and guidance because she is sadly facing the prospect of being forced into a marriage she has not chosen. Women in our society should not be facing this crisis. I call it a crisis because that is exactly what it is. When threats, deception and coercion are used to bring about a marriage or a marriage like relationship, it is a clear human rights abuse. Whilst forced marriage like slavery and human trafficking is not clearly evident in all areas of our society, it does still exist. I am concerned that, if we do not take action and introduce new measures through this bill such as the criminalisation of forced marriage, then these issues may become rooted in all other areas of our society.


To feel powerless, unheard and invaluable is not a life a woman should live. It is not a life anyone should live. We need to empower women. Women who are supported and empowered both economically and socially create a flourishing, productive, rich and diverse society. This bill will continue that proud Labor tradition of empowering women and protecting the vulnerable in our community. Through the support of this bill, we have a real opportunity to show global leadership in the area of slavery and human trafficking. By putting in place good policy, we can work towards the eradication as well as the prevention of this degrading trade in Australia and beyond. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-02-27,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:31):  I rise to speak in favour of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. I think it is really important to reflect in this place that often we have differing views about things yet it has been very humbling experience to listen to the passion and dedication of people on all sides of this debate today. It is obviously something that cuts across political borders. As fellow human beings we understand there can be no justification for forcing another person into that type of slavery or sexual abuse and assault.


It might surprise many people listening today that this type of activity even happens here in Australia because we are the lucky country. We do have the rule of law. We do ensure that we look after those who are vulnerable in our community and do what we can to ensure people are not exploited. Many people are shocked at the idea that sexual slavery, the slavery of individuals, even happens here on Australian soil. But the sad fact is it does. The inquiry into this legislation brought out that it is often occurring to those who are so vulnerable that it is kept silent.


One of the key problems in this issue is that we just do not know how many people are actually affected. There are NGOs and community based organisations that try and keep their finger on how many people access their services. Project Respect, for example, based out of Melbourne, helped over 900 victims of sexual slavery in the 2011-12 year alone. But there is no hard data as to how many people, and women in particular, are trafficked into Australia for the purpose of sexual slavery.


One of the recommendations made during the inquiry into this legislation was that we actually fund proper research into the demand for trafficked persons so we can keep a closer eye on just how many individuals and human lives are being destroyed and exploited through these means. To do that we would need adequate funding and partnerships resourced between academic institutions and other groups as well as, of course, government agencies managed by both state and federal government for policing and border patrol so that we can keep check on how many women are being affected by this awful hideous crime, which, I would argue, is a crime against humanity.


This bill goes a long way to ensuring that we put very clearly in the law the seriousness of these crimes against individuals. It ensures that there are tougher penalties for those who engage in putting women into these types of slavery conditions. Those types of penalties are welcome. They go a long way to sending the signal that this is a very serious crime. The bill includes penalties in relation to debt bondage, which we know is how many of these women, particularly young women, are caught in this hideous crime. They are often tricked into coming to Australia to study. A number of victims have study visas. They think they are coming here to learn English or to expand on their other skills they were learning at home only to find themselves bonded into debt by those who then force them to participate in prostitution and other types of slavery.


We need to have these types of penalties but we also need to do what we can to expand the support for victims. That is not what this bill goes to but I think it is very important that we use the motivation from around the chamber today, across the political divide, to advocate stronger support for the victims involved. One of the key recommendations from the inquiry was the setting up of a proper federal compensation scheme. One of the biggest problems in this issue is that victims' compensation is managed by the states but the people who are involved in trafficking individuals, particularly women, move their victims from state to state to avoid being caught. If a crime was committed in Victoria and the person has been moved to a brothel in New South Wales, it is unclear which victims of crime compensation the individual is actually entitled to. This is a federal issue. Many of the people are coming to Australia under the misunderstanding of their visa requirements. It is a crime now in the federal legislation and we should establish a federal compensation scheme to help those victims.


One of the other issues that are particularly pertinent in this area is that as part of the support for victims—whether that be through accessibility to a longer stay visa once somebody has been rescued, if you will, from these hideous circumstances—there should be an ability for that person to access a proper, valid visa that is in their interest, that is going to be supporting them as a victim of these hideous crimes and that is not just directly linked to whether their case is helpful for particular prosecutions. This is really, really important because we need to be able to allow the victims in this area to feel free, comfortable and able to come forward, tell their stories and ask for help and assistance. Because many of them have been flown to Australia under the guise of a different type of visa, once they have been found to be working in a brothel and it is found that they are not in Australia on a valid visa, of course we need to do something to ensure that they can stay here safely and with all the support necessary. That support and compassion offered to those individuals should not simply be linked to whether the prosecution team believe that their case is going to be helpful enough to any legal case.


We need to make sure that there is proper support through the visa system, and that includes de-linking those visas and supports from the criminal justice process. I believe it is really important that we have victims being able to speak out against how they have been treated so that we can keep the individuals who are responsible for these hideous crimes locked up—I absolutely believe that—but we also have to ensure that we look after the victims through that process. I have often called for some type of special humanitarian visa, which would be available for those women victims who have been trafficked. I think that would be a very simple way of being able to acknowledge that we owe these women all the care and support that they deserve. A special humanitarian visa for those who have been victims of trafficking and slavery would be one thing that I urge both the government and the opposition to consider in coming months.


I also believe that we need to do more in terms of educating our communities about these issues. As I said at the outset, many people are surprised that this even happens here in Australia, and yet many people who find themselves in these circumstances, because they are being brought to Australia under a false pretence, find it very difficult to explain to individual members in our communities. Whether they are at university or at TAFE, or at other learning institutions where often many of these young women attend, there is a disbelief about the fact that this is going on. When they ask for help, when they put their hand out for assistance, there is an unawareness amongst our community that this is going on. We need to ensure that we invest significant resources into community education campaigns, letting those victims of these hideous crimes know that they have rights in Australia, that this is not allowed to happen to them, that it is a crime and that the people doing this to them are criminals. We also need to let them know that they deserve help, support and assistance. We need to ensure that we have proper education campaigns targeting high schools, universities, TAFEs and the professions which these women come into contact with, so that anyone who may need assistance is able to be offered that and action can be taken.


As I said, we also need adequate funding for the research to ensure that we know exactly what is going on: how many women in particular are a subject of this awful, hideous crime. The other recommendation that has not been picked up in this piece of legislation, but that I think is worth considering in future debates, is the responsibility that must be taken by individuals who intentionally use these services. It should be a criminal offence to intentionally, knowingly or recklessly obtain sexual services from a trafficked woman. If it is a crime to put women into this circumstance—which it should be—it should also be a crime to knowingly use that service; otherwise we are simply turning a blind eye to why these services are even able to continue. It is absolutely paramount that we send a very strong message to both the criminals in these syndicates and the people who knowingly use their services that the Australian government does not accept this, that this is a standard that is unacceptable in Australia and that we do stand by the human rights as outlined under the various international conventions that stamp out slavery and that say that treating another human being like this is a hideous crime and will not be accepted. An individual who knowingly uses these services must also take responsibility for their continuation of the abuse of these individuals.


Further support for victims, as I have mentioned in terms of a special visa category, would go a long way to helping these women. Ensuring that we have a federal compensation scheme and these other legislative reforms, as I have outlined, are all things that we now need to move on to. This bill has been a very, very important step and I commend it to the Senate. But our work is not yet over. We have got goodwill around this place; let's try and see how we can work together over coming months to make sure that the victims caught up in these awful circumstances are actually looked after. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:44):  I rise too, with an enduring concern and interest to protect women from the most abhorrent crimes, as Senator Hanson-Young has referred to, to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. As my colleague Senator Brandis noted earlier in this debate, most of the offences described as new by the government are in essence definitional changes to existing offences in the Criminal Code. However, there are important new offences in organ trafficking and forced marriage, and it is the establishment of two new offences related to forced marriage that I will confine my remarks to, largely because of my involvement in the inquiry which has been alluded to.


In saying that, though, I would just like to briefly mention that I support the strengthening of regulations against organ trafficking. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who would consider it to be anything but a heinous crime, but we have to recognise and be cognisant of the fact that this is an emerging and flourishing commercial trade that happens overseas and continues to happen today as we stand here to legislate against it. So this is a good move in the sense that it strengthens our position on it—legislating against it to make sure that we stamp out all possibility of this happening in Australia and of people overseas abusing the legislative program and framework here in Australia.


As I said, I support my colleagues' comments on the bill before me and in particular the concerns that they have raised, such as about the ambiguously wide definition of 'servitude', which could be misused in an industrial relations context. As always, on this side of the chamber we give the utmost care and consideration to ensuring that legislation that comes before us in this place does not lead to unintended consequences for our community. I call on the Gillard government to support our proposed amendments.


I will now focus the remainder of my comments today on forced marriage and the relevant offences that this bill addresses. It was just over a year ago that confronting media reports and stories from the community about young women being brought to Australia to be forced into marriage led me to co-author with Senator Cash an inquiry into this issue. While that inquiry looked at all aspects of prospective marriage visas, many of the submissions contained evidence and commentary relating to the incidence of forced marriage in this country. We heard from many witnesses who came forward about their concerns in this regard.


The definition that this bill inserts into the Criminal Code defines a forced marriage as one where, because of 'coercion, threat or deception', a person, the victim, 'entered into the marriage without freely and fully consenting'. It is inconceivable to many of us that any person, any woman, could be forced into entering a marriage against her will. As we understand, it is a cultural--and in some countries, a religious—practice, a tradition, where marriages are arranged between two parties, but I note that here in Australia that is not how we do things. Marriage is probably one of the biggest decisions that any two individuals will make in their lives. It is one of the greatest commitments that any two individuals can make between themselves, and so it should be. I strongly oppose anything that contravenes that, and I am particularly concerned that individuals may be forced into marriages here in Australia, when it is certainly not our tradition and it is not the Australian way of life.


Unfortunately, I have to say that the anecdotal evidence reveals that there is a hidden and disturbing problem here in this country. It may not be a huge problem. That is something that is very hard to identify, and Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has just spoken to the lack of anecdotal evidence that we have here, but there is certainly evidence that this is a disturbing problem here. There are reported cases of so-called marriage trafficking, where women are brought to Australia and forced into marriage, as well as the reverse situation, where women are taken overseas for the very same purpose. It is impossible for me to forget the widely reported plight of a 17-year-old Sydney girl who managed to save herself from a forced marriage in Lebanon with the help of the Australian Federal Police. There are also alarming accounts of women living in Australia being similarly forced into marriage here, particularly in the migrant community.


As I mentioned earlier, the difficulty that we have is that this evidence is anecdotal. The incidence of forced marriages in this country is an unknown factor. As Dr Tomison, Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology, made clear in the recent prospective marriage visa classes inquiry, research into human trafficking and in particular the connection between marriage and human trafficking is in an infancy stage. In other words, there is and has been extremely little, if any, research undertaken to ascertain the significance of this in Australia. The AIC does intend to further examine these connections, and I wish them all the best in that critical work. There is no doubt that, as the AIC, as well as the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women in Australia, have argued, there is a need for greater research into and awareness of the issue of forced marriage.


In this respect, we can look to the United Kingdom, where this issue has been given significant attention and focus, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office even establishing a Forced Marriage Unit in 2005. This unit has a policy role in working with other government departments and community organisations to tackle the issue and has been responsible for, among other things, publishing guidelines to help front-line workers identify and deal with cases of forced marriage. It has been recommended to this government that it consider establishing a working group to investigate the incidence of forced marriages in Australia and to explore relevant options that can be provided to assist victims. I strongly call on the government to act on this recommendation which goes hand in hand with the legislation that we have before us today.


It is also imperative that we seize the opportunity to put the spotlight on this issue to protect current and future victims. We need more research into exactly how prevalent forced marriages are, we need to raise awareness of the problem in the community and we need to provide more information and support to women who tragically find themselves the victim of this heinous practice. We also need, as the prospective marriage visa classes inquiry recommended, to raise the minimum age of visa holders within the prospective marriage visa program to 18 years of age to help minimise the incidence of forced marriage and human trafficking in Australia. The current visa requirements allow for young women under the age of 17 to be brought to this country for nine months, be sponsored by someone here in Australia and come here under the age of 18 with the intention of them being married at the age of 18. The inquiry heard much evidence in relation to this, but we did determine that: that was too young; girls under the age of 18 were particularly exposed; they would potentially not be provided with proper protection and afforded the rights that they should be; it was a fragile age; and that is one immediate change that could be made to strengthen our position in relation to forced marriages. And now, this moment in time, is when we need to do all of this. We cannot afford to wait a moment longer because, if we do, another young woman could find herself trapped in a situation not of her own making.


I welcome the creation of two forced marriage offences in this bill. The Criminal Code does not currently explicitly criminalise the act of causing a person to enter into a forced marriage, but with this bill it will become illegal to both cause a person to enter into a forced marriage and to be a party to a forced marriage. The second offence is directed at the spouse who is not a victim of forced marriage. Some critics have raised concerns about criminalising forced marriage and the potential for victims to be deterred from reporting for fear of the court process and being ostracised. This is another issue raised during the inquiry that I will come to shortly and that I have serious concerns about. I agree with the majority of organisations, including the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, that work in this field needs to support criminalisation. We need to make absolutely clear that Australia condemns this practice of forcing women into marriage and that under no circumstances do we support it. Ours is a country where people are free to choose whom they marry, and so must it remain. I also believe that including these offences in the Criminal Code will help to raise awareness of the problem—a problem that often remains hidden but, once again, exists. However, the coalition does have concerns as to the strict liability imposed in the forced marriage offences. There is a reversal of the onus of proof so that, if the prosecution establishes a person was forced into marriage, the other party to the marriage is presumed guilty and must establish a lawful excuse. 


I will just reflect on a couple of issues that came out of the inquiry and that other senators have raised in their debate on these particular bills. Firstly, there is the need for a central register. Through the inquiry, we established that there is no one agency responsible for collating any information on this. If the police, the department of community affairs or the immigration office are advised of a matter, there is no one central agency that is advised of the incidence or the concerns expressed that an individual may be in a forced marriage and may be having issues in relation to that. There is no single body collecting this information. The example that we were given in the United Kingdom is one that we encourage the government to consider because it centralises the data collection process. Whilst that sounds clinical and cold, all we have here at the moment is anecdotal evidence which raises huge concerns. It is critical that we actually have analytical data to back up and provide the support for changing the current system in the way it applies. In my mind, having a central agency, whether that be the Department of Immigration and Citizenship or not, responsible for the collection of data is the number one way in which we could strengthen the process and the regulation that relates to this. I also note that, when we talked about forced marriages and we discussed the women who are victims in this so-called equation, it is very difficult to flush out this information because many of these women are very fearful of their circumstances.


So you have situations where women are brought here who do not speak English, who have no network of friends around them—when the husband leaves for the day, they have no-one else they can speak to—and who are not aware of their rights here in Australia. They may come from countries where they fear police, so they may come here with a culture of fearing police authorities. More importantly, they are actually unaware of their rights and they do not have anyone to speak to. The big issue is in ensuring that every woman who comes here under a sponsored marriage arrangement is apprised of their rights—and I think through the immigration department. Australian authorities should be assured and comfortable with the fact that that individual is fully across what their rights are in Australia, what our protections are for individuals and the support network that is available through the refugee network. If they should change their mind about the circumstances in which they have come here then they should feel that they genuinely have a network they can turn to that will provide support.


I support the comments that Senator Sarah Hanson-Young made in relation to humanitarian visas. That was something that was crying out for attention in this inquiry. These women not only are not aware of the support network but tragically are scared that they are the ones who will be returned to their country of origin. They are particularly scared because in many of these instances, because of the cultural practices and traditions of their countries, they will be blamed for the marriage collapsing. With that blame they are ostracised; with that blame they will be rejected by their own family. So if they are returned to their country of origin, they will be penalised by their family, whether formally or informally, will be blamed for the collapse of the forced marriage and will incur whatever the consequences may be.


In many of these instances it is fair and reasonable to suggest that they will be discriminated against on their return. It is not a black-and-white scenario where they come here to be married and the marriage does not work so they should be returned to their country of origin. They will be discriminated against. There is no question that they will face prejudicial behaviour and in many cases rejection from their own immediate family. There is a need for us to consider a carving off, if you like, in part of the visa framework of a humanitarian allocation for women who are in this incredibly difficult circumstance so that consideration can be given to them to stay here with clearly strong support from various agencies. They could stay here and not be forced to return home to what would be quite difficult circumstances.


I support this legislation. I am concerned that there may be unintended consequences, but I strongly support it. I look forward to further consideration of other ways in which we can strengthen the framework to support women who may well find themselves in what could be loosely described as forced marriages.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:04):  I want to begin by thanking the senators who have contributed to this important debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012. Slavery, slavery-like practices and people-trafficking are insidious crimes that fundamentally violate the human rights and indeed the very dignity of victims. Sadly, these crimes are not just past injustices relegated to the history books. Throughout the world exploitative practices, such as slavery, servitude and forced labour, continue to be a daily reality for millions of our fellow human beings. Regrettably, Australia is not immune. While we are fortunate that the number of people identified as victims of slavery and trafficking in Australia remains low, just one person affected by such egregious behaviour is one too many. This bill sends a strong message that Australia will not tolerate any form of slavery, trafficking or related coercive practices.


The purpose of this bill is to clarify and strengthen the operation of existing slavery and people-trafficking related offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The bill will target those who facilitate exploitation by harbouring victims and introduce stand-alone offences of forced labour and organ trafficking to ensure that these practices are comprehensively criminalised. The bill will criminalise the unaccepted practice of forced marriage, ensuring that it is absolutely clear that marriage must be entered into freely, without duress or constraint. 


The bill will also amend existing definitions in the Criminal Code to ensure that the broadest range of exploitative conduct is criminalised. It expands the definition of 'servitude' to non-sexual servitude to capture a broader range of exploitative behaviour. I want to make it absolutely clear that the intent of the government is not to in any way lessen the seriousness of sexual servitude by creating this broader offence but rather to ensure that all people in all industries are not subjected to the injustice of servitude.


I will now, if I may, turn to some specific comments that have been raised by senators in their contributions to this debate. First, the additional comments that have been made by the coalition speak of arguing for a distinction between real and apparent consent. The government in the strongest possible terms rejects the proposition that this distinction should exist. This is a proposition from the 1950s. One might very well retort, 'No does mean no and that consent must be full and free as it is found in our bill.' This in our judgement is an antiquated notion and the government firmly sticks to the wording that is proposed in the bill.


We note that Senator Brandis indicated in his remarks that the opposition would not support a strict liability element within the offence of being a party to a forced marriage. But we note that the Liberal Party not only supported a similar strict liability offence but, indeed, introduced it in 2005. Philip Ruddock introduced drug offences involving children in division 309 into the Criminal Code in the Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Act 2005. Senator Chris Ellison took this bill through the Senate. The application of strict liability to the physical element that a child was involved was part of the original Liberal Party's bill, so we note that Senator Brandis is arguing a point here that is in defiance of his own party's history and previous conduct. 


In her remarks, Senator Boyce made the point that a child being coerced into work early in the morning or late at night might be a form of slavery-like conditions. The government is of the view that the Liberal amendments would allow this very egregious act to happen. They will remove the concept of taking advantage of a person's vulnerability from the definition of coercion in the government's bill. They are also removing the concept of psychological oppression from the definition of coercion. The government cannot support this. Senator Boyce's own examples would not even be covered by the Liberal Party's changes and we urge her to look carefully at the amendments she is purporting to support and to reconsider her position.


I would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its report on the bill which was released in September of last year. The government notes the recommendations made in the committee's report. A key recommendation of the committee was for the explanatory memorandum to be amended to better articulate that slavery-like offences may occur within intimate relationships. In line with this recommendation, an addendum to the explanatory memorandum was tabled in the Senate on 9 October 2012. The addendum clarifies that the offences of servitude and forced labour can apply whether the exploitation occurred in the victim's public or private life including in the context of intimate relationships.


The development of this bill has been a collaborative process. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the non-government organisations, industry associations, legal bodies, academics and members of the public, all of whom have provided input into this bill and made a valuable contribution. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 will ensure that our laws criminalising slavery, slavery-like practices and people trafficking are as robust and effective as possible. 


The bill is also essential in ensuring that our law enforcement authorities are adequately equipped to investigate and prosecute these heinous crimes. The bill reflects the government's commitment to doing all it can to prevent the reprehensible practices of slavery and people trafficking in all forms. In conclusion, I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (12:10):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012. In doing so, I indicate that the coalition will not be supporting this bill on the basis that the coalition views the substance of the bill as imposing an additional and unreasonable regulatory burden on Australian employers, the vast majority of whom are honest and law abiding. 


On the issue of additional regulatory burden being imposed on employers, the coalition recognises that, if we address the issue of over-regulation, we can provide business with an environment that supports stronger economic growth, greater investment, more innovation and higher productivity. We recognise that all modern economies need regulation, but excessive regulation creates greater costs than benefits and discourages investment and the willingness to have a go and add to Australia's productive capacity. There is clear evidence to show that Australia has been caught in the vice of over-regulation, and that excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry.


On the issue of Australia's migration program, the coalition has made it abundantly clear that Australia's migration program is intended as a supplement, not a substitute, to the Australian workforce to fill the gaps that occur when productivity capacity is unreasonably constrained by Australia's natural population growth. The coalition has also made it clear to industry and business groups that, when supplementation is required to fill vacancies that cannot be reasonably filled by Australian workers, the compliance measures in place will remain.


However, in relation to these proposed new measures outlined in the bill that we are currently debating, we say that they go beyond the notion of reasonableness and will impose excessive regulatory and compliance measures on employers and cannot be justified in their present form. The purpose of this bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to implement the government's response to the independent report titled Report of the 2010 review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007,conducted by independent legal expert Mr Stephen Howells, and known as the Howells review. In his report, Mr Howells concluded that the provisions of the act, and in particular sections 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act 1958, have not proved to be an effective deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who persist in employing or referring non-citizens who do not have permission to work in Australia. I emphasise the specific words of Mr Howells in referring to the extent of the problem as being 'limited to a small number of employers and labour suppliers who persist in employing or referring non-citizens'. The bill also proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958. 


In essence, the bill imposes strict liability offences for employers that allow or refer illegal workers or temporary visa holders to work in breach of their visa conditions. Offences will incur civil penalties of up to $49,500 for corporate bodies, and $9,000 for individuals. In addition, infringement notices of up to $9,900 for corporate bodies and $1,980 for individuals would apply. Companies who sponsor foreign workers on 457 visas and fail to comply with their obligations can lose their sponsorship in addition to financial penalties.


An analysis of the new requirements proposed by the bill indicates that they are both onerous and unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden and compliance costs for small business. Given this government's complete lack of understanding of and contempt for business in this country, it is not surprising that an analysis of this bill confirms that, if it is indeed passed, the new requirements will add to the already substantial regulatory burden imposed by the Labor government on employers who hire overseas workers, like those we have seen in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008.


In relation to the bill before the Senate, under the current Migration Act it is a criminal offence for a person or corporation to allow to work or refer for work an unlawful noncitizen or a noncitizen who does not have an appropriate condition on their visa permitting that person to work in Australia. These offences were introduced, lo and behold, by the former Howard government in 2007 in the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 and became sections 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act. The offences are fault based—and there is an important distinction between this and what is proposed by the current legislation—meaning that the prosecution must prove both physical and fault elements beyond reasonable doubt: that is, the employer allowed the unlawful noncitizen to work, thus breaching the working conditions of their visa, and the employer had knowledge of the lack of work rights of the employee or was reckless about that fact.


Since the commencement of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, whilst departmental officers have considered approximately 100 instances of possible breach, only four of these possible breaches were suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. And yet it was on the basis of this extremely low prosecution rate that the Howells report concluded:


The provisions of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 are wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


The inherent contradiction in this statement is, without a doubt, a feature of the report. On the one hand, it is acknowledged that there are few breaches and even fewer convictions, and on the other hand it is proposed that such exceptional behaviour warrants the imposition of an even greater evidentiary and regulatory burden on employers, hence the legislation that we have before us. This is clearly legislation that can be properly described as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and is a reflection of the chaos which is a daily feature of the government's failed immigration policies.


In relation to the proposed penalty regime, making new penalties applicable to all existing as well as future employees imposes an enormous additional regulatory burden on employers. As previously stated, Australia is already subject to overregulation, and that excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry. This overregulation was referred to by a number of industry groups in their submissions on the exposure draft of the bill. For example, the Australian Industry Group stated:


… we believe that the proposed changes are heavy handed and unnecessary. Imposing strict liability offences on employers and labour suppliers will not deter the small minority of employers or labour suppliers who already knowingly abuse the law to engage cheap labour. Rather the proposed changes will impact the unintended targets, i.e. good employers and labour suppliers. It is unfair that these persons be subject to high regulatory burdens because of the illegal practices of a very small few.


AMMA's contribution on the exposure draft stated:


…AMMA believes the existing framework is sufficient provided there is greater awareness of the current penalties and sanctions against employers who do the wrong thing. While it is important that penalties are in place to deter businesses and individuals in respect of work by non-citizens, the significant number of strong measures in the exposure draft … would impose disproportionate cost and inconvenience on resource industry employers …


…it is imperative that the cost of doing business is balanced appropriately against the cost of ensuring compliance with migration laws.


The National Farmers' Federation had this to say in their submission:


The NFF has been supportive of imposing stricter sanctions for employers who knowingly and repeatedly employ illegal workers. The NFF believe that these employers constitute a relatively small number and therefore we support Government adopting a targeted approach to identifying and prosecuting these offenders. The NFF does not believe that it is necessary and therefore would not be an effective spend of taxpayer money, to implement a broad scale compliance program across all employers.


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry made the following comments:


ACCI believes that the recommendations in the Howells' Report, if implemented, would be a disproportionate and inappropriate response to the problems they are trying to address.


And the HIA contends:


Strict liability offences should only be imposed in circumstances where it is just and fair to do so; not as a matter of administrative convenience. The case is not made in this Bill or the Policy Commentary supporting the Bill.


Yet, despite this repeated feedback from various industry groups throughout the period in the lead-up to the exposure draft et cetera that asserts that strict liability is not appropriate, the Gillard Labor government continues with its relentless attack on Australian businesses. Even the Howells report itself, if you analyse it, failed to make a plausible case that the extent of illegal workers warranted the sledgehammer effect which is a prominent feature of this bill.


In 2010-11, the department conducted 1,097 employer awareness visits, issued 515 illegal worker warning notices and located 1,788 illegal workers—and that is illegal workers, not illegal noncitizens. There is an important distinction between the two, and it is a distinction which Mr Howells appears to refuse in his report. Mr Howells estimates that up to 100,000 people are working illegally in Australia at any one time, but this is despite the department locating a mere 1,788 in 2010-11. One might also wonder if the department's investigations included the four illegal workers found on the Villawood site, who were working directly under the department and the government's nose. The figure that Mr Howells quotes incorrectly assumes that all overstayers are working illegally. There is no evidence produced to support this hypothesis. The coalition does not seek to trivialise the fact that there are illegal workers in Australia. However, I point out something that Mr Howells in his report does not: the measures proposed by this bill are disproportionate when compared to the limited extent of the problem they are attempting to stamp out. That limited extent is borne out by the department's own statistics.


The bill proposes that a number of offences should be strict liability offences. Whilst the Criminal Code reflects the same starting presumption as the common law—fault must be proven for each physical element of an offence for a person to be guilty—section 6.1 of the Criminal Code negates the requirement to prove fault if an offence is expressed to be a strict liability offence. Whilst the application of strict liability allows a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact to be raised, past governments and parliaments have recognised and have had regard for the findings of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has long taken the view that any use of strict or absolute liability should be properly justified. The reasoning of the Senate scrutiny of bills committee on the issue of the use of strict liability provisions is that it is generally neither fair nor useful to subject people to criminal punishment for unintended actions or unforeseen consequences unless these resulted from an unjustified risk. Clearly, in this case, the decision of the government to make a number of offences strict liability offences is designed to give the government an easy win or an easy conviction notwithstanding the complexity of the issues and circumstances that could have been raised if fault on the part of the employer had to be proven by the prosecution. It is clear that, unless a prospective employee produces, prior to the commencement of any work performed, a valid Australian passport, valid visa or some other valid documentation permitting work, the employer could be subject to prosecution. The combined effect of these recommendations would mean an employer could be taking a risk of fines before the courts or through an infringement notice should they not check a passport, birth certificate or visa status of a person who presents themselves for work.


The process involved in seeking these documents is not only arduous; it is also inherently discriminatory. For example, employees will in most cases be required to share information about their age and their place of birth. The need for this knowledge may lead to discrimination against persons who may be legitimate Australian citizens or permanent residents but are subject to questioning by their employer because of their racial identity, accent or level of English proficiency.


I touched earlier on the fact that Australia has been caught in the vice of over-regulation, excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry. I note that the current Labor government continues to increase the burden of red tape on industry notwithstanding the ironic election commitment to reduce over-regulation. Since 2008, the Rudd Gillard Labor government has introduced, approximately, an additional 20,900 regulations and has merely repealed 104 regulations despite having promised to cap the growth of regulation with their famous 'one in, one out' policy. Far from 'one in, one out', the Labor government has introduced, approximately, a '200 in, one out' regulatory policy. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry National Red Tape Survey found that 73 per cent of businesses now spend longer complying with regulations than they did two years ago, with one in 10 spending more than 20 hours per week dealing with red tape. Seventy-two per cent of businesses surveyed said the time they spent on tackling red tape had increased in the past two years. Only one in 10 businesses feel that red tape does not impact their business. The Productivity Commission has estimated that reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape in Australia could generate as much as $12 billion extra GDP per year. In the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013, Australia's ranking relating to the burden of government regulation fell from 60 to 96 out of 144 countries surveyed. This ranking is well below OECD averages.


Whilst the coalition agrees that the exploitation of foreign workers is an abhorrent practice and that any business found to be exploiting workers should be punished to the full extent of the law, it is our view that this bill is a disproportionate response to the issues raised in the Howells report and seeks to place an onerous regulatory and evidentiary burden on all employers rather than providing a more targeted approach directed towards those employers that have been identified as having employed illegal workers. The coalition will not support government policy responses that are based on creating a one-size-fits-all administrative burden for employers that shifts the cost of enforcing the law onto the employers themselves. The existing regulatory regime and cost of compliance that the government has systematically built around the employment of foreign nationals is already onerous, and the proposed changes will significantly increase the regulatory burden and compliance costs on employers. This bill is in direct opposition to the promise and the commitment that the coalition has made to people of Australia to reduce the red tape burden and lift productivity. For these reasons, the coalition will not be supporting this bill.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:29): I rise to speak in regard to the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employers Sanctions) Bill 2012. The problem of people working illegally in Australia is one that this government intends to curb as much as it possibly can. Clamping down on illegal work practices is important not only for the protection of our immigration regime but for the protection of workers themselves.


Noncitizens engaged in paid employment where their visa conditions do not allow them to do so has a number of consequences. Working without permission takes away work that could be available to people, citizens and noncitizens, who are legitimately entitled to it. We need to maintain the integrity of our migration system and ensure that the economic opportunities available to workers in Australia go to those who are entitled. Large numbers of noncitizens working illegally can distort the labour market; undermine the pay and conditions of legitimate workers, including health and safety conditions; and give employers an unfair competitive advantage over those who are doing the right thing. 


Finally, the practice of working illegally in Australia can have consequences for the illegal workers themselves. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has found in its investigations that the deliberate and systematic use of illegal workers in significant numbers is often associated with the abuse of these workers, including sexual exploitation, unsafe work practices and underpayment. It is also associated with crimes such as taxation and welfare fraud. At the extreme end of the scale, some of the practices are very disturbing.


In the other place, the member for Wills, Mr Kelvin Thomson, included in his contribution to the debate on this bill a detailed explanation of some of the tactics used by criminal organisations to bring women into Australia on student visas for exploitation in the sex industry. I will not go into the detail on that matter as deeply as he did, but I would certainly encourage senators to read his contribution or look at some of the work undertaken by the Victorian parliament's Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee in its investigations into this issue. I have also spoken on the issue of trafficking and sexual exploitation of workers—just this week, for example, in my contribution on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012.


It is important that we, the Australian government, do all we can to stop the exploitation of workers. The integrity of our industrial relations system and the benefits this provides for Australian workers relies on having an orderly process for providing work for noncitizens when we authorise it and when it is in Australia's national interests. Of course, where noncitizens are needed to fill skill shortages that cannot be filled by Australian citizens, there are a range of visa subclasses available to employers and employees under the skilled migration program. In addition, limited work rights are given to some visa holders to allow them to support themselves financially during their stay in Australia.


The number of people in Australia on a valid visa who either have no permission to work or have limited permission was around 960,000 as of 31 December 2009. These temporary migrants include students, tourists, business visa holders and working holiday-makers. Among those people are three groups of noncitizens who work in Australia without permission: noncitizens who have a current visa that does not permit work and have taken a job and commenced work; noncitizens who have remained in Australia after the expiry of their visa and have taken a job and commenced work; and noncitizens whose visa permits work, subject to certain conditions, but who are working in breach of these conditions. An example in this last category are noncitizens on student visas who are limited to 20 hours per week but who work in excess of those hours.


It is impossible to know how many of these noncitizens are violating the work conditions of their visas, although recent estimates have put the figure at around 100,000. What we can quantify is the number of noncitizens who overstay their visas, which in the past decade or so has fluctuated between around 40,000 and 60,000 every year. The problem may appear relatively small compared with our overall labour market of 10 million workers. However, 100,000 people working without permission is not an insubstantial number.


Australia's lifestyle and living standards are the envy of the world. Noncitizens working in Australia without permission threaten this lifestyle by taking away employment opportunities and undermining hard-won working conditions. The previous government, in recognising this problem, introduced the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act in 2007 to provide criminal sanctions for employers and labour suppliers who knowingly employ or refer for work noncitizens who do not have permission to work in Australia. The act quite rightly put some of the onus on employers to check that the workers they were hiring actually had permission to work. It also provided a mechanism to punish those employers and labour hire organisations actively involved in the recruitment and exploitation of illegal workers. The introduction of this act was coupled with an education campaign and administrative warning notices.


In 2010, barrister Mr Stephen Howells was engaged by the government to conduct a review of the act. Mr Howells's review was wide-ranging, examining the effectiveness of the current sanctions, the impact of the regulation on business, and the effectiveness of the systems verifying a person's right to work based on their visa entitlement or Australian citizenship. Mr Howells found that the criminal sanctions contained in the 2007 act had been ineffective as a deterrent to illegal work hire practices.


I will paraphrase a few sections of Mr Howells's report, which goes some way towards explaining why these sanctions have been ineffective. Since the commencement of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, departmental officers have considered more than 100 instances of possible breach. They have thoroughly investigated at least 10 matters involving what appears to have been the deliberate and systematic use of these workers in significant numbers at identified workplaces. There have been no successfully contested prosecutions under section 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act 1958 resulting in a recorded conviction and sentencing.


In December 2010, one offender was convicted and sentenced after entering a plea of guilty and acknowledging a prior criminal record. The principal reason for the failure of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act provisions is that the best evidence of breach would almost always come from the workers themselves, but their evidence is affected by their complicity or independent culpability under section 235 of the Migration Act. They would normally be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable, as required by section 198 of the Migration Act. The cost and the administrative inconvenience of detaining them pending a trial would be prohibitive.


In his report, Mr Howells noted that similar patterns of illegal work practices appeared in the United States, Britain and New Zealand and that the successful responses appeared to be those that included other enforcement mechanisms, such as civil penalties and infringement notices. The compliance regime recommended by Mr Howells is contained in the bill currently before the Senate: the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012.


What the government is proposing through this bill is a tiered enforcement approach. The scheme is designed to encourage voluntary compliance by business, through education and deterrence, and provide effective sanctions where this does not occur. This is achieved through graduated tiers of education, warnings, infringement notices, non-fault civil penalties and criminal penalties. The legislation's key amendments include amending the criminal offences and creating new non-fault civil penalty provisions and an infringement notice scheme for people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work, or allow or refer a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of a work related condition; creating statutory defences where reasonable attempts are taken at reasonable times to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work; broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to hold a person liable for participating in an arrangement, or series of arrangements, that result in a foreign national working without lawful entitlement; extending both criminal and civil liability in certain circumstances to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management; and creating search-warrant and notice-to-produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


So, I will explain the tiered enforcement model. Firstly, businesses are informed and educated on the requirement that only noncitizens with a visa that allows work are entitled to work. This will be achieved through a revamped education and information campaign. Then, where departmental officers identify a business or employer who is not complying with the legislation, they will usually issue an illegal-worker-warning notice. Subsequent infringement notices may be issues where repeated noncompliance with the legislation is detected. Finally, proceedings for a civil penalty order or prosecutions for criminal offences may be pursued where persistent noncompliance occurs and/or where serious breaches of the legislation are detected.


Where departmental officers identify an employer who is not complying with the legislation they will usually issue an illegal-worker-warning notice. These notices are available under the current act. Where repeated noncompliance with the legislation is detected, the department can then issue an infringement notice. Proceedings for a civil penalty order or prosecutions for criminal offences may be pursued in cases where the department finds persistent noncompliance or serious breaches of the legislation.


There has been extensive consultation on the measures contained in this bill. Mr Howells undertook consultation with key stakeholders, including employer groups, before releasing his report and recommendations. The government conducted further consultations on the recommendations in Mr Howells's report before releasing an exposure draft of the legislation. And of course there was then consultation on the exposure draft.


In drafting the bill, we have given careful consideration to the submissions made by employer and employee groups, government agencies including the Department Immigration and Citizenship and a range of other key stakeholders. Contained within this bill is a comprehensive package of measures, which, I am certain, based on international evidence, will be effective in significantly clamping down on illegal work hire practices. I would like to congratulate the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, for his carriage of this legislation.


Now I would like to comment on one of the objections that has been typically raised to sanctioning employers for illegal work hire practices. Some employers say they cannot reasonably be expected to know the work entitlement of prospective employees. The department has overcome this problem with the visa entitlement verification online, or VEVO, system. Through VEVO, employers are able to check whether a named person has a current visa and whether they are permitted to work. Employers without internet access can use the department's toll free visa entitlement verification faxback service.


Mr Howells took into account the concerns of business when he recommended the creation of statutory defences where a business took reasonable steps to check that a worker or prospective worker had permission to work. These defences are now contained within the bill and define what a reasonable step is. It can include checking a computer system as prescribed by regulations or viewing original documentation such as a visa label in the noncitizen's passport which demonstrates that they have permission to work. Another defence recognises that an employer or a referee should not be expected to know whether a non-citizen worker is also working elsewhere. In other words, when a noncitizen has a limited entitlement to work, their employer can only be penalised if that worker exceeds their entitlement through the hours worked with that employer. None of these defences, unfortunately, have satisfied the opposition.


I note that in their contribution to this bill in the other place, the opposition criticised this legislation for introducing new obligations on employers and for imposing red tape and compliance costs. This, as the former Minister for Immigration pointed out in reply, is a furphy. There has not been one additional requirement added to what was already required under the 2007 legislation introduced by the previous government. With this bill, the opposition's usual negativity appears to have reached new heights. They are now opposing a bill on the basis of something that is not even in the bill. These mythical extra obligations to which those opposite refer do not exist. In fact, as Mr Howells pointed out in his review and as I mentioned earlier, the implementation of the VEVO system means that there is less of a compliance burden on business when it comes to verifying whether a visa holder has an entitlement to work in Australia. VEVO makes it easy for employers to conduct a check, and this is not an onerous requirement.


The suite of measures contained in the current bill, the measures which Mr Howells recommended, are not much different to the recommendations handed to the Howard government by their own 1999 review. The coalition rejected them back then too. Those opposite still refuse to accept this advice. They refuse to provide the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with the tools necessary to stop employers engaging in illegal work hire practices and to deal with them under the law.


Those opposite are just not serious about more jobs for Australians. They opposed the economic stimulus plan, putting 200,000 thousand jobs at risk; they opposed assistance for the auto industry, putting a further 46,000 jobs at risk. Now they oppose effective action to prevent 100,000 or so noncitizens working without permission in Australia, taking jobs that could be going to Australians. I am proud to be part of a government that, by contrast, has created over 800,000 jobs since 2007 election during great global turmoil when jobs were being lost in the millions in other advanced economies. We created 800,000 jobs and kept the unemployment rate steady. We kept it lower than the average unemployment rate during the 12 years of the Howard government, despite the doom and gloom of the coalition when they predicted that the mineral resources rent tax, the Fair Work legislation and the carbon price would result in wholesale job losses. They peddled their doom-and-gloom scenarios and what happened? We did not see wholesale job losses throughout the economy. No, productivity tripled because of the economic reforms put in place by this Gillard Labor government and over 800,000 additional jobs were created. 


This just goes to show that the Labor Party is the party of jobs. It demonstrates that we are the only party in this place which is serious about creating jobs for Australians and protecting the employment rights and conditions of Australian workers.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (12:10):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012. In doing so, I indicate that the coalition will not be supporting this bill on the basis that the coalition views the substance of the bill as imposing an additional and unreasonable regulatory burden on Australian employers, the vast majority of whom are honest and law abiding. 


On the issue of additional regulatory burden being imposed on employers, the coalition recognises that, if we address the issue of over-regulation, we can provide business with an environment that supports stronger economic growth, greater investment, more innovation and higher productivity. We recognise that all modern economies need regulation, but excessive regulation creates greater costs than benefits and discourages investment and the willingness to have a go and add to Australia's productive capacity. There is clear evidence to show that Australia has been caught in the vice of over-regulation, and that excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry.


On the issue of Australia's migration program, the coalition has made it abundantly clear that Australia's migration program is intended as a supplement, not a substitute, to the Australian workforce to fill the gaps that occur when productivity capacity is unreasonably constrained by Australia's natural population growth. The coalition has also made it clear to industry and business groups that, when supplementation is required to fill vacancies that cannot be reasonably filled by Australian workers, the compliance measures in place will remain.


However, in relation to these proposed new measures outlined in the bill that we are currently debating, we say that they go beyond the notion of reasonableness and will impose excessive regulatory and compliance measures on employers and cannot be justified in their present form. The purpose of this bill, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to implement the government's response to the independent report titled Report of the 2010 review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007,conducted by independent legal expert Mr Stephen Howells, and known as the Howells review. In his report, Mr Howells concluded that the provisions of the act, and in particular sections 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act 1958, have not proved to be an effective deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who persist in employing or referring non-citizens who do not have permission to work in Australia. I emphasise the specific words of Mr Howells in referring to the extent of the problem as being 'limited to a small number of employers and labour suppliers who persist in employing or referring non-citizens'. The bill also proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958. 


In essence, the bill imposes strict liability offences for employers that allow or refer illegal workers or temporary visa holders to work in breach of their visa conditions. Offences will incur civil penalties of up to $49,500 for corporate bodies, and $9,000 for individuals. In addition, infringement notices of up to $9,900 for corporate bodies and $1,980 for individuals would apply. Companies who sponsor foreign workers on 457 visas and fail to comply with their obligations can lose their sponsorship in addition to financial penalties.


An analysis of the new requirements proposed by the bill indicates that they are both onerous and unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden and compliance costs for small business. Given this government's complete lack of understanding of and contempt for business in this country, it is not surprising that an analysis of this bill confirms that, if it is indeed passed, the new requirements will add to the already substantial regulatory burden imposed by the Labor government on employers who hire overseas workers, like those we have seen in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008.


In relation to the bill before the Senate, under the current Migration Act it is a criminal offence for a person or corporation to allow to work or refer for work an unlawful noncitizen or a noncitizen who does not have an appropriate condition on their visa permitting that person to work in Australia. These offences were introduced, lo and behold, by the former Howard government in 2007 in the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 and became sections 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act. The offences are fault based—and there is an important distinction between this and what is proposed by the current legislation—meaning that the prosecution must prove both physical and fault elements beyond reasonable doubt: that is, the employer allowed the unlawful noncitizen to work, thus breaching the working conditions of their visa, and the employer had knowledge of the lack of work rights of the employee or was reckless about that fact.


Since the commencement of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, whilst departmental officers have considered approximately 100 instances of possible breach, only four of these possible breaches were suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. And yet it was on the basis of this extremely low prosecution rate that the Howells report concluded:


The provisions of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 are wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


The inherent contradiction in this statement is, without a doubt, a feature of the report. On the one hand, it is acknowledged that there are few breaches and even fewer convictions, and on the other hand it is proposed that such exceptional behaviour warrants the imposition of an even greater evidentiary and regulatory burden on employers, hence the legislation that we have before us. This is clearly legislation that can be properly described as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and is a reflection of the chaos which is a daily feature of the government's failed immigration policies.


In relation to the proposed penalty regime, making new penalties applicable to all existing as well as future employees imposes an enormous additional regulatory burden on employers. As previously stated, Australia is already subject to overregulation, and that excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry. This overregulation was referred to by a number of industry groups in their submissions on the exposure draft of the bill. For example, the Australian Industry Group stated:


… we believe that the proposed changes are heavy handed and unnecessary. Imposing strict liability offences on employers and labour suppliers will not deter the small minority of employers or labour suppliers who already knowingly abuse the law to engage cheap labour. Rather the proposed changes will impact the unintended targets, i.e. good employers and labour suppliers. It is unfair that these persons be subject to high regulatory burdens because of the illegal practices of a very small few.


AMMA's contribution on the exposure draft stated:


…AMMA believes the existing framework is sufficient provided there is greater awareness of the current penalties and sanctions against employers who do the wrong thing. While it is important that penalties are in place to deter businesses and individuals in respect of work by non-citizens, the significant number of strong measures in the exposure draft … would impose disproportionate cost and inconvenience on resource industry employers …


…it is imperative that the cost of doing business is balanced appropriately against the cost of ensuring compliance with migration laws.


The National Farmers' Federation had this to say in their submission:


The NFF has been supportive of imposing stricter sanctions for employers who knowingly and repeatedly employ illegal workers. The NFF believe that these employers constitute a relatively small number and therefore we support Government adopting a targeted approach to identifying and prosecuting these offenders. The NFF does not believe that it is necessary and therefore would not be an effective spend of taxpayer money, to implement a broad scale compliance program across all employers.


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry made the following comments:


ACCI believes that the recommendations in the Howells' Report, if implemented, would be a disproportionate and inappropriate response to the problems they are trying to address.


And the HIA contends:


Strict liability offences should only be imposed in circumstances where it is just and fair to do so; not as a matter of administrative convenience. The case is not made in this Bill or the Policy Commentary supporting the Bill.


Yet, despite this repeated feedback from various industry groups throughout the period in the lead-up to the exposure draft et cetera that asserts that strict liability is not appropriate, the Gillard Labor government continues with its relentless attack on Australian businesses. Even the Howells report itself, if you analyse it, failed to make a plausible case that the extent of illegal workers warranted the sledgehammer effect which is a prominent feature of this bill.


In 2010-11, the department conducted 1,097 employer awareness visits, issued 515 illegal worker warning notices and located 1,788 illegal workers—and that is illegal workers, not illegal noncitizens. There is an important distinction between the two, and it is a distinction which Mr Howells appears to refuse in his report. Mr Howells estimates that up to 100,000 people are working illegally in Australia at any one time, but this is despite the department locating a mere 1,788 in 2010-11. One might also wonder if the department's investigations included the four illegal workers found on the Villawood site, who were working directly under the department and the government's nose. The figure that Mr Howells quotes incorrectly assumes that all overstayers are working illegally. There is no evidence produced to support this hypothesis. The coalition does not seek to trivialise the fact that there are illegal workers in Australia. However, I point out something that Mr Howells in his report does not: the measures proposed by this bill are disproportionate when compared to the limited extent of the problem they are attempting to stamp out. That limited extent is borne out by the department's own statistics.


The bill proposes that a number of offences should be strict liability offences. Whilst the Criminal Code reflects the same starting presumption as the common law—fault must be proven for each physical element of an offence for a person to be guilty—section 6.1 of the Criminal Code negates the requirement to prove fault if an offence is expressed to be a strict liability offence. Whilst the application of strict liability allows a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact to be raised, past governments and parliaments have recognised and have had regard for the findings of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has long taken the view that any use of strict or absolute liability should be properly justified. The reasoning of the Senate scrutiny of bills committee on the issue of the use of strict liability provisions is that it is generally neither fair nor useful to subject people to criminal punishment for unintended actions or unforeseen consequences unless these resulted from an unjustified risk. Clearly, in this case, the decision of the government to make a number of offences strict liability offences is designed to give the government an easy win or an easy conviction notwithstanding the complexity of the issues and circumstances that could have been raised if fault on the part of the employer had to be proven by the prosecution. It is clear that, unless a prospective employee produces, prior to the commencement of any work performed, a valid Australian passport, valid visa or some other valid documentation permitting work, the employer could be subject to prosecution. The combined effect of these recommendations would mean an employer could be taking a risk of fines before the courts or through an infringement notice should they not check a passport, birth certificate or visa status of a person who presents themselves for work.


The process involved in seeking these documents is not only arduous; it is also inherently discriminatory. For example, employees will in most cases be required to share information about their age and their place of birth. The need for this knowledge may lead to discrimination against persons who may be legitimate Australian citizens or permanent residents but are subject to questioning by their employer because of their racial identity, accent or level of English proficiency.


I touched earlier on the fact that Australia has been caught in the vice of over-regulation, excessive regulation stifles our economic prospects and impedes the work of Australian industry. I note that the current Labor government continues to increase the burden of red tape on industry notwithstanding the ironic election commitment to reduce over-regulation. Since 2008, the Rudd Gillard Labor government has introduced, approximately, an additional 20,900 regulations and has merely repealed 104 regulations despite having promised to cap the growth of regulation with their famous 'one in, one out' policy. Far from 'one in, one out', the Labor government has introduced, approximately, a '200 in, one out' regulatory policy. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry National Red Tape Survey found that 73 per cent of businesses now spend longer complying with regulations than they did two years ago, with one in 10 spending more than 20 hours per week dealing with red tape. Seventy-two per cent of businesses surveyed said the time they spent on tackling red tape had increased in the past two years. Only one in 10 businesses feel that red tape does not impact their business. The Productivity Commission has estimated that reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape in Australia could generate as much as $12 billion extra GDP per year. In the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013, Australia's ranking relating to the burden of government regulation fell from 60 to 96 out of 144 countries surveyed. This ranking is well below OECD averages.


Whilst the coalition agrees that the exploitation of foreign workers is an abhorrent practice and that any business found to be exploiting workers should be punished to the full extent of the law, it is our view that this bill is a disproportionate response to the issues raised in the Howells report and seeks to place an onerous regulatory and evidentiary burden on all employers rather than providing a more targeted approach directed towards those employers that have been identified as having employed illegal workers. The coalition will not support government policy responses that are based on creating a one-size-fits-all administrative burden for employers that shifts the cost of enforcing the law onto the employers themselves. The existing regulatory regime and cost of compliance that the government has systematically built around the employment of foreign nationals is already onerous, and the proposed changes will significantly increase the regulatory burden and compliance costs on employers. This bill is in direct opposition to the promise and the commitment that the coalition has made to people of Australia to reduce the red tape burden and lift productivity. For these reasons, the coalition will not be supporting this bill.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:29): I rise to speak in regard to the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employers Sanctions) Bill 2012. The problem of people working illegally in Australia is one that this government intends to curb as much as it possibly can. Clamping down on illegal work practices is important not only for the protection of our immigration regime but for the protection of workers themselves.


Noncitizens engaged in paid employment where their visa conditions do not allow them to do so has a number of consequences. Working without permission takes away work that could be available to people, citizens and noncitizens, who are legitimately entitled to it. We need to maintain the integrity of our migration system and ensure that the economic opportunities available to workers in Australia go to those who are entitled. Large numbers of noncitizens working illegally can distort the labour market; undermine the pay and conditions of legitimate workers, including health and safety conditions; and give employers an unfair competitive advantage over those who are doing the right thing. 


Finally, the practice of working illegally in Australia can have consequences for the illegal workers themselves. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has found in its investigations that the deliberate and systematic use of illegal workers in significant numbers is often associated with the abuse of these workers, including sexual exploitation, unsafe work practices and underpayment. It is also associated with crimes such as taxation and welfare fraud. At the extreme end of the scale, some of the practices are very disturbing.


In the other place, the member for Wills, Mr Kelvin Thomson, included in his contribution to the debate on this bill a detailed explanation of some of the tactics used by criminal organisations to bring women into Australia on student visas for exploitation in the sex industry. I will not go into the detail on that matter as deeply as he did, but I would certainly encourage senators to read his contribution or look at some of the work undertaken by the Victorian parliament's Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee in its investigations into this issue. I have also spoken on the issue of trafficking and sexual exploitation of workers—just this week, for example, in my contribution on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012.


It is important that we, the Australian government, do all we can to stop the exploitation of workers. The integrity of our industrial relations system and the benefits this provides for Australian workers relies on having an orderly process for providing work for noncitizens when we authorise it and when it is in Australia's national interests. Of course, where noncitizens are needed to fill skill shortages that cannot be filled by Australian citizens, there are a range of visa subclasses available to employers and employees under the skilled migration program. In addition, limited work rights are given to some visa holders to allow them to support themselves financially during their stay in Australia.


The number of people in Australia on a valid visa who either have no permission to work or have limited permission was around 960,000 as of 31 December 2009. These temporary migrants include students, tourists, business visa holders and working holiday-makers. Among those people are three groups of noncitizens who work in Australia without permission: noncitizens who have a current visa that does not permit work and have taken a job and commenced work; noncitizens who have remained in Australia after the expiry of their visa and have taken a job and commenced work; and noncitizens whose visa permits work, subject to certain conditions, but who are working in breach of these conditions. An example in this last category are noncitizens on student visas who are limited to 20 hours per week but who work in excess of those hours.


It is impossible to know how many of these noncitizens are violating the work conditions of their visas, although recent estimates have put the figure at around 100,000. What we can quantify is the number of noncitizens who overstay their visas, which in the past decade or so has fluctuated between around 40,000 and 60,000 every year. The problem may appear relatively small compared with our overall labour market of 10 million workers. However, 100,000 people working without permission is not an insubstantial number.


Australia's lifestyle and living standards are the envy of the world. Noncitizens working in Australia without permission threaten this lifestyle by taking away employment opportunities and undermining hard-won working conditions. The previous government, in recognising this problem, introduced the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act in 2007 to provide criminal sanctions for employers and labour suppliers who knowingly employ or refer for work noncitizens who do not have permission to work in Australia. The act quite rightly put some of the onus on employers to check that the workers they were hiring actually had permission to work. It also provided a mechanism to punish those employers and labour hire organisations actively involved in the recruitment and exploitation of illegal workers. The introduction of this act was coupled with an education campaign and administrative warning notices.


In 2010, barrister Mr Stephen Howells was engaged by the government to conduct a review of the act. Mr Howells's review was wide-ranging, examining the effectiveness of the current sanctions, the impact of the regulation on business, and the effectiveness of the systems verifying a person's right to work based on their visa entitlement or Australian citizenship. Mr Howells found that the criminal sanctions contained in the 2007 act had been ineffective as a deterrent to illegal work hire practices.


I will paraphrase a few sections of Mr Howells's report, which goes some way towards explaining why these sanctions have been ineffective. Since the commencement of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, departmental officers have considered more than 100 instances of possible breach. They have thoroughly investigated at least 10 matters involving what appears to have been the deliberate and systematic use of these workers in significant numbers at identified workplaces. There have been no successfully contested prosecutions under section 245AA to 245AK of the Migration Act 1958 resulting in a recorded conviction and sentencing.


In December 2010, one offender was convicted and sentenced after entering a plea of guilty and acknowledging a prior criminal record. The principal reason for the failure of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act provisions is that the best evidence of breach would almost always come from the workers themselves, but their evidence is affected by their complicity or independent culpability under section 235 of the Migration Act. They would normally be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable, as required by section 198 of the Migration Act. The cost and the administrative inconvenience of detaining them pending a trial would be prohibitive.


In his report, Mr Howells noted that similar patterns of illegal work practices appeared in the United States, Britain and New Zealand and that the successful responses appeared to be those that included other enforcement mechanisms, such as civil penalties and infringement notices. The compliance regime recommended by Mr Howells is contained in the bill currently before the Senate: the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012.


What the government is proposing through this bill is a tiered enforcement approach. The scheme is designed to encourage voluntary compliance by business, through education and deterrence, and provide effective sanctions where this does not occur. This is achieved through graduated tiers of education, warnings, infringement notices, non-fault civil penalties and criminal penalties. The legislation's key amendments include amending the criminal offences and creating new non-fault civil penalty provisions and an infringement notice scheme for people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work, or allow or refer a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of a work related condition; creating statutory defences where reasonable attempts are taken at reasonable times to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work; broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to hold a person liable for participating in an arrangement, or series of arrangements, that result in a foreign national working without lawful entitlement; extending both criminal and civil liability in certain circumstances to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management; and creating search-warrant and notice-to-produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


So, I will explain the tiered enforcement model. Firstly, businesses are informed and educated on the requirement that only noncitizens with a visa that allows work are entitled to work. This will be achieved through a revamped education and information campaign. Then, where departmental officers identify a business or employer who is not complying with the legislation, they will usually issue an illegal-worker-warning notice. Subsequent infringement notices may be issues where repeated noncompliance with the legislation is detected. Finally, proceedings for a civil penalty order or prosecutions for criminal offences may be pursued where persistent noncompliance occurs and/or where serious breaches of the legislation are detected.


Where departmental officers identify an employer who is not complying with the legislation they will usually issue an illegal-worker-warning notice. These notices are available under the current act. Where repeated noncompliance with the legislation is detected, the department can then issue an infringement notice. Proceedings for a civil penalty order or prosecutions for criminal offences may be pursued in cases where the department finds persistent noncompliance or serious breaches of the legislation.


There has been extensive consultation on the measures contained in this bill. Mr Howells undertook consultation with key stakeholders, including employer groups, before releasing his report and recommendations. The government conducted further consultations on the recommendations in Mr Howells's report before releasing an exposure draft of the legislation. And of course there was then consultation on the exposure draft.


In drafting the bill, we have given careful consideration to the submissions made by employer and employee groups, government agencies including the Department Immigration and Citizenship and a range of other key stakeholders. Contained within this bill is a comprehensive package of measures, which, I am certain, based on international evidence, will be effective in significantly clamping down on illegal work hire practices. I would like to congratulate the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, for his carriage of this legislation.


Now I would like to comment on one of the objections that has been typically raised to sanctioning employers for illegal work hire practices. Some employers say they cannot reasonably be expected to know the work entitlement of prospective employees. The department has overcome this problem with the visa entitlement verification online, or VEVO, system. Through VEVO, employers are able to check whether a named person has a current visa and whether they are permitted to work. Employers without internet access can use the department's toll free visa entitlement verification faxback service.


Mr Howells took into account the concerns of business when he recommended the creation of statutory defences where a business took reasonable steps to check that a worker or prospective worker had permission to work. These defences are now contained within the bill and define what a reasonable step is. It can include checking a computer system as prescribed by regulations or viewing original documentation such as a visa label in the noncitizen's passport which demonstrates that they have permission to work. Another defence recognises that an employer or a referee should not be expected to know whether a non-citizen worker is also working elsewhere. In other words, when a noncitizen has a limited entitlement to work, their employer can only be penalised if that worker exceeds their entitlement through the hours worked with that employer. None of these defences, unfortunately, have satisfied the opposition.


I note that in their contribution to this bill in the other place, the opposition criticised this legislation for introducing new obligations on employers and for imposing red tape and compliance costs. This, as the former Minister for Immigration pointed out in reply, is a furphy. There has not been one additional requirement added to what was already required under the 2007 legislation introduced by the previous government. With this bill, the opposition's usual negativity appears to have reached new heights. They are now opposing a bill on the basis of something that is not even in the bill. These mythical extra obligations to which those opposite refer do not exist. In fact, as Mr Howells pointed out in his review and as I mentioned earlier, the implementation of the VEVO system means that there is less of a compliance burden on business when it comes to verifying whether a visa holder has an entitlement to work in Australia. VEVO makes it easy for employers to conduct a check, and this is not an onerous requirement.


The suite of measures contained in the current bill, the measures which Mr Howells recommended, are not much different to the recommendations handed to the Howard government by their own 1999 review. The coalition rejected them back then too. Those opposite still refuse to accept this advice. They refuse to provide the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with the tools necessary to stop employers engaging in illegal work hire practices and to deal with them under the law.


Those opposite are just not serious about more jobs for Australians. They opposed the economic stimulus plan, putting 200,000 thousand jobs at risk; they opposed assistance for the auto industry, putting a further 46,000 jobs at risk. Now they oppose effective action to prevent 100,000 or so noncitizens working without permission in Australia, taking jobs that could be going to Australians. I am proud to be part of a government that, by contrast, has created over 800,000 jobs since 2007 election during great global turmoil when jobs were being lost in the millions in other advanced economies. We created 800,000 jobs and kept the unemployment rate steady. We kept it lower than the average unemployment rate during the 12 years of the Howard government, despite the doom and gloom of the coalition when they predicted that the mineral resources rent tax, the Fair Work legislation and the carbon price would result in wholesale job losses. They peddled their doom-and-gloom scenarios and what happened? We did not see wholesale job losses throughout the economy. No, productivity tripled because of the economic reforms put in place by this Gillard Labor government and over 800,000 additional jobs were created. 


This just goes to show that the Labor Party is the party of jobs. It demonstrates that we are the only party in this place which is serious about creating jobs for Australians and protecting the employment rights and conditions of Australian workers.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  The great heartland of Sydney is Western Sydney. Acres of newsprint have recently been devoted to Western Sydney, there have been hours of television and radio commentary about Western Sydney and today there are editorials in both the Australian and the Financial Reviewabout WesternSydney. I really do not know how much the editors of the Australian or the Financial Review would know about Western Sydney. But, with all this interest in Western Sydney, the most bizarre thing I have seen was Senator Birmingham on the doors today. There he was, a senator for South Australia, on the doors with scripted and rehearsed spin about Western Sydney—a South Australian senator pontificating about Western Sydney. He was sent out to tell the people of Western Sydney that they were concerned about protection visas and the carbon price. 


Apart from the 12 years I lived in Muswellbrook in the Upper Hunter region of New South Wales, I have spent most of my life in Australia in Western Sydney. I have lived in St Marys, I have lived in St Clair, I have lived in Parramatta and I now live in the Lower Blue Mountains. I have two daughters. They grew up and were educated in St Clair. Both have degrees and both are professionals. I am proud of them, I am proud of the public schools they were taught in and I am proud of the teachers of Western Sydney who gave them their opportunity. 


I spend a lot of my time in Western Sydney and when people there talk about the issues—the things which will improve their lives—not many people raise the carbon price or temporary protection visas. When I have discussions in Western Sydney, it is all about infrastructure. It is about the Richmond bridge, where commuters queue for hours in the morning. It is about bringing more culture into the area through the government's $9.5 million grant to get the Springwood Civic Centre up and running. It is about sport—building a stand for the Windsor Wolves down in the Hawkesbury so young people and their families can watch sport in decent comfort in winter. All of this has been promoted and pushed by the Labor candidate for Macquarie, Susan Templeman. 


On education, the people of Western Sydney want to talk about Gonski and improved public schools. They want to talk about health, they want to talk about the trade training centres which are being built across Western Sydney and they want to talk about jobs. They want jobs for themselves and jobs for their kids and they want decent rights in those jobs. They want to be treated with respect when they go to work and they want to have access to an industrial umpire—something which was not there under the last coalition government. 


No government in history has, over two terms, invested more in Western Sydney than the Rudd and Gillard governments. Western Sydney, depending on which statistics you look at, has about 1½ million or 2 million people. The biggest employer in Western Sydney is manufacturing and the government has made recent announcements about how it will promote manufacturing. I will come to that later. Manufacturing is the biggest employer in Western Sydney, with 12.1 per cent of the workforce. It is followed by retail, health care and social services, which each employ 10.7 per cent of the workforce.


Look at what the government did when the global financial crisis hit this country, when investment was frozen by the private sector. The investment that the government made allowed the healthcare, retail and social services sectors to continue, and we avoided a recession in this country. We invested in construction, in transport and warehousing, in education and training and in public administration. That is what kept this country out of recession.


What do we have from the coalition? What do they want to do? They want to send these public administration jobs in Western Sydney to some remote part of the Northern Territory. This is the nonsense that we have from the coalition. They do not care about the issues in Western Sydney. One of the fundamental issues for people in Western Sydney is travel to work. Nearly 200,000 Western Sydney workers travel outside Western Sydney every day to get to work. There are areas of social disadvantage in Western Sydney that the Labor government is addressing. These are the issues for Western Sydney. It is not about sending a South Australian senator with his Richard Burton tones—his serious voice on—out in full view of the public to tell the people of Western Sydney what they need and what they are concerned about. It does not matter doing that; you have to get on with the job. I have to say that, after years of coalition government, they squandered the opportunity to build Western Sydney. As Peter Hartcher noted in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald in April 2009:


But when the mining boom arrived, framing the budget went from being a carefully managed process to the equivalent of a cargo cult.


That is how the current opposition dealt with the budget; it was a cargo cult. Prime Mister Howard's former chief of staff, Arthur Sinodinos, now Senator Sinodinos from New South Wales:


was also a former Treasury official. He said the boom gave the budget process ""a lucky dip feel""—


A lucky dip! They were dealing with the budget on the basis of a lucky dip—


…as officials and ministers scrambled to formalise tax cut options and decide which ones would get the go-ahead.


That is how the coalition dealt with the budget of this country, and that is from a current coalition senator, Senator Arthur Sinodinos.


The first phase of the mining boom in particular and economic conditions in general saw the Howard government just about drowning in revenue. With so much money sloshing around, fiscal discipline and nation-building priorities collapsed. The priority was not Western Sydney; it was not about nation-building projects in Western Sydney; it was not about making life easier for people in Western Sydney. It was about giveaways; it was about a lucky dip approach to the budget. Who will ever forget the wave of panic, the panic spending by the coalition in the wake of the Liberals loss in the Ryan by-election in March 2001. That was to be dwarfed only by the infamous Crazy John's closing down sale in the mid-2004 election campaign when $6 billion was added to government spending in half an hour. Showering tax concessions and rebates on a startled middle class unaccustomed to such largesse became a social engineering art form carried out in the complete absence of social or financial need. Meanwhile, the nation's infrastructure needs were ignored, Western Sydney was ignored, while our research institutions, hospitals and schools were subjected to death by a thousand cuts. That is the reality of the coalition. And when they get out and say that they want to do things for Western Sydney you have to look at their record in Western Sydney.


What the Commonwealth government has done is committed 10 times what the Howard government spent on infrastructure in this country during its 12 years in office—10 times the amount. All the Howard government spent in Western Sydney was $350 million for this M7 toll road. Since late 2007 the Labor government has spent $3.2 billion, including $800 million for the development of the Moorebank intermodal, $980 million for the construction of the Southern Sydney Freight Line, $93 million to widen the F5 at Campbelltown and $300 million to upgrade the Great Western Highway, which has been a goat's track under the coalition government for 12 years. We have spent the money to make it easier for people to get to and from work, and there is much more to be done. We have spent $8½ million to begin planning for the installation of an electronic freeway management system along the full length of the M4. We have put up $25 million to advance the WestConnex project. A further $150 million has been set aside to improve the M2 to F3 link. We have $2.1 billion on the table for the Parramatta to Epping rail link, which would cement Parramatta's position as Sydney's second CBD. These are the practical things that we have done in terms of infrastructure in the Sydney region and Western Sydney.


Despite the coalition raking in over $40 billion worth of infrastructure promises at the last election, not one dollar of infrastructure spending was promised for Sydney, never mind Western Sydney. And they get out there and tell people what is good for Sydney! There was not one dollar in infrastructure promised at the last election. And what was the solution? Let me quote the Leader of the Opposition from the ABC's Four Corners program on 16 August 2010. He said:


Now … if you want better public transport in Sydney … sure ask the Feds for more money … but basically you've got to change the State government if you want better public transport in Sydney.


What they are saying there is that it is not a federal government issue to improve public transport in Sydney or to improve infrastructure in Western Sydney; it is a matter for the state government. Well, we have never taken that view. We believe the federal government has a big role to play in Western Sydney—a role that has been completely ignored under nearly 12 years of the Howard government.


It is not just transport infrastructure; it is health. There is funding for the Nepean Hospital, with $96 million for the new east block and $17 million for a new clinical school; $31.7 million to Blacktown Hospital for 10 rehabilitation beds and a specialised 20-bed neuropsychiatry subacute unit; $11.5 million to Blacktown Hospital for additional emergency services; $15 million for a GP superclinic in Liverpool; $1.75 million in south-western Sydney for New Directions: Mothers and Babies Services and Strong Fathers Strong Families—and it goes on in health. In education there is the Hawkesbury Trade Training Centre; the Blacktown Girls High School Hospitality Trade Training; $2.16 million for two trade training centres to benefit two schools in Hughes, Bonnyrigg High School and Miller Technology High School; and up to $17 million for trade training centres in the Penrith area.


These are the issues that build the western suburbs. These are the issues that build the infrastructure, the health and the education capacity of Western Sydney. That is what a Labor government is about. Compare that with the lack of attention to Western Sydney by the Howard government. Compare that with the profligacy of the Howard government, who did not care about Western Sydney, who squandered the opportunity of the mining boom and who left us with real challenges in Western Sydney.


So the Labor government has the track record in Western Sydney. We are the ones who understand that it is about education; it is about health; it is about transport; it is about infrastructure. For the coalition—through a South Australian senator—to lecture the Labor government on Western Sydney is an absolute joke.

However, Mr President, I would ask you on the point of relevance to direct him to the question. The question was about the Prime Minister's proposed visit to Western Sydney, and specifically to Rooty Hill. Can you ask the minister to address that question rather than to behave like the clown that he is.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is not called for. The minister was addressing the question until there was an unfortunate interjection which turned the minister's attention away from the question.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (15:05):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Payne today relating to western Sydney and the Prime Minister.


It seems to me that small things apparently can amuse small minds, judging by the reaction of those opposite to the question I asked at the start of question time today. But they are not small things to the people at the Penrith Whitewater Stadium in the electorate of Lindsay. The fact that they are prepared to go on the record in their annual report, tabled in Penrith council in the second week of February, and say that they have seen a 15 per cent rise in their energy costs as a result of the carbon tax, as reported in the Penrith Press on 15 February and in the Western Weekender on 14 February, shows this is very serious for them. This is an international world-class facility that now finds itself in a position where it will probably have to buy a diesel generator to operate during parts of the day because of these increased costs and other increased costs for electricity as well. It is the facility that produced Olympic silver medallist Jessica Fox. It is not a laughing matter. The fact that those opposite and other members of this government continue to treat the people of Western Sydney, the people who are actually in their forgotten heartland, with contempt is the problem that this government has. 


The headlines in relation to the Prime Minister's upcoming sojourn in Western Sydney are even more fascinating. We have: 'Oh west, where goes thy vote?' 'The west puts up a Do Not Disturb Sign to Prime Minister Julia Gillard'. And in an alliterative effort by the Australian Financial Review: 'Gillard's futile foray out west'. These are the sorts of observations which even the Canberra press gallery are making, and heaven only knows what the local Western Sydney papers will make of it, too. But my personal favourite is the small cartoon on the front page of today's Australian. It is not quite clear enough for me to see who drew it, but it has a very helpful gentleman at the front desk of the Rooty Hill RSL Novotel saying, 'Can we help you with your baggage?' And around her are polls, boats, mining tax, ICAC, Kevin, more polls, the surplus or not, more polls, and the Prime Minister saying in response, 'That's the general idea.' 


The people of Western Sydney will not be helping the Prime Minister with her baggage. A one-week visit is much like one swallow in a summer; it does not make a commitment to Western Sydney. Perhaps a little doorknocking would not go astray while she is there. Perhaps our candidate in Chifley, Isabelle White, could take some of her energy and enthusiasm to the streets with the Prime Minister, and she could meet some of the real people of Rooty Hill. 


While I am on the question of the Rooty Hill RSL, it would seem to me that the Prime Minister is really not helped by her colleagues—colleagues like Minister Mark Butler, who thinks it is a joke to talk about one of the largest facilities in Western Sydney, like the Rooty Hill RSL, in the way that he did on Adelaide radio today. I will tell you where the joke lies, Mr Deputy President: it lies with Minister Butler. The Rooty Hill RSL does things like those outlined in the St Mary's Vietnam Veterans' Outpost website and newsletter—and I want to quote it. It was in 2010 but it is a pretty good quote: 


We recently received our CDSE grant from Rooty Hill RSL Club which could not have come at a better time as we also received acknowledgement from DVA regarding our BEST Funding. Unfortunately with the Government in ""Claw Back Mode"" to pay for the insulation and schools improvement program our Grant has been slashed by several thousand dollars … 


The activities of this extremely worthy organisation, the St Mary's Vietnam Veterans' Outpost, is supported by the Rooty Hill RSL, about which Minister Mark Butler thinks it is appropriate to say it is 'a bit too ""Benny Hill"" '. Was that a play on words as well? Was that a play on Sydney's history and the naming of Rooty Hill by Governor Sir Philip Gidley King, who named it after a place on Norfolk Island, where he had also lived? Or is that a joke as well? The people of Western Sydney are strong and proud. It is where I work and it is where I live. They are people who are sick and tired of this government, of their increased living costs, of their broken promises and of the lack of attention to the infrastructure that they need to go about their daily lives and not unreasonably to live and work and play where they live. The Rooty Hill RSL answers those questions. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  It is actually quite refreshing and quite a change to hear Senator Payne stand up in here and talk about Western Sydney. This morning we had a South Australian senator, Senator Birmingham, being sent out to run the lines for the coalition. I do not know why Senator Payne was not sent out, but Senator Birmingham was sent out to run the lines for the coalition on Western Sydney. Like Senator Payne, I am also a resident of Western Sydney. I have lived in St Clair, I have lived in St Marys and I have lived in Penrith. So I know Western Sydney well. 


I certainly know that the issues that are a problem in Western Sydney are issues that are being assessed and dealt with by this government. They are the issues of transport: the issues of almost 200,000 people in Western Sydney having to exit Western Sydney every day and come back into Western Sydney at night. That is a huge problem. It is the neglect of 11½ years of the Howard government to put infrastructure into Western Sydney. Look at the last election platform of the coalition. What was the election platform for Western Sydney in terms of infrastructure? Zero. Nothing. They did nothing. They were promising nothing in Western Sydney, and so they have got a lot to answer for after 11½ years, when they were profligate. 


When the money was flowing into the government, what did they do in Western Sydney? They did nothing in health. They did nothing in education. I have been to Western Sydney schools where the toilets look as if they were built in the 1800s, and that was after 11½ years of the coalition government. I have to say, in terms of transport, what have they done over 11½ years? Nothing. Who has invested in health in Western Sydney? It is the Labor government that has invested in health. If you go to every major hospital you can see the building work that is being done. There is the building work in health and the building work in education. 


We are rebuilding the infrastructure in many of our schools by putting in school halls that would never have been built under a coalition government and putting in science labs and language labs that were never thought about under a coalition government. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  So I object. I will not accept a lecture from Senator Payne or Senator Fierravanti-Wells about Western Sydney, because the major neglect in Western Sydney came from a federal government, the Howard-Costello government, who did not care about Western Sydney and who did not invest in the future of Western Sydney. Do not come here and lecture me after the federal government has invested millions upon millions of dollars in Western Sydney in health, education, roads and infrastructure. Where has the investment come from? It has come from Labor. It did not come from the coalition. The coalition's record in Western Sydney is an absolute disgrace, and the public will soon realise it when this approach by the coalition of having a balanced budget at all costs will cost jobs in Western Sydney, it will cost investment in Western Sydney, it will make life harder for people in Western Sydney.


When I go out to Western Sydney—I do not know where Senator Payne goes—I do go to the clubs. I am a member of St Mary's RSL, I do go there; I am a member of Penrith Panthers, I do go there. When people talk to me about issues, they talk to me about jobs, they talk to me about a future for their kids, they talk to me about investment in education and they talk to me about an investment in health. These are the key issues. What do you hear from Senator Payne? Normally nothing. You normally hear nothing from her. You even have to send a South Australian senator out to the doors to run the coalition lines on Western Sydney. If you cannot do it, Senator, that is okay. You should just admit it. But do not send a South Australian senator out to do your job in Western Sydney. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  Clearly, Senator Cameron did not understand that the reason why the Investing in Our Schools Program was so successful was that we had to provide funding for toilets in New South Wales schools, because the New South Wales government had its eye on other matters, such as corruption and waste and mismanagement, and they did not provide the toilets that they should have been providing, Senator Cameron.


Can I move to issues pertaining to Western Sydney? I have to say that I, like Senator Payne, do spend considerable time in Western Sydney. Indeed, I was out in Chifley only last month. Perhaps the Prime Minister needs a map to find her way out to Western Sydney? I am happy to provide her with directions from Kirribilli House out to the Rooty Hill RSL—it is about 50 kilometres. It is little wonder that she has now decided to stay at the Novotel at Rooty Hill. Because of the traffic congestion it takes long amounts of time to travel in Western Sydney, and, as Senator Payne has correctly said, this is the reason why the Liberal Party is committing $1.5 billion to the West Connect project.


Today's press is, of course, very telling as to why Ms Gillard has suddenly worked out: 'Oh dear, I'd better go out to Western Sydney. I'd better go out. Not because I really want to go out there, but because the polls are so bad, and I have to worry about my own survival'. It is all this woman ever worries about—her own survival.


When she eventually does find her way out to Western Sydney, and she goes to visit the Rooty Hill RSL, perhaps she might like to have lunch there. Perhaps she might like to talk to some of the people there. I have talked to them: they have complained about the high cost of electricity because of the carbon tax, or the blow-out in the budget of the boats coming out to Australia. Many of those people out in Western Sydney came to Australia through the front door and they are not very happy about the government's lack of a proper immigration process. They also complain about the cost-of-living pressures that are hitting the families out in Western Sydney.


Perhaps after she has had lunch at the Rooty Hill RSL, she might like to walk around the corner and perhaps go and visit the aged-care facility that I visited. And instead of Minister Butler making jokes about Rooty Hill, he ought to be worried about the chaos that he has perpetrated in the aged-care system by taking $1.6 billion out of aged care. Small aged-care facilities are saying to me, 'We are not able to make ends meet and we are having difficulty with grave financial circumstances'. So, Minister Butler, instead of making jokes about Western Sydney, why don't you go and worry about the aged-care facilities that are really doing it tough and that might shut down as a consequence of your mismanagement of your own portfolio, and do not worry about other matters in Western Sydney.


Minister Conroy, in his answer to me, did not answer my question.




Senator Payne:
  His non-answer!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  His non-answer about taking cuts. While the Prime Minister is at the Rooty Hill Novotel, perhaps she might like to walk down the road 500 metres or thereabouts, and go to the Mt Druitt Hospital. Why does she not go and ask the doctors and nurses at the Mt Druitt Hospital about the impacts that the recent retrospective cuts are going to have on the health budget in New South Wales? While she is at it, perhaps she might go out to the Auburn Hospital, the Blacktown public hospital, the Campbelltown hospital, the Dundas public hospital, the Liverpool Hospital, the Nepean Hospital and Westmead Hospital, and ask them what the impact of the latest debacle in health is, and hear directly from them about what the impact is going to be on the health services out in Western Sydney. And so, as the papers are correctly saying: too little, too late; this is a stunt all about her survival. (Time expired)

  I can assure the good senators on the opposite side that I have concern for Australians across the board, and I do know where Western Sydney is, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. What I find extraordinary is that the opposition is so het up about members of the ministry going out and talking to people in Western Sydney. It is like they do not think that people in Western Sydney deserve to have this sort of access. This is what they are saying. So you have got Senator Fierravanti-Wells—




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  Der! You've just worked this out now?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, on my left!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I do not think you should be able to say 'der'. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has just cottoned on to the fact that the Prime Minister and the cabinet have conducted community cabinet meetings all over the country for years—for years. You have just worked out that they are doing this! Now you come in here with this extraordinary level of outrage because the Prime Minister is going out and talking to people who live and work in Western Sydney. Those opposite do this because they are preoccupied with negativity, and they are so caught up in the mud-slinging that they try to score cheap political points. I often listen to what Senator Payne has to say, but unfortunately she has been caught up here today—in her questions and in taking note of answers—in an extreme level of negativity. For those opposite to focus on the Prime Minister's visit in this negative way truly exposes the policy vacuum they have over there.


The Prime Minister visiting a range of electorates, as I have said, is nothing new. To speak to local people about issues is completely normal, and that is what you would expect—and that is what the government has been doing for years. Whilst visiting Western Sydney, I am sure the Prime Minister will have an opportunity to speak about many of the Labor government's policy initiatives that will benefit the people of Western Sydney. So we will not be distracted by the policy void that we find on the other side of the chamber today in the taking note of answers debate. In fact, Senator Fierravanti-Wells talked about—

  Why don't you learn how to pronounce my name properly?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Order!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Senator, you seriously need to have a good look at yourself and at your interjections. You are really getting childish—very childish.


What the senator on the opposite side does not want people to know about are the Gillard government achievements. She talked about the Prime Minister in quite a personal way, which is not unusual for Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The Prime Minister has done many good things for this country. She has been getting on with the job. She is keeping our economy strong, spreading jobs, opportunity and fairness, and helping families with modern-day pressures. The Prime Minister has provided unprecedented support for families. We have the schoolkids bonus, new payments for families and teenagers, more family tax benefits, record support for child care and help with costs like taking the kids to the dentist. What we see here today are two New South Wales senators who say that Western Sydney families and people who live in Western Sydney do not deserve a visit from the Prime Minister. It is outrageous—outrageous—and you stand condemned. (Time expired)

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:26):  I must confess that, following the contributions of my distinguished colleagues from New South Wales Senator Payne and Senator Fierravanti-Wells, as a Victorian senator I almost feel I am standing here under false pretences—but not entirely so. I did spend most of my schooling and university, and had my first job, in Sydney. I grew up in the Hills district of Sydney, which is not the western suburbs—but, for those on the North Shore line, anyone from west of Wahroonga was called a 'westie'. So I am happy to stand here as an honorary westie!


I have to say I feel for the people of Western Sydney. They are suffering under cost-of-living pressures, they are suffering as a result of chronic neglect by state and federal Labor governments in terms of infrastructure. As if that were not bad enough—and I do not know what they have done to deserve this—the New South Wales ALP head office in Sussex Street have announced that they are going to relocate to Parramatta. In a brilliant electoral strategy by the New South Wales Labor Party, they are bringing to Parramatta, to Western Sydney, the outfit that brought you Eddie Obeid, Ian Macdonald, and the revolving door of leadership in that state! What have the people of New South Wales done to deserve that? I do not know. 


Advancing that move by the Sussex Street head office is the Prime Minister herself. I do not know what the people of Western Sydney have done to deserve what I guess we must call 'a prime ministerial progress' through Western Sydney. It brings back the idea of the Elizabethan progress of Elizabeth I, where she deigned to leave London and go out into the extremities of the nation. I am not sure if it is an Elizabethan progress or if it has a little more to do with that TV series Entourage. According to the Rooty Hill RSL general manager, the Prime Minister will have an entourage of more than 10 people when she checks in for her minicampaign. It is a peculiar thing.


I notice Senator Faulkner has arrived in the chamber. So far, Senator Faulkner has shown the good judgement and common sense not to rise in this place to defend the progress of the Prime Minister through Western Sydney; nor for that matter has Senator Stephens—both two of the more highly regarded senators in this place. But I hope Senator Faulkner is not about to disappoint me.


Senator Payne touched on a contribution from Mr Mark Butler. He was asked by Matt Abraham on Adelaide radio:


The Rooty Hill experiment, Mark Butler, not to put too fine a point on it. Is it a sign of a party that thinks it's rooted?


That last word was his, not mine. Mr Butler replied:


There are so many different sort of double entendres you can do with this place. I stay at the Penrith Panthers when I'm in western Sydney because I'm not sure I could check into the Rooty Hill RSL with a straight face. It just conjures up all these sort of Carry On films and Benny Hill episodes and Carry On Governing filmed at the Rooty Hill RSL.


The government itself cannot take this particular exercise seriously. It has become a matter of high farce.


But, what will not be a matter of high farce is when the Prime Minister meets the people of Western Sydney. It will not be pleasant, because on 12 August 2010—the last campaign—the Prime Minister, at the Rooty Hill RSL, told the people of Western Sydney at that gathering that she stood for cutting company tax, that taxpayers would get an automatic tax deduction of $500 rising to $1,000, that she would involve the community to get a consensus on climate change, that Australia's net debt would not exceed six per cent of GDP and that she would bring the budget back into surplus in 2013.


Given the Prime Minister has broken each and every one of those promises, all I can assume is that she is going to Western Sydney to say to the people of Western Sydney, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I misled you. I broke every commitment I made to you and now I throw myself upon your mercy'.


But one thing we on this side of the chamber know for sure is that in Western Sydney, for the Prime Minister, there will be no mercy.(Time expired)

The PRESIDENT
 (15:37):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 8 February 2013 of John Joseph Morris, a senator for the state of New South Wales from 1985 to 1990.


I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate.




Senator CONROY:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 8 February 2013, of John Joseph Morris, former senator for New South Wales, places on record its appreciation of his public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


John Morris was born on 12 June 1936 at Young Wallsend, New South Wales and died on 8 February 2013. From a young age John was a passionate member of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia, New South Wales branch. He held the positions of organiser from 1966 to 1970, secretary from 1970 to 1981 and president from 1981. John was also the national President of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia in the 1970s and again in the 1980s. Among the other trade union positions he held during the period, John was a member of the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions; World President of the Hotel and Catering Group Board and President of the International Union of Food and Allied Workers Association, Asia-Pacific Region.


With this strong union background, John was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1976 and served that parliament for eight years before resigning in 1984. In the same year he was elected as a senator for New South Wales. He began his term in mid-1985 and retired in June 1990. John was on a number of parliamentary committees and served as Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and Chair of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. John was also a temporary chairman of committees from 1987 until his retirement in June 1990. On behalf of the government I offer condolences to his wife, Margaret, and his family.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  One thing is true, and that is that there have been few kind words spoken about former Senator John Morris in this place. But it is also true John Morris did not have many kind words to say about the Senate. He and the Senate were not a good fit. I served with John from April 1989 to June 1990. My parliamentary career was in its infancy; John's was disappearing.


I got to know John, or Johnny as we used to call each other, in my earliest days as a Labor Party official in New South Wales, many years before I became a senator. He was then, as we have heard, New South Wales Secretary of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia. It was John Morris whose 'New Deal' team was the driving force in wresting control of the union from its Stalinist leadership in 1970. Under John Morris, the liquor trade union became extreme right wing. By the late 1970s, John Morris was not only a right-winger but an enthusiast in the unceasing war against the left; but a realignment began in 1980 when John Morris was a member of the New South Wales council. I thought this afternoon, Mr President, I might share some of the background of that with the Senate.


Legislative councillors were moving in to the brand-new office building at the back of the New South Wales parliament. These offices were wonderful beyond all imagining; but some were more wonderful than others. The prized offices faced the Domain—they offered a view of park and trees; but there were five offices on the Macquarie Street side with a view of nothing. The Labor leadership and the Legislative Council conducted a draw from a hat for the five undesirable offices; the usual story—no witnesses. Whose were the five names that came out? No surprise—all three left-wingers in the legislative council, of course; also, Jim Kaldis—although a right-winger, he had no power base in the machine so apparently he did not matter; and the last name drawn out was John Morris, MLC. Oh dear, oh dear. It was on for young and old. John, not unreasonably, asked, 'What are the odds of this happening?' He was heard to say from that point on: 'All bets are off.' John Morris was also repudiated as a candidate for president of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party by the New South Wales right machine. He should have known that there are no rewards for unquestioning loyalty.


Out of these slights grew major intrafactional tensions within the New South Wales right. I remember them well because negotiations with the liquor trade union represented my blooding in terms of leadership responsibilities in the New South Wales left. I had just been selected to succeed Bruce Childs as assistant general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party; Bruce was coming to the Senate.


I immodestly mention here that I prevailed without a ballot over one Ian Macdonald. You may have heard of him. He has been prominent in a current New South Wales Independent Commission against Corruption public inquiry. My victory was remarkable, because Macdonald was a self-proclaimed Marxist, when I was not.


The favoured place for negotiations with John Morris and his team was always a private room at a Chinese restaurant. These occasions were a spectacle to behold. The food kept on coming. But that was nothing compared to the wine and beer that disappeared. The leader of the left in New South Wales, Deputy Premier Jack Ferguson, was a more than active participant in the negotiations. One remarkable exchange, given all the New South Wales Right's shenanigans and history, occurred when John Morris said to Jack about the right, 'Jack, when you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas.' Jack's response was: 'Then you turn on the hose and wash the fleas off.'


Apart from myself and Rodney Cavalier, the other left negotiators, I can assure you, manfully matched the Liquor Trades boys drink for drink. In fact, Rodney's sobriety afforded him the second sight that enabled him to reconstruct these events later, and I am indebted to him for sharing his reflections.


From the left's perspective the aim of the negotiations was to restore the proportional representation voting system for the preselection of members of the Legislative Council, taken away in a ruthless power grab in 1977. The Liquor Trades Union forces, by then the self-styled 'Rank and File Committee', were confident of a quota in their own right. A complex deal was done that resulted in a realignment at the party's annual conference as well as the usual series of doublecrosses in two state preselection ballots. Of course, they turned into a triple-cross with, as so often happens, the usual stitch-up of the very naive.


All of this was very deep secret at the time, less so today, 27 February 2013, as a result of this condolence motion. The association between the New South Wales left and John Morris and the Liquor Trades Union did not last long. Within a couple of years the natural order of things had been restored. John Morris and the liquor trades were back in the fold.


In a major article in the Sydney Morning Herald in May 1990, Marian Wilkinson and Kate McClymont described it thus:


In 1984, in exchange for his Union's loyalty to the ruling right-wing faction in the Labor Party, Mr Morris demanded—and was given—a safe seat in the Senate. It was classic accommodation of interests.


Inevitably John Morris's Senate career will be remembered not for what it was but for what it was not. He was, of course, as we know, tagged 'the silent senator'. It stuck. He did not enjoy working on Senate committees. We served together for eight months on Senate estimates committee E. For the new senators in this chamber, I can explain to you that that was a committee which examined the then Department of Administrative Services, the Attorney-General's Department and the then Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. He hated it, but he did attend the meetings.


It is true he only made four speeches in the six years he served in this place. His first speech in 1985; a matter of public importance speech, also in 1985; and two adjournment speeches in June 1989, just a couple of months after I had been sworn in as a senator. The chorus of criticism grew. At the time I did what I could to assist John and his then staffer, Peter James, who spoke warmly and eloquently at John's funeral. Why did I help? It is time to own up.


Inevitably, anyone like me who has been in the ALP for over 40 years, who has been a party official and has been preselected by the party to run for public office has contested a few ballots along the way. On a couple of occasions in my career John Morris, and the trade union block votes he controlled, broke the New South Wales right-wing ticket and voted for me. It is a long time ago, but I do not forget those things.


John Morris came from another time and another place. When he became a New South Wales legislative councillor all members of that chamber were appointed, not elected. Most Labor MLCs were trade union officials who retained their full-time jobs outside the parliament. I am certain that parliamentary responsibilities were not at the forefront of their minds. In fact, I am very confident most never considered their parliamentary duties as a primary responsibility or even most pressing concern. That was John Morris's background. But that approach could not and did not work here in the Senate.


While John Morris might never have been at home in the Senate, he certainly was at the greyhounds. He died earlier this month doing what he loved at the track. To his family—and he was very close to his family—and to his friends I express my sincere sympathy.

  I wanted to take this opportunity to remember for a moment the late Senator Jeannie Ferris. She was the Government Whip when I first came into the Senate, and she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in October 2005. She fought a very brave battle, which she lost in 2007. During that period she took the opportunity to move for an inquiry into gynaecological cancers in Australia, and as a result of that report, which recommended more funding for these cancers, awareness was raised. In the spirit of Senator Cash's motion, it points out that early diagnosis is a critical component and I wanted to remember the late Senator Ferris's efforts in raising awareness, in that very difficult time in her life, of the importance of early diagnosis.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (16:18):  This latest funding debacle had its origins in the various versions of the so-called health reform proposal. The funding authority was included in the April 2010 version of the National Health and Hospital Networks Agreement but, with the ink barely dry, it was scrapped by Minister Roxon, who stated that we did not need to increase the size of the bureaucracy; it was appropriate for us to establish an authority without the need to do so. This was supposed to be the centrepiece of transparency for the so-called health reforms—and it was dumped with the ink barely dry. Then it was reinstated in the 2011 version and it actually became nine pool accounts in the August 2011 version, which eventually was enacted as the National Health Funding Body in 2012 to supposedly introduce unparalleled transparency into public hospital funding. In going out of her way to say that she is going to fund the hospitals directly, the Prime Minister is now acting contrary to her own legislation in funding the Victorian hospitals directly. 


All of this chaos is in addition to all the other cuts that we have seen by Labor over the years: the $1.6 billion ripped out of public hospitals, the $4 billion ripped out of private health insurance, the $1 billion ripped out of dental health through the closure of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, the seven GP super clinics that were promised but were never even opened, and the list goes on. 


I would like to remind those opposite of this document—which of course they want to forget: New directions for Australian health: taking responsibility: Labor's plan for ending the blame game on health and hospital care, by Kevin Rudd. And there is a picture of Kevin Rudd smiling. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Fierravanti-Wells, refer to Mr Rudd as Mr Kevin Rudd.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  There he is smiling—Mr Kevin Rudd. This document is co-authored by Mr Rudd and Ms Roxon. Of course, we know what Ms Roxon really thinks about Mr Rudd, and she was very vocal in telling us so. Goodness only knows what they told each other in those hundred photo shoots that they did together. Let us look at what has happened with this debacle about the funding cuts midstream. We know that Labor has established dozens of new bureaucracies since coming to office, at a cost of $1 billion. So when we look at this latest issue with the states, the health minister will not explain the Commonwealth cuts. All she is doing is making accusations about the states and targeting Victoria and Queensland. 


Labor's excuse about the variation in population growth has been debunked by the hapless Treasurer himself.


In the health funding determination, the Treasurer used a population growth figure for Australia of just 0.03 per cent. However, for an earlier determination for local government funding, he used a growth figure of 1.4 per cent, which is consistent with publically available ABS data. 


The minister needs to stop playing the blame game, quickly review the Treasurer's determination and negotiate a resolution with the states. The matter needs to be resolved quickly, before even more damage is done. As a consequence of the funding cuts which have been made part way through the financial year, people were sent letters telling them that their elective surgery was going to be cancelled; nurses and doctors were put off; beds were closed. And, despite the reversal, enormous damage has been done. This latest fiasco in health just demonstrates that this is a Prime Minister who cannot keep her promises. In this space of health they have absolutely no credibility. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2013-02-27,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:23):  This debate has been a very frustrating one. Full of huff and bluster, lots of hand wringing, lots of finger pointing: 'It's your fault'; 'No, it's your fault'; 'It's the states'; It's the Commonwealth's responsibility'; 'It's Labor's fault'; 'It's the Liberal's fault'. I think what is forgotten in all of this is what this means for patients. 


Let's get back to what this actually means. It means the closure of the emergency department in Colac overnight. It means that in the Peter James Centre in Burwood people who are waiting to get a bed so they can have rehabilitation for their stroke cannot get one. It means that a hospital like the Austin Hospital, which does such great work, originally budgets a $2 million surplus then suddenly finds itself with a $4 million deficit. Spokespeople report that that means 800 fewer operations at that hospital in order to make those savings. For Barwon Health it means the closure of a number of beds at Geelong Hospital. It means potentially the closure of more emergency departments. At Peter MacCallum, it means the closure of 16 beds—announced in February. At Royal Melbourne, it effectively means cuts to 700 operations. At the Royal Children's Hospital and at the Northern Hospital a series of planned expansions are being cut. 


What this whole debacle means is that people who are waiting for urgent treatment are no longer going to get it. When you strip away all of the huff and the bluster, the finger pointing, the hand wringing, the 'It's your fault,' 'No, it's your fault', what you get is an issue that affects people's lives. We have to fix it. How are we going to fix it? 


Firstly, let's work out what has actually happened. It can be summarised in a few short sentences. We have seen state governments underinvest in our public hospital system, particularly in the states of Queensland and Victoria. That is, I think, not in dispute. But we have also seen the sudden withdrawal of funding by the Commonwealth government from the public hospital system. 


It is a very simple proposition. A number of state governments are underinvesting in health care, and then in December this year we see the Commonwealth government pull out $1.5 billion over the forward estimates. When you have a simple proposition like that, how is it that we hear arguments that allow both the state and federal governments to escape responsibility for their share of the problem? The lesson is: if you muddy the waters enough, you can get away with saying or doing anything.


Let's strip this back. In question time today we heard Senator Conroy say that the Commonwealth share of hospital funding is increasing. He is absolutely right. But that is not the relevant point. The relevant point is that the states are now confronted with the proposition that they are going to get a reduction in funding compared to what they were promised. So, sure, the Commonwealth share of funding is increasing, but it has increased by less than what was promised to the states. That is effectively a cut. Let's say I negotiate a pay increase with my employer. I take out a mortgage based on that new pay increase. Then, a year later, I find out that I cannot pay the mortgage, because the employer says: 'Well, I am not going to give you as much as I said I was going to give you. I gave you a little bit more, but you are not going to get quite as much as I promised you.' That is a cut. That is what has happened here. 


Why have they done it? Why has the Commonwealth cut back on funding to hospitals? The answer is a little complicated but not very complicated. The Commonwealth has based its reasoning on a change in population. The government's argument is: population has not changed much and therefore we are not going to increase the funding as was promised. It is able to get away with that claim because it has compared two different population datasets. In 2011 the census changed the way it would ultimately establish population number. So there was a change between 2006 and 2011 in the way we estimate population. 


What the government has done is, instead of comparing like with like, essentially compare population changes using the old approach for one and the new approach for another. That is a maths 101 error. It is a straightforward mistake and it is despite the recommendations from the ABS, the Australian Statistician, that we should be comparing like with like, that we should be using the new population estimates and comparing those using the same dataset. By doing that, the government has been able to strip away $1.5 billion worth of funding that was promised to the states over four years. Sure, it is going to increase its commitment, but it is still a reduction on what was promised. 


The other part of this equation is this thing known as the health price index or health inflation. Health inflation is another measure that determines how much money is being paid by the states.


Unfortunately, we have a health price index, or an inflation measure, that does not actually reflect the cost of running a hospital. The health price index brings in all these other costs that have absolutely nothing to do with running a hospital. That is why, for example, private health premiums are going up by five per cent based on health inflation and yet, when it comes to public hospitals, we have a health inflation figure of 0.9 per cent, despite the fact that wages—by far the biggest cost of running a public hospital system—have gone up by in the order of three per cent. So we have got two important factors here. We have got the population data, which is wrong, and we have got the health inflation index, which does not reflect the cost of running a hospital.


On the back of those two things, the Commonwealth has pulled out the money that was promised to the states. But, worst of all, if that were not bad enough, halfway through the financial year, after hospitals planned their budget, worked out how many operations they were going to do, got staff employed and got everything lined up—being good corporate citizens—the government says, 'Guess what? We are going to pull away some of your funding; you need to find savings. And not just that—we are not going to pull away just this year's funding; we are going to go back to the year before and in Victoria take out $40 million from the previous year.' Again, to take the analogy of the pay cut: you negotiate a pay increase with your employer and he comes back a year later and says, 'Guess what? I am not going to pay you as much as I said I was going to pay you—but, even worse than that, I am going to deduct pay from the year before.' That is what has happened here, and it is not acceptable.


What is welcome is that the government in Victoria decided to restore $107 million worth of funding. That is absolutely welcomed. But the government has continued to play politics here. Rather than doing what it should do and give the money through its own agreed National Health Reform Agreement, which is a central funding pool jointly owned by the states and the Commonwealth, it has decided to bypass the states, undermining its own agreement, and fund the hospitals directly so that it can continue playing this ridiculous blame game—'It's your fault'; 'No, it's your fault.' It is not good enough.


What we have is a situation now where we do not know how the money is going to be paid to these hospitals. Who is going to oversee it? Are they going to get it in a block? Is it going to be paid out in dribs and drabs? How is that money going to be paid? We have doubts over the constitutional validity of how that money should be paid. We know that some of the money is not coming from additional Commonwealth spend and that we are in fact rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic and some of the money that was originally allocated to Victoria for national occupational health and safety reforms is going to go to plug the shortfall.


So what we are seeing is an effort to continue the blame game, rather than a genuine effort to resolve the issue. The responsible approach would have been, 'Look; we misinterpreted the ABS data. We have a health inflation index that does not reflect the cost of running a hospital. We are going to fix it. We are not going to fix it by this short-term political fix in Victoria; what we are going to do is restore funding to all states and not just for this year but over the forward estimates.' That is the right thing to do.


In the end it is the people who miss out. It means that somebody who was going to get their hip done next week might not be able to get it done for another six months. It means that the kid with asthma who is in an emergency department might not be seen immediately but might have to wait two, three or four hours.


The only little ray of light in all of this is that we are going to move to a new way of funding our hospital system. We are going to get an independent umpire. It is two years away. It cannot come soon enough, because this spectacle has been particularly unedifying.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:33):  The opposition's criticism of the government's approach to the health sector is one of the most hypocritical and disingenuous claims that I have heard since I have been in this chamber. The National Health Reform Agreement, announced in partnership with states and territories on 2 August 2011, is a huge step towards a better health policy for this country. The agreement increases publically available information to enable a proper comparison of health service performance and ensures more transparent funding of public hospitals based on services delivered. In addition to this, it substantially enhances access to care to drive improved efficiency.


For the first time, Commonwealth funding will be directly linked to the actual level of services delivered by public hospitals, with funding flowing from the National Health Funding Pool directly to local hospital networks. From 2014-15 Commonwealth public hospital funding will be completely uncapped and based solely on activity levels. States will not simply get lump sums of cash but will be paid according to the work done by the hospitals—so that, as service levels and costs rise, Commonwealth funding will rise as well. The agreement will result in an extra $19.8 billion spent on public hospitals through to 2020 and a total of $175 billion to 2030. It is also worth remembering that the agreement carries a pledge of accelerated emergency department treatment and substantial cuts to elective surgery waiting lists, so that all Australians receive the care they need without lengthy delays.


The adjustment in Commonwealth funding to the states, announced by the Commonwealth Treasury on 3 November 2012, was undertaken in accordance with the terms of the Health Reform Agreement. In the first two transition years of the agreement, Commonwealth funding variations may occur based on the application of the agreed funding formula set out in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. The formula is calculated with reference to growth in population estimates provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a health price index provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and a fixed technology factor. When they signed the agreement, every jurisdiction approved this formula which reflects the costs of delivering public hospital services. There is no grand conspiracy; the adjustment was simply made in accordance with an agreed formula.


Last week in Melbourne the Finance and Public Administration References Committee's hearing into the implementation of the Health Reform Agreement heard that numerous false allegations have been thrown at the government. The Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu and his health minister, David Davis, in particular, have been quick to blame the woes of their inept leadership and lack of commitment to health funding on the Gillard government. Commonwealth funding to the state of Victoria is increasing by $900 million over the next few years. With such a comprehensive increase, it really is incredible that the Victorian government cannot take care of the state's health system.


Instead, the Victorian government budget papers show significant cuts to health funding by the Baillieu government in both 2011-12 and 2012-13 of some $616 million. Elective surgery waiting lists have reached a record high of 46,131. I note that this is 7,000 more than when the Premier came to office. However, they are not owning up to their mismanagement of the state's health sector. Instead, as the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing Federation informed the committee, the Victorian government is using the recent Commonwealth funding adjustments as a smokescreen to hide their own massive cuts to the state's health sector.


It is important to bear in mind that the Victorian Liberal government has not, since June 2012, issued its quarterly reports of elective surgery waiting lists and emergency department waiting times. It has not, as is customary, entered into a statement of priorities with the state Department of Health to indicate what services they intend to provide. The Baillieu government has also failed to provide the independent Health Reform Agreement administrator and the National Health Funding Pool with details on how it is allocating the Commonwealth funding. None of this information has been forthcoming. The reason it has not been forthcoming is that cuts to services were already intended. The Health Reform Agreement funding adjustment has presented the Victorian Liberals with the opportunity to cynically blame the Gillard government for their own failures.


That is why the Victorian Premier and his health minister cannot be trusted. That is why the emergency $107 million health rescue package for Victoria's crippled health system, announced by the Minister for Health last week, will sidestep the Baillieu government and be handed directly to local hospital networks. Those funds will be an enormous relief to those who work in the Victorian health system and to all Victorians who rely on the state's health services. But it should never have come to this.


As the health minister said herself last week, the Baillieu government has proven itself to be a cruel and incompetent manager of the Victorian health system. But of course the Victorian Liberal government is not the first Liberal government to grossly mismanage health priorities and expenditure. Those opposite me in the chamber serve under a Leader of the Opposition—Mr Tony Abbott—who, as health minister during the Howard government years, saw $1 billion dollars cut out of public hospitals. That is enough to pay for 1,000 hospital beds.


If Mr Abbott was to become Prime Minister, we know the coalition would cut emergency departments, cut elective surgery improvements, cut GP superclinics, cut after-hours services, cut local control and cut the 24-hour telephone GP help line. How do we know this? Because that is their history—we saw it when John Howard and his government were in power for 12 years.


The shadow minister for health said in November last year that jobs would be slashed from the health department and portfolio agencies. Do not forget that he also announced that jobs were to be cut from Medicare Locals, which were established to coordinate primary healthcare delivery and confront crucial service gaps. Under the opposition, how many social workers would remain, how many outreach workers would remain and how many Aboriginal health workers would remain? Just who would be safe if the opposition were to make their cuts? We know that, if they get onto the government benches, that is exactly what they will do.


The opposition leader has taken several swipes at the components of the nation's health architecture which ensure transparent and effective health funding. That includes the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, the National Health Performance Authority and local hospital networks. These bodies, which may be abolished if the opposition leader has his way, actually deliver the reforms that our health system needs. These are the health systems that our country needs.


The opposition leader has many questions to answer, but we know he has no answers. His solution to the issues confronting health services is to just cut—cut jobs and services. If you support the principle of activities based funding then why don't you provide unqualified support for an independent authority to identify the services which are being paid for? If you are committed to improving transparency and accountability in the health system and making sure Australians have access to information about health services then surely you would want to continue with an independent agency to crunch the data and publish the reports. If you agree that decisions on health should be made, where practicable, by local communities then surely you would to retain local hospital networks which achieve this purpose. I know, from my home state of Tasmania, how effectively they are working. These bodies are not examples of bloated bureaucracies; they are valuable tools in the nation's health system and they ensure that money is spent by those who know where the services need to be.


The government is committed to the National Health Reform Agreement and to making sure that every Australian receives the health services they need. When the opposition leader was health minister, bulk-billing rates were 67 per cent. Today, the rates are over 81 per cent. A record 1,100 GPs were trained this year. When the opposition leader was in charge, training places were capped at 600. We have made medicines cheaper so that Australians can afford drugs for conditions such as high cholesterol and diabetes. We have established a $4.6 billion public dental scheme to assist children and low-income earners. We have introduced plain-packaging reforms and extended the Gardasil vaccine to boys. We have means-tested the private health insurance rebate and built GP superclinics. We are ensuring that the future health needs of Australians are being met, and we are ensuring that there is less waste and increased transparency and accountability—unlike those opposite, who only oppose these reforms.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (16:43):  I would like to commend Senator Di Natale for his well-reasoned and well-thought-out slamming of this government's current handling of the—



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BOYCE:
  I think I should take that interjection from Senator Wong: 'A unity ticket between the Greens and the coalition.' They cannot cop criticism over there. They are very upset with the trial separation that they are currently undergoing with their friends from the Greens. But it is good to have someone with Senator Di Natale's background and analytical skills looking at this area—the contribution that we just had from Senator Polley was just nonsense—as the current funding situation has developed.


We are here talking about Labor's waste and mismanagement, and the chaos caused in the health sector. None of that should come as a surprise to anybody dealing with this government. Waste and mismanagement is their middle name. But the thing about this particular little effort that really stunned all the state health ministers was the fact that the funding cuts were in part retrospective. As the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Lawrence Springborg, has pointed out, they were going back to grab money off procedures that had happened 18 months earlier. It is just inconceivable that Ms Plibersek, as Minister for Health, thought that she could drivel her way out of this by talking about 'over the next four years' without mentioning what had happened.


Let us look at the much-vaunted National Health and Hospital Reform package. Let us look at the national partnership agreement. One would have thought, as Senator Di Natale said, if you were going to backdate a wage decrease to someone you had a national partnership agreement with, you would have told them. But it was in the detail of the MYEFO late last year where the health ministers found out what they had lost. If you look at those figures, it is just startling to think about how much money has been ripped off. 


Victoria has had $107 million restored. Well, Queensland would like its $103 million restored, although that is only a part of the $382 million that has been taken out of our health budget over the next four years. If you look at the results of that, it is shocking. The Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service in Queensland has lost $6½ million. In Brisbane, Metro North has lost $22½ million and Metro South has lost $18.8 million. Did we get any comments at all from the Queensland Leader of the Opposition about the fact that this money has been pulled out of Metro South? You would have thought the member for Inala cared about the fact that the federal government has taken almost $19 million out of the hospital and health services in her area—but no, nothing. Townsville has lost $7.8 million. Probably even more disturbing, the Torres Strait northern peninsular, which of course everyone knows is such a well serviced area, and I am being sarcastic in saying that, have lost $1 million out of their budget.


I suppose, as I said, there is no surprise in the waste and mismanagement aspect of this problem. This government have set up 12 new health bureaucracies over the past five years, but they promised 16 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres. Guess how many of those they have delivered? They have delivered none, none at all. There has been nothing delivered there, just more bureaucracy. They seem to think they can get away with using the state health budgets and talking drivel, as I said earlier, about the effects without anyone objecting. And there is the blame game. When Mr Lawrence Springborg in Queensland was talking about the half-cocked approach that Ms Plibersek was taking to this, he said: 'Just give us the $103 million. I don't care if you break the COAG agreement, just somehow put it back into our health budget.' What a disaster.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (16:48):  I rise to participate in this MPI debate on Australia's health system and to comment on the great leadership displayed by federal Labor health ministers Plibersek and previously Roxon, particularly in my home state of Tasmania—leadership that stands in stark contrast to that of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister of our country for the years leading up to the 2007 election. This was a time when over $1 billion was ripped out of Australia's health system by the Howard coalition government. During a time when the mining boom was delivering them more cash than they knew what to do with, their priorities are laid bare in that fact. Contrast this mismanagement and spin with Labor's firm priority to deliver better results for patients and their families. I want to read for the Senate a letter to the editor in today's Advocate from my local area, concerning the quality of health care in Tasmania. It states:


Last Friday week at 3 am, I suffered a major heart attack at Penguin. 


My wife drove me to the Burnie hospital where I was assessed and given first-line treatment and when I was stable, it was decided to evacuate me to the Hobart hospital for specialist treatment. 


Unfortunately there were no beds available so I was sent by the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Launceston, where I was seen by specialist staff and by 8am had had a stent placed in my heart. 


After a few days of wonderful treatment, I was discharged to enjoy the remainder of my holiday in your state.


This guy's letter continues:


All I can say as a visitor from Queensland, thank you very much to the health services of Tasmania and the professional staff. 


I want to thank Mr Baltokiewicz for writing this letter and to wish him well in his recovery. I hope that he travels with his wife again to Tasmania soon.


I, too, want to thank the wonderful staff at the Burnie and Launceston hospitals who treated this patient within five hours. This is hardly a health system in disarray. This letter highlights that in this instance Tasmania's health system delivered satisfactorily. Everyone on both sides accepts that there are ongoing stresses to the health system across Australia. We Australians want and need a federal government that makes the tough decisions and steps in where required. 


In Tasmania, the federal Labor government acted last year to provide a $325 million assistance package to boost access to health care. The package will boost the healthcare outcomes for all Tasmanians. This is a state that has the oldest population and whose population demographic is ageing the fastest. Just yesterday the preliminary report on improving the delivery of health services for Tasmanian patients was released. Developed by the Commission on Delivery of Health Services in Tasmania, the report addresses the key stresses in my state's health system, highlights community suggestions and sets the direction for 2013.


The commission was set up through the assistance package and is tasked with advising the state and federal governments on how best to redesign the state's health services to help better manage current and future pressures.


Labor is committed to making plans for the future and delivering quality services for all Australians. Health has definitely been a major topic in the Advocate this week, with Tuesday's front page dedicated to the start of physical works at the North West Regional Cancer Centre. This cancer centre, a 2010 Labor election commitment, will provide a treatment facility closer to home for the 600 north-west Tasmanians who are diagnosed with cancer every year. It has taken around 18 months to prepare the site and construction is scheduled for completion by the end of 2014. The centre will be operational in 2016 after the linear accelerator goes live.


Other Labor election commitments delivered for north-west Tasmanians are the GP superclinics at Burnie and Devonport and the revitalisation of the Mersey Community Hospital. These superclinics, which would be scrapped by the opposition, provide a fantastic level of care across a range of front-line services, taking some of the burden off our region's emergency departments. In Latrobe, Labor has invested over $200 million on upgrading and running the Mersey Community Hospital. The upgrades, completed over the past few years, have delivered a state-of-the-art emergency department and outpatients unit as well as a new high-dependency unit. The evidence from Tasmania highlights that, as all Australians know, the only party who can be trusted to deliver a quality public healthcare system is Labor.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:54):  I rise to speak in support of this matter of public importance and to condemn Labor's waste and mismanagement and the chaos caused in the health sector, especially through retrospective funding cuts. Labor should be ashamed of its lack of care and lack of concern for the health and wellbeing of Australians using the public health system. Let us be clear, Labor is undermining our health system on a number of fronts. Let me name just three. Firstly, Labor is contravening the National Health Reform Agreement by rebasing funding under the agreement and then moving to fund hospitals directly instead of through the states. Secondly, Labor is increasing uncertainty about whether it plans to expand and improve health and hospital services and whether these plans can actually be funded—we know you cannot have a health plan without funding certainty. Finally, Labor is constantly undermining the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, meaning increased costs for Australian families.


The federal Labor government's failure to honour the National Health Reform Agreement by reducing the funding and beginning direct funding of hospitals is bad policy. For Western Australia this is seriously bad policy, and I understand that the negative impact could be in the order of almost $100 million over the period to 2015-16—funding that is much needed to support a growing WA population with unique challenges of providing health services over a vast geographic area. The WA government has given effect to the National Health Reform Agreement, which Western Australia agreed to in August 2011 along with other states and territories and the Commonwealth.


Some background is necessary to understand the complexity of health funding in Australia. In the Western Australian context, for 2012-13 and 2013-14 this arrangement will not result in any different funding outcome for the state, other than under the current national healthcare agreement. However, from 2014-15 the Commonwealth's funding for public hospital services in Western Australia will vary on the quantum of activity delivered. From 2014-15 the Commonwealth will fund 45 per cent of the efficient cost of the growth in public hospital services over the preceding year. From 2017-18 this proportion will increase to 50 per cent. But this is the critical point: it is important to understand that this does not mean that the Commonwealth will become an equal partner with the state in the funding of public hospital services. This point has been made particularly clear by our state health minister. This is the case for two reasons. Firstly, the arrangement commencing in 2014-15 does nothing to address the current gross inequity in state and Commonwealth funding shares for public hospital services in Western Australia; it only applies to activity growth from that point forward. Secondly, the Commonwealth's funding of the growth in public hospital activity will be determined by the relevant proportion of a national efficient price to be determined by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. If the pricing authority's modelling fails to take into account the significant and legitimate cost of disabilities involved in the delivery of services in a state the size of Western Australia, the state will again be left to meet the shortfall in funding.


The improvements that we may have expected to see as a result of the introduction of activity based funding are now at risk of being lost. If you do not want to believe the coalition, that might be okay. If you do not want to believe the Greens and you do not want to believe Labor, that might be okay. But you might just want to read an editorial from the Financial Review earlier this week. It said:


However, these incremental improvements—


referring specifically to the benefits of activity based funding—


now look likely to fall victim to Labor's poor economic management. Desperate for budget savings in this year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Gillard government used revised population estimates to cut $1.6 billion in hospital funding.


So the issue is serious and detrimental to our state.


There is much that I can say in regard to this, but let me just make one final comment. Less than two weeks ago, in Perth, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, made an important statement. He said: 'The Barnett government has become a model for all the governments we run, or hope to run, right around the country.' Importantly, he said how much he would like to model himself on the WA Premier. 'In the area of delivering quality health services Labor has failed Australians. Only the coalition can deliver us a better health system. Only the coalition can properly meet the challenging needs of Australia, especially in health and ageing. There is much to learn from Colin Barnett and the WA Liberals.'

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  We have hit a new low in this place with the notion that we are debating today; and it is ironic, it is Orwellian and it is downright offensive to the people of New South Wales, the constituents I represent in this place, because it is actually the complete opposite of what is occurring in reality. One need only look at today's Sydney newspaper headlines to see exactly what is going on in the New South Wales health system. I refer to an article by Alicia Wood in today's Daily Telegraph with the headline 'Ward and bed cuts at Prince of Wales Hospital'. The article reads:


The state government plans to close a ward and slash 26 beds at Randwick's Prince of Wales Hospital despite assurances that frontline health services would remain intact.


The article goes on:


Staff were advised by an email from Patrick Bolton, the director of clinical services, who said hospital management was ""required"" to cut bed numbers, close a ward and reduce staffing costs.


That is from today's newspaper. That is what is occurring in New South Wales. Another article from today's newspaper, this time in the Australianwith the headline, 'Prince of Wales loses 26 beds.' It reads:


The NSW health department says it's ""consolidating"" beds at a leading Sydney hospital but if refusing to comment on claims that 26 beds have been lost.


This follows up from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Shaun Nichols of 14 September last year. The headline is, 'Health budget slashed by $3 billion.' It reads:


Thousands of jobs may be axed from the NSW health service as part of deep budget cuts confirmed by the NSW Health Minister, Jillian Skinner.


Just days after the Education Minister, Adrian Piccoli, announced a $1.7 billion funding cut in his department, Mrs Skinner confirmed this morning that $3 billion would be cut from NSW health over the next four years.


They are the facts. This is exactly what is happening in my state of New South Wales. They come in here and seek to blame these health cuts on the federal government when the government is actually increasing funding to the states. In New South Wales, they have increased funding over the next four years to the tune of $1.1 billion—an extra 23 per cent of the base funding for New South Wales. But despite that, the New South Wales government is taking that money and cutting services in particular areas. If you think that the public is unaware of this, those opposite, then you are kidding yourself.


I was alerted to a Facebook page which has been set up in the wake of the health cuts in New South Wales. The Facebook page goes under the name of 'Save Prince of Wales Hospital from Budget Cuts'. I encourage members of the public who are concerned about health cuts in the Randwick and eastern suburbs area of Sydney to visit this particular website and post their opposition. I want to read some of the comments that have been posted on this website by members of the public who understand what these cuts to health services that have been undertaken by the New South Wales government will mean for them.


Belinda Mahony posted on 23 February, 'We actually need more hospitals. Too many people now. Not closure. It is a disgrace what these pen pushers are doing'. Another person posted on 23 February, 'Heard on the radio this morning that Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner got a $50,000 pay rise, and our local hospital, Prince of Wales, is having bed closures and job cuts. Hope our pollies realise this is not the way to go and get their priorities right in serving the people of our great state New South Wales.' They are some of the some of the comments of members of the public. Another one on 22 February, 'And it has started. Bed closures at Prince of Wales Hospital. Prince of Wales Hospital services patients from all over New South Wales. Emergency will be backlogged, elective surgery list will increase.' And it continues with a post from Lyn Williams on 21 February. Lyn Williams is a woman I have much regard for, and who has made representations to me about the concern that she has. She is in a wheelchair and relies heavily on the hydrotherapy pool at Prince of Wales Hospital. That is now under threat because of the cuts to health services in New South Wales. She posts, 'Every day, I hope and pray that sanity prevails and that Minister Skinner reconsiders any planned privatisation of the hydrotherapy pool which I need for my physical and mental wellbeing. Being in a wheelchair is a steep learning and it turns your life on its head. The things I once took for granted came to a crashing halt. I would ask Minister Skinner and the Prince of Wales Hospital board to wheel a mile in my shoes.' Again, another post this time from 20 February: 'Please Minister Skinner, reconsider these cutbacks as, unfortunately, I need my local Prince of Wales Hospital and outpatient hydrotherapy pool.'


They are the facts. This is the voice of the people of New South Wales. These are the people who are facing service cuts to health provisions within their community. Yet, those opposite seek to come in here and waste this parliament's time and move this particular motion. I have had representations from people in my community—from the elderly, from the disabled—who rely on these health services on a daily basis, and they are really concerned. I find it disrespectful that these people, who are facing cuts to their health services and who are distraught, have this motion moved as an insult to the work that they are doing in my community in trying to ensure that health services are not cut. This motion is lazy, it is tardy and it is not factual. In New South Wales, because of federal government outlays the budget in health has increased by $1.1 billion—a 23 per cent increase. When we look at all the other initiatives that this Labor government has undertaken in the area of health to improve services, people see that the arguments put forward by those opposite simply do not stack up.


Federal Labor has increased funding for national health in New South Wales under the Health Reform Agreement. I mentioned the $1.1 billion over four years. We have a commitment to better health care. We have, of course, undertaken the plain packaging reforms and pushed those through—despite opposition from a number of large corporations and despite a High Court challenge—which will result in a healthier society over the longer term. We have invested $4.6 billion in a new public dental health scheme that will provide better services, particularly for children and those from disadvantaged backgrounds who cannot afford to access adequate dental care.


We have reduced the cost of more than a thousand generic drugs, through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those drugs include cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes drugs. We have established an after-hours health help line to ensure that people, particularly in rural and regional areas, who get sick after hours and do not have the wherewithal to travel long distances to hospitals can ring a help line and get the security and assurance that they need to make sure that their health is being looked after.


We have established 60 GP superclinics throughout the country to ensure that we are taking some of the pressure off our hospital waiting rooms and our hospital emergency departments. We have made a big investment in training more doctors and nurses to ensure that we have the adequate resources to look after our population. In that respect, this year alone we have provided the funding for the training of an extra 1,000 general practitioners throughout this country. When Mr Tony Abbott was the health minister he capped that number at 600. An extra 400 positions have been funded and paid for by this federal government to ensure that we have adequate doctors in the system. An extra $500 million is available for training nurses, particularly nurses who are working in aged care and in rural locum services where there are shortages. And, of course, we have means-tested the private health insurance rebate to make sure that that system is much fairer.


That is Labor's commitment to better healthcare services in this country, in stark contrast to what is occurring in my state of New South Wales, where the Liberals are doing what Liberal governments always do. When they come to office they commission these audits and then they cut services. They use the audits as an excuse to cut services, and that is what they are doing in New South Wales.

 (South Australia) (17:09):  I rise to address this matter of public importance on Labor's waste and mismanagement and the chaos caused in the health sector, especially through retrospective funding cuts. I would firstly like to rebut a couple of the comments that many of the government members have made. They have been trying desperately to paint the Howard government as a government that did not care about health and did not fund it. It is interesting that the Museum of Australian Democracy has fact sheets on different prime ministers, where they highlight just half a dozen of their key achievements. Guess what one of those half-dozen key achievements was for Prime Minister John Winston Howard AC: record health funding of $47.6 billion in 2006-07. And just in case you think this might be some kind of conservative think tank, there are four ex-members of parliament on their advisory council, two of whom are Labor, one of whom is a Democrat and only one of whom is Liberal. So it is hardly a partisan body that would be favouring the conservative party. But they put down as one of the key achievements of the Howard government record health funding.


The government members have been saying today, particularly during question time and during this MPI: 'Who, us? Would we cut health funding? Never!' But if you look at the analysis of the health provisions in the 2012-13 MYEFO—conducted not by the Liberal Party but by the Australian Primary Health Care Research Institute at the Australian National University—you see that in their introduction they bell the cat on this. They say: 


The hidden disaster in the 2012-13 MYEFO is the hit (unacknowledged by anyone in the Government) taken by preventive and public health. We know that $1.5 billion over four years … has been cut from the National Health Reform (NHR) funding.


So do not come and talk to the coalition and say that we are saying things that are unfounded. Go and look at independent experts who have studied this in detail, look at their pronouncements, and you will see that they have indicated that the government has made these cuts.


This matter of public importance that was raised by Senator Fierravanti-Wells talks about waste, mismanagement and chaos. In South Australia we know too well about Labor waste in the health area. There were 64 GP superclinics promised at a cost of $650 million around the country. In Modbury in South Australia a clinic opened right next door to areas that were well served by existing private practices: no GPs. President of the AMA Steve Hambleton hit the nail on the head when he said that this is a big waste of government money. 


I come to mismanagement. People in South Australia, particularly those in rural areas, know only too well that Ms Roxon, in 2009, got rid of the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Area way of allocating funding and brought in the Australian Standard Geographical Classification that saw places like Hobart considered more rural and remote than parts of South Australia. Large parts of our population lost out on funding to provide accident, emergency and after-hours health. 


In terms of chaos, which is the point of this MPI, retrospective funding cuts hurt. We have seen in Victoria that the state Liberal government has taken this government to task and challenged them about their $107 million. The problem for people in South Australia is that we get a double hit of Labor's waste, mismanagement and chaos because not only do we have a federal government that has cut funding to the tune of $31 million from South Australia's health budget, but we have a Premier, Mr Weatherill in South Australia, who does not stand up for the state. In fact, when questioned in state parliament about this, rather than say, 'You're right; perhaps I should go and challenge the federal government,' he tried to indicate that perhaps the Victorians were not doing what everyone knew they were doing. 


Now that New South Wales and Queensland are also challenging, he still has not taken his federal counterparts to task. So Mr Weatherill must step up to the plate and fight for South Australia to reclaim that $31 million, as opposed to just rolling over, because the consequences for the South Australian public are extreme. The long-promised outpatient facility at the Lyell McEwin Hospital has been scrapped to save money. There have been other delays at Modbury, and at Flinders there were six ambulances left waiting on a ramp, just last week, on a day when temperatures peaked at 40 degrees. The health outcomes for the people in South Australia are suffering as a result of Labor waste, mismanagement and chaos. They get a double hit. They get a hit from this Gillard government and, as I have just shown, independent external commentators are highlighting the cuts to the health budget but the Labor state Premier, Mr Weatherill is not fighting for the people of South Australia.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-02-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:14):  I, too, seek to speak in the debate on the matter of public importance on Labor's waste and mismanagement and the chaos caused in the health sector, especially through retrospective funding cuts. Midway through the financial year we have had yet another dysfunctional decision by the Gillard Labor government when they announced $1.6 billion-worth of cuts to public hospitals from the hospital national pool, causing chaos right through the hospital system all over the country, playing havoc with people's lives.


These funding cuts have been directly linked to bed closures, operating theatre closures and delays in elective surgeries right across the country, and you have heard this from senators from Queensland to South Australia to WA and beyond.


The fact is, hospital patients are paying the price for Labor's economic mismanagement in search for the elusive, yet now abandoned, budget surplus. Labor cannot manage health—$403 million has been cut halfway through this financial year alone for funding that has already been spent and allocated in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 financial years. Labor does not understand how the business end of our hospital system works. Contracts need to be signed, staff hired and surgery lists set. How many times have we heard repeatedly from Labor benches that the buck stops with them on hospitals. For the hospitals in Victoria, we thought the lack of federal bucks for a time would stop their operation. Failed and hollow promises were made yet again that they would end the blame game and fix public hospitals. The public hospital cuts are in addition to the $4 billion slashed from private health insurance and the $1 billion slashed from dental health. The Prime Minister needs to stop the blame game and stop using it as a way to pick a fight with premiers and to target my own home state of Victoria.


In the face of the Victorian hospitals budget reductions in the 2012-13 financial year by $107 million, the Victorian government stated that it would have a major negative consequence for the Victorian community, including the cancellation of Victorian hospital services and the retention of staff. The state government has further stated that this clawing back of health funding from the 2010-11 financial year, after patients have been treated, was based on incorrect application of population growth data. Across all aspects of this particular government, they just cannot get the numbers right. When we look at numerous levels right across this nation, we need to send some of the ministers back to the maths classroom—particularly Minister Plibersek so that she can use an appropriate dataset on which to base her financial predictions.


What did these funding cuts mean on the ground in Victoria? What did they mean for a city like Bendigo, with 100,000 people in the middle of building a world-class hospital right in the heart of regional Victoria? It meant that the budget of the Bendigo Health Care Group was $2 million out of pocket. What did that mean? It meant reducing elective surgery by 600 cases, the closure of 24 beds, $100,000 worth of savings in the mental health area by not filling positions, and reducing after-hours services. These are all services that a regional city like Bendigo needs. The Bendigo Hospital CEO, John Mulder, said that this was an unprecedented move by federal government to remove funding at this point in their cycle. This is the case being felt by hospital administrators right across our state, because they have had to manage in an economically responsible way. They have had to balance their budgets. It meant that services had to be cut. Other hospitals, right across Victoria, suffered, and I notice Mr Trewin, from Benalla, in the gallery today. Benalla and District Memorial Hospital is set to lose $202,000 out of its budget.


The health minister needs to stop the blame game, targeting the states, particularly my home state of Victoria. The truth is the Victorian government are reducing bureaucracy, re-investing administration savings and efficiencies over the next six years in the health portfolio and delivering back into front-line health services, which is exactly what the Gillard Labor government need to get serious about, instead of wasting more health dollars by advertising their backflip in our local papers over the weekend. It does not matter which way you look at it, and how much they squirm, Labor cannot be trusted on health. The public expect more from us. They have to stop shifting the blame and, basically, grow up.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:50):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


In going through the Foreign Investment Review Board Annual report 2011-12, I have been particularly struck by the increase in foreign proposals and approvals from the Foreign Investment Review Board. Interestingly, from 2010-11 to 2011-12 the number of proposals—and they were subsequently approvals—increased from 17 to 49 in just that single year. The value went from $1.4 billion to $3.6 billion.


What concerns me and, I know, a lot of people in regional areas is the fact that we simply do not have the understanding, knowledge and data around the level of foreign ownership when it comes to agricultural land and agricultural businesses. I know the government has instigated a register—which we have been talking about and calling for some time but which we are yet to see. That is only the very first step in this issue. That is only the identification of what is currently the level—which, to be quite frank, we should be well and truly on top of already. 


It is then about determining as a nation what the appropriate level of foreign investment and foreign ownership is, because this is potentially an issue of where our agricultural productive capacity lies in the future. Where is the control over that land and that productive capacity? The global population is predicted to be around nine billion by 2050. The global food task is going to exponentially increase. We are going to have to play our role as a nation in terms of that food task, particularly regarding developing nations. We also want to retain every opportunity for our Australian farmers to take advantage of playing their role in terms of that global food task.


I am very concerned by the fact that we have not yet had the debate in this nation on the level of foreign ownership and investment. As a farmer in a regional area, I do not want to see us lose control of that productive capacity, of that supply. When I say this, people think that I am scaremongering—that it will never get to that. We export 70 per cent of what we produce. But I believe in long-term thinking, and at the moment our thinking on foreign investment is short term. We are thinking about the immediate capital injection from foreign investors into Australia, and we are not going beyond that. We do not want to risk our domestic security of supply or the opportunity for our Australian farmers to take advantage of the growing global food task into the future. A lot of people say that we have to have foreign investment. I agree that there have been, and will continue to be, instances where foreign investment is appropriate. But we are not thinking long term about how we want the ownership of agricultural land in this country to look. That concerns me greatly. On reading through the annual report and doing some further work, I learned that, to 2007, the average value of foreign investment per year was $274 million. From 2008 to today, the average investment per year was $2.5 billion. That is a tenfold increase, and we have no idea where that foreign ownership and investment is sitting because we simply have not been on the ball and we have let it slip under the radar.


We have to be aware that—and it is not surprising—foreign nations are looking at Australia as their potential back paddock to secure the food supply. Qatar has been on the record saying this, through Hassad Australia. China have said that they will provide subsidies to companies that invest overseas. If this is not a wake-up call for us, I do not know what is. We need to have a proper debate and discussion around this issue. In my view, the national interest test for FIRB is nowhere near appropriate to determine what is right when it comes to foreign investment in our agricultural land and businesses. It is about time this nation looked further than the immediate capital injection from foreign investment, to the much bigger picture of how we want this nation to look in the future.


Question agreed to.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-02-27,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (18:56):  Earlier today, in question time, Senator Bob Carr in his capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs answered some questions relating to democracy in Fiji. His answers were welcome. They were strong and clear on the expectations that Australia has for democratic advancement in Fiji and on the lifting of sanctions in Fiji that would—hopefully—result from that.


Amongst the criteria that Senator Carr rightly set out were that we would expect any changes in Fiji towards the restoration of democracy to include robust freedom of expression, association and the media. I hope that, as Senator Carr spoke about the freedom of expression and of the media, his colleagues in the Labor Party were listening—especially the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. We are soon to face media reforms from Senator Conroy, if speculation in the media is accurate. I hope that Senator Conroy is very mindful of maintaining the utmost level of freedom of expression and freedom of the media in whatever reforms he proposes.


I have concerns, however, that that may not be the case. My concerns are driven by the words of many Labor MPs, by the words of Senator Conroy himself and by the encouragement from some on the cross benches, including Senator Ludlam, who I note is here this evening. Recently we saw Mr John Murphy, of the other place, single out a news entity. His words were:


We cannot possibly allow News Corporation to own more print or electronic media and that is a top legislative priority to deal with what is becoming a cancer in our democracy.


They are strong words indeed. I would be extremely concerned were the minister for communications, the man who should be the chief defender of a free media within the government of the day, to believe that we have a cancer in our democracy because we have robust and critical media. I would be concerned if Senator Conroy were to believe that somehow restricting that capacity of the media to be robust and critical were, as Mr Murphy says, 'a top legislative priority'. Of course, Senator Conroy is encouraged by others, such as Senator Cameron, who has made very clear his view about the need to further regulate how the media reports, how what it says is adjudged and assessed and how determinations of any complaints against it are made. Once again, we need to be very careful that such processes do not step into a zone where they impinge on the capacity of the media to critically assess what is said, and in particular to critically assess what is said and done by those of us in this place of whatever political persuasion.


I know the minister is well inclined towards these things. Over a period of time his embrace of terms like 'hate media' have made clear his prejudicial attitudes towards some media outlets. Of course, they happen to be media outlets that have, from time to time, criticised policies of the government. In particular, Minister Conroy's venom towards a media outlet seems to be turned up whenever they criticise policies in his particular portfolio area. Once upon a time, for example, the Financial Review seemed to be in a stable of newspapers that Senator Conroy thought was appropriate and did not seem to criticise terribly much. But then they ran some stories critical of the National Broadband Network and all of a sudden the Financial Review fell in with others that Senator Conroy likes to single out.


In recent days, Senator Conroy has been consulting with the Australian Greens in developing his media reforms. This I find particularly remarkable—not that the government would consult with the Greens, for we know that they have been bedfellows with the Greens throughout this term of parliament. Despite the theoretical tearing up of the marriage agreement, the reality is that they still work hand in glove with the Greens on so many policy issues. On media reform, I am sure we are seeing another demonstration of this. The fact that Senator Conroy is in discussions with Senator Ludlam and others in the Greens on media reforms before he even takes those reforms to his own cabinet is a demonstration of how close the working relationship remains. Given some of the approaches the Greens have taken in arguing for tighter controls on the media in terms of ownership, content regulation and complaint adjudication, this is again a cause for concern about the types of policies that this Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy may yet come up with when he produces his media reforms in the near future.


We know that Senator Conroy himself is inclined towards reforms—he has made it very clear in his responses to the Finkelstein report and the Convergence Review that were released nearly a year ago. He has made it very clear and stated on 3AW last year that a public interest test when it comes to media mergers, which is based on a Productivity Commission report from a number of years ago, is something that he supports—never mind that the only surviving author of that report, Stuart Simson, labelled the minister's plans 'a dog's breakfast'.


I particularly note the interjection and endorsement of the minister's comments from Senator Ludlam. What appears to be occurring now is that contrary to the recommendations of the Convergence Review, there is an endorsement of multiple tiers of regulation. Senator Ludlam and Senator Conroy seem hell-bent on moving towards introducing a public interest test with all the nebulous and vague criteria that will no doubt be applied in subjective judgements of the minister of the day or other parties as to how such a test would be applied; yet, against the recommendations of the Convergence Review, maintaining some type of cross-media ownership test may possibly be expanded to include pay television, free-to-air television, radio and print. Both tests may actually operate, contrary to the recommendations of the Convergence Review that found the existing test to be increasingly irrelevant, given the rise of other media sources, particularly online media sources. 


That is the whole amazing point of where media reform has come to in this country. When Senator Conroy started out on the convergence review, it looked as though it was going to be about modernising our approach to media regulation, noting the great expanse in the number of media outlets and opportunities right across this country and the world because of the globalisation of media outlets. The barriers to getting messages heard are reducing because online news vehicles have the capacity to get coverage through a whole range of sources and there is increasing diversity of viewpoints coming through blogs and other opportunities. This is reflected in terms of the media in the declining revenue basis for traditional media. There is a decline in advertising take in traditional media because the audience is becoming more fragmented, getting its information from an increasing number of sources rather than the type of concentration that seems to be driving the responses of Senator Conroy. 


It is a concern that rather than seeing this as an opportunity to reflect what is happening in the real world, to reflect and respond to those increasing number of voices and to actually decrease the level of regulation, we instead appear to have a minister who is going down a path driven by Mr Murphy, Senator Cameron, the Greens and Senator Ludlam towards greater regulation. This is exactly at a time when we should be trying to create and inspire greater innovation in our media sector instead.

(1) Given that, in a speech made to the Association of International Life Offices, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi asked countries to prevent their companies from partnering with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise due to the lack of transparency and accountability, will the Government take steps to stop Australian companies investing in Burma's oil and gas industry.


(2) Will the Government apply internationally recognised standards such as the International Monetary Fund's Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency in its trade with Burma, and require Australian companies to be subject to the code including the publication of accounts.

"Carr, Sen Bob",ALP,2013-02-27,"



Senator Bob Carr:
  The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:


(1) The Government takes the view that the private sector has an important role to play in developing Burma's economy, consolidating democratic gains and contributing to sustainable reform, including through strengthening economic and corporate governance.


The Government will encourage Australian companies wanting to do business in Burma, including in the oil and gas sector, to apply the highest standards of corporate, environmental and social responsibility.


(2) The IMF Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency is a set of guidelines that the IMF uses to encourage better transparency standards and performance by governments. It is not a code that another government can apply to companies in its jurisdiction.


Australia is a strong supporter of and major donor to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and encourages countries to implement it as a standard. We understand there is interest in the Burmese government about joining the EITI, which would help promote transparency and accountability in the oil and gas sector.
