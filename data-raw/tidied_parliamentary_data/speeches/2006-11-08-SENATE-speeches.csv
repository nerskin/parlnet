"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. It is clearly a bill that is fundamentally flawed. This bill purports to tackle ‘the relatively high level of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities,’ but it will achieve nothing of that sort. What I have heard in the committee’s hearings on this bill leaves me in little doubt that this bill is nothing more than a legal fig leaf to cover the inadequacies of the minister purportedly responsible for Indigenous affairs. The legislation is in fact not worth the paper upon which it is written. It is a distraction; it is a waste of the time and energy of this parliament. The media and the Public Service are, as you can appreciate, very busy at this time of year. There is a legislative program to be dealt with before we go home for the Christmas break.
But, more importantly, this bill is a distraction from the 10 long years of failed Howard government policy on Indigenous affairs. It is a distraction from the litany of Liberal policy failures of Ministers Herron, Vanstone, Ruddock and Brough. The government has had 10 years and two national summits on violence in Indigenous communities and has absolutely nothing to show for it. Only last week at estimates the government’s own backbench took a stick to the miserable failure of the office of Indigenous affairs, as well they might. It is a shame that they failed to highlight the abysmal performance at the ministerial level. How is it that in a time of national prosperity—a prosperity, may I remind the Senate, built by Labor—the Howard government and its coterie of incompetents have managed to leave Indigenous Australians for a large part worse off than ever before?
Turning to the content of this bill itself, as the short title of this bill suggests, it makes changes in two areas of the Crimes Act 1914: the provisions for granting bail under proposed section 15AB and the provisions relating to the matters courts are expected to take into account during sentencing under section 16A. The bail provisions inserted by proposed section 15AB list new matters to be considered in granting bail—namely, the impact the decision may have on victims or witnesses alleged or otherwise. These new measures at least in sentiment may have some merit. Indeed, excluding subsection (1)(b), this section is the only element of the amendments to receive any reasoned support from the non-government submissions to the Senate inquiry. Specifically, the Aboriginal Legal Service of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory believed that directing ‘consideration during bail deliberations to the circumstances of the alleged victim and potential witnesses, especially those in remote communities’ was appropriate. But it stopped short of supporting subsection (1)(b), which prohibits the consideration of customary law and cultural practices in bail deliberations. Equivalent prohibitions are made in the context of sentencing. I will deal with both limitations simultaneously when I get to those measures, to which I note that the government has already flagged amendments.
There are two important points worth noting about this new section. To begin with, this is a matter that is currently under review by the Council of Australian Governments. Page 13 of its latest communique, dated 14 July 2006, states:
COAG has asked the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) to report to the next COAG meeting on the extent to which bail provisions and enforcement take particular account of potential impacts on victims and witnesses in remote communities and to recommend any changes required.
As such it is grossly premature of the government to be making these amendments given SCAG has not had the opportunity to present its report nor has COAG been given a chance to consider any subsequent recommendations. If this bill passes, amended or otherwise, there is still a strong possibility that we may be legislating in this area again inside the next 12 months.
Let me now demolish any rational argument in favour of this bill by quoting some of the high priests of hypocrisy. In this very session of parliament, I have also attempted to amend provisions relating to sentencing in the same part of the Crimes Act 1914 by the Crimes Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Bill 2006. I was told at that time by government senators in the debate on that bill that it would be:
... premature for the government to consider the use of victim impact statements in isolation.
That was what Senator Ian Macdonald said. I was also told:
This government is currently considering the Australian Law Reform Commission report and the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the recommendations about victim impact statements in the context of the wide-ranging recommendations that the ALRC made about the sentencing of federal offenders. The Australian government’s response will be made public. Work is now being done preparing a response to both of these important reports.
I would like to say again that it would be premature to consider the use of victim impact statements in isolation. Yes, they have a key role in sentencing, but we should not consider them in isolation.
That was said by Senator Bernardi. I was also told:
So there are federal reports and recommendations which press this matter ... But I take the view that other senators on this side of the chamber have taken during the course of this debate and suggest that, rather than passing this bill, the better course would be to ensure that there is widespread consultation with other agencies with regard to this proposal, to discuss the matter widely amongst members of the profession in jurisprudential circles and, in light of those considerations, to introduce a more comprehensive reform of the Crimes Act.
That was said by Senator Trood. I was told:
We should take our time. We should make sure that we get it right. We should make sure that we take into account all relevant factors in relation to sentencing policy so that we ensure that we get this right.
That was said by Senator Fifield. There was a litany of senators commenting on my private member’s bill, but the comments are germane to the point that I am making on this bill because apparently the Howard government’s position not much more than a fortnight ago was one of total opposition to incremental change in the sentencing provisions of the Crimes Act in favour of implementing wide-ranging recommendations on sentencing. And here we are today and the disingenuousness of the government lies exposed. It is okay apparently for the government to incrementally change sentencing legislation when it suits them. They are hiding behind their own rhetoric. How brazen they are in their arrogance. Let me remind senators again of what COAG said:
COAG has asked the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) to report to the next COAG meeting on the extent to which bail provisions and enforcement take particular account of potential impacts on victims and witnesses in remote communities and to recommend any changes required.
Instead of proceeding through SCAG as agreed, we are now legislating unilaterally. This means that only part of the bill that possesses any possible merit has been acted on in direct contradiction to the government’s own commitments. It is abundantly clear that, by disregarding the COAG agreement relating to bail, the government’s attempt to rely on other parts of the communique to justify the remainder of the bill rings truly hollow. We now have a government that has said about sentencing provisions in relation to a private member’s bill that that matter should form part of the bigger picture and that we should wait to see what the bigger picture is. But the government’s position is: ‘No, that rule doesn’t apply to us, although we talk about it and we say it. What we say in this instance is that we’ll ignore the bigger picture and deal with this small proposal because it suits us.’
Let me also talk to other parts of this bill. The second substantive change that the bill seeks is the removal of the reference to cultural background that appears in section 16A, which lists the matters that courts should have regard to when passing sentence. Senator Sandy Macdonald, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, said in the second reading speech on this bill:
The Australian Government rejects the idea that an offender’s cultural background should automatically be considered, when a court is sentencing that offender, so as to mitigate the sentence imposed.
I have to ask the question: did the government actually read section 16A(2)? When I turned to my copy of the Crimes Act 1914 I saw the following paragraph:
In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court.
Let me emphasise the word ‘relevant’ because, although section 16A(2) directs the court to take into account a range of matters, including cultural background, it must only do so where they are relevant and it is left to the court to determine whether a matter is relevant or not. If the government wants these amendments to the Crimes Act to be taken seriously, then it is not enough to simply wander into the chamber and reject some unattributed idea. It is incumbent on the government to point out the specific failings in the law as it stands and explain in full how these changes will remedy them. That is, after all, the difference between legislating and a high school debate.
Sadly, though, this government has failed in this responsibility and, instead of basing its case on both fact and experience, it has relied solely upon some idea—and, as I said, an unattributed one at that. Indeed, when asked to identify where the consideration of customary law or cultural practice has led to inappropriately lenient sentences, the Attorney-General’s Department failed to provide a single case. When pressed for the details of cases known at the time of drafting where cultural background or customary law had been used to determine guilt or innocence in matters of federal jurisdiction, the only example that the government could provide related to an unsuccessful attempt to use hunting traditions as a defence for hunting birds that were listed as endangered. In the future, if the government wants to use the Senate’s time to debate propositions or ideas, it should draft an appropriate motion or use the adjournment debate like other senators do. In the future, if the government wants to deal with matters such as this, as I have said, it should seriously consider both waiting for the overall COAG response and, in the interim, using other mechanisms, rather than using an instrument such as this today.
I turn to the amendments that will direct authorities in granting bail under proposed section 15AB(1)(b) and those directing courts in sentencing under proposed section 16A(2A) to exclude from consideration any form of ‘customary law or cultural practice’ as a reason for ‘excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of’ the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates. The government has already flagged amendments in this area in response to recommendation 1 in the report on the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In the committee’s view, this provision as originally drafted would have meant that:
... a court could not take into account customary law or cultural practice to render criminal behaviour less serious but could consider these factors if it rendered criminal behaviour more serious.
It is good to see the government take at least one of the committee’s recommendations seriously, but this only serves to reinforce the hasty way that this legislation has been thrown together. Although it is an improvement, it does not make either the bill as a whole or even the individual provisions in any way redeemable.
When you examine the evidence given by the department in relation to these new paragraphs on customary law and cultural practice, a number of inconsistencies are revealed. For instance, the department has said that the bill is intended to address ‘cases where judges or magistrates are presented with arguments in mitigation relying on customary law or cultural practice, which are based on ... a misunderstanding of customary law’. That almost implies that the judges and magistrates, appointed by the Attorney-General, are not capable of isolating such instances. Meanwhile, the department has also said that it may still be relevant for a court to take into consideration that an offender lives in a customary law environment, such as a remote community, or that they will receive or have received tribal punishment. The problem with the bill, even if amended, is when you combine the removal of the reference to ‘cultural background’ with the fact that ‘cultural practices’ and ‘customary law’ have both deliberately been left undefined.
The committee also examined other arguments, including raising a number of issues with the bill to demonstrate why it is flawed. There was a lack of consultation. That is a sad refrain that I have heard often in the last year or so. This government has failed to consult widely in respect of its legislation—an emerging trend that really started shortly after 1 July 2005. The committees that have been set up to inquire into bills have been given short time frames. When we get to the departments, we find that there has been a lack of adequate consultation on the bills. Such matters have also been raised by witnesses before the committees. They have had insufficient time to prepare submissions, and there has been a lack of consultation on behalf of the government. In response, the government says, ‘The committee is part of the consultative process.’ That is rubbish. There should be wide consultation on these matters before they get to the committee process.
In this instance, when concerns were raised by witnesses before the committee, the department indicated that it had not directly consulted with Indigenous groups about the bill and that there had been no consultation with any police forces or police unions and no consultation with any lawyer associations. This should come as a surprise to me, but it does not. When the government was given a genuine opportunity to help victims of crime, via the bill I introduced dealing with victim impact statements, it indicated that it could not possibly proceed with amendments to the act without widespread consultation. So when it suits the government it will consult.
Ultimately, these changes will have almost nil effect on violence and sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. We all want an end to violence and sexual abuse across the board—that is a given—but what this bill purports to impact upon is not that. Why? As noted by the committee and almost every organisation that made a submission to the inquiry, those sorts of offences are actually covered by state and territory legislation. When you look at federal prisoners as of 1 September 2006, three-quarters were incarcerated under drug importation offences. When you look at the 74 prisoners convicted under the Crimes Act 1914, which make up the bulk of the residual, more than half of their offences related to social security. So how these changes are going to make an impact upon the serious problems of domestic violence and sexual abuse is anyone’s guess.
The gall of this government knows no bounds. They truly are shameless in the depths of the hypocrisy to which they have now sunk. If any further evidence were required of just how hollow this bill really is, you only need to look at the history of the reference to cultural background in section 16A(2) that this bill removes. The reference was originally introduced by the previous government under the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. And guess who supported those changes? The members opposite, that’s who.
What we have before us today is a complete backflip by this government. If we want a rationale for why this legislation is unnecessary, we need only take a trip down memory lane. I would like to remind the present Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, of what he had to say in his second reading speech on the very measure he now seeks to amend. He said:
I would indicate that the coalition agrees with the inclusion of cultural background in relation to sentencing principles. I believe that is an aspect which is relevant in a country such as Australia, where there are diverse cultural backgrounds. In my state of Western Australia there have been cases where tribal Aboriginals have been dealt with before the courts and, of course, they have operated under a different cultural background. They have also had to face some sort of penalty from their own tribe and clan. Also, some aspects of a culture bring out different sorts of behaviour in people, and that has to be recognised. In particular, this relates to Aboriginal offenders, but it could apply to anyone in the community.
Daryl Williams, who became Attorney-General under the Howard government, had the following to say:
The bill will add the words ‘cultural background’ to this list. The effect of this will be to make the cultural background of a convicted federal offender— (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-11-08,"—The Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 is a disgrace. Not only is it bad law, not only is it discriminatory; it is also a total con. It is bad enough that it is going to create a change that will mean that people who are not from a dominant cultural background will not have their cultural background taken into account and therefore will not have equality before the law. In some ways even worse is the fact that it is being put forward as in some way being an action in response to the problem that we all acknowledge and the problem we all want to see more action on—that is, violence in Indigenous communities. I should point out that, whilst there is serious child abuse and domestic violence in Indigenous communities, we cannot kid ourselves that the rest of Australia is not also suffering from significant levels of that social blight.
With regard to the legislation before us, we can see the political veneer being used here: we need to look tough and look as though we are doing something about violence in Indigenous communities, so we will make a change to the legislation to say that we are no longer required to take cultural background into account in sentencing under the Crimes Act, even though at the federal level the Crimes Act does not have any offences that relate in any way to violence in Indigenous communities—or anywhere else in the community, for that matter. It is being put forward under completely false pretences and used basically as a stalking horse to rush through an ideologically-driven change that negates the validity of people of different cultural backgrounds, including and most specifically Indigenous Australians. If there is any group of Australians whose unique cultural background and heritage we should not only acknowledge but celebrate it is Indigenous Australians.
I really cannot do much better than go the report of the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which, apart from its final recommendation suggesting that the bill could still pass with some amendments that do not, I think, reflect virtually every word before it, is a very solid summation. It was a report put together by a government controlled committee including senators from the Liberal Party—from the government benches—who we know have a great degree of expertise and integrity in these areas, particularly Senator Payne but also Senator Brandis. Frankly, it is hard to find a report that is more scathing in its assessment, apart from its failure to do what should have been done, which was to recommend that the bill be rejected. I should note that, nonetheless, they have circulated two amendments to at least attempt to ensure that the government picks up the specific recommendations of the Senate committee inquiry and the specific recommendations put forward by the government senators—the Liberal Party senators—on that committee.
But let us look at the reality of what is before us, as opposed to the smokescreen that has been put forward as a justification by the government, without going through all the detail of the findings of the committee. Let us look at the summations of the committee from paragraphs 3.90 onwards. These are words that have been put together by Liberal senators—words that I endorse, I might say. The report says:
... the committee considers that the Bill’s focus is misdirected.
                  …         …         …
... the committee notes the absence of any Federal laws relating to violence or sexual abuse in Indigenous communities that will be affected or changed as a result of the Bill.
                  …         …           …
The committee has concerns in relation to the haste with which the proposals in the Bill have been drafted and introduced into Parliament, without adequate, if any, consultation with Indigenous and multicultural groups.
The report goes on to say that the committee also notes advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission that in relation to its Same crime, same time report into federal sentencing, which goes to the heart of equality before the law, the federal government made a series of submissions, none of which suggested that customs or cultural background be removed from the Crimes Act as a sentencing factor. It said that, as recently as February this year, according to the ALRC, a submission from the Attorney-General’s Department made positive reference to initiatives that can be developed to assist the courts to take into consideration the cultural background of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the sentencing phase.
We have a component in legislation that was put in place as long ago as 1994. It was not just put in place on a whim; it was put in place following comprehensive investigations into the best way to ensure equality before the law, following on from the report and recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. It says in the report that it was put in place with bipartisan support. I would say that it was with multiparty support, because I am sure that the Democrats from the crossbenches also supported that change back in 1994. Throughout all of that period it was continually being reinforced as a component by report after report right through to February this year when the Attorney-General’s Department made positive references to initiatives to assist the courts to take into consideration the cultural background of people in the sentencing phase.
What has changed? What has changed is huge moral panic and media outrage about what is, I accept, a legitimate concern regarding some Aboriginal communities. That is being used as a smokescreen to completely reverse the solidly based, properly thought through and fully considered cross-party evidence based situation in the law—which is to be taken out to insert an ideologically driven, completely divorced from reality obsession with dismissing any cultural difference that does not reflect the dominant Anglo-cultural preference of those who promote this ideology. That, I would suggest, is a perversion of the law, and it introduces a reality that is racially discriminatory, where the cultural background of one group of people, which is automatically infused in the way the law is interpreted, has precedence over everybody else’s. This action will consciously take away the requirement to give automatic consideration.
There has been a lot of misrepresentation about what this means, not surprisingly by populist tabloid media and shock jocks, who will always jump on these sorts of things and say, ‘People are getting special treatment,’ or ‘This will mean people are able to claim some made-up cultural background to avoid being convicted or to get a lighter sentence.’ Those sorts of things, frankly, show not only breathtaking ignorance but total contempt for the rule of law and the adequacy of our legal processes. That is not to say that judges always get it right, any more than juries always get it right, parliaments always get it right or shock jocks always get it right. It is to say that we have in place quite a strong system of law, built up over a long period of time, that is continually monitored and reviewed, and when there are occasional situations where there is a belief that a wrong sentencing decision was made, for example, then there is scope for appeal and review.
The example that was used to justify this sort of change was a decision by one judge to give what was felt to be a totally inadequate sentence for a very serious offence to an Aboriginal man who was guilty of a serious act of violence. But that decision was reviewed and a harsher penalty was put in place—a clear indication the system is working. The government has put a bazooka right through the middle of this well-established principle when there was no indication and no evidence—certainly no thorough review, consultation or examination in any thoughtful, comprehensive and proper way—that it was not working or needed reform. All we got was recognition somewhere that all of this current publicity and concern creates the need to look like we are doing something. This will be a chance to not only look like we are doing something—even though it actually has no connection at all to Indigenous violence and the act we are dealing with has no connection to offences that would arise from that—but also implement the ideological agenda and try to white out the significance and the relevance of any cultural background other than the dominant one.
Returning to the report, paragraph 3.96 states:
… the committee considers that the most concerning feature of the Bill is the symbolic message that it sends to the judiciary (and the community at large), and the judicial uncertainty it may create.
We have a well-established component of the law that has operated for over a decade. That is being taken out and taken out without warning and without consultation. Not only was there no consultation with Indigenous communities, which is a disgrace, but there was no consultation with multicultural communities, who probably do not even know this is happening. The stated political context is about Indigenous communities, but it will affect people from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and, most notably at the moment, Muslim Australians who are from non-European backgrounds. There was not even any consultation with the legal profession. Ludicrous!
As the committee report says:
As evidence to the inquiry strongly indicated, the Bill will inevitably impact most on Indigenous Australians and those with a multicultural background. The committee notes the Department’s assertion that the Bill is not discriminatory—that the Bill may be drafted in a way that accords with principles of formal equality but, clearly, in practice it is likely to apply only to certain categories of offenders. It does not therefore provide substantive equality to Indigenous offenders or offenders with a multicultural background.
I will just pause on that particular finding of the Senate committee—the finding of the entire Senate committee, a Senate committee controlled by government senators who we would all acknowledge have expertise in this area. The committee says that the bill ‘does not provide substantive equality to Indigenous offenders or offenders with a multicultural background’. We are talking about equality before the law here. You could say: ‘Well, this is only one act, and it’s only a part of an act—just bits to do with sentencing and bail. It doesn’t actually deal with whether or not people might be convicted. And it doesn’t prevent background being taken into account; it just takes out a requirement that it must be taken into account.’ But it is still a significant shift on principle—and it is a fundamental principle. Equality before the law is a fundamental principle.
Surely, if you are going to make a change to the law and it is assessed by an entire Senate committee—a government controlled Senate committee—that the change will not provide substantive equality to Indigenous people or people with a multicultural background, you want to make absolutely sure you have an extremely good reason for doing it. You would not want, I would have thought, to make a change to the law that creates a situation where there is not equality for people of different cultural backgrounds without very thorough consultation, without building acceptance for the reasons for it and without building a credible case that it will have some positive effect.
There are very few principles that are totally absolute—I accept that—but you must really put forward a strong case that it will have positive benefits. I am not one to get up on high moral ground and spout with great high moral indignation about something, oblivious to what its actual impacts may be on the ground. If a case can be made that a practical, positive consequence can occur on the ground from this sort of change, then at least I would be prepared to consider it. It would want to be a pretty good case, because equality before the law is a very fundamental principle. But if you can make a case then make it. Build that case, engage with people and consult with them. Make sure that those people who will be affected by it understand why it is being done and, ideally, even accept that this is being done for the greater good. Actually do the work if you have a genuine commitment to doing this sort of thing.
But unfortunately what we are seeing, which is not uncommon and which is a direct consequence of the fact this government now has control of the Senate, is none of those things. The government’s view—and this is a mentality that is permeating throughout every nook and cranny of the executive: ministers, their advisers and the like—is that it runs the joint, it decides what happens, it is going to do it and everybody else can just get out of the way. The government think: ‘We might let you make a speech about it as we’re bulldozing it through; we’ll ignore what you say and just spout our talking points anyway. But the bottom line is: we rule. Out of the way!’
Now, maybe in a totally brutish context of an assessment of the way politics operates, you could say that that is just the way of the world. My annoyance with this is not based on my inability to stop this sort of legislation. Before the government had total control I saw lots of legislation that I did not support passed in this chamber, but the way this is being done—with total contempt for the community and the people who are directly affected by these changes and complete lack of interest in recognising that there is any need to consult with the people who are directly affected or to seek the opinions of people who have far greater expertise than I do—is frankly unforgivable.
I want to pause on paragraph 3.97 of the report because I think it is a particularly crucial and important finding of the entire committee. Further on in its report the committee said:
The committee does not accept the Department’s explanation that this will ensure the law applies equally to all persons. Evidence received in the course of the committee’s inquiry—
that is evidence from people with expertise in the area and who actually work with the law on the practical side of things in the real world—
strongly suggests that, in practice, this will not be the case.
People would not get equality. The report went on:
The proposal is at odds with well-established common law principles relating to the relevance of cultural background and customary law to sentencing decisions.
The issue that is being addressed—the issue that is being curtailed here—is not some touchy-feely bleeding-heart 1990s idea that has been plucked out of the air. As the committee inquiry said, it is in accordance with well-established common-law principles, codified in this case to ensure that it worked effectively. It is not some bolt out of the blue that was trendy in the mid-nineties. The report said that it was in accordance with ‘well-established common-law principles relating to the relevance of cultural background and customary law in sentencing decisions’.
As Senator Ludwig has already noted from the report:
... the Federal Parliament gave bipartisan support to the insertion into the Crimes Act of the ‘cultural background’ requirement in 1994. The committee is concerned about the complete absence of consultation in the present case in relation to removing the phrase, despite its specific introduction in 1994.
The report goes on:
In addition, the committee notes that, while the Bill’s stated aim is to address violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities—
even though the legislation that it is amending actually does not deal with any offences that relate to that—
its implications are much wider.
Further down the committee noted in its report:
... the reasons underlying the ALRC’s recommendation relate to offenders from a multicultural background as well as to Indigenous offenders. The committee is concerned that the Bill, as it impacts upon offenders from a multicultural background—
as well as an Indigenous background—
has not been fully considered.
As I said at the start, this bill is a disgrace. This bill is racially discriminatory in its effect. That may not be its intent—I am not sure—but it is certainly discriminatory in its effect. It is also a con. It does not address the issue that it supposedly has been brought forward to do. It is simply a vehicle to introduce an ideological obsession to white out any other cultural background and validity other than the dominant one. It is a disgrace. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I wish to speak in this second reading debate on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 and in doing so express my disappointment that the Senate has been required to deal with such an obnoxious and badly motivated piece of legislation. It is ironic that today, following the release of the most recent statistics on Aboriginal imprisonment in Australia, we are dealing with a bill that effectively has at its core an argument that we are not locking up enough Aboriginal people.
We are locking up Aboriginal people in record numbers in this country. Despite only representing about three per cent of the population, they represent 22 per cent of the prison population. So the assertion inherent at the core of this bill—that somehow we are not locking up enough Indigenous men—is just completely wrong, absurd and terribly motivated. The fact is that we lock up Aboriginal people in record numbers. The challenge for us is to deal with the terrible tragedy of criminal offences and the imprisonment of Indigenous people.
This bill has arisen out of the latest concern and publicity surrounding violence against Aboriginal women and children. As we all know, every two or three years there is a focus on this issue. Deeds are promised—action is promised—and then the media spotlight moves on and an examination of the actions announced by governments establishes that nothing really changes and that action was not delivered. Once the media spotlight moves on, the attention on the issue moves on.
As part of the government’s latest reaction—its latest summit, which I think was the third held by this government—it has promised to take on the issue of bail and sentencing and the issue of customary law as a defence. It is a complete furphy, as Senator Bartlett said. It does not go to the heart of the issues and it does not go to the real causes of the violence and abuse against Aboriginal children, which is where we should be directing our energy.
Let me say at the outset: Aboriginal women and children should be able to live in safety in their communities with the full protection of the law. There should be zero tolerance of abuse of women and children, of whatever nationality or ethnic background, in Australia. Part of the problem we face is the inherent racism that occurs in dealing with Indigenous victims of abuse and violence—the fact that in Australian society there is an attitude that somehow it is different if Aboriginal women and children are attacked, somehow it is part of their culture, somehow it is acceptable behaviour in a way that it would not be in any other community. That has to be countered by every leader in this country, every politician in this country, because it is simply not true.
One of the things that frighten me most about this bill is that it seeks to perpetrate the myth that somehow violence against children and women is endorsed or perpetuated by Aboriginal customary law. That is wrong. It is a lie. There is no evidence for it. And the danger in this bill is that it seeks to perpetuate that myth. That is why it is so abhorrent, and that is why the Senate ought to reject it. There is nothing in Aboriginal law and cultural practice which condones violence, abuse or criminal behaviour against women and children. It is just not true. Customary law and cultural practice are not a cause of the violence or abuse of women and children; in fact, that is more a reflection of the breakdown of Aboriginal law and culture: the effect of European settlement, the effect of alcohol, the effect of drugs—the effect of the breakdown of their traditional law and culture. So, in the way that this legislation draws us away from the real causes of that violence and abuse, it does the debate and the campaign against that violence and abuse a terrible disservice. It is very much about the Howard government demonising Aboriginal culture. We saw that in the land rights legislation debate, and we are now seeing it here. I think it does the government no credit at all.
All Australians have been shocked and saddened by the abuse that has received so much publicity in recent months. As I say, we have had no shortage of inquiries and reports. We had the report of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women’s Task Force on Violence in 1999 and we had the 2002 Western Australian Gordon inquiry. In 2003, the Prime Minister personally convened a crisis summit of 16 Indigenous people to discuss family violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities. The government has been told of these problems time and time again, but sadly there has been little progress. Last week’s report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is another reminder of the problems of family violence faced by Indigenous Australians.
Labor strongly supports the measures in Aboriginal communities to provide protection to Aboriginal people, including the very strong policing measures that are required, but unfortunately the government’s record on delivering community safety measures has been mixed at best. The government’s responses have been tied up in red tape and bureaucracy, like so many of its other initiatives in the Indigenous policy area. At the budget estimates in May we learned that, of the $37 million allocated to family violence programs after the last summit, the 2003 Prime Minister’s summit, only a small percentage—about 15 per cent—had been spent three years later. All talk, no action.
There is a serious issue in terms of Aboriginal people’s engagement with the criminal justice system and incarceration. In WA, my own state, Aboriginal people make up 40 per cent of the prison population, despite only representing three to four per cent of the population. Between 70 and 80 per cent of the children in juvenile detention centres in WA are Aboriginal. That is the problem. New research by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows that the rate at which Indigenous Australians appear in courts on criminal charges in New South Wales is 13 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people. Furthermore, in the last six years, the national rate of Indigenous imprisonment has risen by 23 per cent. So the rate of imprisonment has been rising rapidly—by 23 per cent—and the ratio of Indigenous to non-Indigenous incarceration has risen from 9.9 to 12.1.
We are locking up more and more Indigenous people at a more rapid rate, and the government come forward with a bill that says: ‘Well, we’ve got to cut out their defences against being imprisoned.’ There is no sign that they are defending very successfully against imprisonment. All the records, all the information, says that Indigenous people are not doing at all well at defending themselves against imprisonment. So this bill is just completely out of whack with the reality and with what this community and this parliament need to be dealing with. Our problems are much worse than those of other countries—say, for instance, the African-American community in the United States. Our imprisonment rates of our Indigenous people are world leaders. We lock up our Indigenous people at a much higher rate than virtually anywhere else in the world.
The New South Wales research shows that the prime cause of incarceration among Indigenous people is related to the abuse of alcohol and drugs, and that is consistent with substantial previous research linking drug and alcohol abuse to contact with the criminal justice system. The report also pointed to other factors including low levels of education, poverty and unemployment. All other research points to a complex web of factors including poverty, inadequate housing and social dysfunction as drivers of criminal behaviour. A range of testimony to the Senate inquiry into the bill noted disadvantage, poverty and the breakdown of traditional Indigenous community and social structure as the causes of crime, violence and abuse. It is the breakdown of the traditional legal and community structures that has driven much of this.
This bill will not protect children from abuse. It will not protect one Aboriginal woman from being bashed. This bill does nothing to attack the causes of the problems in communities and the causes of the violent behaviour. As I say, this legislation actually seeks to perpetuate an analysis of the problem that is wrong, politically motivated and deeply harmful to Aboriginal people.
Protection of women and children from violence and abuse and reduction of contact with the criminal justice system means combating drug, alcohol and substance abuse and building the self-worth of people in Indigenous communities. It requires relief from the endemic poverty and sense of hopelessness which are a way of life for so many Aboriginal people. Scapegoating Aboriginal culture and locking up increasing numbers of Aboriginal men is just not a solution to the problem.
In recent months, there has been a growing drumbeat from the government which degrades and vilifies Aboriginal culture, tradition and communities. A range of negative assertions have been made by senior members of the government about Indigenous culture, and there has been a complete lack of engagement and consent sought from Aboriginal people. This is part of that cultural attack. I reiterate: there is nothing in Aboriginal law or culture which causes or condones the violence, abuse or sexual assault of women and children. People must understand that.
Larissa Behrendt, Professor of Law and Indigenous Studies at the University of Technology in Sydney,. told Lateline earlier this year:
There’s nothing in—
Aboriginal customs or values—
that ... advocate the fact that it’s appropriate to treat Aboriginal women and children with disrespect and there’s nothing in those cultural values that ... permit people to abuse Aboriginal women and children.
She is an expert in law and in Aboriginal law. In its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, the Law Council noted:
Indigenous community leaders have consistently abhorred any suggestion that violence against women and children is justified or condoned in any way by customary law.
Currently, cultural background is among a list of factors that can be considered by judges in sentencing—only in sentencing. The Law Council noted to the Senate inquiry:
... courts recognise that Aboriginal customary law and cultural practices will only be relevant in limited circumstances and will not justify or condone abuse of women and children.
Indigenous communities may apply traditional punishments in the case of certain offences. Customary law is a complex system of social and cultural relationships, identities and responsibilities and is of central importance to many Aboriginal people. There is substantial evidence to suggest that law and order issues in Aboriginal communities are in part related to the breakdown of traditional culture.
Sentencing circles have been a way of reducing the adversarial nature of the legal process for those offenders who plead guilty and of providing effective, culturally relevant punishments under the auspices of the mainstream legal system. Similarly, Koori, Nunga and Murri courts have provided an effective halfway point between the mainstream system and Aboriginal traditional practice. The federal government has been helping to fund these initiatives. Why would it do so if it thought they were part of the problem? This legislation is a real reversal in terms of the approach taken, both by Senator Ellison and the government over many years, and it really disappoints me.
As a result of the recently handed down WA Law Reform Commission report, which I note was commissioned by the former Liberal Attorney-General in 2000, the WA government is now considering the recognition of customary law within a human rights framework and the broader Western Australian legal system. When cultural background was inserted into the Commonwealth legislation as a factor if relevant, it was a response to recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which drew heavily on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As Senator Ludwig pointed out in his contribution, the coalition supported the inclusion of the customary law provision when in opposition in 1994.
The government has not presented a shred of evidence as to why the changes contained in this bill are necessary. It has not indicated at all how these will prevent violence, abuse or contact with the criminal justice system. It has simply used assertions about Aboriginal culture and rhetorical remarks about equality before the law—in appealing to a different constituency, I suppose—rather than trying to tackle the real issues involved in violence and abuse in Indigenous communities.
In fact, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission argued that the legislation is in conflict with every major inquiry into the role of cultural background and customary law in the Australian legal system, including a number of reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner made the point:
All Australians, regardless of their ethnic background, have cultural values and may engage in cultural practices that may be relevant to sentencing for a criminal offence.
The legislation is based upon the removal of the right of Aboriginal people to have their culture recognised in the same way as other Australians. Far from serving to make all Australians equal before the law, it is fundamentally an attack on Aboriginal culture. As Senator Ludwig pointed out, this legislation is much more about spin than reality.
The relevant offences regarding violence and abuse are largely dealt with under state and territory law, not federal law. As I understand it, the majority of Indigenous offenders charged with Commonwealth offences are charged under the Social Security Act with social security fraud. I have not heard yet of anyone using customary law as a defence against a charge of social security fraud. If they did, this bill will fix it, but that is all it will fix. It will prevent people using customary law as a defence against social security fraud, although I note the government has led no evidence to suggest that that has been used in the past.
As the Indigenous affairs spokesman for the Labor opposition, I am very concerned by the whole framework of this bill—the way it seeks to denigrate Aboriginal culture and the way it seeks to pass over dealing with the causes of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities and the very serious issues involved. The government have taken measures to assist with better policing in Indigenous communities, and I commend them for that. One of the key problems has been the fact that the police have not had the resources or the attitudes to properly deal with complaints or evidence of violence against Aboriginal women and children. But policing is not sufficient in itself to deal with those issues. We need to look at the causes. We need to look at prevention.
Locking more people up after they have committed violence is not a solution. It is a punishment but it is not a solution. Those people will eventually be released and returned to the community. Violence will continue in those communities unless we deal with the causes: the poverty, the alcohol and drug abuse, the unemployment, the housing issues and the hopelessness that exists in many Aboriginal communities. Unless we empower Indigenous people in those communities, we will not attack the fundamental causes of violence against Indigenous women and children.
In a sense, people could say this bill does not really matter—that it is a bit of cover for the government, a bit of spin, a bit of PR, but it will not do anything. And it will not do anything. It will not have any practical effect, as I say, unless people are using customary law as a defence for social security fraud, and no evidence has been led to that effect. But it does send a very clear message to the wider community that somehow Aboriginal culture is wrong, that Aboriginal culture contains elements which encourage paedophilia and violence against women. That is a lie. It is completely wrong. It is a denigration of Aboriginal people and their culture and it needs to be resisted by this parliament.
This takes us down a path which does nothing to improve relations between Indigenous people and the rest of the Australian population and it does nothing to attack the causes of crime and violence in Indigenous communities. In the way that it denigrates Aboriginal customary law and culture, it actually sets us back and acts as a barrier to making progress on these really important issues.
Labor are vehemently opposed to the high levels of violence and abuse that occur in some communities, and we support the government and join with them in seeking to take all measures possible to prevent that, as we would in any other community. As I say, I have supported the policing initiatives as strongly as I can and supported all proper measures to attack these problems, as do Indigenous people. Indigenous people want action from government; they want the protection of the law; they want protection from violence and abuse. There is no argument about that. But what is completely wrong about the government’s approach is that it fails to recognise and deal with the causes and it hides behind these sorts of smokescreens, these hoaxes on the Australian public, that passing a law about customary law as a defence in sentencing is somehow going to make a difference and help. That is a nonsense, it is a fraud and it is a disgrace that this parliament has been used in this way. It is a con trick, it ought to be opposed and it does the government no credit at all.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-11-08,"—The Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 is important and deals with provisions relating to the administration of criminal justice at a national level. It deals with such areas as sentencing, bail and how people are dealt with in relation to alleged criminal behaviour. At the outset I want to make it very clear that the amendments relate to criminal behaviour across the board. They are not specifically designed to target Indigenous offenders. As these amendments are couched, they apply to all Australians, and I think that that must be remembered. Of course the debate in recent times has related to attention which has been focused on the unacceptable levels of Indigenous violence against women and children, and that has been a prime mover for these amendments, but in no way are these amendments related only to Indigenous offenders. They apply across the board, and the government rejects any suggestion of any racial aspect to these amendments.
Before I continue I should acknowledge the work done by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I want to acknowledge the work done in relation to the consideration of this bill. The government has carefully considered the recommendations made by the committee and has addressed the committee’s concerns in recommendation 1 by adopting, in principle, the sentiments expressed in that recommendation. By giving consideration to customary law and cultural practice specifically, the wording as put forward in the government amendments I believe reflects, if not exactly, the first recommendation of the Senate committee. It certainly picks it up in principle. For instance, the committee uses the word ‘enhancing’ and the government amendment replaces that with the word ‘aggravating’, but I think nonetheless the sentiment is there. The government was unable to accept recommendation 2 of the committee on the basis that it might take away the thrust of the message that is intended to be sent out by these amendments. That is something which will come out in the consideration of the amendments which will be moved at the committee stage.
During the debate there was some query as to the reasons for this bill and the two amendments that I have foreshadowed. At the outset the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 is one of the outcomes of the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities and is designed to respond to the issues raised at that summit. In particular, the government is concerned that all Australians are treated equally under the law and wishes to ensure that every Australian is subject to the law’s protection and equally subject to its authority. The bill is intended to confirm that no customary law or cultural practice excuses criminal behaviour, including unlawful violence or sexual abuse, and to ensure that victims and witnesses, particularly those in remote communities, are adequately protected. The bill is designed to remedy those situations in which the consideration of customary law or cultural practice has lead or may lead to inappropriately lenient sentences. The Australian government takes the view that the cultural background of a person should not necessarily be identified as a special consideration in sentencing. More importantly, a claim that criminal conduct was justified by customary law or cultural practice should never be used to avoid full and proper punishment for any offence. The Australian government is taking the lead on this issue and hopes that this bill will act as a model for similar legislative changes in all states and territories.
The question has been asked: what are the examples that can be given of the circumstances that the bill intends to address? Examples of these circumstances include where judges or magistrates have to face arguments in mitigation relying on customary law or cultural practices which are based on a misunderstanding of the customary law, including an incomplete presentation of what customary law entails. As an example, Indigenous leaders in the recent Western Australian Law Reform Commission’s Aboriginal customary laws discussion paper note that because customary law arguments are put forward by male defendants in sexual crimes, the version of customary law is limited to those aspects that suit those male defendants. Another example is based on the lack of understanding of the impact of the crime on the victim, both in terms of physical and emotional impact and in terms of the negative consequences of a finding, express or implied, that what happened to them was acceptable to the community, and hence there is a real sense of isolation rather than victim support.
Another example is a lack of testing that what defendants claim to be customary law is in fact accepted as the case. I think this touches on something Senator Chris Evans raised, which was that this bill presumes that Aboriginal customary law in some way condones paedophilia, the abuse of women or violence. This is not the case. Indeed, the very example that I have cited as what we are attempting to deal with in this bill is the lack of testing of what defendants claim to be customary law. The problem is what people say the customary law is and whether or not that is tested—that has been more the problem that we have faced. Dr Sue Gordon said in a lecture at the recent international convention on crime prevention that there have been three aspects of law: whitefella law, blackfella law and bulldust law. I was very impressed by that argument because I think Dr Gordon hit the nail on the head with that third aspect, in that the interpretation that some people are placing on customary law is part of the issue that we are addressing. And I would suggest that that could even have wider implications than just in relation to the Indigenous community.
Another example of a circumstance that we are intending to address in this bill is the lack of recognition that even if a practice can be shown to be part of the background and cultural environment of a defendant, particularly in communities where violence and abuse are prevalent, such a background does not justify the practice where it is in conflict with the rights of the victim.
I now turn to a number of other issues which have been raised by senators during the second reading debate. One of those issues has been an alleged lack of consultation. I would point to a number of aspects which completely dispel this. Firstly, this bill follows the commitment made by the Commonwealth and all states and territories at the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities on 26 June and at the COAG meeting on 14 July this year. Both of those meetings involved state and territory ministers and, of course, leaders. This commitment is set out in the COAG communique of 14 July 2006:
COAG agreed that no customary law or cultural practice excuses, justifies, authorises, requires, or lessens the seriousness of violence or sexual abuse. All jurisdictions agree that their laws will reflect this, if necessary by future amendment.
All jurisdictions are being encouraged to follow the Australian government’s lead on this issue during bilateral negotiations. I might say that bilateral negotiations have already been held with New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. So I think that quite squarely puts the issue of consultation to rest. I think you can do it no better than with an intergovernmental summit with the relevant ministers, followed by a Council of Australian Governments meeting.
In relation to the application of Commonwealth law, some criticism has been raised today that Commonwealth law does not touch on offences against the person and that these amendments, therefore, will not have much impact on sentencing or dealing with those people charged with offences against the person, such as violence or sexual assault. I put it to the Senate that, if the Commonwealth did not provide leadership on this issue, it would be found to be wanting. It would be negligent of the Commonwealth as the national government of this country not to set an example to the states and territories. Indeed, the Attorney-General will be pursuing this at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which meets tomorrow and the day after in Fremantle. We could only go to such a meeting and implore and beseech the states to follow us if we were doing the same thing ourselves, and that is precisely what this bill is about. It demonstrates leadership in the area that we have constitutional jurisdiction over. Of course, the states and territories have the jurisdiction in relation to those offences against the person I have mentioned, and we will be pushing the states and territories to do more in that regard.
Another criticism has been that cultural background, which is to be taken out of the list of considerations as mentioned in the Crimes Act, will not be available for consideration at all. What we are saying is that by taking out cultural background and leaving in antecedents—which, as I recall, is in the same subsection—we are treating everyone in the same fashion. That is, any person who comes before the court will have their antecedents considered, and those antecedents, by the very definition of them, will include the person’s cultural background. But what we are saying is that you should not place too much emphasis on cultural background to the exclusion of other factors and, in fact, to the extent that justice may be distorted. Of course there will be a variety of cultural backgrounds of the people coming before the courts in Australia. That can well be considered in the antecedents of the individual concerned—and not just an Indigenous cultural background but others, whether from a variety of overseas countries or not.
That needs to be remembered. The question of antecedents has been left there deliberately for that reason, that there will be an overall consideration of the person and that person’s background when they come before the court. It is just that we do not believe that cultural background should be used in a way that could distort the administration of justice.
One of the other criticisms was that this was discriminatory in some form, and there was some suggestion that the Racial Discrimination Act might be a barrier to these proposed amendments. Certainly it is a matter that we have considered carefully, and I am advised that legislation precluding reliance in any form on customary law or cultural practice to justify criminal behaviour is not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That is fairly clear and we reject totally that there is any racial discrimination aspect to this proposed legislation.
Senator Chris Evans and other senators raised the issue that in dealing with the Indigenous violence and abuse that has been in the fore of the public mind recently many measures are needed. I am the first to agree with that—housing, education and health are all relevant factors. I would agree that policing on its own is not sufficient. We have to remember that you deal with the problem at hand—that is, where there has been the commission of an offence—by the administration of justice. That includes law enforcement and appropriate punishment. In the long term you have to look at how you can prevent that happening. In my own portfolio I administer the National Community Crime Prevention Program. Since its inception a couple of years ago we have had 22 Indigenous crime prevention projects, which have received average grants of $133,000 per project. These are targeted measures on the ground dealing with crime prevention measures which the community itself believes are the most appropriate to address its problems. That is very much a grassroots approach to crime prevention.
From a policing point of view, I was very pleased early in October to announce the commencement of the Australian Crime Commission’s task force based in Alice Springs but working out of all its offices around Australia. That task force brings together state and territory policing in relation to Indigenous violence. I think that will prove to be a great boost to policing in the Indigenous sector. I want to acknowledge the great work that is being done by the state and territory police in this regard. In that task force there is a combination of state and territory police officers working with the Australian Federal Police and officers of the Australian Crime Commission. This is the first time we have seen a national initiative dealing with such an issue where we look at it with a whole-of-government approach. That has been needed for some time.
In the wider context of dealing with domestic violence issues, the government has provided funding of $23.6 million over four years to extend Indigenous family violence prevention legal services from 26 violence prevention units to 31. That is a significant input in relation to prevention of the problem that we are addressing with this bill.
The passage of this bill will not be the silver bullet, it will not be the panacea and it will not be the total cure for what we need in relation to the Indigenous violence and abuse we have seen, but it is a very important part of the whole-of-government approach to address this issue. In the wider context it deals with issues in sentencing and bail that I think are relevant factors across the board in the administration of criminal justice in this country.
Senator Ludwig mentioned that the opposition is opposed to this bill yet supports our provisions in relation to bail. To then suggest that this bill is in some way premature is inconsistent with that stance. Certainly we are progressing this with the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, as I said, and we will progress it with COAG. That does not mean that meanwhile the Commonwealth stands still. This bill is about leadership and providing the way forward, and we want to work with the states and territories in addressing these issues. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-11-08,"—When I left off previously I was articulating the Greens’ concern about the combined impact of Welfare to Work with potential reduction in payments of child support and the lack of modelling of the interaction between these two. The Greens are also concerned about unpaid child care and how this has been accounted for in the proposed new formula. The proposed new child support formula does not adequately recognise the costs of unpaid child care. The cost is overwhelmingly borne by resident parents who are typically, but of course not exclusively, single mothers. The formula recognises that the financial costs of older children are higher but does not recognise that the unpaid care responsibilities of younger children are greater. It is argued that ignoring unpaid care creates a bias in the system, predominantly against women who provide the majority of unpaid care.
The opportunity costs of providing care include forgone earnings, super and career advancement, loss of access to training and professional development, and reduced social networks. Unpaid care is accounted for, in part, under the existing child support formula by the different self-support component for resident and non-resident parents. This no longer exists under the new formula, supposedly as part of the move from a one-home to a two-home model.
The argument put forward by Professor Parkinson when further questioned on this issue was that financial provision for unpaid care was mainly made in the way that the Family Court assigned assets on separation. He effectively implied that this dealt with the issue, and hence it was of lesser or no concern in the child support calculation. However, this provision in effect only applied where there were significant assets to divide—meaning that this only benefited divided families who had significant assets prior to separation. Therefore, the proposed arrangements will impact more unfairly on those on low incomes who have few or no assets.
In addition, it assumes that settlement happens as soon as couples separate. It may take years to come to court and arrange a settlement. In the meantime people do not have access to resources; sometimes they do not even have access to the family home. We acknowledge that measuring the monetary value of unpaid care has always been a problem for policy makers. We believe that more work needs to be done in this area.
Unpaid care is emerging as an important policy issue in other areas. I refer for example to aged care, where pressures are growing via an ageing population. There is a wealth of contemporary analysis around these issues which we believe could have better informed the task force’s deliberations. We need to balance the opportunity costs of unpaid care against the ongoing and future benefits of caring for children and, through them, the future wellbeing and productivity of the nation. We believe that ongoing monitoring and evaluation of this process is absolutely critical if we are to ensure that this new formula and Child Support Scheme are successfully implemented.
I would like to touch now on enforcing compliance. We welcome the long overdue enhancement of the Child Support Agency’s compliance capabilities, which will better enable the agency to pursue non-resident parents who fail to provide any support for their children. The fact that only half of all non-resident parents meet their child support obligations in full and on time is a longstanding problem. We welcome the introduction of a minimum payment for parents who deliberately minimise their income to avoid paying child support. In his submission the task force chair, Professor Parkinson, expressed concern that these provisions of the bill may need to be strengthened to remove doubt. To this end we will put forward some amendments, which have been circulated, following suggestions made by Professor Parkinson.
We also support some of the proposed changes to deal with the current problems with defaulters. The proposed changes will allow parents to pursue unpaid child support through the courts. We believe this is a significant improvement, provided there are sufficient resources for legal support and that there is equity of access. However, we believe there is an emerging problem now that the agency has started to provide some resources to pursue nonpayment, and is serving notices on non-resident parents—in this case, mostly fathers—for large amounts of unpaid child support. Sometimes this is extending over a lengthy period of time. But there are occasions when this is starting to generate conflict, and I think this needs to be adequately addressed. That is not to say that we do not believe that these defaulting parents do not need to be chased, but we need to recognise that it can cause conflict when people are starting to be pursued after many years.
We also have some concerns about shared care agreements. While the shared care provisions are in some ways an improvement on the existing system, we believe there are some potential problems. It was identified in the evidence presented to the committee that some of the shared care arrangements are tenuous and that the most likely outcome over time is for slippage to take place, whereby the child often ends up living with one parent—usually the mother. Some of the shared care agreements end up enforcing a particular set of financial arrangements while at the same time the percentage of care with the non-resident parent often drops off considerably. The current arrangements seem to lock that in. We will propose an amendment to the bill that addresses this matter, so that arrangements can be reviewed and they are not locked in permanently. Again, that amendment has been circulated in the chamber.
In conclusion, I still have some reservations about the government’s decision to proceed with this bill without proper provision to protect low-income families who may lose income as a result of these changes. I am disappointed that the government failed to model and to qualify the likely impacts of the bill on existing child support recipients. Some significant issues were raised in the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs which, disappointingly, were not put forward explicitly as recommendations and subsequently have not been addressed by the government as amendments.
As I said, we have developed some amendments which we have circulated in the chamber. These relate to issues identified by Professor Parkinson, the task force chair, and discussed by the committee. I understand there is a willingness on the part of government to consider these recommendations. As I said at the beginning of my speech some weeks ago, we do support the need for reform of the child support system, so we will be supporting this bill with the amendments that I have circulated. I believe they address some of the concerns that were expressed to the community affairs committee inquiry. I believe the amendments will strengthen the bill. However, as I said, the Greens will be supporting this bill because we believe that there is a need for change in the child support area. We believe that the bill represents a step ahead, even though we have articulated some concerns with some aspects of the approach that has been taken.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-11-08,"—The Democrat view on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 is similar to that just expressed by Senator Siewert. There is a need for reform and we are prepared to support it, but we also acknowledge that the reforms contained in the legislation could be improved through amendment.
The issue that this legislation deals with is a fraught one, of course, as I imagine pretty much everybody in this chamber and in the wider community realises. Child support issues, whether they are financial calculations or other aspects to do with access to children, division of property and all those other things in the family law area, are incredibly fraught and very difficult, particularly when circumstances are such that people are not able to work things out between them to their own satisfaction anymore and require another party, a court, legislative compulsion or whatever to come in. That is always going to be a less than forensic mechanism for ensuring the closest approximation of fairness in every circumstance.
At the end of the debate on the previous legislation I was talking about the value of truth and ensuring that our deliberations are based upon some sort of verifiable fact and evidence rather than just pronouncements that have no consideration about whether or not they reflect reality. That is certainly true but, as this area reminds us all, that is just the start. Trying to actually base things on facts, truth and evidence is necessary but not sufficient. In this area, perhaps more than most, one person’s undeniable, blatant, obvious fact is another person’s blatant pile of nonsense. There are incredibly conflicting views and opinions between people caught up in the child support system about what they believe is fair and reasonable. Such things will inevitably be influenced by the perspective that the individual is coming from.
Of course, in many of these circumstances, which involve a lot of personal hurt and emotional pain, perceptions can be further influenced by those immediate personal factors. As legislators we cannot and should not make decisions solely based on reacting to such personal hurt and pain but nor should we be completely oblivious to it. We do need to recognise it and seek to address it as much as possible. We also need to try to get an outcome, which, above all else, is as close to consistently and universally fair as can be done. Any legislation in an area that deals with the myriad individual circumstances that people find themselves in is going to have difficulty managing fairness every time.
It is about trying to apply a mathematical formula that will deal with every situation. It is a mathematical formula with different components to enable it to be flexible enough for different situations, but it is still just a formula. Then there are a group of public servants who have to implement and administer it and use their discretion to ensure it operates fairly. That is always going to leave some people dissatisfied. That should not be used as an excuse to not try to continually make it better but it must nonetheless be acknowledged that, even with these changes and even if we make amendments to get the legislation as close to perfect as we like, there will still be a lot of dissatisfied people.
As we all know in going through this process, there are dissatisfied people with regard to this legislation. Some think it has not gone far enough, some think it has gone too far and some think at least components of it are off the track altogether. But it is the end of a very long, considered process and, unlike the previous legislation, it does at least reflect an attempt to engage with the conflicting realities and circumstances, the competing demands and the competing and conflicting principles involved. To that extent I think it should be acknowledged that the Senate committee process once again proved its worth by identifying some areas where further improvement could be made in weighing up legitimate concerns that some had that there was an excessively unfair impact on some with high incomes. It is worth trying to address that. The fact that people have high incomes does not mean that the fairness of the situation should be completely discounted but it certainly should get lower priority than ensuring fair outcomes for those on lower incomes.
There is legitimate concern that some aspects of the reforms put forward in this legislation will impact negatively on some with low incomes without adequate reason, I might say. That is something that I think does need further examination and certainly the Democrat view is very much to align ourselves with the amendments that will be put forward in the committee stage of the debate by Senator Siewert and potentially by others. I might leave any further contributions I make until we get to that stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I rise to speak in support of the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This bill does four main things. It introduces a much needed independent review of all Child Support Agency decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. It broadens the powers of the courts to ensure that child support obligations are met and it strengthens the relationship between the court and the Child Support Scheme. It allows separating parents more time to work out parenting arrangements before their family tax benefit is affected and it introduces a new child support formula by which child support payments are calculated, with this measure to commence on 1 July 2008.
Labor acknowledges that there is considerable concern in our community about the fairness of the formula for assessing child support obligations under the regime that was set up by the Hawke government in 1988 and accepts the need for reform of the Child Support Scheme. Labor’s approach to child support reform has always been guided by a belief that the interests and wellbeing of the children must always come first. Central to this is Labor’s belief that it is the responsibility of both parents, whether they are living together or apart, to provide a loving, nurturing environment for their children to grow up in where they are safe, they are encouraged and they learn to develop into strong adults free from fear, knowing that they are accepted and loved.
After careful consideration, Labor has decided that the new scheme is likely to be fairer and more focused on the needs of children. The ALP recognises that establishing a new formula based on fairer and sounder principles means that some payments will go up and others will go down and that child support payers and payees will be affected in different ways according to their income, the number of children involved, who cares for the children, how often they care for the children, the age of the children and whether or not second, third or even fourth families are involved.
When this bill becomes law, residential parents will get to keep all of their family tax benefit where a non-residential parent has care of their child for less than 35 per cent of nights in a year. That is fewer than five nights a fortnight. Non-residential parents who have care of their child for at least 14 per cent of that time, that is one night a week, will continue to be eligible for the rent assistance component of family tax part A and continue to be eligible for the healthcare card. Parents who have financial responsibility for a stepchild in a second family will now be able to apply to have the stepchild considered when calculating the child support for the parent’s first family if no-one else can financially support the stepchild.
The most important aspect of the changes to the child support formula is that it treats first and second families more equally and more fairly. Senators will know that a constant concern raised with us by people who repartner is that the children of the second relationship are not currently treated on an equal basis by the application of the formula. I think we overcome that problem in the new formula.
The bill before us today is the culmination of a process which started with the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs into family separation issues which led to the report titled Every picture tells a story. That inquiry recommended the establishment of a ministerial task force to examine the Child Support Scheme, including an examination of the cost of raising children in a post-separation household. I place on record my congratulations to Professor Parkinson and the members of his task force, who have done a very solid task in reviewing all of the empirical research both in Australia and overseas to try to arrive at a far more objective child support formula. I also acknowledge the role that the Chief Whip of The Nationals, Kay Hull, played when she chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that delivered the report. On my side, I acknowledge the roles that the deputy chair—the member for Fowler—the member for Throsby, the member for Franklin and the honourable member for Chifley played on that committee. The committee demonstrated the very best traditions of this parliament—government and opposition members on a parliamentary committee working together in the best interests of the Australian community.
The centrepiece of the reforms is the new child support formula based on new Australian research on the costs of caring for children and reflecting community values on shared parenting. The current formula uses fixed percentages of income, assuming people spend the same proportion of their income on children regardless of their level of income. Whilst we know that people with higher incomes spend more money on their children than people with lower incomes, they spend less as a percentage of their income. The current formula treats the income of resident parents more generously than it does the income of non-resident parents and does not compensate a non-resident parent who looks after their children for up to 29 per cent of the time. Second families are also unfairly and inconsistently taken into account under the current formula. The current formula also fails to distinguish between the ages of children, so the significantly higher expense that comes with teenagers goes unrecognised.
The new formula, on the other hand, will explicitly be based on the costs of children as drawn from Australian research showing the real costs of children according to the level of income of parents and the ages of children. In the new formula, parents who care for their children for 14 per cent of the time, which equates to a night a week, will be recognised and compensated for the cost they incur. In the new formula, during the first three years after separation, parents who are using income from second jobs and overtime to help re-establish themselves will be able to apply to have their child support calculated taking into account their re-establishment costs.
I think that is an important issue. It is constantly raised with me that, when relationships break down, the costs of repartnering, establishing new households and establishing new care provisions are not properly compensated in the current formula. In the new formula, an income share approach will be used so that both parents will have the same amount deducted as self-support. The incomes of both parents will be taken into account in establishing the cost of the children, and the resulting cost will be apportioned between the parents according to their share of the combined income.
I think the most important change to the child support formula proposed in this bill is the attempt to ensure that all biological and adoptive children be treated as equally and as fairly as possible. Under the old formula, more money would go to supporting children of the first family than to a new child in the second family. Parents who have financial responsibility for stepchildren will now be able to apply to have the stepchild treated as a dependant under the child support formula for the parent’s first family.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2006-11-08,"—It is important that Australians have confidence in our judiciary. There are many fine judges in this country—and they do a great job—but we must have a means by which we can deal with those who are not. Bad judges undermine the community’s belief in our system of democracy. Today, we have even more evidence of the need for a judicial commission. I hope the Attorney-General’s Department are listening and giving consideration to the authentication of documents that I sent to them this time last year. I want to quote an article in the Hobart Mercury of 31 October 2006 with regard to a magistrate. It says:
The magistrate appointed to hear the sensational criminal charges against dumped Labor ex-deputy premier Bryan Green and former Labor health minister John White is a staunch member of the Labor Party—
which I think is not important—
and a close friend—
which is important—
of Mr White.
Chris Webster, who was appointed a magistrate in February this year by outgoing Labor attorney-general Judy Jackson, also stood as the Labor candidate for the Upper House seat of Newdegate in 1986.
Before becoming a magistrate, Mr Webster worked closely on the state election teams of several high-profile Labor figures, including John White’s own election campaign to win Newdegate in a by-election in 1998.
Mr Green and Mr White both face criminal charges of conspiracy and ‘interfering with an executive officer’.
And, of course, those charges are being heard by none other than their close friend. I would have thought that that was enough for that person to immediately withdraw. The article continues:
Mr Webster adjourned the Green-White case for it to be heard before him again at 10am on January 10 in the Hobart Magistrates Court.
He made no attempt to disqualify himself as presiding magistrate because of any perceived conflict of interest over his strong Labor links.
A Labor insider who worked on Mr White’s Newdegate by-election campaign confirmed that she met Mr Webster at Mr White’s Battery Point home in August and September 1998.
She said Mr Webster, a former president of the Law Society of Tasmania, was described to her as Mr White’s campaign manager.
I do not think we need to say much more. This is a clear example of what people will do if they think they can get away with it. Clearly, Mr Webster should not have heard this case. He should have withdrawn. I understand the DPP’s office was fuming and could do nothing about it. It is a perfect example of why we need to have a process so that people can have confidence in the judiciary.
To give further emphasis to this, I would also like to raise a matter which is suppressed in the Glebe Coroners Court. I have had complaints against this person, who died in a bizarre circumstance following some bizarre lifestyle choices—
 (Senator Moore)—Senator Heffernan, I remind you of standing order 193 and draw your attention to that before you go any further.
—Is it about casting aspersions? This gentleman is dead.
—His reputation does not die with him, Senator Heffernan.
—I am just saying that I have had complaints regarding a court matter that involved several million dollars that was of a like matter to the matter that is before the Hobart court system. I think it is intolerable that a person in those circumstances would not withdraw from the case. I think this is a perfect example of why Australians deserve a process to deal with complaints, not necessarily of a criminal nature, against judges. There is simply no process in the federal jurisdiction if you have a complaint that is not a matter of criminality that would go straight to the police. You have to somehow conjure up both houses of parliament to agree to deal with the matter. If there is no process, I do not know how you can put an argument to get both houses of this parliament together. I think the system is failing. This is a perfect example of why we need to take urgent action; otherwise, the public will rightfully lose confidence in the judiciary.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Federal Judicial Commission</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-11-08,"—My question is directed to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the minister recall the Prime Minister’s statement at the last election when he asked, ‘Who do you trust to keep interest rates low’? Given that we have had four interest rate rises since the Prime Minister made that statement, doesn’t it prove that Australians cannot trust the Prime Minister to keep interest rates low? Why should the Australian public ever trust the Prime Minister again?

I think he will have to change it to give more prominence to the eights. But, given his answer, which again seeks to mislead the Australian public, is he aware that the Liberal Party’s own website still advertises, ‘The Howard government’s plan will keep interest rates at record lows’? After eight consecutive rate rises, does the government accept that interest rates are no longer at record lows? Why do the Prime Minister, the government and the Liberal Party continue to mislead the Australian public about interest rates?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-08,"—The opposition do seem to want to revisit the 2004 election repeatedly, which surprises me given the trouncing they properly got at that election. That was an election at which the Australian people quite properly accepted the proposition that we put: that interest rates were always likely to be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government. Of course, that continues to be the case.
It continues to be evident on the basis of the facts. The fact is that, under the former Labor government, home mortgage interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent for the 13 years of their government. Under us, they average 7.18 per cent. The fact is that, based on the 25 basis point increase in the cash rate today to a 6.25 per cent cash rate, we would anticipate mortgage interest rates rising to 8.05 per cent. It is a fact that home mortgage interest rates never got as low as 8.05 per cent in the whole 13 years of the Labor government.
Most interestingly, when interest rates went to 9.5 per cent in September 1994, Kim Beazley, now Leader of the Opposition, was finance minister. This is what Mr Beazley had to say then about a 9.5 per cent interest rate:
... I point out that this is still a very low interest rate regime in Australian historical standards. It is a regime that is capable of being held at that level ... because the fundamentals of the economy ... are very good indeed.
Apparently in 1994, under then finance minister Mr Beazley, a home mortgage interest rate level of 9.5 per cent—about 1½ per cent more than is currently the case—was a very low level and a very low interest rate regime. They never got interest rates as low as 8.05 per cent. Now they have the temerity to criticise this government for a level of home mortgage interest rate that they were never able to achieve.
We do not retract one bit the assertion we properly made at the last election that interest rates will always tend to be lower under our government than under the federal Labor government, for the reasons cited by the Prime Minister this morning and, most particularly, because of the fact that, on current Labor Party policy, which is to recentralise and reregulate industrial relations in this country, it is certain that under a federal Labor government we would have a flow-through of wages right through the economy which would produce the wage inflation that we saw under previous Labor governments. That would put pressure on interest rates.
We know that, under a federal Labor government, there would be a looseness in fiscal policy. They are already proposing to loosen fiscal policy by spending the earnings of the Future Fund. All of the policy prescriptions of the Labor Party will put pressure on interest rates. Their track record on interest rates is appalling. As the Prime Minister said today, no-one likes home mortgage interest rates to rise, but no-one likes inflation to rise, and we never want to see inflation go back to the levels that pertained under the previous Labor government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

Is the minister aware that both the Queensland and New South Wales governments have apologised for the mismanagement and misappropriation of millions of dollars supposedly held in trust and that reparations are now being organised? Is the minister aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs reported that the same problem of stolen wages applies to child migrants and non-Indigenous children institutionalised last century? Is the minister aware that these two groups reported on by the committee lack the same sort of well-funded advocacy network that Aboriginal activists rightly have?

Would you agree to ask the Prime Minister to put this matter on the COAG agenda to assist in ensuring that justice is done and that a fair go is given to all those who had their wages stolen, misappropriated or mislaid simply because they were too disadvantaged and powerless to do anything about it? My own feeling is that if it is on the COAG agenda it can be driven a bit harder by the Prime Minister than it otherwise would be.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-11-08,"—I thank Senator Murray for that question. Indeed, I took the liberty of reading Senator Murray’s fine contribution on this subject in the adjournment debate last night and commended him on his words. They were obviously said with great sincerity and purpose, and he has diligently pursued this matter. The government obviously does believe that the issues raised about the experiences of former child migrants, those who grew up in institutionalised care, and Indigenous people are significant and matters properly inquired into by this parliament.
The government responded to the inquiry into child migrants in 2002 and the inquiry into children in institutional care in 2005. As Senator Murray pointed out, Senator Marise Payne’s Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is currently inquiring into Indigenous stolen wages. I place on record the government’s enormous sympathy for the distressing experiences that many faced, including the withholding of wages and entitlements. Allegations of mismanagement of these moneys by state and territory governments and agencies are obviously the responsibility of those governments and agencies. In relation to children in out-of-home care, the Commonwealth has contributed $300,000 for counselling and support services, a national conference and a contribution towards memorials. For child migrants, the Commonwealth has contributed to a travel fund, family tracing and counselling services and memorials.
Further on the issue of child migrants and children in care, this is not directly a Commonwealth responsibility; but, on the basis of Senator Murray’s particular interest in this issue, I will ask the Prime Minister to consider writing to the relevant premiers and chief ministers to seek a fair resolution of these claims and to ensure that the states and territories—who have direct responsibility for these matters—understand our concern and act with resolution to bring these matters to a conclusion.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Australians: Stolen Wages</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to inflation and interest rates.
Today we saw the eighth increase in a row in mortgage interest rates. We now know that on an average mortgage, or a mortgage of about $300,000 a year, families in Australia will have to pay an extra $195 a month, about $50 a week, to service their mortgage—to pay for the house in which they live. This is a huge burden. It is the highest burden in a decade, and it represents a record share of people’s income being spent on the cost of their mortgages. With rising house prices and the rising size of mortgages, people in Australia are now paying a record share of their income to service their repayments.
What we have from the government today is an out of touch, arrogant response to the concerns and pressures on Australian families. Mr Costello, the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister continue to describe interest rates as ‘extremely low’. I do not know what planet they live on and I do not know what they know about paying a mortgage, but everyone I know does not describe these interest rates as ‘extremely low’. Everyone I know realises that they have had to suffer eight increases in a row, that the pressure on their families to meet those repayments is huge, that they are feeling threatened and that their financial security is threatened as a result of this. And this government does not seem to care.
We also know that the Liberal Party’s website still carries the promise—John Howard’s claim that he would keep interest rates at record lows. That was his promise to the Australian people at the last election: he would keep interest rates at record lows. He has breached the trust of the Australian people. He has let them down, because interest rates are not at record lows. We know they are not at record lows, but the Liberal Party is in denial. The Liberal Party will not accept the fact that it has lost control of inflation and, as a result, Australian families are paying the price. They are paying the price by having to pay up to $200 extra a month in interest rates on repayments on their mortgage as interest rates continue to climb.
The government are in denial. They do not want to talk about the promise made before the last election. They want to run from that. Mr Howard wants to rephrase and reclarify what he promised. But we know that the Prime Minister has breached a promise to the Australian public. He will not and has not been able to keep interest rates extremely low, and now he wants to move on. We know also that he gave the green light to the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates. He saw it as the interest rate hike that we had to have. What he said to Australian families is: ‘Because we have lost control of inflation and because you are paying 10 per cent extra on your grocery bill compared to what you were paying last year, we have let the economy run out of control. Because of that, someone has to pay a price. And who is going to pay the price? Australian families are. We have given the Reserve Bank the green light so they can put up interest rates. So ordinary families will pay 50 bucks extra a month because we failed—because we let inflation get out of control. You will pay the price.’
Senator Minchin today said, ‘Governments need to touch the brakes.’ That was his phrase: they need to touch the brakes. What he meant was that every family servicing a mortgage will have to pay in excess of $50 a month extra as the government seek to touch the brakes. ‘Touching the brakes’ means ‘touching you’. Touching you and increasing your repayments is the way the government touch the brakes on the economy. They have not invested in infrastructure, they have not invested in skills, they have not managed inflation, and now it is all out of control and Australian families are paying the price.
Australian families will be very interested to hear that you are so out of touch as a government—that you are so unconcerned with this that you continue to say, ‘Oh well, it is the states’ fault,’ or, ‘It is the former Labor government’s fault.’ Today you are trawling around the press gallery with a document saying what Kim Beazley said in 1994. Take some responsibility. Take up your commitment to the Australian public. You will not take responsibility for your failure. You want to take credit for the positives, but you will not front up. You have breached your faith with the Australian public. You said that you would keep interest rates at record lows. You have let them down, and you ought to front up and take some responsibility.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-11-08,"—I welcome the interjections of Senator Ferguson, because he comes with a very sound understanding of economics. He would agree with me that today there has been a breakthrough in question time. For the first time since the last election, which was two solid years ago, the Labor Party spent the whole hour on economics. This is a first. After the last election, the message from the Australian people was loud and clear that you had to establish your economic credibility. It has taken them two years to finally dedicate a whole question time to the economic state of the nation. And what a muddled affair it was. We had Senator Hutchins, who is going to get up after me, saying that housing prices have dropped, that they are now too cheap and that the Howard government is to blame for that. No sooner had he sat down than up jumped ‘Mr Economic Credibility’ himself, Senator Carr. How could you even allow him to get up on economics? He got up and said that housing prices are way too expensive. I know they are from different states, but surely they talk and swap questions. Obviously not. You would have thought that they would. What a muddled affair that was.
Senator Sherry, who is still in the chamber, yesterday and today and any time he has jumped up has tried to say that the government have had absolute responsibility for the decision to increase interest rates, that we can control and direct the Reserve Bank. He knows only too well that that is not the case. He is not that dumb—or is he? He knows only too well that one of the first reforms the government introduced was the independence of the Reserve Bank to make such decisions about the economy and the inflation rate. There was a good reason for introducing that reform in 1996—one of the first fundamental reforms the government made to the economy—and that is that the previous government had lost all credibility in the markets, in the community and in this parliament because they boasted that they had the Reserve Bank in their back pocket. The Treasurer and Prime-Minister-to-be boasted that he directed the Reserve Bank’s decisions on interest rates. Of course, we know where interest rates ended up with that government. It was the most blunt, heavy-handed monetary tool used, because of a lack of fiscal discipline displayed by the previous government.
Senator Sherry is getting the previous government mixed up with this government. They know only too well that it is a cheap political trick to say that John Howard has given the green light to the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates. Nothing could be further from the truth. The only thing I can say is that I congratulate the other side for at least spending one solid hour—you must have all walked out with headaches—on economic questions. It is a first in the two years since the last election.
I will move now to the substance of the issue, but I felt I had to make that point. At least I acknowledge that the Labor Party have spent one hour on economics. The point is, of course, no-one likes the increase in interest rates. We in this parliament know that it hurts businesses and it affects household budgets, but we also know that it is done against the backdrop of a sound and solid economy where the fundamentals are in place. Employment is at a record high. Productivity is on the increase and wages are increasing also. So there is an economic security, a foundation stone, on which this decision to increase interest rates has been based.
We know that the last inflation figures were above the bounds given to the Reserve Bank, at 3.9 per cent. But over the 10 years of this government they have been below three per cent, at an average level of 2.6 per cent. I only regret that time does not allow me to answer the proposition put by the previous speaker, Senator Evans, about taking responsibility for the increase in interest rates. I invite Senator Evans and those on the other side to look at a quote from the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, who warned that the biggest threat to interest rates and inflation in this country is the state government budgets.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-11-08,"—The Prime Minister, Mr John Howard—‘Honest John’—made a major issue at the last election of interest rates remaining at record lows. Now the Liberal Party, and especially Senator Ferguson, are saying that people should be careful about their borrowing, that they should organise their affairs so that they have fixed interest rates. So we have to turn ordinary householders into economists and financiers in order for them to afford the interest rate rise.
People relied on the Prime Minister’s judgement. People relied on his word when they borrowed. He has let them down; he has badly let them down. All the government can do is run their mantra on interest rates under the Labor Party. They will not take responsibility for their own lack of actions in this regard. That is the problem here. A huge amount of cost pressure has built up on ordinary everyday families over the 10 years of the Liberal government.
The Liberal Party have made life more expensive in a number of ways over a range of essential services—for example, health care. People have been forced into private health care by the government, by their campaign. Okay, there is a 30 per cent rebate, but people are still paying health care costs that go up every single time there is a review. They are paying more for education. The government have funded private schools, but public schools are still struggling. If a student goes on to tertiary education, where the HECS debt is now sky high, that is another cost pressure on families. Child care is another cost pressure on families. It is difficult to access and very expensive when you do access it.
What has happened is that a broad based cost pressure on families is affecting the economy. We are not just talking about bananas here, despite what Senator Minchin seems to imply. We are not even talking about petrol. We are talking about broad based cost pressures that affect every single family in Australia.
On inflation the government goes back to history—goes back to Labor’s past, goes back to its averages—but increasingly we have seen that the government has lost control of inflation—not just the headline rate but also weighted medians and trimmed means. They are outside the Reserve Bank’s band and the reserve is desperately trying to keep them under control—without the help of the government, I should say.
You could argue that the very severe drought that is affecting us means that the rural sector is already in recession. In the urban areas, families are feeling the effects of the government’s mismanagement of the economy. That is because the Liberal government—as Liberal governments always seem to do—think in the short term. They have had a populist approach and now, after 10 years, it is starting to affect our economy, because of the capacity constraints on our economy. Our leader, Mr Kim Beazley, keeps talking about capacity constraints and I think it is starting to become a common term because people realise what it means. They realise the real effect on our economy because of underinvestment in infrastructure and underinvestment in training. It is affecting our productivity, our ability to meet the cost pressures and the demand of world economic growth.
It is now too late for the Prime Minister to fight inflation first, because he has not laid the background to fight inflation. He has sent mixed signals from the start. We have the baby bonus and tax rises while the government has been preaching about low inflation, and they are just incompatible. For the last 10 years, this government has ridden on the coat-tails of the former Labor government’s reform of the financial system and now it has to face the consequences of its own short-term policies.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Inflation</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-11-08,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Minchin. I think that it is very important, having listened to what has come from the other side today, that we go through what the coalition has done and what Labor has done. With the interest rate rise today, it is now 8.05 per cent. The mortgage rate, as we have been told, was never as low under Labor. Never in the course of 13 years did Labor get the mortgage rate below 8.05 per cent.
By contrast, in 1996, when the Labor Party left office, interest rates were 10.5 per cent. In the course of Labor’s 13 years in office, home loan interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent. Mortgage interest rates peaked at 17 per cent in 1989 and 1990—and I can certainly relate to that, as we were buying more property. In the last 10 years, interest rates have averaged 7.17 per cent. The reduction in mortgage interest rates since 1996, even after today’s increase, would still save a typical family $449 per month in interest payments on an average $220,000 home loan.
Having heard Senator Evans mention the press release that is going around about what his leader, Mr Beazley, said, it is important that I read this out, because people may not be aware of what he said. In September 1994, when Mr Beazley was finance minister, home loan mortgage rates were 9.5 per cent, and this is what he said:
... I point out that this is still a very low interest rate regime in Australian historical standards. It is a regime that is capable of being held at that level largely because the fundamentals of the economy in this country are very good indeed.
That is what Mr Beazley said in 1994, in case those opposite are wondering what he said. So, in 1994, a 9.5 per cent interest rate was considered low and keeping interest rates at that level was regarded as an achievement and a testament to the economic management of the Labor Party.
Throughout the last 10 years, and particularly in the 2004 election campaign, we made the point that interest rates have been lower under the coalition than they were under Labor. That is an indisputable historical fact. Why would interest rates be higher under Labor? In 2004 we made two points about interest rates under the Labor Party. Firstly, a Labor government would create a risk of higher inflation because they would return us to a centralised, union dominated system of industrial relations which would remove the link between pay rises and productivity. That issue is even more important in 2006 because, with the commodity boom affecting wage outcomes in the resources sector, Labor’s centralised industrial relations system would create the risk of a wages outbreak and higher inflation, just like we saw during previous booms—for example, in the early 1970s.
Secondly, we made the point that Labor had a big spending program. In the 2004 campaign, Labor promised some $40 billion in new spending over four years to be funded by some vague and rubbery savings. In 2006 the Labor Party had already outlined a substantial spending agenda. Labor’s promise to spend the annual earnings of the Future Fund represents a fiscal loosening of over $2 billion a year. Labor’s promise to raid the Communications Fund and spend it on present-day projects represents a further one-off $2 billion fiscal loosening. Labor has committed to a long list of vague and unfunded promises. Australian families do not trust Labor to keep interest rates low, because after 10 years Mr Beazley and the Labor Party have not done the work to articulate a clear alternative economic plan.
As far as affordability goes, Australia has a very high level of home ownership. Home ownership in Australia is 70 per cent. In the G7, only Italy has a higher rate. The most important ways to improve housing affordability are to keep unemployment low, keep real wages rising, keep interest rates low, maintain a competitive and efficient housing construction sector, ensure adequate land release and minimise taxes on land transfer.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Inflation</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,6,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I want to take note of the answers given by Senator Minchin this afternoon. Having listened to the contributions by the coalition colleagues, I understand that they just do not get it. They just do not get it that, right at the moment, Australian families are suffering. I listen to Senator Minchin’s answers all the time because I admire him in that, unlike a lot of other government ministers, we do not get the diatribe about 13 years of Labor government or what they did here or what they did there. Generally, if you listen to Senator Minchin’s answers, he will try to give you an answer to the question you have put to him, but not today. All we got from him today was haranguing. We were flippantly dismissed because of the serious questions we were asking. I can come to only one conclusion: this mob is worried.
In my question to the minister, I chose three suburbs in Western Sydney that are in areas held by the coalition. I know what is going on in those suburbs because I live out that way. I know that the men and women and their families who live there are suffering. As a result of what has occurred today with the Prime Minister’s inspired rate increase, those families will continue to suffer. They are suffering not only because of what they will have to pay in additional payments but also because of falling house prices. In the last few years, house prices have fallen by as much as 40 per cent in parts of Western Sydney and south-western Sydney.
In the last few years, people have borrowed on the basis that their house would be worth $300,000 to $350,000. But now people have been told that they cannot sell. Only a few weeks ago, a family—a husband, his wife and their eight children—came to my office. The family needed to relocate, but if they sold their home they would be in debt until they died. They could not afford to move because they had borrowed on the basis of the promises given by this Prime Minister when he went to the last election. We know what he said: ‘You can trust me.’ But, in the last three years, we have had eight rate increases. For an average mortgage of $300,000, these increases have resulted in an increase of $350 per month or $4,000 a year. Where are people going to get that money from?
I do not know how things are for people who live in the areas that Senator Adams and Senator McGauran represent, but I can tell you that things are getting tighter and tighter for people living in Western Sydney. People are not getting the overtime that they used to get; they are two-income families. There are pressures at home. People cannot move because they cannot afford to sell. Why can’t they afford to sell? Because they will end up in extreme debt. This has all happened on the government’s watch. It has all happened on the watch of the coalition senators, and it will continue.
We were promised by the Prime Minister that we could trust him to deliver on interest rates. Recently, the Sydney Morning Herald interviewed a family in Claremont Meadows, which is in the seat of Lindsay and represented by Jackie Kelly—that well-known landlady of Western Sydney. Mrs Slan said of Jackie Kelly:
She’s just a cheer squad for John Howard, but the issues that affect people in Kirribilli are very different from here.

Mr Elly Slan said:
By and large, we are supposedly wealthier, even though it’s only on paper. But we’re in debt now. He allowed the housing boom to go on for too long. We’ll be in a lot of trouble if interest rates continue to rise.
I say to Mr and Mrs Slan of Claremont Meadows: Interest rates have risen again today. What is there to say that they will not rise again? You are already worse off under this government. People like you are already committing 29 per cent of your income to paying the mortgage, which is more than they paid under Labor. Where will this all end? I will tell you where it will end: people like the Slans and those who came to see me will have to relinquish their houses and go into debt for most of the rest of their lives.

"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2006-11-08,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Maritime Legislation Amendment (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Bill 2006, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the bill

The bill amends the Navigation Act 1912 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to incorporate the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) revised versions of Annex I (prevention from pollution by oil) and Annex II (prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances) to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).

Reasons for Urgency

The IMO’s revised Annex I and revised Annex II of MARPOL comes into effect internationally on 1 January 2007. Implementing legislation for both Annexes are included in the bill for introduction and passage in the 2006 Spring sittings.
There is a risk if implementing legislation does not commence on 1 January 2007 that any prosecution action taken after that date by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as a result of pollution of the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone by oil and/or chemicals using current legislation may not be enforceable due to the inconsistency between domestic legislation and the new international regulations. Any incident involving oil and/or chemical pollution of the marine environment has a high likelihood of raising adverse media and community reaction so it is in the government’s interest to avoid or reduce the risk of ineffective legislation.

That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-11-08,"—I had an amendment circulated in regard to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 and foreshadow that I will be moving that amendment. But I guess we all know what the issue is, in any case. It is becoming a bit of a case of ‘here we go again’ every time a Selection of Bills Committee report is tabled. I indicate that, whilst I am a member of that committee, I was not able to attend yesterday’s meeting. The cloning legislation was in the committee stage at the time the meeting was held and I did not think I was in a position to step out from that debate to go to it, particularly given that we all know what happens these days in Selection of Bills Committee meetings—we just get the legislation served up and the government insists on ridiculously unrealistic time frames.
The proposal here, if I heard the minister correctly, was 30 November for the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill. The Democrats believe that is far too short a time frame for what we believe is significant legislation which is of interest to the community and on which the parliament would benefit from having access to the expertise and views in the community.
I should emphasise that, with Senate committee processes, as a party and as senators we would like more time to be able to consider things—30 November is three weeks away. Whilst we have two non-sitting weeks in front of that, I do not know about the rest of us, but mine are pretty much wall-to-wall committees and inquiries already, given all of the other legislation and issues that we have jam-packed in and on which we have to report by the end of year.
It is not just about giving ourselves more time or making life more convenient, although I do think, frankly, it is appropriate, given the significance of the role that is entrusted to us, that we show respect in doing at least some semblance of a reasonable job. It is also part of the public education and public debate process. The Senate committee processes are not just for the convenience of senators; they actually play an important part in enabling the information to get out into the public arena. The people in the press gallery endeavour, of course, to forensically follow every piece of legislation that comes through here and ensure they give comprehensive coverage on all of the detail on significant matters. Also, of course, for people in the wider community—particularly these days, with more use of the internet, with submissions and Hansard being online and also often with committee inquiry hearings being streamed so that people are able to watch them—there is much more ability for those who are interested to be able to follow, react, respond and put the debate out quite quickly to interested sections of the community that may have nothing to do with the mainstream media.
I guess in that sense we can perhaps accept that we can be a little quicker than we were five years ago with some of these inquiries, but, once again, this is far too short a time frame—31 January is not stretching it out into the ether; it is still a fairly short time frame when you consider that Christmas will be intervening. A lot of people will obviously be focused on other things and having a bit of a break. To allow only three weeks in effect for such legislation, I believe, is really bringing the political process into disrepute.
This is not the first time; this is pretty much a weekly occurrence when we sit. Legislation is tabled, immediately bundled off to a committee, shunted to an extremely quick hearing with an extraordinarily short turnaround time for people to put in submissions, with absurdly short time frames for reports to be written and then bundled into the Senate and railroaded through before half of us even know what it is that we are looking at. It draws the Senate and the whole process into disrepute. Sometimes I wonder if it is not actually part of the government’s agenda to do that. Either way, we do not need to speculate on the agenda. The consequence is a very poor one. It is a poor process. We are not just debating points here; we are making laws and we should at least show the public the courtesy and respect of doing our job properly, given they have given us the responsibility of being in parliament.

The government’s proposed reporting date of November is ridiculous if they are truly trying to encourage a proper informed analysis of these legislative amendments. The proposed amendments are quite significant, and I believe members of the community will want to comment on them. To meaningfully analyse the import of these amendments takes a period of time. It takes time to get out and inform people that these changes are happening. As these changes have only come onto the agenda recently, people will not be aware of the extent of the changes. They need time to analyse them, to get their submissions in. Committee members need time to adequately consider the submissions and make meaningful comment. The time allowed is insufficient to give proper analysis of the amendments, so we are supporting the amendment to the amendment that Senator Bartlett just tabled.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,8,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-11-08,"—Labor is also supporting the amendment to the amendment. If you look at the Selection of Bills Committee report today, the committee resolved to recommend that this legislation be referred immediately to the committee but was unable to reach agreement on a reporting date. There are two reasons provided in the statements for reasons for referral about the reporting. The real issue is that the government has proposed that the reasons for urgency are that the bill addresses concerns raised by the Northern Land Council in relation to nominating a site under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. Fancy that! We know exactly what the Northern Land Council has been thinking in terms of the proposal to site radioactive waste in the Northern Territory. The government is suggesting that, if this is not addressed, the Northern Land Council may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land. How likely to happen is that? Any nominated site needs to be included in the current Commonwealth radioactive waste management legislation site characterisation program as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration. Glory be! We know exactly why the government wants to have this reported in such an absurd and obscene time frame by 30 November.
Senator Bartlett is quite right: considering the workload that the environment committee has, it is quite extraordinary. The environment committee is where this should be going; the government has referred it to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education—that in itself is an intriguing event, but never mind. The Australian people who are most affected by this legislation are yet again going to be denied an opportunity to participate meaningfully in an inquiry. Yet again, they are going to be excluded from the process of consideration of the detail of a bill and, yet again, they are going to have their hands forced by this government which is determined to find a site in the Northern Territory for radioactive waste. We are very concerned that yet again due process is being superseded by this extraordinary measure and we support an extension of the time for discussion and investigation of this legislation to the date proposed by Senator Bartlett.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,8,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2006-11-08,"—I raise the reason for the urgency at an early point to cut to the chase in relation to this whole business. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 amends the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and provides for the failure to comply with the site nomination rules in section 3B, and does not affect the validity of the minister’s approval under section 3C of a nomination. It amends it to remove any entitlement of procedural fairness in relation to a nomination made under section 3A and provides, should a nominated site ultimately be chosen for the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility, for the Commonwealth to return the nominated site to its original owners when it is no longer required. The bill also amends the Administrative Decisions Act to exclude the application of the act to a site nomination under section 3A of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act to ensure consistency with existing provisions of the act relating to sections 3C and 7 of that act.
The bill is therefore a rather technical one but important nonetheless. It addresses concerns raised by the Northern Land Council in relation to nominating a site under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act. If these concerns are not addressed, the Northern Land Council may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land. Any nominated site needs to be included in the current site characterisation under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act program as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration within the current project schedule. So, if there is any nominated site, we need to deal with that as quickly as possible. If this reporting date is extended, as proposed by the Democrats, we will be taking this into early next year. We are able to deal with this act with sufficient Senate committee scrutiny and we can then deal with it in the final sitting fortnight, which is coming up. For those reasons, the government considers this to be urgent, and that is why I moved my amendment for an earlier date for reporting.

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


Statement of Reasons for Introduction and Passage in the 2006 Spring Sittings


Purpose of the bills

This “first tranche” of legislation repeals and replaces much of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and better implements parts of the revised (June 2003) Forty Recommendations of the OECD-based Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and several of FATF’s Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. The remainder of the FATF Recommendations (except for those implemented by other legislation) will be implemented via a future “second tranche” of legislation.

Reasons, for Urgency

Passage of the bills is required in the 2006 Spring sittings to implement outstanding international obligations (arising out of Australia’s membership of FATF) to upgrade anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.

The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 amends the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and provides for the failure to comply with the site nomination rules in section 3B, and does not affect the validity of the minister’s approval under section 3C of a nomination. It amends it to remove any entitlement of procedural fairness in relation to a nomination made under section 3A and provides, should a nominated site ultimately be chosen for the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility, for the Commonwealth to return the nominated site to its original owners when it is no longer required. The bill also amends the Administrative Decisions Act to exclude the application of the act to a site nomination under section 3A of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act to ensure consistency with existing provisions of the act relating to sections 3C and 7 of that act.
The bill is therefore a rather technical one but important nonetheless. It addresses concerns raised by the Northern Land Council in relation to nominating a site under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act. If these concerns are not addressed, the Northern Land Council may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land. Any nominated site needs to be included in the current site characterisation under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act program as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration within the current project schedule. So, if there is any nominated site, we need to deal with that as quickly as possible. If this reporting date is extended, as proposed by the Democrats, we will be taking this into early next year. We are able to deal with this act with sufficient Senate committee scrutiny and we can then deal with it in the final sitting fortnight, which is coming up. For those reasons, the government considers this to be urgent, and that is why I moved my amendment for an earlier date for reporting.

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration


Statement of Reasons for Introduction and Passage in the 2006 Spring Sittings


Purpose of the bills

This “first tranche” of legislation repeals and replaces much of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and better implements parts of the revised (June 2003) Forty Recommendations of the OECD-based Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and several of FATF’s Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. The remainder of the FATF Recommendations (except for those implemented by other legislation) will be implemented via a future “second tranche” of legislation.

Reasons, for Urgency

Passage of the bills is required in the 2006 Spring sittings to implement outstanding international obligations (arising out of Australia’s membership of FATF) to upgrade anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.

I think you will find that we will be renegotiating the formal arrangements regarding speaking times, with the cooperation of the whips. I think that this matter came on a bit earlier than Senator Sherry expected. The important thing to understand is, firstly, he is here now; and secondly, it is an important debate given the focus today on the interest rate increases and the concern about the future of the economy.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Inflation and Interest Rates</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,15,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I apologise for being late. I was trying to access the Liberal Party website, which contains an interesting message. I will get to the matter of the Liberal Party website shortly, because I think it is very embarrassing for the government. Today we are discussing a number of key aspects of the recent economic performance of the country, particularly the very poor contribution by the current Liberal government.
First and foremost is the issue of interest rates. Today the Reserve Bank announced the eighth interest rate increase since 2002—the fourth increase since the last election. That brings me to the matter of the Liberal Party website which I was attempting to access and was therefore held up in getting to the chamber. You cannot download the message, but the Liberal Party website still contains the Howard government plan: ‘keep inflation under control and keep interest rates at record lows.’ That is the message which is still on the Liberal Party website. Of course, it is patently wrong with regard to inflation and interest rates. I will talk a little more about interest rates before I get to inflation. The message on the website which states, ‘keep interest rates at record lows’ is patently untrue. It has to be false, because we have had four interest rate increases since the last election. Today we had the fourth increase.
Today’s increase will impact significantly on the community in a number of ways. It will impact not only on mortgage repayments—which is what is referred to mainly—but also on small business, small business loans and the farming community, particularly in a time of drought. The last eight interest rate increases have seen housing interest payments—that is, the actual monetary amount that individuals now have to pay as a percentage of their household income—running at 9.1 per cent. So, after the increase today, close to $1 in $10 of household income has to be contributed towards higher interest payments. The Liberal government is fond of looking at history. If we compare that to the proportion of household disposable income some 10 years ago, we see that it was then 5.6 per cent. So, 10 years ago, when the Liberal government was elected—at the end of the Labor Party government—interest rates as a proportion of the dollar income of Australians were considerably lower.
I have referred to history. Time and time again today we questioned Senator Minchin about the Liberal government’s broken promise of keeping interest rates at record lows—because clearly they are not at record lows—and time and time again the minister referred to the record under Labor in Labor’s 13 years. As I referred to, the valid comparison is actually the percentage of household disposable income—the actual amount of money from your pay packet—that you have to use to repay your mortgage. It has increased significant under the Liberal government. If we want to refer to history—and some people may not be able to remember back this far, but I certainly do—we should refer back to when John Howard, the current Prime Minister, was Treasurer.
—We do want to go back in history.
—I am very happy to. If it is a history lesson people want, it should be noted that interest rates reached 22 per cent when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer.
But what is important is the impact on families in Australia today. Why have these higher interest rates come about? Despite the fact that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Liberal and National parties misled the Australian people at the last election, they have come about because inflation is increasing. Inflation has now reached 3.9 per cent. It has increased significantly over the last 12 to 18 months. Indeed, the Reserve Bank, in its announcement today, referred quite specifically to escalating inflation as being a major factor in the need for yet another increase in interest rates.
The Liberal government takes the credit and takes responsibility when the news is good but, when the news is bad, everyone else is to blame—it runs a mile and will not take responsibility. So, when the news is good, you take responsibility and you take the credit but, when the news is bad, you blame someone else. I notice the Liberal Party whip from the Northern Territory nodding in agreement.
—Absolutely.
—He says, ‘Yes, absolutely.’ The Liberal Party blames someone else when the news is bad and takes the credit when the news is good. What we are seeing is the Liberal Party in blame game. When interest rates go up it is someone else’s fault—bananas or the states. ‘It’s the states,’ is the most common excuse, but it could be bananas, world oil prices or anything—anything but the Liberal government taking responsibility for any economic bad news. The Liberal government just will not take responsibility. The government is out of touch and arrogant. We see a continual arrogance from this out-of-touch government, particularly since it has had a majority in the Senate.
As I said, inflation has been rising. As at September 2006, it was 3.9 per cent. The headline rate has increased significantly, as has the core rate, in the last 12 to 18 months—contributing to some of the difficulties that Australian families are having to grapple with at the present time. If you go to the supermarket and do the shopping, you see that, as a component of the inflation rate, food prices in the year to September rose by almost 10 per cent—and it was not bananas, I have to say.
So increasing inflation—which the government has lost control of—has obviously fed into higher prices. Food is an obvious and unfortunate example that has a significant impact on households in Australia, particularly low- to middle-income households. At the same time, inflation is feeding into higher interest rates. Of course, for many Australian families, that has a severe impact because they are having to make higher repayments—after the latest rise, approximately another $50 a month. So a real double whammy is being suffered.
I remind people who are listening to this debate that this is a government that still has on its website ‘Keeping inflation under control’ and ‘Keeping interest rates at record lows’. Again, I see the Liberal and National party senators nodding. How can you claim that you have kept interest rates at record lows when there have been eight increases in the last couple of years—and four increases since the election? Clearly, interest rates are not at record lows. The Liberal Party continues to mislead—and I have to say that I am using relatively gentle language; I would not use the word ‘lie’—the Australian community about its recent very poor record in keeping interest rates low and keeping inflation under control. I would not be surprised if its website is adjusted. It should be pulled down or readjusted to read ‘Allowing inflation to increase’ and ‘Eight interest rate increases in a row since the election’. That is the sort of adjustment that should be made to the website. Indeed, at the bottom there should be an apology from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, for having misled the Australian people.
But inflation feeding into higher interest rates and impacting on families and their ability to pay the bills are just some of the more important poor recent economic indicators. I want to turn to a couple of other areas. One is productivity performance and productivity growth, which has declined significantly over the last two years as well. Productivity growth is important because it is fundamental to maintaining growth in real wages and fundamental to growing employment. If productivity growth starts to decline, and it has declined significantly in the last two years, that has a significant economic impact. The government, because of its arrogance and because it is out of touch, has failed to deal with a number of important issues in respect to labour market demand, other labour market issues and productivity generally—for example, there should be a much greater focus on education and training issues. Because of its neglect in the area of productivity, we have seen a significant increase in the number of foreign workers coming into this country to try and redress the economic issues around labour market demand. It should be Australians first. Because of this government’s neglect, there is an increasing reliance on foreign workers. That should not be the preferred approach of any government. The government has taken its eye off the ball in regard to elements of productivity.
There are some other worrying signs as well. Look at debt levels, both national debt and personal debt. At the moment, Australia’s foreign debt is approximately $500 billion. We heard a lot about Australia’s debt levels when the current government was in opposition, but over the last 10 years under this Liberal government foreign debt levels have increased some 2½ times, to $500 billion. That equates to a foreign debt level of approximately $25,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. If you took the debt truck that the Liberal Party has parked for the last 10 years in the garage and brought it out, you would have a B-double. The size of Australia’s debt has grown. This is very important, because this impacts on interest rates as well.
If you look at Australia’s interest rates by world comparison, if you have growing foreign debt and problems with your current account exports and imports—those economic difficulties—then there will be upward pressure on interest rates. Because the government has paid insufficient attention to growing foreign debt and to ensuring that our exports are stronger—for example, in the areas of services and manufacturing, where they have been slipping; mining is doing well, but manufacturing and services are declining—that means that you have to attract capital into the country. That is one of the reasons why interest rates are higher than they otherwise would be. As of today, Australia has the second-highest interest rates of all advanced Western European style economies. Only New Zealand has a higher interest rate. Australia’s interest rate has been very high by international comparisons for some years. That is because of that neglect of the issues of foreign debt and our current account exports and imports. As we have seen recently, and which is again reflected in today’s decision, there has also been neglect of inflation. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-11-08,"—I admire Senator Sherry—I have to say that from the outset—because he has obviously adopted very early in his life the idea that if at first you do not succeed then you must try and try again. He repeatedly comes into this chamber and tries to attack this government on its economic record. Once again, he has failed. But he will be back, because he insists on raising the economic record of this government. The Labor Party, to their credit, do their very best. They trot out their finest economic spear carriers and hurl their spears at the economic record of this government. Unfortunately for Senator Sherry and his Labor Party colleagues, the only spears that they are carrying are spears of overcooked asparagus. The Australian public will not swallow overcooked asparagus. Nor will they swallow the rhetoric and point scoring that Senator Sherry and the Labor Party are engaging in. They are seeking, quite simply, to undermine the economic prosperity that this government has delivered for this nation and the Australian people. Critically analysing the Labor Party’s economic policy is like considering the hole in a Krispy Kreme doughnut: there is simply nothing there. There is no pastry; there is not even a sprinkling of sugar to make it more palatable. Rather than consider the hole in a Krispy Kreme doughnut which the Labor Party produces, let us consider the balanced meal that is the economic record of this government and compare it with the empty calories that are being produced by the other side.
Australian householders’ balance sheets are in very good shape. Nominal wealth has increased in this country by about 11 per cent per annum since we have taken government. Don’t just take my word for it: Mr Ric Battellino wrote in a Reserve Bank of Australia bulletin—and this is what the Labor Party has been focusing on today—that interest rates ‘should not be viewed in isolation’ and that many households are ‘increasing both their debt and their holdings of financial assets’. So, yes, there is a corresponding increase in debt for people, but we are also talking about an increase in household net worth. This is lost on the Labor Party; they focus on the hole. We cannot continue to respect these isolationist, empty arguments, which are full of calories but with no viable nutritional value.
In his considerations, Senator Sherry also raised inflation. Access Economics—widely regarded and often used to support arguments—said in their recent Business Outlook:
Underlying inflation is rising as demand catches up to the economy’s supply-side potential, which, in turn, is raising wages and the cost of materials. Headline inflation has risen even more, topped up by bananas and petrol prices.
We accept that. But any balanced or reasonable economist knows that you look at core inflation. The headline inflation rate is discounted for these variables. Core inflation in this country is still at less than three per cent—I understand the medium adjusted inflation rate is 2.9 per cent. Access Economics continues:
The momentum behind demand may keep underlying inflation flirting with 3% for a while, but its next big move is down. New supply is coming—more workers, factories, mines and roads. That will send underlying inflation back down through 2007 and 2008.
A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. And to the Labor Party I say: this is your medicine. We are going into a controlled inflationary environment that is going to sustain the economic prosperity of this nation and benefit the Australian people.
Let us talk about productivity for a moment. The Labor Party will have you believe the trend is down. I suggest to them that they have their graphs upside down because labour productivity output per hour worked grew by 1.4 per cent through the year to the June quarter. If that is a trend, it is a pretty good one. If you look at it on a five-year cycle, as produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, what used to take five hours of work to produce now takes four in this country. That is a pretty good trend. So, turn your graphs up the other way and perhaps you will start to get some coherent economic analysis going.
What about national and personal debt levels? Once again the Labor Party is full of rhetoric and light on substance. They are talking about national debt levels. This government, to my knowledge, does not have net debt. I think national debt is owned by companies that make prudent decisions in accordance with business policy. Sometimes that money is invested overseas, or in fact borrowed from overseas. It is sustaining economic growth in this country, it is sustaining productivity and it is sustaining prosperity.
The Labor Party once again focus only on the negative. They fail to recognise that they are cultivating a culture of fear and negativity that revolves around scaring the Australian people. The Australian people will not swallow these empty lines. They know that they cannot continue to eat sugary substances, because it will affect their overall health. No matter what you throw out there and produce, they are going to see through it. The Labor Party forget that our households have $6 in total assets and $2 in total financial assets for every single dollar in debt. The net nominal wealth for households in Australia is about $5.225 trillion. That is $5,225 billion. That is nearly three times the level it was at the time this government took office. When the Labor Party was in office, it was $1,748 billion. So the trend towards increased nominal wealth is also supported.
Let us touch on the subject du jour of mortgage rates. No-one likes higher mortgage rates. We know that they cause pain to Australian families. But we also know that sometimes the Reserve Bank, acting independently, has to take measures that are in the best interests of sustaining economic growth in this country. This government has never sought to interfere in interest rates, aside from pursuing prudent fiscal monetary policy. Senator Minchin said today that interest rates, at 8.05 per cent today, were never ever seen under Labor’s 13 years of hard labour, which they foisted on the people of Australia. In 1996, when we took office, interest rates were 10.5 per cent. They are now nearly 2½ percentage points, 250 basis points, below that.
Let us talk about housing affordability. In 1989, under Labor, 30.4 per cent of disposable income went out to pay off the average mortgage. It was high; it was unacceptably high: 30.4 per cent. It is less under this government. Let us be realistic about this. When I was growing up bank managers used to say, ‘If you want a mortgage, the bank will assess your suitability for a mortgage on your ability to repay the loan.’ Banks are still making these decisions today. There are, once again, conflicting stories on the Labor Party side about housing affordability. One is lamenting the decline in house prices and one is lamenting the affordability. What is the preponderance of that? It is zippo. You have a hole. There is nothing there. One negates the other. There is zero coherent policy on the other side.
What about the other trends they are barking on about today? I have to repeat: they have their graphs upside down, because trade is good. Manufacturing exports in this country increased by 12 per cent to a record $39.5 billion in the last 12 months. In volume terms, they rose by 6.4 per cent in 2005-06. The choice for the Australian public is very clear: they can have a balanced meal, one that will sustain them for many years, with this coalition government, or they can chase empty calories, which are very dangerous to health, wealth and prosperity, by appointing a Labor government and undoing the good work that has been done over the last 10 years.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Inflation and Interest Rates</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,15,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-11-08,"—The issue before us is not an immediate, today’s issue—it is a culmination of a long-term effect, which is the effect of underlying inflation and demand on the economy and, consequently, the determination of the Reserve Bank to apply a monetary policy ‘brake’—and I note that that was the word used by Senator Minchin in replying to a question today.
Inflation, of course, has many causes. One of them is a shift in import prices. Import prices, the cost of capital and the flow of capital are indeed affected by interest rates and whether they have a premium over foreign interest rates. But probably the greatest effect for import prices in recent times has been the exogenous effect of a rise in oil prices, and we recognise that. And there is very little either this government or any government can do about that. So we really have to look at the endogenous area—the domestic area, domestic policy. If you look at the issue of business costs, businesses’ costs rise when events occur which force them to increase their prices, and of course that has an inflationary effect. It is a direct consequence of the government’s obsession with markets and with a backing-off of intervention that, to some extent, we have inflationary effects on business costs.
The first and most obvious example is a failure to recognise that reducing the percentage of GDP spent on education and training would result in fewer skills being available. The consequence of fewer skills being available is that businesses have to pay more to make sure that they get those skills. If they pay more, they then have to raise their prices. So government had a very conservative view and a very economic rationalist view, which I think they are backing off from now, which said: ‘Let the market control these matters. The market will supply the skills and the people that are required.’ If anyone thinks we do not have the raw numbers available, one in 20 Australians are unemployed and one in seven are underemployed. If they had been properly trained and educated and if other things had been done, we probably would not have that price effect.
Another effect has been recognised by the government, and that is regulatory overlap—the consequence of a failure to invest in infrastructure or in resolving the various regulators that govern the economy. The government has now recognised this, but the delay in attending to that has meant that bottlenecks have occurred. When bottlenecks occur, costs rise for businesses and they pass them on in prices. So there are underlying effects on inflation from that area.
In the area of consumer demand, the failure of the government to follow the lead of advanced Western economies and restrict and restrain negative gearing has contributed to asset inflation. Essentially, over a million households are engaged in negative gearing. They record something like $10-odd billion of tax losses on their negative gearing. They have freed up the equity in their homes, or they have borrowed, in order to acquire assets to lay them off for a tax purpose now, with the intention of gaining a capital gain later. The consequence of that is excessive demand in the economy, excessive confidence. And eventually the market will work and people will get burnt and hurt, and, to some extent, this interest rate is a consequence of that.
I recognise that government ministers have slogged their guts out, working very hard at things they think important. But I think they have not paid enough attention to the future, and by not paying enough attention to infrastructure, to skills and to the issues of negative gearing and restraining asset inflation they have contributed to an inflationary situation. Unfortunately I only have five minutes—otherwise I would give you much more of the same, but I hope you have got the message.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Inflation and Interest Rates</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,15,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-11-08,"—At the last election, Middle Australia put their trust in John Howard on interest rates. And what have they got back since then? They have got back four successive rate increases. Today the Prime Minister got what he has been softening up the electorate for, with the rates rise he gave the green light to—his fourth consecutive interest rate rise since the last election, since the commitment was given to keep interest rates at record lows, and the eighth successive increase in interest rates since 2002, I think.
The reality is that Australians are more highly indebted than they ever have been, and the proportion of disposable income that families have to find to meet the interest payments on their mortgages is higher now than it ever was under Labor. Australian families understand what the new interest rate reality is, and there is no such thing as a small interest rate rise.
But unfortunately this government is too arrogant and too out of touch to understand this. We have a Treasurer who says that any interest rate below double figures is low. We saw Mr Turnbull, when commenting on the previous rate rise, trying to argue that that last rate rise was overdramatised. And then, today, here we have Senator Bernardi, who suggests that Labor’s criticism of the government’s economic management resulting in an interest rate increase was akin to the hole in a Krispy Kreme doughnut. I am sure the Australian families who are going to struggle with the ever-increasing cost of meeting their mortgage interest repayments arising out of eight successive interest rate increases think this is a little more important than a hole in a Krispy Kreme doughnut.
Let us have a little discussion about the sort of pressure that the government’s broken promise is placing on Middle Australia and the reasons behind the most recent interest rate increase, consistent with previous warnings from the Reserve Bank. It is probably useful to go to the governor’s statement, where he states:
Domestic demand has been expanding at a relatively strong pace against a background of limited spare capacity. Labour market conditions have remained tight and businesses are reporting high levels of capacity usage.
                  …         …         …
This combination of forces has contributed to an increase in inflation. In the September quarter the underlying inflation rate was … 3 per cent …
What are the factors which are contributing to inflation? If you read what the Reserve Bank has said both on this occasion and on previous occasions—warnings that the Howard government has simply failed to acknowledge and failed to act upon—it is quite clear that the Reserve Bank has been saying for some time that the supply side of the economy, the capacity constraints which exist and the fact that demand has grown so substantially have added to inflationary pressure. It is quite clear from what the Reserve Bank has said that we are looking at capacity constraints. This is putting pressure on inflation which, in turn, is putting pressure on interest rates.
But of course that is not what the Howard government say. They seek to blame anyone and everyone else when it comes to the inflationary pressures in the economy which, in turn, are putting pressure on interest rates. The reality is the Howard government are failing to manage inflation, and this is the primary reason we see interest rates going up for the fourth successive time since they promised to keep interest rates at record lows. What are some other things the government have ignored? The Howard government have been too short sighted to act appropriately on the skills crisis. They have failed to invest sufficiently in research and development and innovation and they have failed to invest in infrastructure.
I want to briefly comment on household debt levels, because the government does not seem to understand the reality that is facing Australian families. The reality is that mortgage interest repayments under John Howard are around nine per cent of disposable income. That is higher than they ever were under previous Labor governments, and families are using a greater proportion of their income on mortgage interest repayments than ever occurred under Labor. That is the reality. I tell you what else is the reality: we are more highly indebted than we ever have been. The average Australian household now owes $1.57 in debt for every $1 of disposable income they earn. The government can only talk for so long about the balance sheet and the growth in assets values to justify the ever-increasing proportion of disposable family income which is being spent on mortgage interest repayments.
Let us look at what the Prime Minister says. Do you see him saying, ‘I see that the Reserve Bank yet again has talked about capacity constraints, skills and the labour market being tight’? No. He says, ‘There is also upward pressure on interest rates now being exerted because some state governments are going into deficit.’ It is extraordinary. He is trying to blame Labor state governments. What is amazing about the government is that they are incredibly quick to take responsibility, to take credit, when there is not an interest rate increase but, if there is one, all of a sudden it is everybody else’s fault—it is the price of bananas, it is the price of petrol or ‘The state governments are doing this or doing that.’ I think Australians are going to become increasingly tired of the government’s willingness to take responsibility for the upside of being in government but their failure to take responsibility for the downside, which is when there are inflationary pressures resulting substantially, at least, from their failure to invest in productivity and the supply side of the economy, which people expect them to take responsibility for.
I want to briefly talk about investment in skills, and Senator Murray was right to identify that as a major problem. As I have previously said in this place, it is an extraordinary act of economic irresponsibility for the government to allow us as a country—the only OECD country, I think; certainly one of the few—to go backwards in terms of public investment in education and training over the last decade. According to the most recent figures, the average OECD increase in public investment in post-school education—that is, vocational and higher education—was a 48 per cent increase. What has Australia’s investment been during the term of this government? Minus seven per cent. That is the government’s contribution to skilling the Australian workforce, increasing productivity and ensuring that the economy on the supply side has the capacity to meet increasing demand.
Underinvestment is something that not just Labor but the Reserve Bank and business have been telling the government about for years. So, whilst the Prime Minister might want to continue to blame the states and to mislead the public about who sets interest rates and what impact they have, he fails to take responsibility for the fact that, under his government, there has been a massive underinvestment, in international terms, in post-school education. Also, the Productivity Commission has recently warned the Howard government against its narrow focus on the commercialisation of public research and called for a rethink of industry research and development incentives. We all know that innovation is critical to Australia’s ongoing economic prosperity. It delivers critical economic, social and environmental benefits. The Productivity Commission is echoing a range of concerns, which have been raised by others, about the government’s failure to have a coherent strategy on innovation and about the underinvestment in research and development.
I turn very briefly to infrastructure. Infrastructure has been identified as one of the factors contributing to capacity constraints in the economy on a number of occasions. Do we have national leadership from the Howard government when it comes to infrastructure? We do have national leadership, but do you know what it is for? It is for pork-barrelling. That is what the infrastructure leadership from the Howard government is for—National Party interest before the national interest and, frankly, that has to stop. There are a range of examples which demonstrate the government’s propensity to spend funds—which should be spent on productive infrastructure—on what can only be described as electoral pork-barrelling. For example, in the Liberal Party seat of Forde, the government spent over $5 million on a steam train that has not generated enough steam to boil an egg and, in the seat of Dobell, $1.5 million was spent to dredge the famous Tumbi Creek, which was already clearing itself. Meanwhile, again in the electorate of Forde, $370,000 a year could deliver Labor’s trade completion bonus, which is a plan to halve the current dropout rate of apprentices and produce an extra 46 qualified local tradespeople.
We know from the Business Council of Australia there is a substantial shortfall—$90 billion—in Australia’s infrastructure, and the response from the Howard government is to continue to pork-barrel. In the very short time I have allocated, I want to say one thing. We saw Senator Minchin today, again, refuse to take responsibility for this matter. In 2005, when there was not an interest rate increase, he put that down to the government’s record of economic management. I cannot recall the exact quote—‘great economic management’, ‘good economic management’ or something like that.
Including today, there have been eight successive interest rate increases—four since the last election. Do we see the government stepping up to take responsibility and recognising that their economic management has contributed to this? No, we do not. We see yet more blame-shifting and more finger-pointing—‘anybody but me’. They are happy to take the upside, they are happy to take the credit—but not the responsibility. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2006-11-08,"—Labor have been hoping for this day. You can imagine how excited they were flying to Canberra on Sunday night thinking to themselves, ‘Only two more sleeps to the RBA board meeting.’ You can imagine how excited they were when they woke up this morning: ‘Only a few hours until 9.30 am when the RBA will announce its decision.’ The sad truth is that Labor have been athinkin’ and awishin’ and ahopin’ and aprayin’ for this rate hike. They could barely contain their excitement. Mr Beazley was out there yesterday with his billboard. Labor have already released their TV ads. They popped their MPI in before the RBA had even issued its release. They were just that keen. But let me pose a question: what has the Labor Party done in opposition to help create a low interest rate environment? What has the Labor Party done in opposition to help take pressure off interest rates?
—You’re in government.
—People might laugh and think, ‘Well, they’re in opposition: what could they possibly do?’ There are things an opposition can do to help. Let me tell you what they are. Labor, as we have heard them say, are in favour of lower interest rates. Yet everyone in this chamber knows that they delivered a $96 billion debt to us when we came to office.
One thing we do know is that high government debt and large budget deficits put upward pressure on interest rates. Having delivered nine budget deficits in 13 years, having left a $96 billion debt—which was putting upward pressure on interest rates—you might think Labor felt some obligation, felt some sense of responsibility, to help solve the problem. But no: Labor opposed every single measure in this chamber and in this parliament designed to put the budget back into balance. They say that they support balanced budgets; it is just that they oppose every single measure designed to get the budget back into balance. They say that they support low inflation and they say that they support low interest rates; it is just that they oppose the very policy settings required to create a low interest rate environment—such as paying off debt and supporting a government that is endeavouring to budget without resort to deficits.
Yet Labor have the audacity and the absolute hide to come into this chamber and lecture us about interest rates. Labor have done everything that they could in opposition to help maintain an economic environment like the one they left behind. They have done everything they possibly could to maintain a high-inflation environment, a high interest rate environment and a high-unemployment environment. Despite Labor’s obstructionism and despite their opportunism, they have failed. Labor have failed to prevent us from balancing the budget. Labor have failed to prevent us from reforming the tax system. Labor have failed to stop us freeing up the labour market. Labor have failed to stop us lowering inflation, interest rates and unemployment. And Labor have failed to stop us keeping the economy growing strongly.
Now, having been opponents of good policy at every step, Labor feel they have somehow earned the right to delight in and crow about a rate rise. The opposition are seeking to misrepresent the government’s comments on interest rates. They seek to verbal us—to claim that we contended that rates would not rise under a coalition government. But what we said was that rates would be lower under a coalition government than they would be under a Labor government. We never said that rates would never move again. We never said that rates would only ever fall. What we said was that rates would be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government. That is what we said. And you know what? We were right. We were right then and we are right now.
Why did we make that claim at the election? Why did we say that interest rates would be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government? Because mortgage rates under Labor peaked at 17 per cent, because mortgage rates under Labor averaged 12.75 per cent and because mortgage rates under Labor when they lost office were still 10.5 per cent. Labor say: ‘Don’t worry about that. That’s all in the past. That was a long time ago. We’re different. We’ve learnt.’ Well, how different are Labor now? When they were in government Kim Beazley was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Who are Labor putting up as the alternative Prime Minister today? A Mr Kim Beazley. It must be a different Kim Beazley if Labor have changed that much. Why do I look at Labor’s record? Because any good psychologist will tell you that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. Do not listen to what Labor say; look at what they have done.
On this side of the chamber we are happy to be scrutinised and we are happy for people to look at what we have done. We are happy for people to look and see that under this government mortgage rates are down from 10.5 per cent to 8.05 per cent, that mortgage rates have averaged around 7.18 per cent. The interest rate reduction from 10.5 per cent under Labor to the interest rates we have today would save a person with an average new mortgage of about $220,000 around $449 per month. We are very happy for people to look at our record. There are a couple of good case studies as to the callous disregard that Labor have for homebuyers—one is federal and one is state.
I will start with the federal example. I read an article in the Australian newspaper on 1 December last year with the heading ‘“Energy-guzzling” McMansions in Labor’s sights’. It said:
AUSTRALIA’S “energy guzzling” McMansions are in Labor’s sights under a new housing policy designed to tackle the nation’s supersized houses.
                  …         …           …
The new housing agenda calls for a “redesign” of the popular first-home-owner grant scheme ...
I think we all know what a ‘redesign’ of that scheme might mean—that it will not be there for every new homebuyer as it is currently. That is what Labor have in mind. That is what Labor think of first homebuyers—they want to ‘redesign’ the first home owners grant. The article goes on:
As Kim Beazley prepares to chase the aspirational vote at the 2007 election, the report suggests a radical rethink of Australia’s lust for bigger houses.
                  …         …         …
Opposition housing spokesman Kim Carr—who the article says lives in a large, sprawling two-storey house in Melbourne; and there is a lovely picture of it—wants to generate a debate on housing. He told the Australian:

“I am saying we cannot continue to build energy-guzzling houses without explaining to people the cost of building a house where you need two airconditioners to make it habitable,” he told The Australian.
How dare the Australian public want to own a large house! How dare they want a house that has two air conditioners!
Labor have some scary policy proposals in mind for Australian homebuyers when they get into government. Clearly, they want to do something funny on the first homeowners scheme and they want to re-educate the Australian people about the sorts of houses they should be buying. Fiona Allon, a fellow at the University of Western Sydney’s Centre for Cultural Research, warned in that article that homeowners might find a re-education campaign patronising. I think they would find it patronising. There is something the Labor Party can do if they are seriously concerned about housing affordability: the state Labor governments can free up more land in the capital cities and do something about stamp duty.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-11-08,"—The Australian government’s failure to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is feeding into the decision today by the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates. In his statement on monetary policy today, the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, confirmed that the Reserve Bank had taken ‘careful note of the likely economic effects of the drought’. The current drought is being exacerbated by the climate change that we face in our community. Climate change is going to drive up the cost of fuel, it is going to drive up the cost of food and it is going to drive up the cost of water, all of which will fuel inflation.
As my colleague Senator Brown said earlier today, the Howard government likes to talk about its record on fighting inflation, yet it has failed to tackle the No. 1 long-running cause of the increased cost of living in Australia. The government’s failure to address climate change now and, indeed, over the last 10 years has fuelled inflation and contributed to the interest rate increase we have seen today. While today’s interest rate increase is only in part due to the current drought, there is little doubt that petrol prices, energy prices, water prices and food prices will face upward pressure due to both the direct impacts of climate change and the introduction of policy mechanisms designed to address climate change.
Australians have said time and time again that they are willing to pay more to protect themselves from climate change. Yesterday’s ACNielsen poll showed that 91 per cent of Australians believe climate change is a serious problem, and 63 per cent said they would be prepared to pay more to tackle the problem. It is ironic that the Prime Minister says he will not introduce a carbon tax because of the cost to taxpayers when it is those same taxpayers who are now paying higher interest rates because of the government’s failure to tackle climate change.
The Australian Greens are the only party to have voted against this year’s round of income tax cuts. We argued at the time—and we continue to argue—that those tax cuts would have been better spent helping to address the pressing problem of climate change. Unfortunately, those same tax cuts have increased consumer spending, which is inflationary and has contributed to today’s interest rate rise. Australia’s economy and Australia’s environment need the same thing: urgent action from the government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Greens have a far better track record than this government when it comes to putting forward proposals on how to manage an economy that is in the midst of a climate change crisis—and the community recognises that. In a recent Roy Morgan poll of around 11,000 Australians, 48.1 per cent said the Greens were the best party to tackle climate change. The Greens have been proposing mechanisms by which the Howard government can change our economy to deal with climate change for decades—mechanisms such as a carbon tax; a price signal for carbon, through a carbon emissions trading scheme; and investment in renewable energy, rather than tax breaks for polluting and extractive industries.
Just last week in the United Kingdom the Stern report warned of dire consequences for our economy if we do not address climate change. Sir Nicholas Stern warned that the economic and social consequences would be ‘on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century’. Over the last 10 years, the government has failed to tackle the challenge posed by climate change and to reorient our economy to deal with the climate challenge. Let us see the much-needed investment in renewable energy. Let us see a commitment to a carbon tax—from the government and, indeed, the opposition. We need to see the political leaders of our day make a commitment to our country, our economy and our environment.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Inflation and Interest Rates</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,15,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-11-08,"—Labor attacking the government on the economy is utterly incredible. It reminds me of a scene from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which the Black Knight has lost his arms and legs in a fight. He demands that his assailant continue the fight, telling him it is ‘only a flesh wound’. For 13 years, this country saw Labor economically lose arms and legs. The one overriding reason Labor have been in opposition federally for 10 years is that, in government, they are hopeless economic managers—incompetent and useless. What do we get today? No policy, no ability. The states, under Labor, are all running deficits—and that gives us a little entree of what we would get under Mr Beazley.
Let us look at Labor’s legacy as hopeless economic managers of this country for 13 years. Under Labor the net government debt was $95.8 billion in 1995-96; under this government it is minus $4.8 billion today. Interest on government debt under Labor in 1996-97 was $8.4 billion; today it is $0.5 billion. Under Labor there were 8.3 million Australians in work; today we have 10.1 million Australians in work. The unemployment rate was 8.2 per cent in March 1996; today it is 4.9 per cent. There were 197,800 long-term unemployed in March 1996—and I will have some more to say about them in a moment—and there are 91,000 today. Average inflation was 5.2 per cent under Labor; today it is 2.5 per cent. Average mortgage rates were 12.75 per cent under Labor; under us they are 7.15 per cent.
One of the most important statistics is that, when we took over, we ranked 13th on the OECD table of living standards; today we rank eighth. We have exceeded a number of countries, including Germany, Italy, Denmark, Sweden—a host of European countries—and Japan. Household wealth was $2,047 billion in March 1996; today it is $4,632 billion. That is a snapshot of the difference between this government and Labor and of the economic drive that this government has brought to bear for this country.
What do we get from Labor? As my learned friend and colleague Senator Fifield said, they are awishin’ and ahopin’. It is the greatest free kick they think they have ever had, yet we still do not have the sense, smell or aroma of any policy. There is a black hole of policy. What would they do in government with respect to inflation? Silence is the stony reply. Under Labor Australia’s credit rating was twice downgraded. That is how successful Labor was as an economic manager. In 1986 and 1989 Standard and Poor’s took us back. In 2003 our credit rating was finally restored to AAA by this government. That is our achievement. The runs are on the board and the objective international commentators have acknowledged that.
Let us talk about the long-term unemployed for a moment. The number of long-term unemployed stands at 91,000 today. That figure has come down by 106,000 or 54 per cent since the coalition came into office. The number of long-term unemployed peaked at 329,800 in May 1993. Guess who was the employment minister then: the current Leader of the Opposition. He presided over the largest number of long-term unemployed in recent times. More particularly and more worrying is teenage unemployment. The number of 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work stood at 63,900 in June 2006, down from 133,400 in July 1992. That was the number of young people trying to get a job, seeking work at that time. Under Mr Beazley’s management there was a complete dearth of employment.
Let us look at what Labor did in their last five years in office. In the last five years of the Labor government, from 1991 to 1995-96, cumulative deficits totalled $69 billion. Under Labor, net government debt rose from $16.9 billion to $95.8 billion—a huge achievement. They were spending like drunken sailors. They were the government of tax and spend. That is Labor’s record.
Mr Beazley was Minister for Finance from December 1993 to March 1996. Over this period net government debt climbed from $55.2 billion in 1992-93 to $95.8 billion in 1995-96—the highest level on record. That is the dubious distinction of Labor’s track record—and they come along here today to lecture us on interest rates! It is absolutely laughable. Net interest payments on debt increased from $2.9 billion in 1992-93 to $7.8 billion in 1995-96—the highest level of government debt on record, and it was under Mr Beazley’s stewardship. Goodness me: what a lot to look forward to if he were ever—frightening as it is to contemplate—elected to lead this country!

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-11-08,"—Once again the Senate has accorded an Australian citizen a right of reply under section 5. As I have said previously, I think it is very commendable that the Senate allows this provision to be exercised. I have often drawn the odious comparison with the other place, the House of Representatives, which to my knowledge, although I have not updated it of late, has only ever allowed one reply. They have very similar provisions to ours. Mr Acting Deputy President, I could not tell you how many replies we have allowed but I think there would have been at least 50 over the last decade or more. The House of Representatives, in the early stages, took the attitude that generally they would not allow any replies. The reason for that is that at least one or two precious individuals, including a grub I know very well, always took the attitude you should never give anyone the chance to criticise politicians. That was the reason that even the government members on the House of Representatives Privileges Committee always felt stymied. Now that person has gone from the place, I would expect them to lift their performance in this particular way.
The Senate Standing Committee of Privileges has the onerous duty of not merely ticking a reply but making sure that it is in conformity with the provisions of privileges resolutions and also our past practice. In other words, this is not just an open go. If the person responding starts to open up a new front or is abusive or overly critical in their response, we have to suggest that it be modified. This was the case in this particular response, and it is often the case, because we do not want to start tit-for-tat warfare in this chamber. In general, these amendments are negotiated, usually by the secretary of the committee with the concurrence of the chair and deputy chair of the committee, and eventually we see the reply in the form that it has arrived in today.
The committee does not distinguish bet-ween the natures of misrepresentation, defamation et cetera—but I do. I think there are different forms. I think things said about colleagues in this place can always be responded to but an attack on the character of a third party, if it is a preplanned attack like an arranged question and a detailed answer read out, goes beyond the pale on occasions and is far more serious than the offhand and hot-headed remarks that senators often make and later regret. I also think we should think seriously if it is an attack based on someone’s philosophical or religious beliefs, and I find it hard to distinguish in this case whether that was the case. If you attack someone’s spiritualism in this place, I do not think that actually enhances the role and reputation of the Senate. I would also say about this particular case that what really bemused me was not the attack against Dr Hamilton but the allegation that the Australia Institute is some sort of front organisation for the Labor Party and the Greens. I have never heard of it and I have never heard of Dr Hamilton, so if he is a stooge of ours he will come as a surprise to me and, I think, many other senators. We have seen him in the public domain before expressing views, but he certainly does not speak on behalf of the Labor Party or at our behest.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
Appendix One
Response by Dr Clive Hamilton
Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988

On 18
th
 October 2006, in reply to a question from Senator Heffernan, Senator Abetz launched a personal attack on me ostensibly in response to my comments on drought relief to Australian farmers. By taking some words of mine wholly out of context, he attempted to defame me by ridiculing my religious experiences.


The same words used by Senator Abetz were used by Senator Parer to attack me on 25
th
 September 1997, in reply to a question from Senator Abetz ostensibly about my views on greenhouse policy. The Privileges Committee recommended that my response to Senator Parer be incorporated in Hansard, which was duly done on 21 October 1997.


In 1994 I was invited by Caroline Jones to be a guest on her ABC Radio program 
The Search for Meaning. The Search for Meaning
 was a long-running program that provided an opportunity for well-known people to discuss their personal spiritual and religious journeys. It was difficult for me to decide whether to accept the invitation to appear because it would require some intimate revelations about my own spiritual journey. I feared that I may be misunderstood and, possibly, ridiculed by people who have little understanding of the subject. After the program, I had many letters and telephone calls from people around Australia thanking me for my candour and willingness to speak of these issues.


Senator Abetz has selected from the one-hour interview my description of the stage of the spiritual journey known as the ‘confrontation with the shadow’, a well-known aspect of the process of ‘individuation’, that is, the process of achieving psychological wholeness. There is an extensive psychological literature on this process.


Many eminent Australians—including authors, scientists, poets, academics and religious leaders—have spoken or written of similar experiences, as any regular listener of Caroline Jones’ program would know. The experience of confronting the shadow is a persistent theme of the world’s literature. Some celebrated examples include Goethe’s 
Faust
 and Dante’s 
Inferno
. I could name dozens more which deal with it explicitly. The theme also figures prominently in Australian literature including the work of A.D. Hope and Patrick White, the latter in his seminal work 
Voss
, to name but two.


This literature in turn reflects the graphic treatment of these experiences in the great religious writings of the world. They feature prominently, for example, in both the old and new testaments of the Bible and in the Bhagavad-Gita. Several of the best-known Christian theologians, including St John of the Cross, Master Eckhart and Hildegard of Bingen, provide detailed accounts of their experiences which closely resemble mine in form, content and resolution.


I was dismayed to hear Senator Abetz use intimate revelations about my spiritual journey in an attempt to smear me as an individual and undermine my credibility as a commentator on drought relief. The very same views on drought relief have been expressed recently by a wide range of experts and commentators including Professor Peter Cullen, Professor Mike Young, Mr Ross Gittins, the Productivity Commission and the Government-endorsed Agriculture and Food Policy Reference Group.


My credentials as a commentator have not been questioned by anyone, but in case any observer should have doubts after Senator Abetz’s attack I would like to record the following. I hold a degree in Pure Mathematics from the Australian National University, a First Class Honours degree in Economics from the University of Sydney and a DPhil from the University of Sussex. I have held permanent or visiting positions at the Australian National University, the University of Sydney, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of Cambridge.


I have published widely, including seven books and many articles in Australian and international refereed academic journals. I have been employed to carry out research by many government, business and community organisations including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the Department of Environment Sport and Territories, the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and the Sustainable Energy Development Authority.

If you attack someone’s spiritualism in this place, I do not think that actually enhances the role and reputation of the Senate. I would also say about this particular case that what really bemused me was not the attack against Dr Hamilton but the allegation that the Australia Institute is some sort of front organisation for the Labor Party and the Greens. I have never heard of it and I have never heard of Dr Hamilton, so if he is a stooge of ours he will come as a surprise to me and, I think, many other senators. We have seen him in the public domain before expressing views, but he certainly does not speak on behalf of the Labor Party or at our behest.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
Appendix One
Response by Dr Clive Hamilton
Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988

On 18
th
 October 2006, in reply to a question from Senator Heffernan, Senator Abetz launched a personal attack on me ostensibly in response to my comments on drought relief to Australian farmers. By taking some words of mine wholly out of context, he attempted to defame me by ridiculing my religious experiences.


The same words used by Senator Abetz were used by Senator Parer to attack me on 25
th
 September 1997, in reply to a question from Senator Abetz ostensibly about my views on greenhouse policy. The Privileges Committee recommended that my response to Senator Parer be incorporated in Hansard, which was duly done on 21 October 1997.


In 1994 I was invited by Caroline Jones to be a guest on her ABC Radio program 
The Search for Meaning. The Search for Meaning
 was a long-running program that provided an opportunity for well-known people to discuss their personal spiritual and religious journeys. It was difficult for me to decide whether to accept the invitation to appear because it would require some intimate revelations about my own spiritual journey. I feared that I may be misunderstood and, possibly, ridiculed by people who have little understanding of the subject. After the program, I had many letters and telephone calls from people around Australia thanking me for my candour and willingness to speak of these issues.


Senator Abetz has selected from the one-hour interview my description of the stage of the spiritual journey known as the ‘confrontation with the shadow’, a well-known aspect of the process of ‘individuation’, that is, the process of achieving psychological wholeness. There is an extensive psychological literature on this process.


Many eminent Australians—including authors, scientists, poets, academics and religious leaders—have spoken or written of similar experiences, as any regular listener of Caroline Jones’ program would know. The experience of confronting the shadow is a persistent theme of the world’s literature. Some celebrated examples include Goethe’s 
Faust
 and Dante’s 
Inferno
. I could name dozens more which deal with it explicitly. The theme also figures prominently in Australian literature including the work of A.D. Hope and Patrick White, the latter in his seminal work 
Voss
, to name but two.


This literature in turn reflects the graphic treatment of these experiences in the great religious writings of the world. They feature prominently, for example, in both the old and new testaments of the Bible and in the Bhagavad-Gita. Several of the best-known Christian theologians, including St John of the Cross, Master Eckhart and Hildegard of Bingen, provide detailed accounts of their experiences which closely resemble mine in form, content and resolution.


I was dismayed to hear Senator Abetz use intimate revelations about my spiritual journey in an attempt to smear me as an individual and undermine my credibility as a commentator on drought relief. The very same views on drought relief have been expressed recently by a wide range of experts and commentators including Professor Peter Cullen, Professor Mike Young, Mr Ross Gittins, the Productivity Commission and the Government-endorsed Agriculture and Food Policy Reference Group.


My credentials as a commentator have not been questioned by anyone, but in case any observer should have doubts after Senator Abetz’s attack I would like to record the following. I hold a degree in Pure Mathematics from the Australian National University, a First Class Honours degree in Economics from the University of Sydney and a DPhil from the University of Sussex. I have held permanent or visiting positions at the Australian National University, the University of Sydney, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of Cambridge.


I have published widely, including seven books and many articles in Australian and international refereed academic journals. I have been employed to carry out research by many government, business and community organisations including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the Department of Environment Sport and Territories, the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and the Sustainable Energy Development Authority.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I am continuing my speech begun earlier in the day on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006. This corrects a cause of constant concern expressed by people who say that currently second families, in particular the children of second families, are unfairly and inconsistently taken into account. There will also be changes to the maintenance arrangements for family tax benefit part A so that the reduction under the maintenance income test that applies to payment above the base level will be limited to those children in the family for whom child support is paid. More flexible arrangements, with better legal protection, will be made for parents who want to make agreements between themselves about the payment of child support and for how lump sum payments are treated. I think all of those positives in this legislation will go a long way to addressing the longstanding grievances that are expressed by both payers and payees about the child support system. These reforms are to ensure the scheme works in the best interests of children while balancing the interests of parents and reflecting community expectations.
In summarising, we must acknowledge that the impact on children of the separation of their parents should be minimised and that the psychological and emotional stress that separations can cause is often compounded by the current child support regime. Any change to this that will reduce the negative impact on children deserves the support of all senators.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—NEW FORMULA AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-11-08,"—When the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—New Formula and Other Measures) Bill 2006 was being introduced in the other house, the statement was made was that these changes aim to:
... reduce conflict between separated parents, particularly through encouraging shared parenting as part of a system that is fairer and puts the needs of children first.
Importantly, the new formula reflects the value of shared parental responsibility and treats children more equally. This is a very noble sentiment and one that we all agree with. It does not differ too much from the sentiments that were expressed when the original legislation was brought down both in this place and in the House of Representatives. What has happened in the interim is that there has been a need—a quite clearly identified need, I think—for the legislation to be reviewed. We celebrate the fact that through this process—and it has been a longstanding process—there has been a genuine attempt to have a look at the legislation, to talk with the people who are affected by the legislation and to try to make it better. It is a very difficult task because, as we all know, when we are dealing with the child support system and working with families that are dissolving, there is going to be conflict, there are going to be competing interests and there is going to be a wide range of views about what is fair and what is not.
The legislation before us cannot be looked at alone, because it reflects a wide range of processes which have been put in place over a number of years to change the way the child support system operates. Labor supports the fact that the system needs to be reviewed and that there needs to be change. We are deeply concerned about the impact that this legislation will have on the thousands of families who currently live with the child support system on a daily basis. It is a difficult process. It is one on which we should be prepared to engage. But I am particularly worried about how this legislation has been rushed through at this time. This saddens me, because the process of community consultation has been done with strong intent.
We know that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs spent an extensive period of time working through community consultation, working through legal involvement and also working to achieve some genuine issues that we can bring in to effective legislation into the future. I really hope people have taken the opportunity to read the Every picture tells a story report, because that was the result of months of intensive effort. Other senators have given respect to the number of members of the House of Representatives who gave up a great deal of their own time and also brought their own personal experiences to that final report. As a result of that report, the government then instituted a review, wonderfully chaired by Professor Parkinson. Again taking on board the need for the involvement of a range of people, particularly those who work with the system, out of that process came, I believe, a genuine commitment to making sure that we have a look at better and stronger legislation.
However, in many ways that incredibly valuable process has now been affected negatively by the shameless rush at the last round. We have set up a process where we need to work with people. We have expressed that publicly. The process around the introduction of this legislation has been appalling. That came out. People who were involved in the community affairs committee process looking at this bill came to us voluntarily to be part of the review of incredibly complex legislation. As their first point, the majority of witnesses who came to our committee—I was going to say every witness, but I do not think the department said it—stated that they had had inadequate time to consider the legislation. The legislation itself was very many pages. The explanatory memorandum was over 300 pages. What it was dealing with was particularly detailed changes to the legislation which were going to impact on their financial survival.
So what we have is an intent to engage people—an intent to make sure that people understand the background to the legislation, are involved in the implementation, understand the complexities and work together to implement the changes—and we immediately offend, dismiss and disrespect. And I do not understand why. That disrespect has been heightened by the fact that we needed to rush through the community consultation on the legislation. We gave people so little time to prepare their comments on the legislation. We gave the committee itself and the secretariat a ridiculously short time to present the report that many of us have read, I hope, looking at what we hope to achieve out of this process.
We have a legislation program implemented, and then it is changed. We are told the reason for the important rush was, quite realistically, the wide range of changes that had to be implemented across a number of departments, including the complex range of technological changes that had to be made in computer systems. Anyone who has worked in the system understands that need, because we have an implementation schedule that lasts over two years. My understanding is that the final range of legislation is due to be implemented in 2008. Given the time, I think I will cease my remarks there, rather than moving on to the next step.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-11-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on the tabling of the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation annual report 2005-06.The Special Broadcasting Service, known to most as SBS, has a unique role and unique responsibility in Australian broadcasting. That role is to reflect the multicultural nature of Australia within a media that reflects and amplifies the mainstream. These days, much of our commercial programming seems to reflect the American mainstream. But SBS reflects the varied and diverse cultures and histories of those who make Australia their home.
On SBS television you can see programs in more than 60 languages—subtitled, of course, in English. SBS was established to give a voice to multicultural Australia—to define, foster and celebrate Australia’s cultural diversity in accordance with their charter obligation to ‘provide multilingual and multicultural radio and television services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in doing so, reflect Australia’s multicultural society’. SBS television is watched by more than seven million Australians each week. What they see is a unique mix of Australian produced and international programs drawn from over 400 national and international sources.
Perhaps this is why some of the senators on the other side of this chamber spend so much time watching SBS. But I suspect not. I suspect that the reason senators such as Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Ronaldson spend so much time watching SBS, and apparently making notes on every single word they find questionable, is not an admiration for the way SBS fulfils its mandate or an appreciation of the wonderful diversity of the Australian community reflected in SBS programming. Their farcical performance at Senate estimates last week made it clear that these two senators cannot find anything better to do with their time than police one of our public broadcasters in a desperate search for something to justify their ideological opposition to SBS. How else can we understand Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s complaints that on a Dateline program:
... a left-wing candidate is referred to as a ‘leftist’ but the conservative candidate is referred to as ‘right wing’ twice.
I hope the people of New South Wales appreciate the efforts that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has taken on their behalf to clear up this absolutely crucial question of, and I quote Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the ‘far-left-wing bias’ of SBS. This farce would be laughable if SBS were not so important to our community. SBS celebrates difference and it promotes understanding. It gives Australians access to other cultures and languages, and it targets prejudice, racism and discrimination. SBS is the voice and the vision of multicultural Australia. But, as we have seen recently in comments by Mr Robb, this government has no time for multiculturalism. I quote from a story in the Weekend Australian on 4 November:
The Howard Government is looking to scrap the word ‘multiculturalism’ ...
As the Australian reported, this is:
... a shift in emphasis away from fostering diversity ...
The Howard government wants a monocultural Australia to suit their one-eyed vision of our nation. But they will never understand what SBS demonstrates: that our diverse, cosmopolitan, multicultural community is one of this country’s greatest strengths.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Special Broadcasting Service Corporation</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-11-08,"—My interest in small business is well known to my friends. It began long ago—my father was a small business man. Indeed, I have been a small business man, having started a number of small enterprises and been a self-employed hotelier. More than 95 per cent of businesses in Australia are defined as small, and currently there are more than 1.2 million small businesses in Australia. They all make an invaluable contribution to the prosperity and productivity of this country, providing jobs for more than 3.3 million people. It is interesting to note, given that we are faced with a very difficult drought circumstance, that 40 per cent of all small businesses in Australia actually operate in rural and regional areas.
It is timely that the government have announced some support measures to ensure the survival of regional and rural communities, but we have done much more than this for small business over many, many years. First and foremost, small business has benefited from a stronger economy. More Australians have higher incomes and more small businesses have more customers. They all benefit from lower interest rates. Small business lending rates have averaged 8.8 per cent since 1996, compared with a whopping 14.25 per cent under Labor’s reign. A reduction in company tax rates has benefited small business. It has fallen from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. We have made workplace relations simpler and fairer. We are encouraging employment and growth. However, perhaps one of our most successful small business policy initiatives is the federal government’s New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS, which is the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations’s most successful labour market program.
The NEIS program helps eligible unemployed people to start and run their own new, viable small business. During the first year of business, NEIS is there to train, support and help the entrepreneur to become self-supporting and independent. NEIS participants undertake an accredited three-month small business management course and in the first year business advice and mentor support help the business to become successful. The statistics tell the story. Seventy-five per cent of small businesses are known to fail in their first year simply because the entrepreneurs are not equipped to manage them effectively. Those entrepreneurs fail to plan or to research and sometimes they fail to properly cost their products and services. But, under the NEIS program, 75 per cent of projects succeed. Financial support for these microenterprises together with business training and mentoring through the NEIS program make for more successful small businesses in Australia.
I rise tonight to support a scheme recently announced by the National Australia Bank that I feel is extremely important. I commend the National Australia Bank for taking the initiative to assist in the development of very small business enterprises. The NAB recently announced that it has developed a specialised product to deliver affordable small loans to financially disadvantaged microenterprises. These microenterprises are small businesses with five or fewer people. Typically, they include owner-operator businesses and businesses operated from home; more often than not, they are operated by a stay-at-home partner. Typically, a loan to a microenterprise is between $500 and $20,000, which the NAB lends at a competitive interest rate. It financially supports the growth and establishment of new businesses in this country. These loans are designed to assist people who earn low incomes, have low asset bases and have very few or even no avenues to access affordable business credit.
Over time this void typically has been filled by loans from family members or by encumbering any assets these microenterprises have. Microbusiness is a way for the less fortunate amongst us who aspire to become self-employed to become so. It allows them to pull themselves out of the trap that they are in and more fully participate in the productivity and prosperity that is being generated in this country. Each year there are thousands of Australians with the drive, the motivation and the skills to set up a small business; they are only limited by their lack of access to capital and affordable credit.
Microenterprise schemes have been in the press quite recently, with a Nobel Prize being awarded to a microenterprise lender in India. In Australia we want to see a strong commitment to free enterprise and an encouragement of what I like to call the ‘culture of entrepreneurship’. Free enterprise builds the economy, creates jobs and can mean a way out of scarcity for many Australians on low incomes who have genuine business aspirations but are unable to realise them.
I have mentioned that we have 1.2 million small businesses in this country. They are a vital source of jobs, economic growth and innovation. By early 2007, many enterprising Australians will have had the opportunity to access affordable credit through microenterprise loans being offered by the National Australia Bank and by working within the NEIS program. It is heartening to see Australia’s biggest bank come on board and develop a successful microenterprise lending program. It is most likely that it will not be profitable for the National Bank, but it will make a very important contribution to the development of small business in this country. It goes to show that partnerships between government, business and, indeed, small business are indeed formidable. The combination of NEIS, NAB and Australia’s entrepreneurs will allow the culture of entrepreneurship to continue to grow—and I am very pleased to say that it continues to grow in my home state of South Australia.
Under NEIS, two young Adelaide women, Louise and Sapphira, both in their early 20s and with young children, saw a niche that needed filling in the Adelaide cafe market. As young mothers, they constantly found it difficult to meet where they could enjoy the atmosphere when accompanied by their children. Together they came up with the idea of a cafe that welcomed adults as well as children. Louise and Sapphira wanted to create a venue that served good coffee and healthy food in the type of environment that would keep children entertained and allow parents to relax.
They joined the NEIS program, through which they gained valuable business knowledge, training and skills. They started their business with only a few thousand dollars and it began to grow. Faced with the beautiful summers that are increasingly prevalent in Adelaide, Louise and Sapphira knew they would have to install reliable air conditioning and refrigeration systems. They had no assets to borrow money against, so they approached the National Bank, with the support of NEIS, for a small loan to enable them to make these purchases.
Not only were the National Bank impressed with how professional and dedicated Louise and Sapphira were towards their business venture but they also recognised the high level of business acumen Louise and Sapphira had developed through the NEIS program, so they were only too happy to assist. The result of this partnership is Cafe Komodo on Prospect Road. Louise and Sapphira were both inspired by their own children and Cafe Komodo now has classes for children in everything from art, music and puppetry to yoga and cooking. It provides parents with a place where they can network and meet with other young parents, building a sense of community and support.
But, importantly, the approach of Louise and Sapphira to the National Bank helped the National Bank identify a gap in the market—a gap that they readily acknowledged may not make money for them but which they see as an important part of community service. It is a service that I wholeheartedly support. It is an example of how strong financial backing together with positive business training and mentoring can change people’s lives for the better and lead to successful small business growth, which will contribute to our nation’s economic prosperity. It shows how successful partnership between government and private enterprise will continue to benefit Australia. I conclude by commending the National Bank on their willingness to implement microenterprise lending. I wish them and their partnership with small business in Australia working with the NEIS program every success.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Microenterprise Lending</title>,ADJOURNMENT,22,1,speech

The cost of maintaining the customer service line between 11 November 2004 (when the phone line was established) and 30 June 2006 was $376.
For the number of calls received by the general enquiry line, it has not been administratively efficient to keep records of expenses to the level of detail requested. Infrastructure and staff costs in particular were unable to be estimated, as all calls are managed in our already established offices, by existing staff, as an additional duty.
There were 1200 calls between 11 November 2004 and 30 June 2005.

1 represents the Multilingual call centre.
2 represents the two call centres which operate extended hours of operation from 8.00am – 8.00pm Monday to Friday.
The call centre locations have remained the same since 2000-01. The customer service lines represented in the table have remained relatively stable since 2000-01. Some customer service lines have increased staff numbers since 2000-01 and have included additional sites. For example, the Youth and Students customer service line was expanded into Tweed Heads call centre and Illawarra call centre in late 2004. The expansion of the customer service lines allows for flexibility in managing customer demand.

Australian Hearing
Australian Hearing operates a small customer support centre which is co-located with its Port Macquarie Hearing Centre in NSW. From April 2004, this customer support centre expanded to a national function with a core responsibility of outbound telephone calls which previously were handled by individual hearing centres.
The primary function is to confirm appointment and voucher details for hearing impaired clients throughout the entire network. Provision of this national function has resulted in an improvement in clinical efficiency and continuity of client service.
A secondary function is handling inbound calls from mobile phones within NSW and VIC, and as a business continuity option where temporary diversion of inbound calls reduces client service disruption. A recent example was the floods experienced in Northern NSW and Southern Queensland where temporary closure of Lismore, Tweed Heads and Southport hearing centres resulted in temporary diversion of inbound calls from these centres to the customer support centre.
Reporting is provided for the full 04-05 FY.
