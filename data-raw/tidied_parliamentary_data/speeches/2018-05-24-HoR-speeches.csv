Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (09:31):  


I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Turnbull government is backing business with more competitive taxes to help Australian businesses invest, grow and employ more workers as well as pay them more. More than a million Australians have got a job since this government was first elected back in 2013. That is a credit to the hundreds of thousands of businesses around the country who have taken the risks, put in the effort and given an Australian the best of all opportunities, a job.


The transformation of someone being able to come off welfare and get into work is the ultimate 12-point turnaround. The opportunity to actually prevent someone from not being in a job and get them into the job: this is what is driving our economy forward; this is what is driving the nation's finances forward. It all comes down to ensuring that you back business to invest and create jobs.


This is a central plank of the strong plan for a stronger economy that was set out in this year's budget. We're delivering on that commitment. As I said, more than one million extra jobs have been created. Employment is now at a record high of over 12½ million Australians now in work. I stress: that million jobs is net—that's net additional jobs.


As we know, there has been transition and dislocation in our economy as we've come off the top of the mining investment boom. Some $80 billion stripped out of our economy over that period, yet we continue to grow and we continue to add more and more jobs—more than a million jobs—to now have 12½ million Australians employed.


We're delivering on our commitment for a stronger economy through our more competitive business taxes. The government has already legislated tax cuts for 3.3 million small and medium Australian businesses, employing 6.8 million workers, as part of our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan.


We have increased the unincorporated small business tax discount rate from five per cent to eight per cent (up to a cap of $1,000). This rate will increase to 16 per cent by 2026-27.


Further, by lifting the small-business entity turnover threshold from $2 million to $10 million, access has also been extended to a range of small-business tax concessions, such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off.


This movement of defining this turnover of up to $10 million is one of the biggest things, if not the biggest thing, to happen to small-business taxation in generations. And it comes from an acknowledgement and an understanding by the government about what a small business actually is. A small business has a turnover of up to $10 million, and there are actually small businesses with turnovers even above that. One of the businesses I visited just last week—I am still constantly struck by it. This is a business with a turnover of almost $50 million. It has 35 employees. It's hardly a multinational. It's a radiator business in Rockhampton.


So businesses of up to $10 million now have rightly—rightly—been defined as small businesses and are attracting the tax arrangements that have been designed to support small businesses. So we're backing those small businesses by cutting red tape through streamlining GST reporting for around 2.7 million small businesses, and we are backing small business by levelling the playing field through countering illegal phoenixing and extending unfair contract term provisions.


On the issue of illegal phoenixing, this is a significant issue. It's an issue where businesses are often forced to go bust themselves because of the improper and illegal behaviour of other businesses who don't pay their bills and try to use the system to reinvent themselves and walk away from their obligations. It's not fair, it's not right and in this budget the government has taken strong action to ensure that that practice is obliterated wherever possible.


This bill will continue the government's plan for a stronger economy so that businesses can prosper, grow and hire more Australians. The bill continues the government's strong record of supporting small business to invest and grow by extending this successful $20,000 immediate deductibility threshold for a further 12 months to 30 June 2019.


Small businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million will be able to immediately deduct purchases of eligible assets each costing less than $20,000, which are first used or installed ready for use for another year to 30 June 2019.


Assets valued at $20,000 or more can continue to be placed into the small-business simplified depreciation pool and depreciated at 15 per cent in the first income year and 30 per cent each income year thereafter. The pool itself may also be immediately deducted if its value falls below $20,000 at the end of the financial year.


To facilitate access to this measure, the 'lockout rules' that stop small businesses that elect out of the simplified depreciation regime from re-entering it for five years will continue to be suspended until 30 June 2019.


This $20,000 instant asset write-off, first introduced in the 2015-16 budget, will continue to benefit small business, improving their cash flow and helping them to replace or upgrade their tools and equipment and write it off immediately.


This initiative reduces red tape for small business as they no longer need to track the annual depreciation for assets that are written off immediately, or maintain detailed records substantiating their depreciation claims.


The extension of this measure is welcomed by the small-business community all over the country.


Around 3.3 million incorporated and unincorporated businesses with aggregated turnover annually of less than $10 million will be eligible to access the $20,000 instant asset write-off.


It will continue to boost activity and investment for another year, encouraging hardworking Australian small businesses to renew their capital base so they can grow and create jobs.


Everything this government does is premised on the basis that, if you increase investment, then you increase the number of jobs there are in the economy. And, when you do that, then you're heading in the right direction. And there are more than a million jobs that have been created since the 2013 election, when we were first coming to government, that demonstrate that this plan is working, this plan is delivering, that this government's plan for a stronger economy continues to provide the direction that the country needs to ensure that the next decade we live in will be a decade of a stronger economy under these policy settings.


We have a plan for keeping business competitive to grow jobs and to support better wages.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


I call on all members to give this measure their full support and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House) (10:37):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am pleased to introduce the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018.


The bill has six schedules and would implement several new initiatives to deliver a range of services to veterans and their families to give them the support and services they need.


As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs I recognise the Australian community has a clear expectation veterans and their families will be well looked after, long after their service ends.


This bill demonstrates the commitment this government made in 2016 to put veterans first and continues on from the eight measures we introduced earlier this year under the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 1) Act 2018.


Schedule 1 of the bill would enable a veteran who is studying full time as part of an approved return to work rehabilitation plan to be paid their incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earning after 45 weeks.


Currently, a person's incapacity payments 'step down' to 75 per cent (or a higher percentage depending on weekly hours worked) of normal earnings after a period of 45 weeks.


We know the best type of support for our ex-service men and women is the economic independence that comes with a job.


Which is why we will continue to promote employment for veterans by ensuring the business community recognises the many benefits of employing a veteran.


Quite simply, it's good for your business to employ a veteran. They bring skills of leadership, discipline, teamwork and patriotism, which will benefit businesses around Australia.


We want to encourage and support our veterans to get back into the workforce, and assisting them financially while they study as part of a rehabilitation plan is one important way we can do this. Participation in a Department of Veterans' Affairs rehabilitation plan may include study to assist a veteran in returning to ongoing meaningful employment outside of the Australian Defence Force. For veterans participating in a rehabilitation plan, and in approved full-time study, their incapacity payment will not be reduced after 45 weeks.


Injured veterans are naturally concerned about financial security not only for themselves but also for their family. These amendments will allow those former members studying full time as part of their approved rehabilitation plan to focus on their study and not be concerned about financial matters.


As we know more than 5,000 men and women leave the service each year. This measure aims to make a real difference to how injured service men and women who are leaving the Australian Defence Force manage the transition to civilian life, in particular for those undertaking full-time study. This measure promotes veterans' employment and builds on the jobs and growth measures announced in the 2017-18 budget. 


Schedule 2 of the bill would give effect to a new Veteran Suicide Prevention pilot.


Reducing suicide, including among veterans, is a key priority for the government. Consistent with this focus, the government is committed to improving veterans' mental health. Suicide is an issue that affects many Australians, and the ex-serving community, tragically, is not immune. The 2017 National Mental Health Commission's review of suicide prevention services reinforces that suicide prevention is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted service response.


The government takes this issue seriously and is working to ensure that members of the ex-serving community experiencing mental health issues can access the support they need. The Veteran Suicide Prevention pilot will provide mental health support for veterans who have been hospitalised after attempted suicide, suicide ideation or who may be at increased risk of suicide because of their mental health or other factors. The Veteran Suicide Prevention pilot will target a small subset of veterans with complex mental and social health needs, including homelessness. 


The pilot will deliver a 'step down' service that takes into account factors that may lead to suicide, such as primary health, financial stress, housing and employment. The Veteran Suicide Prevention pilot will provide intensive services to ensure the veterans are accessing treatment and provide support to reduce the risk of suicide and enhance their quality of life.


This measure not only sets out to provide intensive support for up to 100 veterans who have complex mental health challenges but its evaluation will also inform future policy direction for veterans' mental health services. 


Schedule 3 would give partners under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 more time to choose whether to receive the compensation payable for their partner's death as a weekly payment, lump sum or a combination of both.


The proposed amendments would give partners, during what is a very difficult time, two years rather than the current six months to decide how they would like to receive their compensation.


The commission would retain the discretion to extend the time frame within which a partner can ask for more time to decide how they would like to receive their compensation, where special circumstances exist, beyond two years. This may be the case where there are complicated family law issues to be resolved, for example.


This measure demonstrates this government is listening and is putting the veteran community at the centre of decision-making so partners and families can determine when they are ready to decide when and how they receive the compensation and support that they need. 


Schedule 4 would extend the Long Tan Bursary to the grandchildren of an Australian Vietnam veteran, who has operational service in Vietnam. The Long Tan Bursary is part of the Veterans' Children Education Scheme.


Currently, the Long Tan Bursary scheme is limited to eligible children of an Australian Vietnam veteran. The proposed amendments would extend the eligibility so that an eligible grandchild of an Australian Vietnam veteran who has operational service in Vietnam, may apply for and be granted a Long Tan bursary to enable them to undertake post-secondary education.


The children of Vietnam veterans will remain eligible and their applications for Long Tan bursaries will be given first priority during the assessment process. This honours the original intent of the scheme.


It also demonstrates how we continue to recognise the important contribution of the Vietnam veterans who have given so much to our country to protect our great nation and freedoms and way of life. It is only right we support them and their families. 


Schedule 5 would deem a submariner's service on a submarine between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992 as operational service, where they served on a submarine special operation during that period.


A deeming provision will enable all submarine service during this period, by persons who have served on submarine special operations, to be treated as operational service. This provision will address the difficulties in determining whether an injury sustained or disease contracted by a submariner is related to service on a secret operation.


This amendment will ensure the classified nature of information about submarine special operations does not hinder access by these personnel to the benefits and entitlements available to those with operational service. In addition, this means submariners who are deemed to have operational service will have their claims assessed against the more generous provisions than those that apply to peacetime service.


This measure gives full effect to the intent of the Clarke review and will benefit those veterans and their widowers to be able to access the benefits to which they are entitled.


Schedule 6 would enable veterans with Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 coverage to lodge a claim for compensation orally. This amendment supports the veteran-centric reforms being made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and will lead to improvements for clients.


Currently, a claim for compensation must be made in writing and is distinct from a claim of liability. For those clients who wish to do so, they will be able to continue to make a written claim for compensation.


However, the amendments would mean a client will be asked during a needs assessment telephone call whether they want to make a claim for compensation, and their oral statement will be treated as a valid claim under the act.


This means a client will have the option to make a claim for compensation in writing or orally. This is all about making it easier for our clients to engage with us. 


This demonstrates this government has listened to the concerns and frustrations of veterans and their families and is committed to put them first and at the centre of the decisions we make. 


Each of the set of amendments will mean better outcomes for veterans and their families.


I commend this bill.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (11:02):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Dubai World Exposition in 2020.


On 25 March 2018, the government announced Australia's participation at the 2020 World Exposition. Australia's participation at Expo 2020 presents a unique opportunity to deliver a distinct image of Australia in the Middle East. Through engaging exhibits and targeted business and cultural programs, Australia will be promoted as a secure destination for investment, a producer of innovative and high-quality products and a provider of quality education and other services.


Expo 2020 will be the first international expo held in the Middle East. Themed around mobility, sustainability and opportunity, it will take place in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021. Expo 2020 is expected to attract more than 25 million visitors, with more than 70 per cent of visitors expected to come from outside the United Arab Emirates.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has responsibility for this project and will manage Australia's presence at the expo. The Public Works Committee has been briefed on the project by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and supports the project taking place. The Public Works Committee will maintain a connection to the project, receiving regular briefings and updates on the progress of the project as well as a post-implementation report.


Previous Australian pavilions at world expositions in Seville, in 1992; Hanover, in 2000; and Aichi, in 2005, were exempted from referral to the Public Works Committee on the grounds of urgency. Like these previous projects, the lead times between the announcement of Expo 2020 participation and the fixed deadline of the expo's opening are insufficient to undertake the design, build, statutory approvals and fit-out processes as well as accommodating a full formal Public Works Committee referral process. I commend the motion to the House.

 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (11:05):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Jindalee Operational Radar Network Phase 6 facilities project.


The Department of Defence is proposing to undertake a number of infrastructure works at Jindalee Operational Radar Network sites in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. The surveillance of Australia's air and sea space is a fundamental responsibility of the Australian Defence Force, and this surveillance capability is critical to providing border security through the detection, validation and tracking of air and surface targets. The 2016 Defence white paper noted the importance of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network and advised of the government's intention to upgrade the network. The works proposed will significantly upgrade the network's capability and effectiveness in line with innovation and technological advancements.


The total estimated cost of the infrastructure project is $50.7 million excluding GST. This includes management and design fees, construction costs, furniture, fittings and equipment, information and communications technology, contingencies, risk and escalation provisions. The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers, with up to approximately 200 personnel and an average construction workforce of up to approximately 15 personnel. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is planned to commence in early 2019 and be completed by late 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (11:17):  The 14th of December 2017 is a day that I will never forget. It was the final hearing of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses into Child Sexual Abuse. As I approached the building, I could see the unmistakable blue and yellow shirts of the Clannies standing out against the grey suits of downtown Sydney. The Clannies are, of course, the Care Leavers Australasia Network, a support group of survivors of child abuse. They were there with the irrepressible Leonie Sheedy—kind, determined and resilient. Leonie is one of the most remarkable people I've ever had the good fortune to meet.


There are so many people who've made an enormous contribution to the cause of justice for survivors of child sexual abuse, including Leonie and everyone at CLAN, and Caroline, Carol and everyone from the Alliance for Forgotten Australians. I'll never forget Caroline telling me her story to help me understand the horror of what had been done to her and so many others. The late Anthony Foster and his wife, Chrissie. Chrissie and Anthony Foster discovered in the 1990s that two of their daughters, Emma and Katie, were raped by their local priest. Emma began harming herself after the trauma she experienced. In her teens, Katie was hit by a car, leaving her permanently disabled. In 2008, Emma died of an overdose. And so began Chrissie and Anthony's tireless fight for justice, taking on the Catholic Church and eventually suing the church, personally giving counsel and support to hundreds of survivors. To this day, Chrissie continues to be a powerful advocate for survivors, particularly on the issue of redress.


I remember Chrissie saying to me on that day that we must implement the recommendations of the royal commissioners. These commissioners, she said to me, were the people who had listened to the experiences of the survivors of child sexual abuse. The commissioners had spent five years considering their recommendations and they must not be ignored. The hearing room that day was packed, and as the commissioners very formally filed in there was a loud cheer. So many people had been heard. So many people had finally been believed. The people in the room that day and all the others who have been so badly abused are now relying on us to establish a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, and we must not fail them. As the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, chair of the royal commission, stated in his final address that day last December:


…the primary responsibility for the sexual abuse of a child lies with the abuser and the institution of which they were part, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the problems faced by many people who have been abused are the responsibility of our entire society.


We, as lawmakers, must uphold our responsibilities to the survivors. We must not fail them as a society. We must not fail them again, and we must establish a national redress scheme, and this time we have to make sure we get it right. On the day that Prime Minister Gillard announced the establishment of the royal commission back in 2013, she said:


There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil. 


I believe in these circumstances that it's appropriate for there to be a national response through a Royal Commission.


And she was right. Over the five years of the commission, there have been 57 public hearings held over 444 days. The commission heard evidence from 1,300 witnesses. Commissioners held almost 8,000 private sessions to listen to the personal accounts of survivors. There have been more than 2½ thousand referrals to authorities, including the police. The royal commission estimates that around 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. It found that there were more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. Thousands of vulnerable children were subjected to truly horrific sexual abuse in institutions right across Australia. Think about it: 20,000 people in 4,000 institutions—so widespread, so devastating.


I want to thank the survivors who gave evidence to the commission. I want to say to the survivors directly: without your extraordinary courage in giving evidence, the realities and extent of child sexual abuse would not have been truly recognised—I'm looking at the member for Swan—nor would the failure of institutions to respond to that abuse be fully known. I want to say loud and clear that I believe you. We, all of us here, believe you. The parliament of Australia believes you. I say this so sharply but also so sadly because, for years, these survivors were not believed. Your personal stories greatly contributed to the royal commission's recommendations, and none of us, I think, can allow any of these recommendations to sit on a shelf and be ignored.


The national redress scheme was recommended in the royal commission's interim redress and civil litigation report released in June 2015. The royal commission's case studies and private sessions made clear that many people, while children, were subjected to terrible sexual abuse in institutions. As the royal commission said, many of the injuries were severe and long-lasting. Many people have been and continue to be affected by injuries for the rest of their lives. It is the case that many, many survivors have still not had the opportunity to seek compensation for their injuries. The royal commission acknowledged:


… it cannot now be made feasible for many of those who have experienced institutional child sexual abuse to seek common law damages, there is a clear need to provide avenues for survivors to obtain effective redress for this past abuse.


The establishment of a national redress scheme will acknowledge the abuse that occurred. Labor understands—and I think everybody understands—that no amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced. However, redress is a vital step along the path to healing—a vital step that we all have an obligation to put in place.


It's also important that, under this legislation, survivors will have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution or institutions responsible for the abuse. A direct personal response is a statement of acknowledgement, regret or apology and will be delivered to survivors by the relevant participating institution after the survivor has accepted the offer of redress. We did announce support for a national redress scheme back in October 2015 and, unfortunately, it has taken too long to get to this point. Nevertheless, we do welcome the recent significant progress that has seen the majority of states and territories sign up to the redress scheme and we strongly urge the remaining states and institutions that are yet to sign up to do as soon as possible. Access to redress must not depend on where you live.


The royal commission recommended that the Australian government announce a willingness to establish a single national redress scheme by the end of 2015 and that the scheme should be accepting applications by no later than 1 July last year, so it is very, very disappointing that this legislation is nearly a year late. But, that said, it is now time to get on with it.


The two bills that we're debating here today supersede the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Institutional Sexual Abuse 2017, otherwise known as the Commonwealth bill. The original 2017 bill would have created a redress scheme only for the few survivors whose abuse occurred in the territories and in Commonwealth institutions. Following the announcement that New South Wales and Victoria would join the scheme, the national bills that we're debating here today were drafted. On 17 May the New South Wales parliament passed redress legislation, and earlier this month legislation was also introduced into the Victorian parliament that will refer powers to the Commonwealth. On 30 April the Queensland government announced that they would opt in. The ACT and the Northern Territory have indicated their support, as has the Tasmanian government. That is very good news, and we certainly hope the remaining states will follow very quickly.


We have referred these bills to a short Senate inquiry to make sure that survivors of child sexual abuse get a redress scheme that they think—that they think, that the survivors think—is appropriate and fair. That inquiry will report by 15 June.


We of course want to see a national redress scheme established without further delay, so, as a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns, we will support this bill in the House today. I do, however, want to outline some of the continuing issues that Labor has with respect to the proposed redress scheme in the bill that we're debating. First, we do want to make sure that there are enough support services for all survivors of child sexual abuse and that they're accessible no matter where the survivor lives. Second, we want to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. The bill gives applicants at least six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommended a year. It's very important that survivors have sufficient time to consider this decision, as only one application to the scheme is permitted. For many people, this will be a very emotional and overwhelming process. We must do what we can to make sure that people have a reasonable amount of time to work through their claims.


The next concern we have is the compensation amount. The bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor. The royal commission recommended that the maximum payment be $200,000. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights that any survivor may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. That's why it's so important that the amount of redress available under the scheme is adequate.


We also want to make sure that anyone who is eligible for the scheme is able to get the redress that they deserve. We are very concerned that it could be possible, for a person whose abuse was not deemed the responsibility of government and for whom there is no remaining institution responsible, that they could be left with no avenue for redress. This outcome is unacceptable. We've sought urgent clarification from the minister and a guarantee that no-one will be left without any avenue to seek redress, either through the redress scheme or through civil litigation. This is an absolutely critical issue.


The indexation of past payments is a matter particularly close to the heart of many survivors who fought long and hard for compensation. The national bill sets the rate of this adjustment, specifying that an earlier amount received as compensation would be multiplied by 1.019 for each full year since the receipt of the original amount. The Care Leavers Australia Network has been campaigning for indexation to be dropped from the scheme. For many people, past compensation amounts were small. Legal fees often ate up a significant proportion of what people received. As a result, CLAN argue that it's unfair for the past redress amount to be indexed. I fear, as the survivors do, that some survivors who are eligible for redress will end up with nothing after indexation is applied because of previous compensation payments. Survivors have been waiting for many, many years for this redress scheme. We know that. In the event that someone gets no redress because of indexation, that would really be a devastating result. We know, of course, that redress is about more than money. It is a tangible recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors. We do not believe that past redress amounts should be indexed.


The bill also limits eligibility for the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia and who are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We're concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We also want to see the minister take the steps that are available under the proposed legislation to include former child migrants and immigration detainees who no longer live in Australia. This is an important issue of justice, and we're seeking a clear commitment from the government that these people will have access to the scheme.


I'm sure that all members agree that providing counselling to survivors is a top priority. We also know, each and every one of us, that no amount of money can make up for the pain and suffering endured. That said, access to good-quality counselling is vital. We are concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended—and this is very important—that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives. This bill only provides access to state provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. Frankly, these arrangements are woefully inadequate. We, therefore, call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Survivors often consider that government, particularly the state governments, are responsible for their abuse, so they do not necessarily want to use state- or institution-run services. So this needs to be taken into account when consideration is given to who delivers the services. Labor also holds concerns that survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could be disadvantaged if they're not able to access services for the same length of time as those survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. It's very important that this be taken into account in future reviews. For survivors who receive the $5,000 payment for counselling, this amount of money is highly unlikely to provide adequate access to support. It is critical that these issues are addressed urgently.


The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors from accessing the redress scheme who themselves have a criminal history. We also believe this is unfair. The bill requires that those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. This rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The first Senate inquiry into these issues was inundated with evidence from a variety of witnesses and submitters that this rule is cruel and likely to increase recidivism. So we do believe that this policy should be changed.


That said, for all of these concerns, I do want to acknowledge that establishing this national redress scheme is a very, very complex task. I acknowledge the Minister for Social Services, Dan Tehan, for his diligence in getting the outcome that is before us today. It is, as I said earlier, very encouraging that most of the jurisdictions have already agreed to sign on, and I understand the other two are working closely with the government.


It is, next, imperative that those institutions responsible for the abuse of children sign up and pay redress. No institution should back out of its responsibility for the abuse of children that took place where it had responsibility to care for those children. There is still time to get this right, so I call on the government to consider the issues that I've raised today. I do want to make it clear that, if we are successful at the next election, a Labor government would seek to work with the states towards addressing the areas of concern that I've identified here in these remarks.


I want to finish by, once again, thanking the courageous survivors who shared their own personal stories of abuse at the royal commission. It was their evidence that enabled the royal commissioners and the Australian people to understand in some way the extent of their suffering. It's also why we're here today, debating this very important piece of legislation. I want to thank the royal commissioners—what an extraordinary group of people—and all the staff who supported the survivors to tell their accounts of abuse over many years of hearings. I want to thank Julia Gillard for establishing the royal commission. It was a very big decision. Nicola Roxon, who was the Attorney-General at the time, and I worked with Prime Minister Gillard to get this started.


The evidence presented to the royal commission shocked and appalled all Australians. It exposed heinous crimes. Listen to the forgotten. Believe those who had been for so long ignored. We understand the royal commissioners did not make their recommendations lightly. We do believe that all of their recommendations should be implemented faithfully, and the task for us all now in this parliament is to deliver a national redress scheme for survivors. I commend the bill to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:39):  I rise today in support of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I acknowledge the contribution made by the member for Jagajaga. It has been a journey of many years for us, not only on the redress scheme but in dealing with victims of institutional sex abuse. The member for Jagajaga mentioned the work of the royal commission. She and I have heard many stories—she described them as heinous. We have heard tragic stories of things that should never occur in a civilised society. We have heard enormous stories about abuse in all manners and forms. The commission has listened to four or five years of that. I take my hat off to them and acknowledge their contribution to the legislation before the parliament today.


The member for Jagajaga was quite emotional during her speech—and I join with her in that. Jenny, I would like to come over and give you a hug—as we have done with many CLAN people over the years whom we have dealt with on this issue. I feel your lifelong passion in this parliament towards this achievement that is coming out today. When I leave this place, if I could talk about only one thing it would be the efforts we have made towards getting where we are today. I think both sides of the parliament need to be congratulated. There has been an effort from many of us to help these people.


It was 10 years ago that I delivered my maiden speech in this chamber, during which I said I wanted to draw attention to the national issue of institutional child sex abuse. As a former ward of the state, I saw it as my responsibility to champion the issues of care leavers and children who had suffered abuse in institutions across the country. For the last 10 years, I have continued to advocate for a redress scheme which would see institutions that inflicted this abuse held accountable for what they did to far too many of the nation's children.


The member for Jagajaga also mentioned in her speech that Peter McClellan had said it is a problem of our entire society. In my maiden speech, I mentioned a little girl named Shelley Ward. She wasn't in an institution but she starved to death in a home in New South Wales under the care of her own parents. We have heard the many stories about institutional child sex abuse over the last 10 years. They are often reflected in private homes around Australia as well, for which there is no form of redress at all under the system. After our achievement today, we need to look at child abuse in private homes and how the children continue to be returned to the abusers.


If there was one thing I could call for—and I know a lot of people don't agree—it would be the reintroduction of the death penalty for paedophiles and people who continually abuse children. I'm sure that won't get far, but it's a personal passion of mine.


Moving forward four years from my maiden speech, I, along with parliamentary colleagues, welcomed former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's announcement that a royal commission into institutional child sex abuse would be held—which I and a number of members on both sides of this chamber had called for. Again, the member for Jagajaga was influential in getting that over the line.


I note that the member for Maribyrnong is in the chamber. I congratulate him on his efforts. I congratulate the leaders of both sides of parliament who, during this time, have had people like me and Jenny continually knocking on their doors looking for their support for a national redress scheme. I acknowledge all the leaders. The Prime Minister has made promises about this. We all remember his speech where he uttered the words that the member for Jagajaga has just used: 'We believe you.' That was vitally important on the day of that apology.


Over the next five years, an extensive investigation into the wrongdoings of institutions was conducted. In March 2013 the Royal Commission Act was amended to allow for private sessions, the first being held in Sydney two months later. The first public hearing was held at the County Court of Victoria in April and, by June, the first issues paper was released allowing for individuals and organisations to contribute responses to the issues raised. The following April, in 2014, the first roundtable was held enabling representatives, regulators, policy experts, survivors and advocacy groups to discuss key policy issues. The interim report was released in June. Due to the scale of the evidence received, it was obvious the royal commission has only scratched the surface on this national issue. And so in September 2014, the royal commission was formally extended to December 2017—again, with the support of those opposite. The following three years saw the working-with-children checks report released, along with the redress and civil litigation report and the report on criminal justice. In March last year, the royal commission had its 57th and final public hearing. In December of 2017, the final report was presented to the Governor-General detailing the culmination of a five-year inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.


I would like to share some of the facts which the previous member mentioned on the royal commission with the House, which are available on the royal commission's website. I think they give insight into the scale of the royal commission. Over the five-year inquiry, there were 42,041 calls handled, 25,964 letters received, 8,013 private sessions held, and 2,575 referrals to authorities, including to the police. That's a staggering amount of referrals. It's an indictment on that period of time in our society. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where abuse took place. It estimates that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. In addition, more than 6,500 victims who gave private evidence said more than one person had abused them.


These aren't just statistics; these are experiences of real people, real Australians who were sexually abused by the people charged with their care and protection, charged to nurture them. No child should ever experience what they did. I've said in this chamber before that I can only imagine the horrific experiences people suffered. They missed out on the joys of being raised in a loving and nurturing family home. I remember early back in the time the member for Jagajaga talked about the courage of people giving evidence and relaying their stories.


I have an institution in my electorate which looks after young ladies who have been abused either sexually or physically, or who have drug issues. I arranged for some care leavers to come and tell them their stories. These young ladies were in their early 20s. They sat around and listened to the stories of the care leavers and what they had experienced. I spoke to the lady who brought them to the meeting afterwards in my office. She said they cried all the way home. These were young ladies who thought they were having issues of their own but once they heard the care leavers' stories, they had forgotten about their own problems and realised that generations have been going through abuse and troubles in our society for a long time. Again, I say 'hats off' to these people who have the courage to not only tell the member for Jagajaga and myself their stories but to then relay them to commissioners, who they have no knowledge of and no affection with or anything like that, and for their desire to tell their stories to make sure that people nationally across this great country get the redress that they deserve.


As the member for Jagajaga said, it will never fix or compensate for the problems they have had but it's the aftercare response, the necessary care and welfare—psychologically and physically—that we need to make sure we provide these people with to make sure the rest of their lives are peaceful and in a good state. No child is responsible for the circumstances in which they are born or for the reasons they were put into care. Be it financial hardship, or the breakdown of a family unit, all children should feel safe and loved. This is where we failed them as a nation.


I will put a personal touch on it. Once I realised my own story, I researched my sister, Jennifer, and found that she had been put into an institution at the same time I had been, along with my brother, Raymond. Jennifer died at the age of 12 while she was under the care of an institution. When I accessed her Victorian Human Services records and read through them, the evidence was in the paperwork that she was systematically put through foster care homes and sexually and physically abused during her time in foster care homes—not while she was in the institutions but while she was in the foster care homes. Again, that's another area we need.


I take my hat off to foster parents. I had foster parents. But there were times when that evidence was there and was ignored as well by people in the institutions.


Unfortunately, she passed away at the age of 12, and I recently found her unmarked grave. She's now got a headstone on it. It was part of her journey that she was never recognised. She was buried in a pauper's grave. I found out that my own biological mother wouldn't pay for that, so there was never a headstone on her grave. 


There are many stories like that across Australia, but that is just to give you some idea. There is a lot of emotion for these people. It affects all of us. Today, bringing this legislation before the parliament will help them. It won't give them compensation. It will never fix the problems that they suffer from, but it will support them, hopefully for the rest of their lives.


The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect the survivor, as I just said, for the rest of their life. We have learned from the evidence taken that many of the survivors have had issues in their relationships with their own children and often in their dealings with authorities, issues stemming from the abuse they were subjected to as children. We heard the member for Jagajaga mention Leonie. When Leonie contacted me to assist her with the Care Leavers Australia Network on institutional child sexual abuse, she knew that I'd spent time in an institution. She asked me about my reactions and how I dealt with certain issues that I faced in life as I travelled through my life. She said, 'This is the standard response for people who have spent time in institutions.'


Leonie, hats off to you and the work that you and Joanna have done. Leonie always rings me up and says, 'Never give in,' and she hasn't given in in the whole battle that she's been through this whole time. She's actually taking over my office in a couple of weeks to have a CLAN meeting in Perth. We said: 'We need to find a location for you. Don't send out the invite until we've found it for you.' But she sent the invite out anyway, so she's taking over my office in couple of weeks. But that's part of the journey that the member for Jagajaga and, I know, the member for Blaxland have been through. Leonie's organisation is in your electorate, and you've been along for that journey as well, so hats off to you as well.


I'll be forever grateful to the survivors who bravely gave evidence to the commission for reliving their emotional, physical and sexual abuse and trauma while telling their personal stories. Without their courage and sharing their experiences, and without their bravery in having to detail and explain their ordeals, a scheme like this would never have been established.


On 4 November 2016, the coalition government announced the Commonwealth redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse and on that day invited states, territories and non-government institutions to join the Commonwealth scheme to deliver redress to the survivors of these wrongs. Along with the member for Jagajaga, I hope that the final two states and the people and all the institutions get on board and come and join this redress scheme. I must say that it was a privilege for me to have been there on the day when the now Attorney-General, the former Minister for Social Services, made the announcement in my home town of Perth. I know this was a welcome announcement for my colleagues on both sides of the chamber.


Member for Jagajaga, I've put you in here. I've mentioned you a few times. It has been a privilege to work with you on this as well.


It's been a long journey to get here. It must feel like an eternity for the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Through this journey I've had the privilege of meeting many of them. Many of them are incredible characters. Another thing that Leonie often says when she rings me up is, 'The jacks are on their way.' As a Victorian, I know who 'the jacks' are. They don't know who they are in Western Australia, but I know who they are in Victoria. The banter is still there. There have been many tears but many laughs along the way as well.


In the short time I have left, I'd like to thank everyone who's contributed, helped and assisted in getting to this point. Jenny, I heard your comments at the end of your speech. If there's any way I can assist in achieving the things which would give a better outcome for the survivors, I'll work with you on trying to achieve them. I commend this bill to the House. Thank you.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (11:54):  I thank the member for Swan for his words that we just listened to. I think a lot of Australians get rightly frustrated with parliament. They feel that we're not dealing with the issues which go to their daily lives. But sometimes you can hear speeches and contributions from across the political spectrum which I do think measure up to the hopes and ambitions which Australians rightly have of their parliament. This debate, I think, does pass the test of dealing with and improving the lives of Australians.


In saying that, I want to begin by acknowledging the magnificent Leonie Sheedy and her mighty CLAN army; Caroline, Carol and other members of the Alliance for Forgotten Australians; and Chrissie Foster and the late Anthony Foster. I want to acknowledge every survivor and loved one and carer that my colleagues and I have had the privilege to meet along the way—all those brave people who fought a very long battle to be heard. I say to you that the parliament of Australia is debating this legislation today because of your courage, because of your determination and because, somehow, you and other survivors and the people who love you found a strength which is quite frankly unimaginable in many circumstances, to refuse to be silenced, intimidated, ignored or, indeed, patronised. I want to thank the royal commissioners for the quite gruelling and thorough yet caring way they went about their work, and I want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the royal commission. I think it is appropriate to salute the leadership of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who had the conviction to establish the royal commission and put redress for child abuse on the national political agenda, and of course the member for Jagajaga, who has championed this cause for so long.


Within days of Prime Minister Gillard's announcement in 2013, Gerry Ann sent an email to the commission requesting a private session to tell her story. Over the next three years, she cancelled on numerous occasions. Sometimes she didn't feel psychological ready; sometimes she was just frustrated or disengaged. But one day, after reading reports of a particular priest's testimony, she ended up trying to take her own life, and ended in intensive care. This was a turning point for her. In 2015, with help from her daughter Rachel and from commission case workers, Gerry Ann came forward to tell her story. She said:


My time at [the orphanage] robbed me of my innocence, and set the benchmark of who I would become: frightened, petrified, scared, fearful, not worthy, introverted, isolated, segregated, sad and constantly suicidal. … My personality was destroyed by the very people that were supposed to protect me.


Gerry Ann's story is about the calculated, cold-hearted abuse of a scared but very precious little girl. It is unique to her.


Only she will ever know how dark the days were, just how deep the memories run, but it is the same trauma, the same betrayal and the same violation of sacred trust that fills the pages of the royal commission's final report. Thousands of our fellow Australians had their childhoods stolen and their faith in people shattered. Nine hundred orphanages across the time. Literally hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australians. The scars still cover our nation: crimes that were ignored; people whose stories were ignored; perpetrators who were sheltered, quietly tut-tutted and moved on; institutions who protected their reputation rather than the children who were supposed to be in their care; and, of course, the graves of those who did not live to see justice done.


We understand that no set of words can make this right. No amount of compensation can restore a childhood. No dollar sum can put back together souls that have been broken. But we can in this place show perhaps a fraction—a portion—of the courage and resolve that survivors already have. What we can do is match words of sorrow with deeds of redress. What we must do is vow that this cannot happen again. We must ensure that every single survivor gets every dollar they deserve and every second of support they need. We must deliver on the recommendations of the royal commission and live up to its spirit.


A national redress scheme has been Labor policy since 2015. However, we are not the current government. Today we're required to vote and judge upon the basis of the government's proposal. It's a little-known fact that sometimes the hardest decisions for an opposition are not to decide what to oppose but what to agree to. Today we have to ask ourselves: is this legislation good enough? Is it the best deal that we can strike in the circumstances? It's not the legislation that a federal Labor government would have drafted, but that doesn't mean that I think that the federal government hasn't done its very best. It is hard work wrangling states and navigating the legal arguments and strengths of institutions with deep pockets. To the states and institutions yet to sign up, I would repeat what I have said on many occasions: the time for lawyers is over; the time for justice is here.


In our view, the legislation is an overdue step in the right direction, but it cannot be the end of the road. Labor will be voting for this bill before the House because we believe the start date of 1 July this year is vital and because, as an opposition, and on an issue like this, we should not seek to make the perfect the enemy of the acceptable. But, as the member for Jagajaga powerfully indicated, we do have concerns about aspects, important aspects, of the legislation and we are prepared to work in good faith with the government of the day to address these issues prior to the scheme commencing on 1 July. If we cannot solve these problems from opposition, we will sit down with the states and institutions to work on fixing them in government.


In large part, our concerns arise from when the government's legislation departs from the recommendations of the royal commission. For example, the royal commission recommended a maximum payment of $200,000. This legislation seeks to cap that at $150,000. It is near enough to vote for, but not enough to give up on. This isn't the time for haggling; it's not an opportunity to perhaps save $50,000. I think that Australians are more generous and more decent than this. I wonder, if we had a plebiscite on this question, whether or not Australians would vote for $150,000 or $200,000. The royal commission recommended survivors be given one year to decide whether to accept an offer of redress. Legislation gives them only six months. It is near enough, but perhaps not good enough. We're talking about a complex legal and emotional decision, because, by accepting the offer, you sign away your rights to litigation down the track. I think that, in this set of circumstances, every day does matter. After so many years of making Australians wait for justice, I do not feel comfortable in telling them that they must rush to a decision.


Of course, it's not just about the money. Support services are vital. The royal commission recommended survivors have access to counselling for the rest of their life. The legislation provides only for counselling services for the life of the scheme or to the value of $5,000. With regard to this particular proposal, I will not stand up in front of survivors and say that I think it is near enough. I will not say that this is all there should be. I think this is something we can work on fixing. I think we have a collective responsibility to make sure the right support services are available to every survivor, wherever they live and whatever language they speak. I do not regard the right to counselling as a charity to be rationed but a right that has been earned in the most unfortunate and undesirable of circumstances.


As it stands, this legislation limits redress to people living in Australia and to Australian citizens. Our nation has apologised to child migrants for the abuse they suffered in Australian institutions, but if, after what they've been through in this country, they've returned to their country of birth, I do not think that should put them beyond the umbrella of Australian justice. This legislation also seeks to place a restriction on access to the scheme for survivors who've served a prison sentence of five years or more. They would need special permission from the scheme operator to access redress. It is perhaps better than what was initially proposed, but I will not tell survivors that I think it is fair, because I do not believe that. I think it misunderstands or ignores the tragic reality that childhood abuse puts people on a path to incarceration later in life. What puts people into incarceration is a chain of events—it can be a range of circumstances—but, because of other mistakes, I do not see how we absolve ourselves of our contribution to that chain of events. The Senate inquiry heard a great deal of important evidence saying a provision like this not only was cruel but increases risk of reoffending. I think we need to revisit this restriction.


There is one final concern of ours, which is the indexation of past payments. It has been raised with me many times. Let me explain this briefly. As it stands, a small sum of compensation that someone received in the seventies, for example, will be subject to 40 years of indexation when their final redress amount is calculated. This could potentially create a set of circumstances where a survivor of abuse is left entitled to nothing on 1 July this year because of a token sum provided to fob off a claim not believed half a lifetime ago. I think, as a nation, we can do better, but I acknowledge that this legislation is an advance on where we are. I look at the end of Gerry Ann's testimony in 2016, she said:


I'm shutting Pandora's box this year … I've handed it to you now. It's not my problem anymore … I'm not carrying this anymore … It's not my guilt, my shame …


I say to Gerry Ann: you have no reason for guilt; no cause for shame. The system failed you; people betrayed you; the nation ignored you. But no more. No longer. Today we say that Australia believes you. The Parliament of Australia will do right by you.


Today is a most important start. It is a step forward after decades of inaction and denial. But today cannot, should not and must not be the end of the matter. On this question, near enough will never be the same as good enough. All of us in this place on all sides are measured by what we do next. I do not say that anyone can guarantee you that all of what is fair is what will be delivered. I do not say that it is automatic that all of the issues that we've raised here today will be fixed. There are hard conversations to be had with states and institutions, but let us all strive to deliver proper access to counselling, because injury is not time limited. Eliminate indexation of payments so survivors are not discounted and ripped off because of past decisions. Extend justice to forgotten Australians and to those whose childhood trauma saw them spend part of their adult life behind bars. And ensure that the levels of redress reflect the decency and generosity of Australian people.


When you stop to look at the photos, as I did, in the CLAN office, and you see how common the system of orphanages was for so long, and you see the photos and the faces of the boys and the girls in their second-hand uniforms, scrubbed up, you wonder what is really going on when those photos are not taken. When you look at how our fellow Australians who've survived can summon the courage to stare down dark corners of memories, and relive hard moments, I think that we can do better than near enough. We can do good enough.


In closing, for me, the reason why I support this legislation but will not tell people who survived that this is the end of the matter is that I wonder what would happen if my wife, Chloe, and I were no longer able to look after one of our kids. I wonder what would happen if one of our children went through a system and then came out the other end and were told, 'The legislation now deals with your matters.' I wouldn't want my children to be treated in this manner and I don't expect any other children to be treated in that manner either. I thank the House.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (12:08):  I begin this story of support for the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 by talking about the first person who came into my office—not about the tragedy of his life but of his journey of hope. Dr J Michael Davey told me his powerful and inspiring story. Fostered as a baby, Michael was placed with an abusive family and in four separate state-run institutions where he experienced physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of his carers. Kidnapped by his father, Michael eventually returned home, only to discover that his mother was a violent and crazed schizophrenic who both hated him and blamed him for her illness. Devoid of love and care, Michael was mercilessly beaten by his mother. In the face of overwhelming odds, Michael overcame his past, finding success out of significant adversity. Michael's website reflects those words. He is a humble and beautiful soul, reaching out to others at all times with his extraordinary determination, courage and eternal optimism.


Children placed in the trust of our institutions were some of the most vulnerable members of our community. That they were sexually abused by the very people charged with their care and protection is a disgrace. No child should ever experience what they did. That is why it is time for all institutions and governments to take responsibility for what happened.


In the redress scheme we are looking for justice for victims. A process for this must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors, regardless of their location, the organisation or the continued existence of assets of the institution in which they were abused. None of those are discriminatory. The scheme needs to recognise the suffering that survivors have experienced and accept that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for the abuse. It's really important to note that this government is leading by example and establishing the redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, and, in addition, inviting state and territory governments and institutions to opt in to the scheme on the responsible-entity-pays basis recommended by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Hopefully it is a fair and just plan moving towards positive outcomes.


The royal commission estimated that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. The royal commission has clearly demonstrated that thousands of vulnerable children were subject to horrendous sexual abuse in institutions throughout our country. The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm. At all times we should acknowledge the courage of these survivors who presented evidence to the royal commission, and we must remind ourselves that their past and continuing advocacy for redress is vital to the successful implementation of the redress scheme. In addition, we recognise that survivors of institutional child sexual abuse need and deserve equal access and treatment. They really do.


Some people may ask what the Commonwealth government's scheme is. To put it simply, it will provide support services to people who were sexually abused as children in Commonwealth institutional settings. It will offer a direct personal response for those survivors who seek it, psychological counselling and a monetary payment to acknowledge the wrongdoing inflicted upon survivors. Passage of these bills will enable the Commonwealth government to respond to the royal commission's redress recommendations by developing a best-practice redress scheme for survivors. That sounds somewhat clinical, but in some ways is probably the best way forward. The scheme will start on 1 July this year and run for 10 years. I know there are some who may say it has taken too long, and there are others who will criticise the scheme and the processes, but we really must have a nationally consistent approach to redress so that survivors across Australia get equal access and treatment. But the states and institutions need to be on board to achieve this. We're continuing those discussions with the states in the hope that this can deliver the best outcomes for survivors.


The scheme will recognise and alleviate the impact of past child sexual abuse—it is hoped—that has occurred in those institutional contexts by providing three components: firstly, a monetary payment of up to $150,000 with an expected average payment of around $76,000 as a tangible means of recognising the wrong survivors have suffered; secondly, access to counselling and psychological services either through a lump sum payment or a state and territory based service, depending on where the survivor lives at the time of the application; and thirdly, a direct personal response to those survivors from the organisation where they had such harm inflicted on them from those participating institutions—that's if they request one.


A person will be eligible for redress under the scheme if they were sexually abused as a child before the scheme start date, if the abuse occurred inside a participating state or territory or outside Australia, if one or more participating institutions are responsible for the abuse and if the person is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident. New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory governments have announced their participation. It is hoped they will act as role models to the other states, so they also refer their powers to the Commonwealth. The Australian Capital Territory is not expected to refer because they can just be covered by the scheme.


Money will never compensate for the abuse that victims received. It's important also to know that the psychological and ongoing support they need is probably just as important as the payment, if not more so. In designing the blueprint for the Commonwealth redress scheme, we have exercised every available method and have endeavoured to give practical and operational effect to the recommendations of the royal commission. The Commonwealth redress scheme will not just be about facilitating individual monetary redress payments but it will be equally important that these payments across the scheme also provide emotional, mental and other support mechanisms to people who are survivors.


So as well as these monetary payments which are designed to provide some tangible recognition of their hurt and the harm that they have suffered, the Commonwealth scheme is also going to provide access to trauma informed and culturally-adapted counselling over the life of the scheme. The scheme will provide redress for a significant number of survivors—1,000 survivors in Commonwealth government institutions, 9,000 survivors in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 in Victorian government institutions and 200 in the ACT. That's an enormous number of children whose lives have been permanently changed, not always for the better. But some have come through that experience, grown and become amazing people.


Further survivors will be able to seek redress under the scheme as additional states and territories and non-government institutions opt in. The government is continuing negotiations with the remaining jurisdictions and non-government institutions to encourage their participation in the scheme. If all states and institutions across Australia opt in, the scheme could provide redress to around 60,000 people, which is the estimate provided by the Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse. It's an extraordinarily high number.


The Commonwealth continues to consult with states and non-government institutions on the development of the national bill in anticipation of state-referring powers under chapter 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution to allow survivors in state government institutions to be covered by the scheme from its commencement in July. The government will exercise every endeavour to make the reach of our scheme as broad as possible, with the ultimate point being to try and make the system that will operate across Australia as consistent as possible for each victim, each survivor, no matter where they were located.


Sadly, the abuse of children is not new and, even more tragically, child abuse hasn't disappeared overnight. My grandmother was born in 1899. She was fostered to a number of different homes. The only knowledge I have of this came from just two sources. She had a really nasty scar on her forehead and, as a curious child, I said, 'Grandma, what is that line on your forehead?' In her very deep and saddened response, she said one of her foster fathers had been very drunk one night and he threw a knife at her. The other source of her multiple family existence arrived after her death, by way of a bundle of photos handed over via my estranged uncle. Old, sepia, torn and tattered, but every family in the photograph was different. Some were clearly wealthy, some perhaps not so much. It's an intriguing past, I'm sure, but one I can't trace. The orphanage where my Gran was originally left, I'm told, was burnt down. I'm betting she wasn't the only child with a story to tell. Sexual abuse occurs today not just in institutions but in other social settings.


So I begin the end of this story by expressing my gratitude that institutional sexual abuse is being addressed by a redress scheme that will, in part, begin the healing process but also with sadness that the respect and care we should be demonstrating for all our children in any place, in any group and in any setting, seems to be fading from reality with political correctness and the retribution fear factor. We have a court system that is at best ineffective and at worst facilitating more abuse on more children. It has a lack of fortitude in punishing wrongdoers. Police fear to follow up, charge the offenders and pursue the right action because they believe the court system may not record a charge or it may not be successful.


I fear we're opening a Pandora's box of bad behaviour that is totally unacceptable. Surely it's not too much trouble to set the dignity and safety of a child above the inconvenience of bringing the issue to the attention of the court. I know of exactly such an incident. I am greatly concerned of the consequences that could evolve from the lack of action, or action that is not protective, or action that pushes the decision-making responsibility back onto the child. How can this be? Rape of a 12-year-old child is rape; whether inflicted by a physical instrument or biologically inflicted, it's wrong. Inside, I weep that, in this day and age, we still don't fully understand the term 'child sexual abuse'.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (12:22):  This week the Newcastle Magistrates Court convicted the Archbishop of Adelaide of concealing evidence of child sex abuse. Philip Wilson was the Bishop of Wollongong between 1997 and 2000. To my knowledge, he is the most senior Australian cleric to be convicted of such an offence. He should not be the last. Those who have covered up abuse and put the interests of their church and the reputation of their clerics above the suffering of abused children don't deserve the protection of either the congregation or the law.


Over five years the royal commission into child sex abuse established by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has heard evidence from more than 1,300 witnesses and held over 8,000 private sessions to listen to the person accounts of survivors. It has handled 42,000 calls and received 25,000 letters and emails. After 57 public hearings lasting 444 days, the commission has made over 2½ thousand referrals to law enforcement agencies. The inquiry that many said was unnecessary has shone a bright light into some of the darkest recesses of once inscrutable public institutions.


The establishment of the royal commission, and this national response, is a matter of deep personal interest and of great concern to the community that I represent. Wollongong is a wonderful city but it has also harboured more than its fair share of abusers. My years at Edmund Rice College in Wollongong during the late 1970s and early 1980s were mostly happy. There was a darker side, however. For many years the school had been a dumping ground for sex offenders.


We now know that there were many instances where brothers were moved from other schools in Sydney after complaints and allegations of sexual abuse had been made against them. One example was Brother Chris Roberts. He attended St Patrick's College in Sutherland between 1975 and 1977. He sexually abused children. Complaints were made. Instead of reporting him to the police he was moved to Saint Edmund's College in Canberra, where he taught boys between the seventies and eighties. He abused more children and there were more complaints. He was not reported to the police. Instead he was moved to my school in Wollongong.


In 2007 he was charged with 21 sexual offences over many, many years. He has admitted guilt to 11 of the 21 charges. He was but one of many of a community of sex offenders which included my principal, my form master, my parish priest and too many of the brothers who taught at my school. Many, many more were complicit in a culture of silence and cover-up. The impact it had on boys at my school cannot be underestimated, nor can the impact of denial and cover-ups that accompanied the original crimes and allowed them to be repeated in place after place and with victim after victim.


Upon the release of the royal commission's interim report in 2005, Labor, before the government, announced our support for the national redress schemes. These recommendations should be faithfully implemented. The scheme provides for three elements of redress: monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Applicants won't be limited to one form of redress. They'll be provided with access to support services and legal services if they accept an offer. They will also receive financial advice. Importantly, they will be required to sign a deed of release, waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution.


We compound the injustice visited upon the survivors if we think that this bill is the complete answer to decades of abuse. It is a good start, but the scheme does not go far enough. The bill establishes a scheme, but it only becomes operative if the states and territories, churches and other institutions agree to be bound and participate. It's encouraging that Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced they will participate. Today we call upon the other states, churches and institutes to follow.


The scheme has to be improved. We need more support services, and the cap on compensation is insufficient. The royal commission recommended a maximum of $200,000, a figure that many advocates thought was itself insufficient. This bill provides for only $150,000, which seems to me mean-spirited. The scheme is limited to Australian citizens without good reason. We of all people should know that matters of citizenship are not straightforward as we thought they once were. There are many child migrants who attended schools or who were forcibly institutionalised and suffered abuse, and they should not be excluded. The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. I simply point to the evidence that shows that many of the abused have found themselves up in a life of incarceration, and Labor believes this policy should be changed in that regard.


Because it's the faith in which I was raised, because it was where the majority of abuse came from and because I've known and spoken to so many survivors, I'd like to make some particular comments about the Catholic Church. At the request of the commission, the Catholic Church provided data on complaints, and the data is extraordinary. Between 1980 and 2015 alone, over 4,400 people alleged incidents relating to more than 1,000 separate institutions. Of the complainants, 78 per cent were male. Of the alleged perpetrators, 90 per cent were male. Sixty-two per cent of the perpetrators were priests or brothers. Seven per cent of all priests were perpetrators. Twenty per cent of all Marist Brothers and 22 per cent of all Christian Brothers were perpetrators. Can you imagine another institution in this country where close to one-quarter of its members were perpetrators? If that was any other institution in this country, there'd be calls to close it down. 11.7 per cent of priests from the diocese of Wollongong, 13.9 per cent of priests from the diocese of Lismore, 14 per cent of priests from the diocese of Port Pirie and 15 per cent of priests from the diocese of Sale were perpetrators. Five male religious orders—the Christian Brothers, the De La Salle Brothers, the Marist Brothers, the Patrician Brothers and the St John of God Brothers—represent more than 40 per cent of all claims made to Catholic Church authorities.


The first thing that strikes you about this data is the sheer immensity of the crimes. These are statistics, but behind the number stands an adult with vivid memories of their younger self—the moment when their faith, their trust and their body were abused by a person they were taught to revere. The second thing that is overwhelming about this is the sheer number of cases. These were instances where complaints were made and were documented by the church, but in the overwhelming number of cases no report was made to the police. The third thing that becomes obvious is that over 62 per cent of all perpetrators came from an order which imposed a vow of celibacy.


A scheme of redress must by necessity look backwards. That's what redress is all about. But this parliament must also look forward. We must say in clear and unadulterated words to the Catholic Church and other institutions: 'You must reform yourself. If you're imposing obligations upon your clerics that add to the risk of offence and impose a culture of secrecy, this must simply stop.' The rite of confession and the seal of the confessional is at the centre of this culture. It's where the faithful seek divine absolution from their sins through a genuine act of contrition. A confession is made, sins are counted and penance is applied. The practice is bound in confidentiality, known as the seal of the confessional. The priest must not disclose the details of the confession he has heard, even if they concern a serious crime like child sexual abuse. There can be no place in modern Australia where such an obligation is imposed. It is symbolic of the culture of secrecy and cover-up that has perpetuated generations of abuse. There are now many professions from healthcare workers, police officers and educators who have a mandatory obligation to report certain crimes, or even suspicions of certain crimes, because this is in the public interest and in the best interests of the child. Priests should be no different. If the church is to recover from the immense reputational damage it has suffered from the exposure of acts of hypocrisy and complicity in crimes against children then it must dispose of this anachronism.


That priests and brothers be celibate was not always the case in the church. In fact, it wasn't until the 12th century that it was seriously mandated, and it has not necessarily been honoured. It's time to rethink this practice as well. If 62 per cent of all perpetrators came from an order which imposed a vow of celibacy, it is right for us to ask in this place whether the practice is a part of the problem. In the hearings of the royal commission, the commissioners considered what role the vow of celibacy played in the occurrence of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. While there was some division of opinion among Australian bishops, evidence given showed them generally reluctant to concede that celibacy had a significant role to play in the sexual abuse of children. One bishop described it as simplistic. Most other authorities disagree. For example, when non-Catholic religious institutions accused of sexual abuse of children in their care were examined, it was rare that the abusers came from within their ministries. There is academic evidence which adds to the weight of this opinion. A report by two Melbourne academics, Desmond Cahill and Peter Wilkinson, published by RMIT last year, tackles what they call 'the scandal and tragedy of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church'. They emphasise the urgency of reform. They point out that the risk to children greatly increased 'if the child was in the pastoral care of a psychosexually immature, poorly prepared priest, unable to deal adequately with his sexual desires, his exercise of power and his obligations to chastity and celibacy'.


My church and many others have been robust contributors to social policy debates that we've had in this place, and I welcome that, even on the matters on which we deeply disagree. But this cannot be a one-way dialogue. This parliament is one forum where the public opinion can be raised, and the decision-makers within the church would do well to reflect on this if they are to regain an element of the respect and the prestige that they once enjoyed. I commend the bill to the House.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (12:35):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons. I had no idea that you would be in the chair when I came to rise.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  Neither did I!




Mr FALINSKI:
  But I want to say that, in my short time in this place, I've got to know you as the chair of the corporations committee and have discovered that you are a person of great talent, energy and capacity. Indeed, as the chair of a committee that includes the member for Burt and myself, you are a person with more patience than any human being should have to have! When people from time to time reflect on this place and say that we are somehow too narrow and that we have too many staffers, too many people who were union officials and, of course the worst sin of all, too many people who were lawyers, they should look at your speech on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, to see that this parliament does have a long and broad list of people with large experiences who bring many of those experiences to the business of this House.


The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard from thousands of survivors across Australia. Their stories opened our eyes to the prevalence of institutional child sexual abuse, the failures of institutions to respond and the lifelong impact it brings to bear. The findings and recommendations of the royal commission are powerful and far-reaching. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, their families and the organisations that represent them. Whether as children or adults, the reality is that for many years survivors were not listened to, were not believed or were not acknowledged. I thank them for their resilience and their determination to ensure that we all learn from the mistakes of the past and acknowledge the harm and suffering experienced by the many thousands of children who had been sexually abused in institutions where they should have been safe. No child should ever experience what some of these children endured. They were abused by the very people charged with their care and protection, and let us be clear: that is a disgrace. The establishment of the national redress scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was and is wrong.


I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the New South Wales government and its most excellent Attorney-General, Mark Speakman, for being the first state to opt in and already legislate for the scheme, along with a raft of new offences. The national redress scheme recognises the suffering survivors have experienced, accepts that these events occurred and states that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse. The government acknowledged the need to provide public recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors and investigate the inadequate responses provided by institutions through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The royal commission estimated that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm.


The establishment of the national redress scheme is the most significant step in addressing the wrongs of the past and providing an overdue response to survivors. It is also an important step towards healing. It ensures that governments and institutions take steps to safeguard against these crimes being repeated in the future. This bill package will establish the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. From 1 July 2018 the scheme will provide redress where a Commonwealth institution or a New South Wales, Victorian or Australian Capital Territory government institution is responsible for the child sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse which occurred before the date of the scheme's commencement. This bill will also allow other state and territory governments and non-government institutions, such as churches or sporting clubs, to voluntarily participate in the scheme on a responsible-entity-pays basis. The remaining state governments will need to adopt the Commonwealth law for the scheme to apply in those jurisdictions and for non-government institutions to provide redress where abuse has occurred in a state.


Passage of these bills will enable the Commonwealth government to respond to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse redress recommendations by developing a best-practice redress scheme for survivors. The scheme will start on 1 July 2018 and run for 10 years. The scheme will recognise and alleviate the impact of past child sexual abuse that has occurred in an institutional context, by providing three components of redress: a monetary payment of up to $150,000, with an expected average payment of around $76,000, as a tangible means of recognising the wrong that survivors have suffered; access to counselling and psychological services through either a lump sum payment or state or territory based services, depending on where the survivor lives at the time of their application; and a direct personal response to survivors from the responsible participating institutions, should the survivor request one. A person will be eligible for redress under the scheme if the person was sexual abused as a child before the scheme start date; the abuse occurred inside a participating state, inside a territory or outside Australia; one or more participating institutions are responsible for the abuse; and the person is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident.


As I mentioned earlier, the New South Wales government along with the Victorian and Australian Capital Territory governments have announced their participation in the scheme. New South Wales and Victoria will refer their powers so that they can participate and the abuse occurring in their jurisdiction—that is, by non-government institutions—can be covered by the scheme. The Australian Capital Territory is not required to refer powers in order to participate or to allow abuse in its jurisdiction to be covered by the scheme.


The scheme will provide redress for a significant number of survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. There are an estimated 1,000 survivors of abuse in Commonwealth government institutions, 9,000 survivors of abuse in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 survivors of abuse in Victorian government institutions and 200 survivors of abuse in Australian Capital Territory institutions. Further survivors will be able to seek redress under the scheme as additional states and territories and non-government institutions opt in. The government is continuing negotiations with the remaining jurisdictions and non-government institutions to encourage their participation in the scheme. Redress payments will be exempt from Commonwealth debt recovery and income tests related to government payments and will be non-taxable and reflective of the severity and impact of the abuse experienced. Redress support services will be available with the scheme to provide timely access to trauma informed and culturally appropriate support for people during the application process. The scheme will also provide access to free specialist legal support services and financial counselling.


The royal commission released its Redress and civil litigation report in November 2015. In that report it recommended a single national redress scheme. The government is demonstrating leadership by responding to the royal commission's redress recommendations and establishing a best-practice redress scheme. A national redress scheme with an option for states and territories to participate on the responsible-entity-pays basis recommended by the royal commission is the best way of seeking to ensure that survivors across Australia will be able to gain redress on an equal basis. While New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have committed to the scheme from commencement, the government is continuing to negotiate with the remaining states and institutions to ensure maximum coverage.


In line with the royal commission's recommendations, an independent advisory council was formed in December 2016 to provide significant input on the design and operation of the scheme. The council brought together people with expertise from a range of backgrounds, including survivors and their supporters, as well as experts on legal, psychological and redress issues. The council provided advice to ensure the scheme meets the needs of survivors. A single national redress scheme can only be established with full cooperative legislative action of the Commonwealth and states. The surest way is by referral of powers under the Constitution. States must refer powers to allow non-government institutions within their jurisdictions to opt in to a national scheme. On 10 May 2018, the Australian government introduced legislation to create the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. The scheme will begin this year, on 1 July, subject to passage of legislation and will provide access to the psychological counselling so needed, a direct personal response from the responsible institution for people who want it and a monetary payment. If all institutions and state governments across Australia opt in, the scheme could provide redress to around 60,000 people estimated by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to have been abused in institutions. The Commonwealth continues to consult with states and non-government institutions on the development of a national bill in anticipation of a state referring powers as allowed under the Constitution. All survivors and state government institutions will be covered by the scheme from its commencement in July 2018. The governments of Western Australia and South Australia are the only two states yet to formally announce that they will join the redress scheme. If a state or territory does not opt in to the scheme, the Australian government will seek sufficient referral of powers to enable non-government institutions to opt in to the scheme.


To receive redress, the person must accept the offer and, in doing so, release all responsible participating institutions from any liability for sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse covered by the scheme. The redress scheme was designed in close consultation with state and territory governments, an independent advisory council and non-government institutions. Abuse that occurred outside Australia is within the scope of the scheme, so long as the participating institution is responsible for the abuse and the person meets other citizenship requirements at the time of application. The decision to exclude those found guilty of serious crimes was reached in consultation with state and territory governments.


Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, I think it only right to recognise your role in bringing this legislation to the House and to congratulate you for it. I commend this bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. If the member for Isaacs will just indulge me, as I'm just about the leave the chair, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the current Attorney-General in his time as the Minister for Social Services and the enormous amount of work he did in consultation with me during this process—also to the current member for finalising the work that the previous social services minister did. Thank you, Member for Isaacs.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (12:49):  In speaking about justice, Martin Luther King once said, with characteristic eloquence:


Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Every step towards the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering and struggle, the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse provides a potent example of the tireless exertions and passionate concern in the pursuit of justice that Mr King described. That royal commission was announced by Prime Minister Julia Gillard in November 2012 and was established in January 2013. I'm proud of many of the things the Gillard government achieved, but I feel that the royal commission will be shown to be one of the government's more important initiatives—an initiative that, in addressing the most appalling of injustices, will have a lasting benefit for the Australian community. The royal commission we announced was led by six royal commissioners—the Honourable Justice Peter McClellan AM; Mr Bob Atkinson AO, APM; Justice Jennifer Coate; Mr Robert Fitzgerald AM; Professor Helen Milroy; and Mr Andrew Murray. Mr King's reference to the 'tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals' could have been written for those six commissioners whose work over the five years of the royal commission was truly herculean. Through their efforts, some of which will be brought into effect by these bills now before the House, a measure of justice will be delivered to tens of thousands of people who have suffered the most grievous injustice.


During the five-year course of the royal commission, it handled over 42,000 calls, almost 26,000 letters and emails, and held just over 8,000 private sessions with survivors of child sexual abuse. The final report of the commission comprising 17 volumes was delivered to the Governor-General on 15 December last year. The Turnbull government has said that it will respond to that report next month.


Labor, the survivors and their families, along with the wider Australian community, look forward to seeing that response, because how we as a nation respond to the recommendations of the royal commission is of critical importance. Because while the royal commission has concluded its investigations, finished its hearings and delivered its final report, the work of delivering justice to the survivors of child sexual abuse is very far from completed. And so too the work of ensuring that our children are protected from the horror of sexual abuse in institutions, such as churches and schools, is in no way completed by the delivery of the commission's final report; rather, the protection of children from sexual abuse in the future will depend on the extent to which the Commonwealth, state and territory governments are willing to invest the effort and resources required to fulfil the 409 recommendations the royal commission has made.


Sadly, we have seen the recommendations of other royal commissions developed through years of tireless work and the most extensive consultations languish without proper implementation. It is my very sincere hope that such a lack of commitment does not compromise the tremendous work done by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and that its recommendations are fully implemented, which brings me to the subject matter of these two bills, the national redress scheme.


Paragraph (d) of the letters patent establishing the royal commission called on the commission to answer the following question:


(d) what institutions and governments should do to address, or alleviate the impact of, past and future child sexual abuse and related matters in institutional contexts, including, in particular, in ensuring justice for victims through the provision of redress by institutions, processes for referral for investigation and prosecution and support services.


In September 2015 the royal commission released its final report on redress and civil litigation. This redress report contained the commission's concluded view on the question of redress. The commission issued that report more than two years ahead of its final report because it said:


By reporting as early as possible on these issues, we are seeking to give survivors and institutions more certainty on these issues and enable governments and institutions to implement our recommendations to improve civil justice for survivors as soon as possible.


In keeping with this sense of urgency, one of the recommendations in the redress report was that:


The Australian Government should determine and announce by the end of 2015 that it is willing to establish a single national redress scheme.


And that the national scheme be:


… ready to begin inviting and accepting applications from survivors by no later than 1 July 2017.


It's deeply regrettable that the previous Attorney-General, the former Senator Brandis, showed absolutely no interest in doing the work required to establish a national redress scheme, as evidenced by the fact that he did next to nothing to comply with the royal commission's recommendations and deadlines while survivors of child sexual abuse waited patiently for justice to at last be done. However, with responsibility for redress taken from Senator Brandis and given to other ministers in the government, negotiations began with the states and territories, and survivors finally began to see some forward motion.


Now this legislation is before the House that will at last implement a national redress scheme. That scheme will be operational a full year after the deadline that the royal commission set, but nevertheless it is a step forward in delivering justice to survivors. For this reason, and subject to some serious concerns I will set out now, Labor will be supporting the bills in this House. However, we will be carefully considering the recommendations of the Senate committee's inquiries into the scheme when it reports on 15 June, and we will be reserving our position in the other place until that occurs. In the meantime, we will continue to negotiate on a number of outstanding issues of concern with the government in good faith.


With that said, I will now briefly address some of our outstanding concerns about the redress scheme set out in this legislation. The very first recommendation in the redress report is titled 'Justice for victims'. It is important that we do not lose sight of this fundamental point: the redress scheme is at its core about delivering justice to survivors of the most hideous crimes against them. That first recommendation states:


A process for redress must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors – regardless of the location, operator, type, continued existence or assets of the institution in which they were abused – if it is to be regarded by survivors as being capable of delivering justice.


Recommendation 2 sets out the three foundations by which the proposed redress scheme would provide justice. It states:


Appropriate redress for survivors should include the elements of:


a. direct personal response


b. counselling and psychological care


c. monetary payments.


The primary concerns we in Labor have about the redress scheme the Turnbull government has put forward relate to the failure of the scheme to properly provide for the second and third elements and the significant gaps between what is provided for in this scheme and what was recommended by the royal commission.


I will deal with the requirement of counselling and psychological care first, because the failure of the scheme set out in this bill to comply with the royal commission's recommendations in relation to ongoing counselling and psychological care concerns me most. Recommendation 9 states:


Counselling and psychological care should be supported through redress in accordance with the following principles:


a. Counselling and psychological care should be available throughout a survivor's life.


b. Counselling and psychological care should be available on an episodic basis.


c. Survivors should be allowed flexibility and choice in relation to counselling and psychological care.


d. There should be no fixed limits on the counselling and psychological care provided to a survivor.


The redress report also states:


It is clear that many survivors will need counselling and psychological care from time to time throughout their lives. At times, a survivor may need very intensive therapy and support. At other times, a survivor may go for years without needing counselling or psychological care.


…   …   …


Survivors told us in private sessions and public hearings about the severe and sometimes lifelong impact that institutional child sexual abuse can have across all of these areas of life.


We have been given many examples of the severe impacts that untreated trauma of institutional child sexual abuse has had on survivors. We have had a number of private sessions with relatives of victims of institutional child sexual abuse who have committed suicide. Their relatives have told us of the terrible impact that the abuse had on the victims and the ongoing impact that the abuse and victims' suicides has had on their families.


Recommendation 11 deals with the need for ongoing care by explicitly stating:


Redress should fund counselling and psychological care as needed by survivors rather than providing a lump sum payment to survivors for their future counselling and psychological care needs.


The redress scheme set out in this bill directly contradicts those explicit recommendations of the royal commission and, instead, provides for a lump sum payment for counselling and psychological services. This is cause enough for concern, but it is of even greater concern to us that the maximum amount of the lump sum payment that will be available is $5,000. To put this amount in perspective, the Australian Psychological Society's current recommended schedule of fees sets the standard fee for a 45-60 minute consultation at $246. That means that a survivor who received the maximum redress payment for counselling of psychological services and who paid a standard fee to a psychologist for individual sessions would be able to pay for approximately 20 sessions with a registered psychologist.


The royal commission consulted extensively with survivors, their families and mental health experts in making its recommendations, and, given that it has recommended the need to provide for psychological care on an ongoing basis when it is required for the survivor's life, it is very concerning that a decision has been made to instead provide a lump sum payment of up to $5,000 for a lifetime of psychological care. That is 20 sessions only, even for survivors of the worst kinds of child sexual abuse, to last them for the rest of their lives. Of course, it's true that some survivors may not seek psychological support at all, but some survivors who will make claims for redress will need far more than the $5,000 on offer under this scheme. Some may still be teenagers with many years of psychological struggle ahead of them. In ignoring the explicit recommendations of the royal commission for lifetime care in this context and instead proposing a maximum lump sum of $5,000, the government was obviously not informed by any kind of medical evidence.


The royal commission also recommended that a range of changes be made to Medicare to help provide for rest-of-life psychological care to survivors of child sexual abuse. It may be that the government is intending to act on those recommendations to fill the gap in care this scheme creates. If that is the case, I look forward to seeing those changes.


I turn now to the second issue of concern: the quantum of monetary payments. The royal commission recommended that the maximum level of monetary payment for the most severe cases of child sexual abuse should be $200,000. The commission reached this conclusion after careful deliberation and extensive evidence regarding the appropriate monetary payment to provide tangible recognition of the seriousness of the hurt and injury suffered by a survivor. While payments under the redress scheme are not meant to be compensatory in the same way that damages from a civil claim against an abuser would be, I note that survivors of the most heinous forms of child sexual abuse have been recovering in excess of $1 million in civil actions against their abusers. In this context, the decision of the Turnbull government to reduce the maximum amount payable to survivors of the most serious forms of child sexual abuse to $150,000 is deeply disappointing to Labor, as I'm sure it will be to many survivors. How is it that the Turnbull government has no problem finding $80 billion to give to big businesses in tax cuts—including $17 billion just to the banks, which already make billions of dollars in profit a year and pay their executives multimillion dollar bonuses—but says it has no choice but to short-change the survivors of childhood sexual abuse?


The third issue I want to raise is the question of who will step in to make payments to survivors when no-one else is liable—the so-called funder of last resort. Once again, the royal commission was explicit on this matter and recommended that the Commonwealth, as well as state and territory governments, should act as funders of last resort to ensure that no survivor eligible for the scheme is left without a source of redress. It appears from this bill that these recommendations may not have been fully implemented, and there remain questions over who a survivor will be able to seek redress from if the institution in which they were abused is no longer in existence and had no links to government. It's my expectation that any gaps of this kind will be addressed as the scheme is rolled out so that no survivor eligible for redress is left unable to seek it.


In conclusion, I once again thank the royal commissioners and all of those involved in the commission's work for their tireless efforts. While the redress scheme provided for in these bills is late and falls short in some important respects from the scheme recommended by the royal commission, I have no doubt that it will provide a measure of justice to survivors, and I commend both bills to the House.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (13:04):  I too thank the member for Swan not only for his eloquent and moving speech in the House today but for his long-term advocacy on behalf of all Australians who suffered institutional child sex abuse. Having reviewed some of the member for Swan's contributions on this topic going right back to his maiden speech, I know that he has been a passionate, committed and effective champion for the cause of redress for many years. It is gratifying to see him have the opportunity to speak today as part of this landmark step forward for survivors. The member for Swan and I, and some other colleagues, just a couple of nights ago were reflecting that one of the advantages of being in this role is to be able to make meaningful change where it is needed.


I know that all of us were shocked and disturbed by the seemingly endless flood of terrible stories which emerged throughout the hearings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. In fact, an ex-colleague of mine was involved in representing certain people at the royal commission. He was a gentleman who had spent many years as a detective and many years as a criminal barrister. He would tell me that sitting in and listening to what was going on in these hearings made him physically ill. For a man who had spent much of his life dealing with very unsavoury parts of today's society to have said that speaks volumes.


In total, the royal commission handled 42,000 phone calls and almost 26,000 letters and emails and held 57 public hearings all over Australia. In addition, it spoke to around 8,000 additional individuals as part of its private sessions. Along with my colleagues in the House, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the survivors who took part in this process and courageously told their stories describing the devastating impact of the abuse they have suffered.


As we rightly focus on the suffering of survivors today, I'd like to ask members of the House and anyone watching today's proceedings to spare a thought also for the commissioners—the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, the Hon. Justice Jennifer Coate, Bob Atkinson, Robert Fitzgerald, Helen Milroy, Andrew Murray—and senior counsel assisting, Gail Furness SC, and all other support staff. I know from my past life as a barrister that to hear and review, in their case, so many thousands of harrowing stories and to relive those experiences face-to-face with so many thousands of survivors must've been exceptionally difficult for them and indeed their families. It will most definitely have taken a heavy toll on these men and women. We too often forget the psychological impact that working with survivors of trauma can have on our emergency services personnel, our counsellors and our legal officers. The commission and the staff did Australia and all survivors an important and exceedingly challenging service, and I hope and trust that they too are receiving the support that they need going into the future.


The royal commission identified a staggering 4,000 institutions where abuse took place—from schools to sporting clubs. To date, 2575 referrals, from a broad range of institutions, have been made to police. Of particular personal concern to me is the prominent place of the Catholic Church in these shocking statistics. On 6 February 2017, counsel assisting, Gail Furness SC, submitted a research report to the commission as an exhibit. The report resulted from research conducted by the royal commission supported by the Truth, Justice and Healing Council, which is the Catholic Church's body for coordinating the response to the royal commission, and Catholic Church authorities. It sought to estimate the number of priests and non-ordained religious members of the church authorities who were alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse in at least one claim reported between 1980 and 2010, with incidences stretching back to 1950.


The figures made for horrible reading, though we should remember that they relate to allegations of misconduct and not to proven findings of guilt. In that report, 1,880 alleged perpetrators involved in the Catholic Church were identified in claims of child sexual abuse. In total, 4,444 people alleged child sexual abuse incidents. Of the alleged perpetrators, 30 per cent, or 572, were priests, 693 were non-ordained religious brothers or sisters, and 543 were laypeople. This means that, in Australia, seven per cent of all priests are estimated to have been identified in a claim. Tragically, the average age of male victims was 11½ years old, while for girls it was just 10½.


The data likely underestimates the number of perpetrators. It includes only cases where the complainant came forward and actually made a complaint. As we know well, many do not. It also includes only claims where the claimant sought redress or where the complaints were accepted by the Catholic Church without redress being sought. Unfortunately, we know that, until recently, in too many cases the Catholic Church did not accept complaints and did not act to deal with alleged perpetrators. Gail Furness SC put it very succinctly and comprehensively when she said:


The accounts were depressingly similar. Children were ignored or worse, punished. Allegations were not investigated. Priests and religious were moved. The parishes or communities to which they were moved knew nothing of their past. Documents were not kept or they were destroyed. Secrecy prevailed as did cover ups. Priests and religious were not properly dealt with and outcomes were often not representative of their crimes. Many children suffered and continued as adults to suffer from their experiences in some Catholic institutions.


We heard a stark reminder just two days ago of that attitude with the conviction of Philip Wilson, the Archbishop of Adelaide. The archbishop ignored the 15-year-old Peter Creigh in 1976 when he told the then assistant parish priest about his abuse at the hands of Father Jim Fletcher. I understand that the archbishop is now facing a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, which arguably demonstrates the seriousness with which we should, and do, treat the nature of his actions. Had Archbishop Wilson informed the police of the allegations against Jim Fletcher, it would perhaps have helped to convict the priest more than a decade earlier and prevented further abuse from taking place. It seems likely that Archbishop Wilson's conviction will prompt further prosecutions, and we can look forward with optimism to the hope that this will dissuade individuals in the future from failing to report abuse.


Though the Catholic Church's past record in this area is disgraceful and difficult for Catholics like me to understand, it is, of course, sadly not unique. Out-of-home care institutions, sports clubs, recreation and hobby groups, other religious groups, and even schools and youth detention centres have been implicated in failures to prevent or properly deal with incidents of child sexual abuse.


Since the royal commission's report, the attention of the government and of the Catholic Church has rightly turned to the question of redress for victims. Redress is not simply about financial compensation. After all, no amount of money can change what happened to survivors or take away its impacts. Redress should be founded on two key principles: on the one hand, recognising the suffering of survivors and, on the other, helping them both to assimilate the experiences of their past and to build a better life in the future.


As the royal commission rightly identified, to achieve this, redress should have three elements. Though money cannot change the past, it is appropriate, first, that redress include monetary compensation. These payments constitute only a material recognition by the institutions involved of their wrongdoing and their contrition but it also provides funds which can help survivors create new opportunities or improve the comfort of lives often blighted by abuse. The redress scheme in this bill meets this requirement by including awards of redress payments of up to a maximum of $150,000 for each survivor, dependent on the level of sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse.


Second, redress should include counselling and psychological care to help support survivors with the mental health impacts of their experiences. Once again, the redress scheme in this bill meets that requirement by making survivors whose applications are accepted entitled to access counselling services where offered by their jurisdiction. Where their jurisdiction is not registered to provide these services, survivors will be entitled to a further payment of up to $5,000.


Third, the royal commission identified that a redress scheme must include a direct personal response from the institution to the survivor. This bill enables that by giving all survivors whose applications are accepted the right to a personal response. The survivor will be given the opportunity to tell the story of their abuse and describe its impact on them. They'll be entitled to receive, as appropriate, an apology, an acknowledgement of the impact of the abuse on the person, an opportunity to meet with an appropriately senior person from the relevant institution and an assurance as to the steps the institution now takes to protect children in their care against abuse.


Because of the comprehensive and appropriate design I've described, I support the redress scheme encapsulated in this bill and I support the principles that lie behind it. However, I must use this opportunity to remind the future national redress scheme operator and its delegates of its heavy responsibility. In most processes involving claims of compensation or redress, the initial decision is subject to further independent or judicial review where requested on reasonable grounds. This process in general ensures the integrity of the system and helps to prevent injustices. In this case, it is the operator, the secretary of the department and their designated delegates who will make the decision, while only an internal review conducted by an official with no involvement in the original decision will be available to applicants. In order to keep the scheme focused on the needs of survivors and avoid them being dragged into lengthy or adversarial court proceedings which risk further harm, merits review in the AAT or judicial review in the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court will not be available to either survivors or participating institutions. For participating institutions, there is no process of review.


Those measures are part of this bill for the right reasons and are an important means of ensuring that the redress scheme is focused on the needs of survivors. We must continue to adhere to the principles of fairness and equity for all institutions and ensure as far as possible that accepted applications provide redress to bona fide survivors. Without this, not only will the scheme be at risk of perpetrating its own injustices and hurt the interests of people who continue to rely on many of these institutions today, but its credibility with the public would come into question. I would ask that the operators remember this weighty responsibility and bear it in mind in all of their deliberations.


To date, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT and the Commonwealth have all signed up to the redress scheme, and I understand from reports in The Australian newspaper that the Catholic Church, among other institutions, is working behind the scenes to join. If we can persuade all of the states and territories and institutions to opt in, this scheme would offer meaningful redress based on the right principles to the around 60,000 people estimated by the royal commission to have been abused in institutions. For that reason and for the sake of all of the survivors who's courageously testified before the royal commission, I commend the bill to the House.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-24,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (12:34):  So much emotion, so much wrong to be righted and so much courage. In my speech today, I would like to acknowledge, honour and thank all those responsible for the royal commission: its inception, its operation, its administration and the delivery of the report. I'd particularly like to, as many of my colleagues have done, acknowledge the role of CLAN: Care Leavers Australasia Network. I'd also like to shine some light on the impact of the royal commission in my electorate of Indi; focus on redress, which we've been hearing about now; say that the job's not finished, that there's still more work to be done; and talk about one particular model that's been undertaken by the Victorian Women's Trust in this area. In conclusion, I'd like to offer my personal apology to the people of Indi and to those who have been hurt and have suffered pain because of the work of the churches and the institutions that we are all responsible for.


With that beginning, I'd like to start by talking about the Care Leavers Australasia Network. I thank people in my electorate, but particularly Rhonda and her team. As she has done with many members of parliament, she came and saw us, raised the issue, made sure we understood how important it was, kept us informed all the way through the royal commission and made sure that we knew what was going on. It's hard to find words to capture my admiration: courage, resilience, persistence, empathy, tolerance, more courage and patience. One of the things that Rhonda did, knowing that I would be making a speech today, was ask me to read this into the Hansard. It's a letter to 'My dear federal politician'. The heading is, 'Stop taxing the poorest of abuse victims'. It says:


I'm a member of CLAN and I was placed in an orphanage, children's home, foster care mission, and I am writing to you to seek your support to make representations on my behalf to the Prime Minister of all Australians, Malcolm Turnbull, CLAN patron. The national redress scheme is due to commence on 1 July. Whilst we commend the Liberal government for introducing national redress for those abused in orphanages, children's homes, missions and foster care, there are, however, many care leavers who will be extremely disadvantaged, angry and hurt on 1 July because they were not sexually used or abused in an orphanage, children's home, mission, foster care but suffered great cruelty and brutal physical and psychological damage as children. These care leavers, who have received as little as $2,000 redress from the Queensland, Western Australian and Tasmanian governments redress schemes will now be taxed on those payments at 1.9 per cent. This is like robbing the poorest of abuse victims, the government's children. None of these care leavers ever expected that government to tax those paltry amounts decades later. The Prime Minister plans on issuing an apology on behalf of the nation. This will be a hollow apology when so many care leavers will be excluded and reabused and retraumatised by this unjust redress scheme.


So we're not quite done yet.


The second area that I'd like to talk a little bit about is the impact on my electorate of this horrendous activity that's taken place in Australia. We've heard the figures from the royal commission about the size of the problem, but the bit that I'd like to concentrate on, again so sadly, is the Catholic Church and the Sandhurst diocese. The Sandhurst diocese is based in Bendigo, in Victoria, covers most of Indi and also includes the electorates of Murray and Bendigo. I will read from the Bendigo Advertiserof 6 February 2017. It says:


THE Sandhurst Diocese had the second highest rate of priests accused of child sexual abuse out of Australia's 17 Catholic dioceses during a 60 year period.


Figures released from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse showed almost 15 per cent of priests who ministered in the Sandhurst Diocese between 1950 and 2010 were accused of child sexual offences.


…   …   …


The diocese was second only to the Diocese of Sale …


I make this point because we've heard much about Ballarat but we've heard very little about Sandhurst and Sale. Sandhurst:


The diocese was second only to the Diocese of Sale for the proportion of priests alleged to have sexually abused children between 1950 and 2010.


Proportionately, more priests allegedly committed offences in Sandhurst than the Ballarat Diocese, where the Royal Commission sat to hear evidence from residents and former students …


There's something that's so sad about this for me, because Ballarat is a large city. It's got a lot of people in it. Poor old Sandhurst is a rural country electorate, and Sale similarly. So I think what happened is that these priests and brothers and others got sent to the country, and we poor, almost defenceless country communities had nowhere to go. We didn't have the advocacy, we didn't have the knowledge and we became a place for this. I just think it's so sad, particularly with the passion I bring to this parliament for rural and regional Australia. When I see it borne out in these statistics, it makes me even more sad to think the institutionalised church would do that.


But clearly it's not all negative. I'm really relieved that the Sandhurst Diocese says that there were no incidents after 2000, and no priests employed after 1990 were accused of any offences. So the vast majority of offences occurred during my growing-up years, the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In talking about Sandhurst, I probably need to keep the record straight, because the current Bishop of Sandhurst, Bishop Leslie Tomlinson, has apologised to victims and survivors of sexual abuse. He said that it was very sad that it happened and that the church will make amends, and he commits to working with victims, survivors and their families into the future. So that's really good to see, but somehow it doesn't take away the stain. It doesn't take away the lack of trust. It doesn't take away the hurt. So this redress scheme is really important.


I'd like to talk a little bit about redress. I welcome the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Fisher, about monetary compensation—the lump sum—about financial support, about apology and about assurances regarding cessation of alleged perpetrators' position. I'm really pleased to know that that's included in the legislation.


But, in my research to try to understand better the impact of the Catholic Church on my community, I've found it hasn't just stopped with child sexual abuse. There have been other sorts of abuses that have taken place. I'd now like to turn my mind to a submission to the royal commission from the Victorian Women's Trust, dated 9 March 2015. I'll read from the submission:


… over the past six years, we have been intimately involved in seeking redress for women who were former members of religious Orders. We began this journey with some published research. We then designed an Independent Advocacy Program. In the time since, we have successfully sought appropriate redress on behalf of many women religious.


From this significant advocacy experience, we believe we can offer some insight into the broader question of institutional culture and impact on victims as well as adding value to the consideration of key elements that must be involved in ensuring effective redress of past abuse and harm.


Their research culminated in the publication in 2009 of a research and discussion paper entitled The paradox of service. There is much wisdom, I have to say, in that report, and I'm extraordinarily grateful to the Victorian Women's Trust for the work that they've done in supporting nuns who have left the orders. I will turn my mind to the considerations they talk about in The paradox of service and in their submission about redress. They say, and I will quote from their three issues for consideration:


We support the statement of general principles (p.57) to guide the provision of all elements to redress—survivor‐focused; no wrong door; cultural needs of survivors including proper training and understanding; and redress that needs the needs of particularly vulnerable survivors.


And they talk about having a champion in your corner.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (11:17):  The 14th of December 2017 is a day that I will never forget. It was the final hearing of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses into Child Sexual Abuse. As I approached the building, I could see the unmistakable blue and yellow shirts of the Clannies standing out against the grey suits of downtown Sydney. The Clannies are, of course, the Care Leavers Australasia Network, a support group of survivors of child abuse. They were there with the irrepressible Leonie Sheedy—kind, determined and resilient. Leonie is one of the most remarkable people I've ever had the good fortune to meet.


There are so many people who've made an enormous contribution to the cause of justice for survivors of child sexual abuse, including Leonie and everyone at CLAN, and Caroline, Carol and everyone from the Alliance for Forgotten Australians. I'll never forget Caroline telling me her story to help me understand the horror of what had been done to her and so many others. The late Anthony Foster and his wife, Chrissie. Chrissie and Anthony Foster discovered in the 1990s that two of their daughters, Emma and Katie, were raped by their local priest. Emma began harming herself after the trauma she experienced. In her teens, Katie was hit by a car, leaving her permanently disabled. In 2008, Emma died of an overdose. And so began Chrissie and Anthony's tireless fight for justice, taking on the Catholic Church and eventually suing the church, personally giving counsel and support to hundreds of survivors. To this day, Chrissie continues to be a powerful advocate for survivors, particularly on the issue of redress.


I remember Chrissie saying to me on that day that we must implement the recommendations of the royal commissioners. These commissioners, she said to me, were the people who had listened to the experiences of the survivors of child sexual abuse. The commissioners had spent five years considering their recommendations and they must not be ignored. The hearing room that day was packed, and as the commissioners very formally filed in there was a loud cheer. So many people had been heard. So many people had finally been believed. The people in the room that day and all the others who have been so badly abused are now relying on us to establish a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, and we must not fail them. As the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, chair of the royal commission, stated in his final address that day last December:


…the primary responsibility for the sexual abuse of a child lies with the abuser and the institution of which they were part, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the problems faced by many people who have been abused are the responsibility of our entire society.


We, as lawmakers, must uphold our responsibilities to the survivors. We must not fail them as a society. We must not fail them again, and we must establish a national redress scheme, and this time we have to make sure we get it right. On the day that Prime Minister Gillard announced the establishment of the royal commission back in 2013, she said:


There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil. 


I believe in these circumstances that it's appropriate for there to be a national response through a Royal Commission.


And she was right. Over the five years of the commission, there have been 57 public hearings held over 444 days. The commission heard evidence from 1,300 witnesses. Commissioners held almost 8,000 private sessions to listen to the personal accounts of survivors. There have been more than 2½ thousand referrals to authorities, including the police. The royal commission estimates that around 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. It found that there were more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. Thousands of vulnerable children were subjected to truly horrific sexual abuse in institutions right across Australia. Think about it: 20,000 people in 4,000 institutions—so widespread, so devastating.


I want to thank the survivors who gave evidence to the commission. I want to say to the survivors directly: without your extraordinary courage in giving evidence, the realities and extent of child sexual abuse would not have been truly recognised—I'm looking at the member for Swan—nor would the failure of institutions to respond to that abuse be fully known. I want to say loud and clear that I believe you. We, all of us here, believe you. The parliament of Australia believes you. I say this so sharply but also so sadly because, for years, these survivors were not believed. Your personal stories greatly contributed to the royal commission's recommendations, and none of us, I think, can allow any of these recommendations to sit on a shelf and be ignored.


The national redress scheme was recommended in the royal commission's interim redress and civil litigation report released in June 2015. The royal commission's case studies and private sessions made clear that many people, while children, were subjected to terrible sexual abuse in institutions. As the royal commission said, many of the injuries were severe and long-lasting. Many people have been and continue to be affected by injuries for the rest of their lives. It is the case that many, many survivors have still not had the opportunity to seek compensation for their injuries. The royal commission acknowledged:


… it cannot now be made feasible for many of those who have experienced institutional child sexual abuse to seek common law damages, there is a clear need to provide avenues for survivors to obtain effective redress for this past abuse.


The establishment of a national redress scheme will acknowledge the abuse that occurred. Labor understands—and I think everybody understands—that no amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced. However, redress is a vital step along the path to healing—a vital step that we all have an obligation to put in place.


It's also important that, under this legislation, survivors will have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution or institutions responsible for the abuse. A direct personal response is a statement of acknowledgement, regret or apology and will be delivered to survivors by the relevant participating institution after the survivor has accepted the offer of redress. We did announce support for a national redress scheme back in October 2015 and, unfortunately, it has taken too long to get to this point. Nevertheless, we do welcome the recent significant progress that has seen the majority of states and territories sign up to the redress scheme and we strongly urge the remaining states and institutions that are yet to sign up to do as soon as possible. Access to redress must not depend on where you live.


The royal commission recommended that the Australian government announce a willingness to establish a single national redress scheme by the end of 2015 and that the scheme should be accepting applications by no later than 1 July last year, so it is very, very disappointing that this legislation is nearly a year late. But, that said, it is now time to get on with it.


The two bills that we're debating here today supersede the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Institutional Sexual Abuse 2017, otherwise known as the Commonwealth bill. The original 2017 bill would have created a redress scheme only for the few survivors whose abuse occurred in the territories and in Commonwealth institutions. Following the announcement that New South Wales and Victoria would join the scheme, the national bills that we're debating here today were drafted. On 17 May the New South Wales parliament passed redress legislation, and earlier this month legislation was also introduced into the Victorian parliament that will refer powers to the Commonwealth. On 30 April the Queensland government announced that they would opt in. The ACT and the Northern Territory have indicated their support, as has the Tasmanian government. That is very good news, and we certainly hope the remaining states will follow very quickly.


We have referred these bills to a short Senate inquiry to make sure that survivors of child sexual abuse get a redress scheme that they think—that they think, that the survivors think—is appropriate and fair. That inquiry will report by 15 June.


We of course want to see a national redress scheme established without further delay, so, as a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns, we will support this bill in the House today. I do, however, want to outline some of the continuing issues that Labor has with respect to the proposed redress scheme in the bill that we're debating. First, we do want to make sure that there are enough support services for all survivors of child sexual abuse and that they're accessible no matter where the survivor lives. Second, we want to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. The bill gives applicants at least six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommended a year. It's very important that survivors have sufficient time to consider this decision, as only one application to the scheme is permitted. For many people, this will be a very emotional and overwhelming process. We must do what we can to make sure that people have a reasonable amount of time to work through their claims.


The next concern we have is the compensation amount. The bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor. The royal commission recommended that the maximum payment be $200,000. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights that any survivor may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. That's why it's so important that the amount of redress available under the scheme is adequate.


We also want to make sure that anyone who is eligible for the scheme is able to get the redress that they deserve. We are very concerned that it could be possible, for a person whose abuse was not deemed the responsibility of government and for whom there is no remaining institution responsible, that they could be left with no avenue for redress. This outcome is unacceptable. We've sought urgent clarification from the minister and a guarantee that no-one will be left without any avenue to seek redress, either through the redress scheme or through civil litigation. This is an absolutely critical issue.


The indexation of past payments is a matter particularly close to the heart of many survivors who fought long and hard for compensation. The national bill sets the rate of this adjustment, specifying that an earlier amount received as compensation would be multiplied by 1.019 for each full year since the receipt of the original amount. The Care Leavers Australia Network has been campaigning for indexation to be dropped from the scheme. For many people, past compensation amounts were small. Legal fees often ate up a significant proportion of what people received. As a result, CLAN argue that it's unfair for the past redress amount to be indexed. I fear, as the survivors do, that some survivors who are eligible for redress will end up with nothing after indexation is applied because of previous compensation payments. Survivors have been waiting for many, many years for this redress scheme. We know that. In the event that someone gets no redress because of indexation, that would really be a devastating result. We know, of course, that redress is about more than money. It is a tangible recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors. We do not believe that past redress amounts should be indexed.


The bill also limits eligibility for the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia and who are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We're concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We also want to see the minister take the steps that are available under the proposed legislation to include former child migrants and immigration detainees who no longer live in Australia. This is an important issue of justice, and we're seeking a clear commitment from the government that these people will have access to the scheme.


I'm sure that all members agree that providing counselling to survivors is a top priority. We also know, each and every one of us, that no amount of money can make up for the pain and suffering endured. That said, access to good-quality counselling is vital. We are concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended—and this is very important—that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives. This bill only provides access to state provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. Frankly, these arrangements are woefully inadequate. We, therefore, call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Survivors often consider that government, particularly the state governments, are responsible for their abuse, so they do not necessarily want to use state- or institution-run services. So this needs to be taken into account when consideration is given to who delivers the services. Labor also holds concerns that survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could be disadvantaged if they're not able to access services for the same length of time as those survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. It's very important that this be taken into account in future reviews. For survivors who receive the $5,000 payment for counselling, this amount of money is highly unlikely to provide adequate access to support. It is critical that these issues are addressed urgently.


The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors from accessing the redress scheme who themselves have a criminal history. We also believe this is unfair. The bill requires that those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. This rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The first Senate inquiry into these issues was inundated with evidence from a variety of witnesses and submitters that this rule is cruel and likely to increase recidivism. So we do believe that this policy should be changed.


That said, for all of these concerns, I do want to acknowledge that establishing this national redress scheme is a very, very complex task. I acknowledge the Minister for Social Services, Dan Tehan, for his diligence in getting the outcome that is before us today. It is, as I said earlier, very encouraging that most of the jurisdictions have already agreed to sign on, and I understand the other two are working closely with the government.


It is, next, imperative that those institutions responsible for the abuse of children sign up and pay redress. No institution should back out of its responsibility for the abuse of children that took place where it had responsibility to care for those children. There is still time to get this right, so I call on the government to consider the issues that I've raised today. I do want to make it clear that, if we are successful at the next election, a Labor government would seek to work with the states towards addressing the areas of concern that I've identified here in these remarks.


I want to finish by, once again, thanking the courageous survivors who shared their own personal stories of abuse at the royal commission. It was their evidence that enabled the royal commissioners and the Australian people to understand in some way the extent of their suffering. It's also why we're here today, debating this very important piece of legislation. I want to thank the royal commissioners—what an extraordinary group of people—and all the staff who supported the survivors to tell their accounts of abuse over many years of hearings. I want to thank Julia Gillard for establishing the royal commission. It was a very big decision. Nicola Roxon, who was the Attorney-General at the time, and I worked with Prime Minister Gillard to get this started.


The evidence presented to the royal commission shocked and appalled all Australians. It exposed heinous crimes. Listen to the forgotten. Believe those who had been for so long ignored. We understand the royal commissioners did not make their recommendations lightly. We do believe that all of their recommendations should be implemented faithfully, and the task for us all now in this parliament is to deliver a national redress scheme for survivors. I commend the bill to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:39):  I rise today in support of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I acknowledge the contribution made by the member for Jagajaga. It has been a journey of many years for us, not only on the redress scheme but in dealing with victims of institutional sex abuse. The member for Jagajaga mentioned the work of the royal commission. She and I have heard many stories—she described them as heinous. We have heard tragic stories of things that should never occur in a civilised society. We have heard enormous stories about abuse in all manners and forms. The commission has listened to four or five years of that. I take my hat off to them and acknowledge their contribution to the legislation before the parliament today.


The member for Jagajaga was quite emotional during her speech—and I join with her in that. Jenny, I would like to come over and give you a hug—as we have done with many CLAN people over the years whom we have dealt with on this issue. I feel your lifelong passion in this parliament towards this achievement that is coming out today. When I leave this place, if I could talk about only one thing it would be the efforts we have made towards getting where we are today. I think both sides of the parliament need to be congratulated. There has been an effort from many of us to help these people.


It was 10 years ago that I delivered my maiden speech in this chamber, during which I said I wanted to draw attention to the national issue of institutional child sex abuse. As a former ward of the state, I saw it as my responsibility to champion the issues of care leavers and children who had suffered abuse in institutions across the country. For the last 10 years, I have continued to advocate for a redress scheme which would see institutions that inflicted this abuse held accountable for what they did to far too many of the nation's children.


The member for Jagajaga also mentioned in her speech that Peter McClellan had said it is a problem of our entire society. In my maiden speech, I mentioned a little girl named Shelley Ward. She wasn't in an institution but she starved to death in a home in New South Wales under the care of her own parents. We have heard the many stories about institutional child sex abuse over the last 10 years. They are often reflected in private homes around Australia as well, for which there is no form of redress at all under the system. After our achievement today, we need to look at child abuse in private homes and how the children continue to be returned to the abusers.


If there was one thing I could call for—and I know a lot of people don't agree—it would be the reintroduction of the death penalty for paedophiles and people who continually abuse children. I'm sure that won't get far, but it's a personal passion of mine.


Moving forward four years from my maiden speech, I, along with parliamentary colleagues, welcomed former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's announcement that a royal commission into institutional child sex abuse would be held—which I and a number of members on both sides of this chamber had called for. Again, the member for Jagajaga was influential in getting that over the line.


I note that the member for Maribyrnong is in the chamber. I congratulate him on his efforts. I congratulate the leaders of both sides of parliament who, during this time, have had people like me and Jenny continually knocking on their doors looking for their support for a national redress scheme. I acknowledge all the leaders. The Prime Minister has made promises about this. We all remember his speech where he uttered the words that the member for Jagajaga has just used: 'We believe you.' That was vitally important on the day of that apology.


Over the next five years, an extensive investigation into the wrongdoings of institutions was conducted. In March 2013 the Royal Commission Act was amended to allow for private sessions, the first being held in Sydney two months later. The first public hearing was held at the County Court of Victoria in April and, by June, the first issues paper was released allowing for individuals and organisations to contribute responses to the issues raised. The following April, in 2014, the first roundtable was held enabling representatives, regulators, policy experts, survivors and advocacy groups to discuss key policy issues. The interim report was released in June. Due to the scale of the evidence received, it was obvious the royal commission has only scratched the surface on this national issue. And so in September 2014, the royal commission was formally extended to December 2017—again, with the support of those opposite. The following three years saw the working-with-children checks report released, along with the redress and civil litigation report and the report on criminal justice. In March last year, the royal commission had its 57th and final public hearing. In December of 2017, the final report was presented to the Governor-General detailing the culmination of a five-year inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.


I would like to share some of the facts which the previous member mentioned on the royal commission with the House, which are available on the royal commission's website. I think they give insight into the scale of the royal commission. Over the five-year inquiry, there were 42,041 calls handled, 25,964 letters received, 8,013 private sessions held, and 2,575 referrals to authorities, including to the police. That's a staggering amount of referrals. It's an indictment on that period of time in our society. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where abuse took place. It estimates that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. In addition, more than 6,500 victims who gave private evidence said more than one person had abused them.


These aren't just statistics; these are experiences of real people, real Australians who were sexually abused by the people charged with their care and protection, charged to nurture them. No child should ever experience what they did. I've said in this chamber before that I can only imagine the horrific experiences people suffered. They missed out on the joys of being raised in a loving and nurturing family home. I remember early back in the time the member for Jagajaga talked about the courage of people giving evidence and relaying their stories.


I have an institution in my electorate which looks after young ladies who have been abused either sexually or physically, or who have drug issues. I arranged for some care leavers to come and tell them their stories. These young ladies were in their early 20s. They sat around and listened to the stories of the care leavers and what they had experienced. I spoke to the lady who brought them to the meeting afterwards in my office. She said they cried all the way home. These were young ladies who thought they were having issues of their own but once they heard the care leavers' stories, they had forgotten about their own problems and realised that generations have been going through abuse and troubles in our society for a long time. Again, I say 'hats off' to these people who have the courage to not only tell the member for Jagajaga and myself their stories but to then relay them to commissioners, who they have no knowledge of and no affection with or anything like that, and for their desire to tell their stories to make sure that people nationally across this great country get the redress that they deserve.


As the member for Jagajaga said, it will never fix or compensate for the problems they have had but it's the aftercare response, the necessary care and welfare—psychologically and physically—that we need to make sure we provide these people with to make sure the rest of their lives are peaceful and in a good state. No child is responsible for the circumstances in which they are born or for the reasons they were put into care. Be it financial hardship, or the breakdown of a family unit, all children should feel safe and loved. This is where we failed them as a nation.


I will put a personal touch on it. Once I realised my own story, I researched my sister, Jennifer, and found that she had been put into an institution at the same time I had been, along with my brother, Raymond. Jennifer died at the age of 12 while she was under the care of an institution. When I accessed her Victorian Human Services records and read through them, the evidence was in the paperwork that she was systematically put through foster care homes and sexually and physically abused during her time in foster care homes—not while she was in the institutions but while she was in the foster care homes. Again, that's another area we need.


I take my hat off to foster parents. I had foster parents. But there were times when that evidence was there and was ignored as well by people in the institutions.


Unfortunately, she passed away at the age of 12, and I recently found her unmarked grave. She's now got a headstone on it. It was part of her journey that she was never recognised. She was buried in a pauper's grave. I found out that my own biological mother wouldn't pay for that, so there was never a headstone on her grave. 


There are many stories like that across Australia, but that is just to give you some idea. There is a lot of emotion for these people. It affects all of us. Today, bringing this legislation before the parliament will help them. It won't give them compensation. It will never fix the problems that they suffer from, but it will support them, hopefully for the rest of their lives.


The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect the survivor, as I just said, for the rest of their life. We have learned from the evidence taken that many of the survivors have had issues in their relationships with their own children and often in their dealings with authorities, issues stemming from the abuse they were subjected to as children. We heard the member for Jagajaga mention Leonie. When Leonie contacted me to assist her with the Care Leavers Australia Network on institutional child sexual abuse, she knew that I'd spent time in an institution. She asked me about my reactions and how I dealt with certain issues that I faced in life as I travelled through my life. She said, 'This is the standard response for people who have spent time in institutions.'


Leonie, hats off to you and the work that you and Joanna have done. Leonie always rings me up and says, 'Never give in,' and she hasn't given in in the whole battle that she's been through this whole time. She's actually taking over my office in a couple of weeks to have a CLAN meeting in Perth. We said: 'We need to find a location for you. Don't send out the invite until we've found it for you.' But she sent the invite out anyway, so she's taking over my office in couple of weeks. But that's part of the journey that the member for Jagajaga and, I know, the member for Blaxland have been through. Leonie's organisation is in your electorate, and you've been along for that journey as well, so hats off to you as well.


I'll be forever grateful to the survivors who bravely gave evidence to the commission for reliving their emotional, physical and sexual abuse and trauma while telling their personal stories. Without their courage and sharing their experiences, and without their bravery in having to detail and explain their ordeals, a scheme like this would never have been established.


On 4 November 2016, the coalition government announced the Commonwealth redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse and on that day invited states, territories and non-government institutions to join the Commonwealth scheme to deliver redress to the survivors of these wrongs. Along with the member for Jagajaga, I hope that the final two states and the people and all the institutions get on board and come and join this redress scheme. I must say that it was a privilege for me to have been there on the day when the now Attorney-General, the former Minister for Social Services, made the announcement in my home town of Perth. I know this was a welcome announcement for my colleagues on both sides of the chamber.


Member for Jagajaga, I've put you in here. I've mentioned you a few times. It has been a privilege to work with you on this as well.


It's been a long journey to get here. It must feel like an eternity for the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Through this journey I've had the privilege of meeting many of them. Many of them are incredible characters. Another thing that Leonie often says when she rings me up is, 'The jacks are on their way.' As a Victorian, I know who 'the jacks' are. They don't know who they are in Western Australia, but I know who they are in Victoria. The banter is still there. There have been many tears but many laughs along the way as well.


In the short time I have left, I'd like to thank everyone who's contributed, helped and assisted in getting to this point. Jenny, I heard your comments at the end of your speech. If there's any way I can assist in achieving the things which would give a better outcome for the survivors, I'll work with you on trying to achieve them. I commend this bill to the House. Thank you.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (11:54):  I thank the member for Swan for his words that we just listened to. I think a lot of Australians get rightly frustrated with parliament. They feel that we're not dealing with the issues which go to their daily lives. But sometimes you can hear speeches and contributions from across the political spectrum which I do think measure up to the hopes and ambitions which Australians rightly have of their parliament. This debate, I think, does pass the test of dealing with and improving the lives of Australians.


In saying that, I want to begin by acknowledging the magnificent Leonie Sheedy and her mighty CLAN army; Caroline, Carol and other members of the Alliance for Forgotten Australians; and Chrissie Foster and the late Anthony Foster. I want to acknowledge every survivor and loved one and carer that my colleagues and I have had the privilege to meet along the way—all those brave people who fought a very long battle to be heard. I say to you that the parliament of Australia is debating this legislation today because of your courage, because of your determination and because, somehow, you and other survivors and the people who love you found a strength which is quite frankly unimaginable in many circumstances, to refuse to be silenced, intimidated, ignored or, indeed, patronised. I want to thank the royal commissioners for the quite gruelling and thorough yet caring way they went about their work, and I want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the royal commission. I think it is appropriate to salute the leadership of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who had the conviction to establish the royal commission and put redress for child abuse on the national political agenda, and of course the member for Jagajaga, who has championed this cause for so long.


Within days of Prime Minister Gillard's announcement in 2013, Gerry Ann sent an email to the commission requesting a private session to tell her story. Over the next three years, she cancelled on numerous occasions. Sometimes she didn't feel psychological ready; sometimes she was just frustrated or disengaged. But one day, after reading reports of a particular priest's testimony, she ended up trying to take her own life, and ended in intensive care. This was a turning point for her. In 2015, with help from her daughter Rachel and from commission case workers, Gerry Ann came forward to tell her story. She said:


My time at [the orphanage] robbed me of my innocence, and set the benchmark of who I would become: frightened, petrified, scared, fearful, not worthy, introverted, isolated, segregated, sad and constantly suicidal. … My personality was destroyed by the very people that were supposed to protect me.


Gerry Ann's story is about the calculated, cold-hearted abuse of a scared but very precious little girl. It is unique to her.


Only she will ever know how dark the days were, just how deep the memories run, but it is the same trauma, the same betrayal and the same violation of sacred trust that fills the pages of the royal commission's final report. Thousands of our fellow Australians had their childhoods stolen and their faith in people shattered. Nine hundred orphanages across the time. Literally hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australians. The scars still cover our nation: crimes that were ignored; people whose stories were ignored; perpetrators who were sheltered, quietly tut-tutted and moved on; institutions who protected their reputation rather than the children who were supposed to be in their care; and, of course, the graves of those who did not live to see justice done.


We understand that no set of words can make this right. No amount of compensation can restore a childhood. No dollar sum can put back together souls that have been broken. But we can in this place show perhaps a fraction—a portion—of the courage and resolve that survivors already have. What we can do is match words of sorrow with deeds of redress. What we must do is vow that this cannot happen again. We must ensure that every single survivor gets every dollar they deserve and every second of support they need. We must deliver on the recommendations of the royal commission and live up to its spirit.


A national redress scheme has been Labor policy since 2015. However, we are not the current government. Today we're required to vote and judge upon the basis of the government's proposal. It's a little-known fact that sometimes the hardest decisions for an opposition are not to decide what to oppose but what to agree to. Today we have to ask ourselves: is this legislation good enough? Is it the best deal that we can strike in the circumstances? It's not the legislation that a federal Labor government would have drafted, but that doesn't mean that I think that the federal government hasn't done its very best. It is hard work wrangling states and navigating the legal arguments and strengths of institutions with deep pockets. To the states and institutions yet to sign up, I would repeat what I have said on many occasions: the time for lawyers is over; the time for justice is here.


In our view, the legislation is an overdue step in the right direction, but it cannot be the end of the road. Labor will be voting for this bill before the House because we believe the start date of 1 July this year is vital and because, as an opposition, and on an issue like this, we should not seek to make the perfect the enemy of the acceptable. But, as the member for Jagajaga powerfully indicated, we do have concerns about aspects, important aspects, of the legislation and we are prepared to work in good faith with the government of the day to address these issues prior to the scheme commencing on 1 July. If we cannot solve these problems from opposition, we will sit down with the states and institutions to work on fixing them in government.


In large part, our concerns arise from when the government's legislation departs from the recommendations of the royal commission. For example, the royal commission recommended a maximum payment of $200,000. This legislation seeks to cap that at $150,000. It is near enough to vote for, but not enough to give up on. This isn't the time for haggling; it's not an opportunity to perhaps save $50,000. I think that Australians are more generous and more decent than this. I wonder, if we had a plebiscite on this question, whether or not Australians would vote for $150,000 or $200,000. The royal commission recommended survivors be given one year to decide whether to accept an offer of redress. Legislation gives them only six months. It is near enough, but perhaps not good enough. We're talking about a complex legal and emotional decision, because, by accepting the offer, you sign away your rights to litigation down the track. I think that, in this set of circumstances, every day does matter. After so many years of making Australians wait for justice, I do not feel comfortable in telling them that they must rush to a decision.


Of course, it's not just about the money. Support services are vital. The royal commission recommended survivors have access to counselling for the rest of their life. The legislation provides only for counselling services for the life of the scheme or to the value of $5,000. With regard to this particular proposal, I will not stand up in front of survivors and say that I think it is near enough. I will not say that this is all there should be. I think this is something we can work on fixing. I think we have a collective responsibility to make sure the right support services are available to every survivor, wherever they live and whatever language they speak. I do not regard the right to counselling as a charity to be rationed but a right that has been earned in the most unfortunate and undesirable of circumstances.


As it stands, this legislation limits redress to people living in Australia and to Australian citizens. Our nation has apologised to child migrants for the abuse they suffered in Australian institutions, but if, after what they've been through in this country, they've returned to their country of birth, I do not think that should put them beyond the umbrella of Australian justice. This legislation also seeks to place a restriction on access to the scheme for survivors who've served a prison sentence of five years or more. They would need special permission from the scheme operator to access redress. It is perhaps better than what was initially proposed, but I will not tell survivors that I think it is fair, because I do not believe that. I think it misunderstands or ignores the tragic reality that childhood abuse puts people on a path to incarceration later in life. What puts people into incarceration is a chain of events—it can be a range of circumstances—but, because of other mistakes, I do not see how we absolve ourselves of our contribution to that chain of events. The Senate inquiry heard a great deal of important evidence saying a provision like this not only was cruel but increases risk of reoffending. I think we need to revisit this restriction.


There is one final concern of ours, which is the indexation of past payments. It has been raised with me many times. Let me explain this briefly. As it stands, a small sum of compensation that someone received in the seventies, for example, will be subject to 40 years of indexation when their final redress amount is calculated. This could potentially create a set of circumstances where a survivor of abuse is left entitled to nothing on 1 July this year because of a token sum provided to fob off a claim not believed half a lifetime ago. I think, as a nation, we can do better, but I acknowledge that this legislation is an advance on where we are. I look at the end of Gerry Ann's testimony in 2016, she said:


I'm shutting Pandora's box this year … I've handed it to you now. It's not my problem anymore … I'm not carrying this anymore … It's not my guilt, my shame …


I say to Gerry Ann: you have no reason for guilt; no cause for shame. The system failed you; people betrayed you; the nation ignored you. But no more. No longer. Today we say that Australia believes you. The Parliament of Australia will do right by you.


Today is a most important start. It is a step forward after decades of inaction and denial. But today cannot, should not and must not be the end of the matter. On this question, near enough will never be the same as good enough. All of us in this place on all sides are measured by what we do next. I do not say that anyone can guarantee you that all of what is fair is what will be delivered. I do not say that it is automatic that all of the issues that we've raised here today will be fixed. There are hard conversations to be had with states and institutions, but let us all strive to deliver proper access to counselling, because injury is not time limited. Eliminate indexation of payments so survivors are not discounted and ripped off because of past decisions. Extend justice to forgotten Australians and to those whose childhood trauma saw them spend part of their adult life behind bars. And ensure that the levels of redress reflect the decency and generosity of Australian people.


When you stop to look at the photos, as I did, in the CLAN office, and you see how common the system of orphanages was for so long, and you see the photos and the faces of the boys and the girls in their second-hand uniforms, scrubbed up, you wonder what is really going on when those photos are not taken. When you look at how our fellow Australians who've survived can summon the courage to stare down dark corners of memories, and relive hard moments, I think that we can do better than near enough. We can do good enough.


In closing, for me, the reason why I support this legislation but will not tell people who survived that this is the end of the matter is that I wonder what would happen if my wife, Chloe, and I were no longer able to look after one of our kids. I wonder what would happen if one of our children went through a system and then came out the other end and were told, 'The legislation now deals with your matters.' I wouldn't want my children to be treated in this manner and I don't expect any other children to be treated in that manner either. I thank the House.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (12:08):  I begin this story of support for the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 by talking about the first person who came into my office—not about the tragedy of his life but of his journey of hope. Dr J Michael Davey told me his powerful and inspiring story. Fostered as a baby, Michael was placed with an abusive family and in four separate state-run institutions where he experienced physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of his carers. Kidnapped by his father, Michael eventually returned home, only to discover that his mother was a violent and crazed schizophrenic who both hated him and blamed him for her illness. Devoid of love and care, Michael was mercilessly beaten by his mother. In the face of overwhelming odds, Michael overcame his past, finding success out of significant adversity. Michael's website reflects those words. He is a humble and beautiful soul, reaching out to others at all times with his extraordinary determination, courage and eternal optimism.


Children placed in the trust of our institutions were some of the most vulnerable members of our community. That they were sexually abused by the very people charged with their care and protection is a disgrace. No child should ever experience what they did. That is why it is time for all institutions and governments to take responsibility for what happened.


In the redress scheme we are looking for justice for victims. A process for this must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors, regardless of their location, the organisation or the continued existence of assets of the institution in which they were abused. None of those are discriminatory. The scheme needs to recognise the suffering that survivors have experienced and accept that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for the abuse. It's really important to note that this government is leading by example and establishing the redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, and, in addition, inviting state and territory governments and institutions to opt in to the scheme on the responsible-entity-pays basis recommended by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Hopefully it is a fair and just plan moving towards positive outcomes.


The royal commission estimated that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. The royal commission has clearly demonstrated that thousands of vulnerable children were subject to horrendous sexual abuse in institutions throughout our country. The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm. At all times we should acknowledge the courage of these survivors who presented evidence to the royal commission, and we must remind ourselves that their past and continuing advocacy for redress is vital to the successful implementation of the redress scheme. In addition, we recognise that survivors of institutional child sexual abuse need and deserve equal access and treatment. They really do.


Some people may ask what the Commonwealth government's scheme is. To put it simply, it will provide support services to people who were sexually abused as children in Commonwealth institutional settings. It will offer a direct personal response for those survivors who seek it, psychological counselling and a monetary payment to acknowledge the wrongdoing inflicted upon survivors. Passage of these bills will enable the Commonwealth government to respond to the royal commission's redress recommendations by developing a best-practice redress scheme for survivors. That sounds somewhat clinical, but in some ways is probably the best way forward. The scheme will start on 1 July this year and run for 10 years. I know there are some who may say it has taken too long, and there are others who will criticise the scheme and the processes, but we really must have a nationally consistent approach to redress so that survivors across Australia get equal access and treatment. But the states and institutions need to be on board to achieve this. We're continuing those discussions with the states in the hope that this can deliver the best outcomes for survivors.


The scheme will recognise and alleviate the impact of past child sexual abuse—it is hoped—that has occurred in those institutional contexts by providing three components: firstly, a monetary payment of up to $150,000 with an expected average payment of around $76,000 as a tangible means of recognising the wrong survivors have suffered; secondly, access to counselling and psychological services either through a lump sum payment or a state and territory based service, depending on where the survivor lives at the time of the application; and thirdly, a direct personal response to those survivors from the organisation where they had such harm inflicted on them from those participating institutions—that's if they request one.


A person will be eligible for redress under the scheme if they were sexually abused as a child before the scheme start date, if the abuse occurred inside a participating state or territory or outside Australia, if one or more participating institutions are responsible for the abuse and if the person is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident. New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory governments have announced their participation. It is hoped they will act as role models to the other states, so they also refer their powers to the Commonwealth. The Australian Capital Territory is not expected to refer because they can just be covered by the scheme.


Money will never compensate for the abuse that victims received. It's important also to know that the psychological and ongoing support they need is probably just as important as the payment, if not more so. In designing the blueprint for the Commonwealth redress scheme, we have exercised every available method and have endeavoured to give practical and operational effect to the recommendations of the royal commission. The Commonwealth redress scheme will not just be about facilitating individual monetary redress payments but it will be equally important that these payments across the scheme also provide emotional, mental and other support mechanisms to people who are survivors.


So as well as these monetary payments which are designed to provide some tangible recognition of their hurt and the harm that they have suffered, the Commonwealth scheme is also going to provide access to trauma informed and culturally-adapted counselling over the life of the scheme. The scheme will provide redress for a significant number of survivors—1,000 survivors in Commonwealth government institutions, 9,000 survivors in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 in Victorian government institutions and 200 in the ACT. That's an enormous number of children whose lives have been permanently changed, not always for the better. But some have come through that experience, grown and become amazing people.


Further survivors will be able to seek redress under the scheme as additional states and territories and non-government institutions opt in. The government is continuing negotiations with the remaining jurisdictions and non-government institutions to encourage their participation in the scheme. If all states and institutions across Australia opt in, the scheme could provide redress to around 60,000 people, which is the estimate provided by the Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse. It's an extraordinarily high number.


The Commonwealth continues to consult with states and non-government institutions on the development of the national bill in anticipation of state-referring powers under chapter 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution to allow survivors in state government institutions to be covered by the scheme from its commencement in July. The government will exercise every endeavour to make the reach of our scheme as broad as possible, with the ultimate point being to try and make the system that will operate across Australia as consistent as possible for each victim, each survivor, no matter where they were located.


Sadly, the abuse of children is not new and, even more tragically, child abuse hasn't disappeared overnight. My grandmother was born in 1899. She was fostered to a number of different homes. The only knowledge I have of this came from just two sources. She had a really nasty scar on her forehead and, as a curious child, I said, 'Grandma, what is that line on your forehead?' In her very deep and saddened response, she said one of her foster fathers had been very drunk one night and he threw a knife at her. The other source of her multiple family existence arrived after her death, by way of a bundle of photos handed over via my estranged uncle. Old, sepia, torn and tattered, but every family in the photograph was different. Some were clearly wealthy, some perhaps not so much. It's an intriguing past, I'm sure, but one I can't trace. The orphanage where my Gran was originally left, I'm told, was burnt down. I'm betting she wasn't the only child with a story to tell. Sexual abuse occurs today not just in institutions but in other social settings.


So I begin the end of this story by expressing my gratitude that institutional sexual abuse is being addressed by a redress scheme that will, in part, begin the healing process but also with sadness that the respect and care we should be demonstrating for all our children in any place, in any group and in any setting, seems to be fading from reality with political correctness and the retribution fear factor. We have a court system that is at best ineffective and at worst facilitating more abuse on more children. It has a lack of fortitude in punishing wrongdoers. Police fear to follow up, charge the offenders and pursue the right action because they believe the court system may not record a charge or it may not be successful.


I fear we're opening a Pandora's box of bad behaviour that is totally unacceptable. Surely it's not too much trouble to set the dignity and safety of a child above the inconvenience of bringing the issue to the attention of the court. I know of exactly such an incident. I am greatly concerned of the consequences that could evolve from the lack of action, or action that is not protective, or action that pushes the decision-making responsibility back onto the child. How can this be? Rape of a 12-year-old child is rape; whether inflicted by a physical instrument or biologically inflicted, it's wrong. Inside, I weep that, in this day and age, we still don't fully understand the term 'child sexual abuse'.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (12:22):  This week the Newcastle Magistrates Court convicted the Archbishop of Adelaide of concealing evidence of child sex abuse. Philip Wilson was the Bishop of Wollongong between 1997 and 2000. To my knowledge, he is the most senior Australian cleric to be convicted of such an offence. He should not be the last. Those who have covered up abuse and put the interests of their church and the reputation of their clerics above the suffering of abused children don't deserve the protection of either the congregation or the law.


Over five years the royal commission into child sex abuse established by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has heard evidence from more than 1,300 witnesses and held over 8,000 private sessions to listen to the person accounts of survivors. It has handled 42,000 calls and received 25,000 letters and emails. After 57 public hearings lasting 444 days, the commission has made over 2½ thousand referrals to law enforcement agencies. The inquiry that many said was unnecessary has shone a bright light into some of the darkest recesses of once inscrutable public institutions.


The establishment of the royal commission, and this national response, is a matter of deep personal interest and of great concern to the community that I represent. Wollongong is a wonderful city but it has also harboured more than its fair share of abusers. My years at Edmund Rice College in Wollongong during the late 1970s and early 1980s were mostly happy. There was a darker side, however. For many years the school had been a dumping ground for sex offenders.


We now know that there were many instances where brothers were moved from other schools in Sydney after complaints and allegations of sexual abuse had been made against them. One example was Brother Chris Roberts. He attended St Patrick's College in Sutherland between 1975 and 1977. He sexually abused children. Complaints were made. Instead of reporting him to the police he was moved to Saint Edmund's College in Canberra, where he taught boys between the seventies and eighties. He abused more children and there were more complaints. He was not reported to the police. Instead he was moved to my school in Wollongong.


In 2007 he was charged with 21 sexual offences over many, many years. He has admitted guilt to 11 of the 21 charges. He was but one of many of a community of sex offenders which included my principal, my form master, my parish priest and too many of the brothers who taught at my school. Many, many more were complicit in a culture of silence and cover-up. The impact it had on boys at my school cannot be underestimated, nor can the impact of denial and cover-ups that accompanied the original crimes and allowed them to be repeated in place after place and with victim after victim.


Upon the release of the royal commission's interim report in 2005, Labor, before the government, announced our support for the national redress schemes. These recommendations should be faithfully implemented. The scheme provides for three elements of redress: monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Applicants won't be limited to one form of redress. They'll be provided with access to support services and legal services if they accept an offer. They will also receive financial advice. Importantly, they will be required to sign a deed of release, waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution.


We compound the injustice visited upon the survivors if we think that this bill is the complete answer to decades of abuse. It is a good start, but the scheme does not go far enough. The bill establishes a scheme, but it only becomes operative if the states and territories, churches and other institutions agree to be bound and participate. It's encouraging that Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced they will participate. Today we call upon the other states, churches and institutes to follow.


The scheme has to be improved. We need more support services, and the cap on compensation is insufficient. The royal commission recommended a maximum of $200,000, a figure that many advocates thought was itself insufficient. This bill provides for only $150,000, which seems to me mean-spirited. The scheme is limited to Australian citizens without good reason. We of all people should know that matters of citizenship are not straightforward as we thought they once were. There are many child migrants who attended schools or who were forcibly institutionalised and suffered abuse, and they should not be excluded. The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. I simply point to the evidence that shows that many of the abused have found themselves up in a life of incarceration, and Labor believes this policy should be changed in that regard.


Because it's the faith in which I was raised, because it was where the majority of abuse came from and because I've known and spoken to so many survivors, I'd like to make some particular comments about the Catholic Church. At the request of the commission, the Catholic Church provided data on complaints, and the data is extraordinary. Between 1980 and 2015 alone, over 4,400 people alleged incidents relating to more than 1,000 separate institutions. Of the complainants, 78 per cent were male. Of the alleged perpetrators, 90 per cent were male. Sixty-two per cent of the perpetrators were priests or brothers. Seven per cent of all priests were perpetrators. Twenty per cent of all Marist Brothers and 22 per cent of all Christian Brothers were perpetrators. Can you imagine another institution in this country where close to one-quarter of its members were perpetrators? If that was any other institution in this country, there'd be calls to close it down. 11.7 per cent of priests from the diocese of Wollongong, 13.9 per cent of priests from the diocese of Lismore, 14 per cent of priests from the diocese of Port Pirie and 15 per cent of priests from the diocese of Sale were perpetrators. Five male religious orders—the Christian Brothers, the De La Salle Brothers, the Marist Brothers, the Patrician Brothers and the St John of God Brothers—represent more than 40 per cent of all claims made to Catholic Church authorities.


The first thing that strikes you about this data is the sheer immensity of the crimes. These are statistics, but behind the number stands an adult with vivid memories of their younger self—the moment when their faith, their trust and their body were abused by a person they were taught to revere. The second thing that is overwhelming about this is the sheer number of cases. These were instances where complaints were made and were documented by the church, but in the overwhelming number of cases no report was made to the police. The third thing that becomes obvious is that over 62 per cent of all perpetrators came from an order which imposed a vow of celibacy.


A scheme of redress must by necessity look backwards. That's what redress is all about. But this parliament must also look forward. We must say in clear and unadulterated words to the Catholic Church and other institutions: 'You must reform yourself. If you're imposing obligations upon your clerics that add to the risk of offence and impose a culture of secrecy, this must simply stop.' The rite of confession and the seal of the confessional is at the centre of this culture. It's where the faithful seek divine absolution from their sins through a genuine act of contrition. A confession is made, sins are counted and penance is applied. The practice is bound in confidentiality, known as the seal of the confessional. The priest must not disclose the details of the confession he has heard, even if they concern a serious crime like child sexual abuse. There can be no place in modern Australia where such an obligation is imposed. It is symbolic of the culture of secrecy and cover-up that has perpetuated generations of abuse. There are now many professions from healthcare workers, police officers and educators who have a mandatory obligation to report certain crimes, or even suspicions of certain crimes, because this is in the public interest and in the best interests of the child. Priests should be no different. If the church is to recover from the immense reputational damage it has suffered from the exposure of acts of hypocrisy and complicity in crimes against children then it must dispose of this anachronism.


That priests and brothers be celibate was not always the case in the church. In fact, it wasn't until the 12th century that it was seriously mandated, and it has not necessarily been honoured. It's time to rethink this practice as well. If 62 per cent of all perpetrators came from an order which imposed a vow of celibacy, it is right for us to ask in this place whether the practice is a part of the problem. In the hearings of the royal commission, the commissioners considered what role the vow of celibacy played in the occurrence of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. While there was some division of opinion among Australian bishops, evidence given showed them generally reluctant to concede that celibacy had a significant role to play in the sexual abuse of children. One bishop described it as simplistic. Most other authorities disagree. For example, when non-Catholic religious institutions accused of sexual abuse of children in their care were examined, it was rare that the abusers came from within their ministries. There is academic evidence which adds to the weight of this opinion. A report by two Melbourne academics, Desmond Cahill and Peter Wilkinson, published by RMIT last year, tackles what they call 'the scandal and tragedy of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church'. They emphasise the urgency of reform. They point out that the risk to children greatly increased 'if the child was in the pastoral care of a psychosexually immature, poorly prepared priest, unable to deal adequately with his sexual desires, his exercise of power and his obligations to chastity and celibacy'.


My church and many others have been robust contributors to social policy debates that we've had in this place, and I welcome that, even on the matters on which we deeply disagree. But this cannot be a one-way dialogue. This parliament is one forum where the public opinion can be raised, and the decision-makers within the church would do well to reflect on this if they are to regain an element of the respect and the prestige that they once enjoyed. I commend the bill to the House.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (12:35):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons. I had no idea that you would be in the chair when I came to rise.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  Neither did I!




Mr FALINSKI:
  But I want to say that, in my short time in this place, I've got to know you as the chair of the corporations committee and have discovered that you are a person of great talent, energy and capacity. Indeed, as the chair of a committee that includes the member for Burt and myself, you are a person with more patience than any human being should have to have! When people from time to time reflect on this place and say that we are somehow too narrow and that we have too many staffers, too many people who were union officials and, of course the worst sin of all, too many people who were lawyers, they should look at your speech on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, to see that this parliament does have a long and broad list of people with large experiences who bring many of those experiences to the business of this House.


The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard from thousands of survivors across Australia. Their stories opened our eyes to the prevalence of institutional child sexual abuse, the failures of institutions to respond and the lifelong impact it brings to bear. The findings and recommendations of the royal commission are powerful and far-reaching. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, their families and the organisations that represent them. Whether as children or adults, the reality is that for many years survivors were not listened to, were not believed or were not acknowledged. I thank them for their resilience and their determination to ensure that we all learn from the mistakes of the past and acknowledge the harm and suffering experienced by the many thousands of children who had been sexually abused in institutions where they should have been safe. No child should ever experience what some of these children endured. They were abused by the very people charged with their care and protection, and let us be clear: that is a disgrace. The establishment of the national redress scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was and is wrong.


I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the New South Wales government and its most excellent Attorney-General, Mark Speakman, for being the first state to opt in and already legislate for the scheme, along with a raft of new offences. The national redress scheme recognises the suffering survivors have experienced, accepts that these events occurred and states that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse. The government acknowledged the need to provide public recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors and investigate the inadequate responses provided by institutions through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The royal commission estimated that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. The psychological, physical and emotional injuries affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm.


The establishment of the national redress scheme is the most significant step in addressing the wrongs of the past and providing an overdue response to survivors. It is also an important step towards healing. It ensures that governments and institutions take steps to safeguard against these crimes being repeated in the future. This bill package will establish the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. From 1 July 2018 the scheme will provide redress where a Commonwealth institution or a New South Wales, Victorian or Australian Capital Territory government institution is responsible for the child sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse which occurred before the date of the scheme's commencement. This bill will also allow other state and territory governments and non-government institutions, such as churches or sporting clubs, to voluntarily participate in the scheme on a responsible-entity-pays basis. The remaining state governments will need to adopt the Commonwealth law for the scheme to apply in those jurisdictions and for non-government institutions to provide redress where abuse has occurred in a state.


Passage of these bills will enable the Commonwealth government to respond to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse redress recommendations by developing a best-practice redress scheme for survivors. The scheme will start on 1 July 2018 and run for 10 years. The scheme will recognise and alleviate the impact of past child sexual abuse that has occurred in an institutional context, by providing three components of redress: a monetary payment of up to $150,000, with an expected average payment of around $76,000, as a tangible means of recognising the wrong that survivors have suffered; access to counselling and psychological services through either a lump sum payment or state or territory based services, depending on where the survivor lives at the time of their application; and a direct personal response to survivors from the responsible participating institutions, should the survivor request one. A person will be eligible for redress under the scheme if the person was sexual abused as a child before the scheme start date; the abuse occurred inside a participating state, inside a territory or outside Australia; one or more participating institutions are responsible for the abuse; and the person is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident.


As I mentioned earlier, the New South Wales government along with the Victorian and Australian Capital Territory governments have announced their participation in the scheme. New South Wales and Victoria will refer their powers so that they can participate and the abuse occurring in their jurisdiction—that is, by non-government institutions—can be covered by the scheme. The Australian Capital Territory is not required to refer powers in order to participate or to allow abuse in its jurisdiction to be covered by the scheme.


The scheme will provide redress for a significant number of survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. There are an estimated 1,000 survivors of abuse in Commonwealth government institutions, 9,000 survivors of abuse in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 survivors of abuse in Victorian government institutions and 200 survivors of abuse in Australian Capital Territory institutions. Further survivors will be able to seek redress under the scheme as additional states and territories and non-government institutions opt in. The government is continuing negotiations with the remaining jurisdictions and non-government institutions to encourage their participation in the scheme. Redress payments will be exempt from Commonwealth debt recovery and income tests related to government payments and will be non-taxable and reflective of the severity and impact of the abuse experienced. Redress support services will be available with the scheme to provide timely access to trauma informed and culturally appropriate support for people during the application process. The scheme will also provide access to free specialist legal support services and financial counselling.


The royal commission released its Redress and civil litigation report in November 2015. In that report it recommended a single national redress scheme. The government is demonstrating leadership by responding to the royal commission's redress recommendations and establishing a best-practice redress scheme. A national redress scheme with an option for states and territories to participate on the responsible-entity-pays basis recommended by the royal commission is the best way of seeking to ensure that survivors across Australia will be able to gain redress on an equal basis. While New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have committed to the scheme from commencement, the government is continuing to negotiate with the remaining states and institutions to ensure maximum coverage.


In line with the royal commission's recommendations, an independent advisory council was formed in December 2016 to provide significant input on the design and operation of the scheme. The council brought together people with expertise from a range of backgrounds, including survivors and their supporters, as well as experts on legal, psychological and redress issues. The council provided advice to ensure the scheme meets the needs of survivors. A single national redress scheme can only be established with full cooperative legislative action of the Commonwealth and states. The surest way is by referral of powers under the Constitution. States must refer powers to allow non-government institutions within their jurisdictions to opt in to a national scheme. On 10 May 2018, the Australian government introduced legislation to create the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. The scheme will begin this year, on 1 July, subject to passage of legislation and will provide access to the psychological counselling so needed, a direct personal response from the responsible institution for people who want it and a monetary payment. If all institutions and state governments across Australia opt in, the scheme could provide redress to around 60,000 people estimated by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to have been abused in institutions. The Commonwealth continues to consult with states and non-government institutions on the development of a national bill in anticipation of a state referring powers as allowed under the Constitution. All survivors and state government institutions will be covered by the scheme from its commencement in July 2018. The governments of Western Australia and South Australia are the only two states yet to formally announce that they will join the redress scheme. If a state or territory does not opt in to the scheme, the Australian government will seek sufficient referral of powers to enable non-government institutions to opt in to the scheme.


To receive redress, the person must accept the offer and, in doing so, release all responsible participating institutions from any liability for sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse covered by the scheme. The redress scheme was designed in close consultation with state and territory governments, an independent advisory council and non-government institutions. Abuse that occurred outside Australia is within the scope of the scheme, so long as the participating institution is responsible for the abuse and the person meets other citizenship requirements at the time of application. The decision to exclude those found guilty of serious crimes was reached in consultation with state and territory governments.


Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, I think it only right to recognise your role in bringing this legislation to the House and to congratulate you for it. I commend this bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member. The question is that this bill be now read a second time. If the member for Isaacs will just indulge me, as I'm just about the leave the chair, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the current Attorney-General in his time as the Minister for Social Services and the enormous amount of work he did in consultation with me during this process—also to the current member for finalising the work that the previous social services minister did. Thank you, Member for Isaacs.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (12:49):  In speaking about justice, Martin Luther King once said, with characteristic eloquence:


Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Every step towards the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering and struggle, the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse provides a potent example of the tireless exertions and passionate concern in the pursuit of justice that Mr King described. That royal commission was announced by Prime Minister Julia Gillard in November 2012 and was established in January 2013. I'm proud of many of the things the Gillard government achieved, but I feel that the royal commission will be shown to be one of the government's more important initiatives—an initiative that, in addressing the most appalling of injustices, will have a lasting benefit for the Australian community. The royal commission we announced was led by six royal commissioners—the Honourable Justice Peter McClellan AM; Mr Bob Atkinson AO, APM; Justice Jennifer Coate; Mr Robert Fitzgerald AM; Professor Helen Milroy; and Mr Andrew Murray. Mr King's reference to the 'tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals' could have been written for those six commissioners whose work over the five years of the royal commission was truly herculean. Through their efforts, some of which will be brought into effect by these bills now before the House, a measure of justice will be delivered to tens of thousands of people who have suffered the most grievous injustice.


During the five-year course of the royal commission, it handled over 42,000 calls, almost 26,000 letters and emails, and held just over 8,000 private sessions with survivors of child sexual abuse. The final report of the commission comprising 17 volumes was delivered to the Governor-General on 15 December last year. The Turnbull government has said that it will respond to that report next month.


Labor, the survivors and their families, along with the wider Australian community, look forward to seeing that response, because how we as a nation respond to the recommendations of the royal commission is of critical importance. Because while the royal commission has concluded its investigations, finished its hearings and delivered its final report, the work of delivering justice to the survivors of child sexual abuse is very far from completed. And so too the work of ensuring that our children are protected from the horror of sexual abuse in institutions, such as churches and schools, is in no way completed by the delivery of the commission's final report; rather, the protection of children from sexual abuse in the future will depend on the extent to which the Commonwealth, state and territory governments are willing to invest the effort and resources required to fulfil the 409 recommendations the royal commission has made.


Sadly, we have seen the recommendations of other royal commissions developed through years of tireless work and the most extensive consultations languish without proper implementation. It is my very sincere hope that such a lack of commitment does not compromise the tremendous work done by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and that its recommendations are fully implemented, which brings me to the subject matter of these two bills, the national redress scheme.


Paragraph (d) of the letters patent establishing the royal commission called on the commission to answer the following question:


(d) what institutions and governments should do to address, or alleviate the impact of, past and future child sexual abuse and related matters in institutional contexts, including, in particular, in ensuring justice for victims through the provision of redress by institutions, processes for referral for investigation and prosecution and support services.


In September 2015 the royal commission released its final report on redress and civil litigation. This redress report contained the commission's concluded view on the question of redress. The commission issued that report more than two years ahead of its final report because it said:


By reporting as early as possible on these issues, we are seeking to give survivors and institutions more certainty on these issues and enable governments and institutions to implement our recommendations to improve civil justice for survivors as soon as possible.


In keeping with this sense of urgency, one of the recommendations in the redress report was that:


The Australian Government should determine and announce by the end of 2015 that it is willing to establish a single national redress scheme.


And that the national scheme be:


… ready to begin inviting and accepting applications from survivors by no later than 1 July 2017.


It's deeply regrettable that the previous Attorney-General, the former Senator Brandis, showed absolutely no interest in doing the work required to establish a national redress scheme, as evidenced by the fact that he did next to nothing to comply with the royal commission's recommendations and deadlines while survivors of child sexual abuse waited patiently for justice to at last be done. However, with responsibility for redress taken from Senator Brandis and given to other ministers in the government, negotiations began with the states and territories, and survivors finally began to see some forward motion.


Now this legislation is before the House that will at last implement a national redress scheme. That scheme will be operational a full year after the deadline that the royal commission set, but nevertheless it is a step forward in delivering justice to survivors. For this reason, and subject to some serious concerns I will set out now, Labor will be supporting the bills in this House. However, we will be carefully considering the recommendations of the Senate committee's inquiries into the scheme when it reports on 15 June, and we will be reserving our position in the other place until that occurs. In the meantime, we will continue to negotiate on a number of outstanding issues of concern with the government in good faith.


With that said, I will now briefly address some of our outstanding concerns about the redress scheme set out in this legislation. The very first recommendation in the redress report is titled 'Justice for victims'. It is important that we do not lose sight of this fundamental point: the redress scheme is at its core about delivering justice to survivors of the most hideous crimes against them. That first recommendation states:


A process for redress must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors – regardless of the location, operator, type, continued existence or assets of the institution in which they were abused – if it is to be regarded by survivors as being capable of delivering justice.


Recommendation 2 sets out the three foundations by which the proposed redress scheme would provide justice. It states:


Appropriate redress for survivors should include the elements of:


a. direct personal response


b. counselling and psychological care


c. monetary payments.


The primary concerns we in Labor have about the redress scheme the Turnbull government has put forward relate to the failure of the scheme to properly provide for the second and third elements and the significant gaps between what is provided for in this scheme and what was recommended by the royal commission.


I will deal with the requirement of counselling and psychological care first, because the failure of the scheme set out in this bill to comply with the royal commission's recommendations in relation to ongoing counselling and psychological care concerns me most. Recommendation 9 states:


Counselling and psychological care should be supported through redress in accordance with the following principles:


a. Counselling and psychological care should be available throughout a survivor's life.


b. Counselling and psychological care should be available on an episodic basis.


c. Survivors should be allowed flexibility and choice in relation to counselling and psychological care.


d. There should be no fixed limits on the counselling and psychological care provided to a survivor.


The redress report also states:


It is clear that many survivors will need counselling and psychological care from time to time throughout their lives. At times, a survivor may need very intensive therapy and support. At other times, a survivor may go for years without needing counselling or psychological care.


…   …   …


Survivors told us in private sessions and public hearings about the severe and sometimes lifelong impact that institutional child sexual abuse can have across all of these areas of life.


We have been given many examples of the severe impacts that untreated trauma of institutional child sexual abuse has had on survivors. We have had a number of private sessions with relatives of victims of institutional child sexual abuse who have committed suicide. Their relatives have told us of the terrible impact that the abuse had on the victims and the ongoing impact that the abuse and victims' suicides has had on their families.


Recommendation 11 deals with the need for ongoing care by explicitly stating:


Redress should fund counselling and psychological care as needed by survivors rather than providing a lump sum payment to survivors for their future counselling and psychological care needs.


The redress scheme set out in this bill directly contradicts those explicit recommendations of the royal commission and, instead, provides for a lump sum payment for counselling and psychological services. This is cause enough for concern, but it is of even greater concern to us that the maximum amount of the lump sum payment that will be available is $5,000. To put this amount in perspective, the Australian Psychological Society's current recommended schedule of fees sets the standard fee for a 45-60 minute consultation at $246. That means that a survivor who received the maximum redress payment for counselling of psychological services and who paid a standard fee to a psychologist for individual sessions would be able to pay for approximately 20 sessions with a registered psychologist.


The royal commission consulted extensively with survivors, their families and mental health experts in making its recommendations, and, given that it has recommended the need to provide for psychological care on an ongoing basis when it is required for the survivor's life, it is very concerning that a decision has been made to instead provide a lump sum payment of up to $5,000 for a lifetime of psychological care. That is 20 sessions only, even for survivors of the worst kinds of child sexual abuse, to last them for the rest of their lives. Of course, it's true that some survivors may not seek psychological support at all, but some survivors who will make claims for redress will need far more than the $5,000 on offer under this scheme. Some may still be teenagers with many years of psychological struggle ahead of them. In ignoring the explicit recommendations of the royal commission for lifetime care in this context and instead proposing a maximum lump sum of $5,000, the government was obviously not informed by any kind of medical evidence.


The royal commission also recommended that a range of changes be made to Medicare to help provide for rest-of-life psychological care to survivors of child sexual abuse. It may be that the government is intending to act on those recommendations to fill the gap in care this scheme creates. If that is the case, I look forward to seeing those changes.


I turn now to the second issue of concern: the quantum of monetary payments. The royal commission recommended that the maximum level of monetary payment for the most severe cases of child sexual abuse should be $200,000. The commission reached this conclusion after careful deliberation and extensive evidence regarding the appropriate monetary payment to provide tangible recognition of the seriousness of the hurt and injury suffered by a survivor. While payments under the redress scheme are not meant to be compensatory in the same way that damages from a civil claim against an abuser would be, I note that survivors of the most heinous forms of child sexual abuse have been recovering in excess of $1 million in civil actions against their abusers. In this context, the decision of the Turnbull government to reduce the maximum amount payable to survivors of the most serious forms of child sexual abuse to $150,000 is deeply disappointing to Labor, as I'm sure it will be to many survivors. How is it that the Turnbull government has no problem finding $80 billion to give to big businesses in tax cuts—including $17 billion just to the banks, which already make billions of dollars in profit a year and pay their executives multimillion dollar bonuses—but says it has no choice but to short-change the survivors of childhood sexual abuse?


The third issue I want to raise is the question of who will step in to make payments to survivors when no-one else is liable—the so-called funder of last resort. Once again, the royal commission was explicit on this matter and recommended that the Commonwealth, as well as state and territory governments, should act as funders of last resort to ensure that no survivor eligible for the scheme is left without a source of redress. It appears from this bill that these recommendations may not have been fully implemented, and there remain questions over who a survivor will be able to seek redress from if the institution in which they were abused is no longer in existence and had no links to government. It's my expectation that any gaps of this kind will be addressed as the scheme is rolled out so that no survivor eligible for redress is left unable to seek it.


In conclusion, I once again thank the royal commissioners and all of those involved in the commission's work for their tireless efforts. While the redress scheme provided for in these bills is late and falls short in some important respects from the scheme recommended by the royal commission, I have no doubt that it will provide a measure of justice to survivors, and I commend both bills to the House.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (13:04):  I too thank the member for Swan not only for his eloquent and moving speech in the House today but for his long-term advocacy on behalf of all Australians who suffered institutional child sex abuse. Having reviewed some of the member for Swan's contributions on this topic going right back to his maiden speech, I know that he has been a passionate, committed and effective champion for the cause of redress for many years. It is gratifying to see him have the opportunity to speak today as part of this landmark step forward for survivors. The member for Swan and I, and some other colleagues, just a couple of nights ago were reflecting that one of the advantages of being in this role is to be able to make meaningful change where it is needed.


I know that all of us were shocked and disturbed by the seemingly endless flood of terrible stories which emerged throughout the hearings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. In fact, an ex-colleague of mine was involved in representing certain people at the royal commission. He was a gentleman who had spent many years as a detective and many years as a criminal barrister. He would tell me that sitting in and listening to what was going on in these hearings made him physically ill. For a man who had spent much of his life dealing with very unsavoury parts of today's society to have said that speaks volumes.


In total, the royal commission handled 42,000 phone calls and almost 26,000 letters and emails and held 57 public hearings all over Australia. In addition, it spoke to around 8,000 additional individuals as part of its private sessions. Along with my colleagues in the House, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the survivors who took part in this process and courageously told their stories describing the devastating impact of the abuse they have suffered.


As we rightly focus on the suffering of survivors today, I'd like to ask members of the House and anyone watching today's proceedings to spare a thought also for the commissioners—the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, the Hon. Justice Jennifer Coate, Bob Atkinson, Robert Fitzgerald, Helen Milroy, Andrew Murray—and senior counsel assisting, Gail Furness SC, and all other support staff. I know from my past life as a barrister that to hear and review, in their case, so many thousands of harrowing stories and to relive those experiences face-to-face with so many thousands of survivors must've been exceptionally difficult for them and indeed their families. It will most definitely have taken a heavy toll on these men and women. We too often forget the psychological impact that working with survivors of trauma can have on our emergency services personnel, our counsellors and our legal officers. The commission and the staff did Australia and all survivors an important and exceedingly challenging service, and I hope and trust that they too are receiving the support that they need going into the future.


The royal commission identified a staggering 4,000 institutions where abuse took place—from schools to sporting clubs. To date, 2575 referrals, from a broad range of institutions, have been made to police. Of particular personal concern to me is the prominent place of the Catholic Church in these shocking statistics. On 6 February 2017, counsel assisting, Gail Furness SC, submitted a research report to the commission as an exhibit. The report resulted from research conducted by the royal commission supported by the Truth, Justice and Healing Council, which is the Catholic Church's body for coordinating the response to the royal commission, and Catholic Church authorities. It sought to estimate the number of priests and non-ordained religious members of the church authorities who were alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse in at least one claim reported between 1980 and 2010, with incidences stretching back to 1950.


The figures made for horrible reading, though we should remember that they relate to allegations of misconduct and not to proven findings of guilt. In that report, 1,880 alleged perpetrators involved in the Catholic Church were identified in claims of child sexual abuse. In total, 4,444 people alleged child sexual abuse incidents. Of the alleged perpetrators, 30 per cent, or 572, were priests, 693 were non-ordained religious brothers or sisters, and 543 were laypeople. This means that, in Australia, seven per cent of all priests are estimated to have been identified in a claim. Tragically, the average age of male victims was 11½ years old, while for girls it was just 10½.


The data likely underestimates the number of perpetrators. It includes only cases where the complainant came forward and actually made a complaint. As we know well, many do not. It also includes only claims where the claimant sought redress or where the complaints were accepted by the Catholic Church without redress being sought. Unfortunately, we know that, until recently, in too many cases the Catholic Church did not accept complaints and did not act to deal with alleged perpetrators. Gail Furness SC put it very succinctly and comprehensively when she said:


The accounts were depressingly similar. Children were ignored or worse, punished. Allegations were not investigated. Priests and religious were moved. The parishes or communities to which they were moved knew nothing of their past. Documents were not kept or they were destroyed. Secrecy prevailed as did cover ups. Priests and religious were not properly dealt with and outcomes were often not representative of their crimes. Many children suffered and continued as adults to suffer from their experiences in some Catholic institutions.


We heard a stark reminder just two days ago of that attitude with the conviction of Philip Wilson, the Archbishop of Adelaide. The archbishop ignored the 15-year-old Peter Creigh in 1976 when he told the then assistant parish priest about his abuse at the hands of Father Jim Fletcher. I understand that the archbishop is now facing a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, which arguably demonstrates the seriousness with which we should, and do, treat the nature of his actions. Had Archbishop Wilson informed the police of the allegations against Jim Fletcher, it would perhaps have helped to convict the priest more than a decade earlier and prevented further abuse from taking place. It seems likely that Archbishop Wilson's conviction will prompt further prosecutions, and we can look forward with optimism to the hope that this will dissuade individuals in the future from failing to report abuse.


Though the Catholic Church's past record in this area is disgraceful and difficult for Catholics like me to understand, it is, of course, sadly not unique. Out-of-home care institutions, sports clubs, recreation and hobby groups, other religious groups, and even schools and youth detention centres have been implicated in failures to prevent or properly deal with incidents of child sexual abuse.


Since the royal commission's report, the attention of the government and of the Catholic Church has rightly turned to the question of redress for victims. Redress is not simply about financial compensation. After all, no amount of money can change what happened to survivors or take away its impacts. Redress should be founded on two key principles: on the one hand, recognising the suffering of survivors and, on the other, helping them both to assimilate the experiences of their past and to build a better life in the future.


As the royal commission rightly identified, to achieve this, redress should have three elements. Though money cannot change the past, it is appropriate, first, that redress include monetary compensation. These payments constitute only a material recognition by the institutions involved of their wrongdoing and their contrition but it also provides funds which can help survivors create new opportunities or improve the comfort of lives often blighted by abuse. The redress scheme in this bill meets this requirement by including awards of redress payments of up to a maximum of $150,000 for each survivor, dependent on the level of sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse.


Second, redress should include counselling and psychological care to help support survivors with the mental health impacts of their experiences. Once again, the redress scheme in this bill meets that requirement by making survivors whose applications are accepted entitled to access counselling services where offered by their jurisdiction. Where their jurisdiction is not registered to provide these services, survivors will be entitled to a further payment of up to $5,000.


Third, the royal commission identified that a redress scheme must include a direct personal response from the institution to the survivor. This bill enables that by giving all survivors whose applications are accepted the right to a personal response. The survivor will be given the opportunity to tell the story of their abuse and describe its impact on them. They'll be entitled to receive, as appropriate, an apology, an acknowledgement of the impact of the abuse on the person, an opportunity to meet with an appropriately senior person from the relevant institution and an assurance as to the steps the institution now takes to protect children in their care against abuse.


Because of the comprehensive and appropriate design I've described, I support the redress scheme encapsulated in this bill and I support the principles that lie behind it. However, I must use this opportunity to remind the future national redress scheme operator and its delegates of its heavy responsibility. In most processes involving claims of compensation or redress, the initial decision is subject to further independent or judicial review where requested on reasonable grounds. This process in general ensures the integrity of the system and helps to prevent injustices. In this case, it is the operator, the secretary of the department and their designated delegates who will make the decision, while only an internal review conducted by an official with no involvement in the original decision will be available to applicants. In order to keep the scheme focused on the needs of survivors and avoid them being dragged into lengthy or adversarial court proceedings which risk further harm, merits review in the AAT or judicial review in the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court will not be available to either survivors or participating institutions. For participating institutions, there is no process of review.


Those measures are part of this bill for the right reasons and are an important means of ensuring that the redress scheme is focused on the needs of survivors. We must continue to adhere to the principles of fairness and equity for all institutions and ensure as far as possible that accepted applications provide redress to bona fide survivors. Without this, not only will the scheme be at risk of perpetrating its own injustices and hurt the interests of people who continue to rely on many of these institutions today, but its credibility with the public would come into question. I would ask that the operators remember this weighty responsibility and bear it in mind in all of their deliberations.


To date, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT and the Commonwealth have all signed up to the redress scheme, and I understand from reports in The Australian newspaper that the Catholic Church, among other institutions, is working behind the scenes to join. If we can persuade all of the states and territories and institutions to opt in, this scheme would offer meaningful redress based on the right principles to the around 60,000 people estimated by the royal commission to have been abused in institutions. For that reason and for the sake of all of the survivors who's courageously testified before the royal commission, I commend the bill to the House.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-24,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (12:34):  So much emotion, so much wrong to be righted and so much courage. In my speech today, I would like to acknowledge, honour and thank all those responsible for the royal commission: its inception, its operation, its administration and the delivery of the report. I'd particularly like to, as many of my colleagues have done, acknowledge the role of CLAN: Care Leavers Australasia Network. I'd also like to shine some light on the impact of the royal commission in my electorate of Indi; focus on redress, which we've been hearing about now; say that the job's not finished, that there's still more work to be done; and talk about one particular model that's been undertaken by the Victorian Women's Trust in this area. In conclusion, I'd like to offer my personal apology to the people of Indi and to those who have been hurt and have suffered pain because of the work of the churches and the institutions that we are all responsible for.


With that beginning, I'd like to start by talking about the Care Leavers Australasia Network. I thank people in my electorate, but particularly Rhonda and her team. As she has done with many members of parliament, she came and saw us, raised the issue, made sure we understood how important it was, kept us informed all the way through the royal commission and made sure that we knew what was going on. It's hard to find words to capture my admiration: courage, resilience, persistence, empathy, tolerance, more courage and patience. One of the things that Rhonda did, knowing that I would be making a speech today, was ask me to read this into the Hansard. It's a letter to 'My dear federal politician'. The heading is, 'Stop taxing the poorest of abuse victims'. It says:


I'm a member of CLAN and I was placed in an orphanage, children's home, foster care mission, and I am writing to you to seek your support to make representations on my behalf to the Prime Minister of all Australians, Malcolm Turnbull, CLAN patron. The national redress scheme is due to commence on 1 July. Whilst we commend the Liberal government for introducing national redress for those abused in orphanages, children's homes, missions and foster care, there are, however, many care leavers who will be extremely disadvantaged, angry and hurt on 1 July because they were not sexually used or abused in an orphanage, children's home, mission, foster care but suffered great cruelty and brutal physical and psychological damage as children. These care leavers, who have received as little as $2,000 redress from the Queensland, Western Australian and Tasmanian governments redress schemes will now be taxed on those payments at 1.9 per cent. This is like robbing the poorest of abuse victims, the government's children. None of these care leavers ever expected that government to tax those paltry amounts decades later. The Prime Minister plans on issuing an apology on behalf of the nation. This will be a hollow apology when so many care leavers will be excluded and reabused and retraumatised by this unjust redress scheme.


So we're not quite done yet.


The second area that I'd like to talk a little bit about is the impact on my electorate of this horrendous activity that's taken place in Australia. We've heard the figures from the royal commission about the size of the problem, but the bit that I'd like to concentrate on, again so sadly, is the Catholic Church and the Sandhurst diocese. The Sandhurst diocese is based in Bendigo, in Victoria, covers most of Indi and also includes the electorates of Murray and Bendigo. I will read from the Bendigo Advertiserof 6 February 2017. It says:


THE Sandhurst Diocese had the second highest rate of priests accused of child sexual abuse out of Australia's 17 Catholic dioceses during a 60 year period.


Figures released from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse showed almost 15 per cent of priests who ministered in the Sandhurst Diocese between 1950 and 2010 were accused of child sexual offences.


…   …   …


The diocese was second only to the Diocese of Sale …


I make this point because we've heard much about Ballarat but we've heard very little about Sandhurst and Sale. Sandhurst:


The diocese was second only to the Diocese of Sale for the proportion of priests alleged to have sexually abused children between 1950 and 2010.


Proportionately, more priests allegedly committed offences in Sandhurst than the Ballarat Diocese, where the Royal Commission sat to hear evidence from residents and former students …


There's something that's so sad about this for me, because Ballarat is a large city. It's got a lot of people in it. Poor old Sandhurst is a rural country electorate, and Sale similarly. So I think what happened is that these priests and brothers and others got sent to the country, and we poor, almost defenceless country communities had nowhere to go. We didn't have the advocacy, we didn't have the knowledge and we became a place for this. I just think it's so sad, particularly with the passion I bring to this parliament for rural and regional Australia. When I see it borne out in these statistics, it makes me even more sad to think the institutionalised church would do that.


But clearly it's not all negative. I'm really relieved that the Sandhurst Diocese says that there were no incidents after 2000, and no priests employed after 1990 were accused of any offences. So the vast majority of offences occurred during my growing-up years, the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In talking about Sandhurst, I probably need to keep the record straight, because the current Bishop of Sandhurst, Bishop Leslie Tomlinson, has apologised to victims and survivors of sexual abuse. He said that it was very sad that it happened and that the church will make amends, and he commits to working with victims, survivors and their families into the future. So that's really good to see, but somehow it doesn't take away the stain. It doesn't take away the lack of trust. It doesn't take away the hurt. So this redress scheme is really important.


I'd like to talk a little bit about redress. I welcome the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Fisher, about monetary compensation—the lump sum—about financial support, about apology and about assurances regarding cessation of alleged perpetrators' position. I'm really pleased to know that that's included in the legislation.


But, in my research to try to understand better the impact of the Catholic Church on my community, I've found it hasn't just stopped with child sexual abuse. There have been other sorts of abuses that have taken place. I'd now like to turn my mind to a submission to the royal commission from the Victorian Women's Trust, dated 9 March 2015. I'll read from the submission:


… over the past six years, we have been intimately involved in seeking redress for women who were former members of religious Orders. We began this journey with some published research. We then designed an Independent Advocacy Program. In the time since, we have successfully sought appropriate redress on behalf of many women religious.


From this significant advocacy experience, we believe we can offer some insight into the broader question of institutional culture and impact on victims as well as adding value to the consideration of key elements that must be involved in ensuring effective redress of past abuse and harm.


Their research culminated in the publication in 2009 of a research and discussion paper entitled The paradox of service. There is much wisdom, I have to say, in that report, and I'm extraordinarily grateful to the Victorian Women's Trust for the work that they've done in supporting nuns who have left the orders. I will turn my mind to the considerations they talk about in The paradox of service and in their submission about redress. They say, and I will quote from their three issues for consideration:


We support the statement of general principles (p.57) to guide the provision of all elements to redress—survivor‐focused; no wrong door; cultural needs of survivors including proper training and understanding; and redress that needs the needs of particularly vulnerable survivors.


And they talk about having a champion in your corner.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (13:30):  Last week, the Turnbull government announced the rollout of phase 2 of My Health Record. The rollout means that every Australian's private health information will be stored online unless they opt out. Previous audits have shown a number of government agencies have failed when it comes to being cyber-resilient. The Department of Health, unfortunately, has not yet been audited to check if it is cyber-resilient and neither has the Australian Digital Health Agency, although I am heartened that the agency has got a cybersecurity centre. So I'm saying to the Prime Minister: let's talk about the cyber-resilience of My Health Record. Is the Department of Health cyber-resilient? Is the Australian Digital Health Agency cyber-resilient? Do they comply with ASD's mandated Top 4 mitigation strategies? Do they comply with the Essential Eight? What about access to data? What about the computers in every health professional's surgery, clinic and centre across Australia?


Last year's WannaCry attack on the National Health Service proved that the networks that aren't cybersecure down the supply chain are the biggest vulnerability to our systems. So I ask the Prime Minister: are there cybersecurity standards that are being applied to every part of the supply chain? For the Australian people to have faith in this system, the government must assure them that the Department of Health and the Australian Digital Health Agency are cyber-resilient.

The SPEAKER
 (15:12):  Could I please have the attention of the House on this important matter: I'd like to read a fairly lengthy statement, and then I'll be tabling some documents. Earlier in the week, I advised the House I would provide an update on possible dates for by-elections in the seats of Braddon, Fremantle, Longman, Mayo and Perth. This update follows further consultation with the Australian Electoral Commissioner and party leaders. Under the Constitution, it is my responsibility alone to issue a writ for a by-election when a vacancy occurs, and generally it has not been the practice to provide an explanation for the exercise of this responsibility. I have varied from the usual practice because of the quite unusual—quite unique—circumstances surrounding these by-elections.


As the House of Representatives Practice makes clear, there is no statutory period within which I must issue the writ. As a matter of principle, Speakers have generally sought to issue writs as soon as electorally practicable to ensure that electors are not without a representative here in the House for longer than necessary. However, the timing of the calling of each by-election has varied considerably because of circumstances, and in this case there has been a unique set of circumstances.


While there has been much commentary around the five by-elections occurring on the one day, the Australian Electoral Commission actually has to consider whether this is feasible and desirable. The advice I have received from the Electoral Commissioner is that although this is the largest number of by-elections to be conducted at the one time since Federation, and the holding of them across four states adds complexity, the AEC believes conducting the by-elections on the one day is the preferred option. I intend to follow this preferred option.


As noted in my statement on Monday, the Electoral Commissioner advised me that the government was considering urgent changes through regulation to the nomination process to ensure that all candidates are aware of their obligations under section 44 of the Constitution. The implementation of these changes prior to the by-elections was supported by the Electoral Commissioner and by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in a unanimous recommendation. The latest advice I have from the Electoral Commissioner is that the regulations have been signed by the Special Minister of State and will be submitted to the Governor-General soon for his consideration, expected to be 29 May. Regardless of the date for submission to the Federal Executive Council, the AEC has advised me that it has commenced preparations to implement the regulations and will require approximately two weeks to do so. The implementation would need to be complete prior to the writs being issued.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I say to members: I'm giving this update as a courtesy—members on my right—and it would be in all their interests to listen to the entire statement. Let me repeat: the implementation would need to be complete prior to the writs being issued, because nominations open as soon as writs are issued, at which time candidates can start nominating. This is, in part, to accommodate the requirements of the Electoral Commission but, more importantly, so that all candidates in the forthcoming by-election—all candidates—have sufficient time to comply with the new requirements.


Turning now to the date for the by-elections, the Electoral Commissioner has advised me that there is a complication of the school holiday period affecting all four states subject to by-elections, extending across a three-week period from 30 June to 21 July. Although, as the commissioner advises, it is possible to hold by-elections in the school holiday period, it does create additional difficulties for voters and risks disenfranchisement and low turnout. Let me say this is particularly—particularly—the case in by-elections, for, whilst in a general election there are significant absentee voting opportunities outside the electorate in which a voter resides, in by-elections there are not. If there is to be a single date for all by-elections and the school holidays are to be avoided, this pushes the next possible date to 28 July. Although the Electoral Commission—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Members on both sides! Members on my right! The member for Bendigo! I say to those members interjecting: the majority of members are seeking to listen to my statement. Although the Electoral Commission would not usually provide advice about a preferred date, I can advise members on this occasion the Electoral Commissioner has advised that 28 July is the optimal date. As the commissioner notes in his advice to me: 'This achieves three things. It provides sufficient time for the AEC to implement the changes'—



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Isaacs is warned. The commissioner's advice states: 'It allows sufficient time for the AEC to implement the changes, enables prospective candidates to comply with the new requirements and ensures that voters are not disenfranchised.' I consider it is prudent in the current circumstances that I follow this advice and allow time for the changes related to section 44 to be implemented and avoid the by-elections taking place in the school holidays. I, therefore, propose to accept the commissioner's recommendation for the optimal date of 28 July. I will consult with the AEC about the date to issue the writs and the relevant dates for the by-elections and will advise the House when the dates have been settled.


One very important consideration for me has been that this will not impact on the elected members' ability to take up their seats in the House at the earliest opportunity because of the break in the sittings from 28 June until 13 August. The earliest date that any elected members could now take their seats regardless of the date for the by-elections is the resumption of the sittings on 13 August. Because of the particular nature of the issues surrounding these by-elections, I'm going to table the advice I've received from the Electoral Commissioner. There are two pieces of correspondence from the Electoral Commissioner, one dated 17 May 2018 and a further, updated letter of 23 May 2018, and this is not a precedent for the tabling of such advice by Speakers in the future.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, during your remarks, the member for Barton made a very unparliamentary remark, and she should withdraw it.



Mr Burke interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I say to the Manager of Opposition Business: the majority of members were listening. Some were interjecting and, surprisingly, not wanting to hear the statement or the reasons, but I have read them into the Hansard and the correspondence has been tabled. I couldn't hear what the member for Barton was particularly saying but I will ask her, as is the custom, whether she made an unparliamentary remark. The Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (15:21):  On indulgence, I'd like to note a few things about the decision, respecting the fact that the decision is not only made by you in terms of the advice that you have received from the Australian Electoral Commission, and ask that my comments be seen very much in that context. There are a number of by-elections which have occurred since you took the chair. In North Sydney, the writs were issued within three days; in Bennelong, two days; in New England, the same day; in Batman, six days. It will now be, for these by-elections, a delay of 14 days and, instead of the people going to vote 35, 36 or 44 days later, they will go to vote 79 days later.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Isaacs will leave under 94(a).




The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.




The SPEAKER:  I'm going to hear the Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence briefly. I'm happy to hear the Leader of the House on indulgence, and then I will exercise a brief right of reply, but I'm not going to debate the matter.




Mr BURKE:
  I also respect that the decision is now made. The letters that you have tabled you said were on 17 May and 23 May. Had the decision been made within the time that the other by-election decisions were made, it would have been made before those letters were even received from the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission have claimed they want all candidates to know the new rules. I think that, for anyone running for these by-elections, if they don't know by now what the High Court has decided, there is nothing that will help them! 


The AEC normally would not recommend a date, as you have said. On this occasion, they have recommended a date, and they have used the fact that they want this new regulation as the reason. Now, they appeared before the relevant inquiry months ago. They had their involvement with the relevant inquiry through appearing last year. The regulations and discussions with the opposition happened more than a week ago. We have a situation now where that 79-day delay, which has not applied anywhere else, is on the basis of the Australian Electoral Commission, which, if the Prime Minister went down to Yarralumla and called an election today, would be able to conduct it for 150 seats in 33 days time. Instead, they say it has to be delayed all this period and it just happens to be on the day of the Labor Party national conference. It's a what-a-coincidence moment! What a coincidence from the Australian Electoral Commission! The decision now made—



The SPEAKER:  I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that the indulgence is brief and, as I said, in explaining these reasons, as I've done, I've tried to do it as a courtesy to the House. As I pointed out on Monday, the past practice has simply been for the Speaker to report resignations and then report after the writs have been issued. I'm sorry that some elected members are either unaware of that or don't appreciate it.




Mr Pyne:
  The point of order I wish to make is that an indulgence granted by you is also a courtesy. It's not an opportunity to have a debate and it certainly is not an opportunity to reflect on the Chair, which the Manager of Opposition Business is now perilously close to doing. You granted him an indulgence, which was generous, and he is taking advantage of it to debate a matter which, as a courtesy, you chose to tell the House of Representatives when you didn't need to. He should stop reflecting on the Chair.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence—and he will wrap up his remarks.




Mr Burke:
  I raise one final point. Because of the way the Australian Electoral Commission have written to you and the arguments they have put, and because of the initial delay in waiting for their letters, communities around Australia that could have a representative on 16 June, had the writs been issued immediately, instead will not be represented in this place. What was allowed to happen in the other by-elections, including of members on that side, now means there will be a delay in parliamentary representation which could have been avoided and would not occur in the circumstances of a general election.



The SPEAKER:  As I said, I'm not going to debate the matter. It was my decision to grant the Manager of Opposition Business indulgence. I'm going to make a couple of remarks—and the House ought to be capable of listening to them, and those members who want to listen to them should be able to do so without a wall of interjections. I'll make a couple of points. Firstly, the Manager of Opposition Business made a point about the date of the first letter being received. Let me assure members of the House, without going into the details of what are private consultations, that I did not simply sit there as Speaker and wait for a letter to arrive. You have oral consultations and written advice, which I had requested; it's made clear in the correspondence at the start. With respect to the timing of the calling of the other by-elections, without going over all the issues again, I just reiterate that the special circumstances relate to section 44 and the regulation and to school holidays. I simply make that point.


On the inference that this is unprecedented—I think you said 79 days—I'm happy to stand corrected but I do spend a lot of time considering these issues and I'm going to make a point. I think you'll find that the Gippsland by-election in 2008—I carry a lot of these figures around in my head and I'm pretty sure they're right—took 80 days, and I think it took about 40 days to issue the writs. If there were any extenuating circumstances, I wasn't aware of them at the time. Both the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition were in the House at the time, so if they can think of any—I would just make that point. And that was a single electoral event, not five events caused across four states. So I'd just like to make those points. The letters have been tabled. The Electoral Commissioner has provided those two pieces of very detailed correspondence outlining the reasons. I wanted to outline those to the House. I thought that was the right thing to do, notwithstanding I knew that a few members would find it impossible not to interject while I did it. I could have very easily issued a press release on the matter. I could have very easily done that; that's what other Speakers have done. For those who have listened in silence, I thank you, because I owe it at least to all of you to explain the reasons. I thank the House.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



The SPEAKER
 (15:12):  Could I please have the attention of the House on this important matter: I'd like to read a fairly lengthy statement, and then I'll be tabling some documents. Earlier in the week, I advised the House I would provide an update on possible dates for by-elections in the seats of Braddon, Fremantle, Longman, Mayo and Perth. This update follows further consultation with the Australian Electoral Commissioner and party leaders. Under the Constitution, it is my responsibility alone to issue a writ for a by-election when a vacancy occurs, and generally it has not been the practice to provide an explanation for the exercise of this responsibility. I have varied from the usual practice because of the quite unusual—quite unique—circumstances surrounding these by-elections.


As the House of Representatives Practice makes clear, there is no statutory period within which I must issue the writ. As a matter of principle, Speakers have generally sought to issue writs as soon as electorally practicable to ensure that electors are not without a representative here in the House for longer than necessary. However, the timing of the calling of each by-election has varied considerably because of circumstances, and in this case there has been a unique set of circumstances.


While there has been much commentary around the five by-elections occurring on the one day, the Australian Electoral Commission actually has to consider whether this is feasible and desirable. The advice I have received from the Electoral Commissioner is that although this is the largest number of by-elections to be conducted at the one time since Federation, and the holding of them across four states adds complexity, the AEC believes conducting the by-elections on the one day is the preferred option. I intend to follow this preferred option.


As noted in my statement on Monday, the Electoral Commissioner advised me that the government was considering urgent changes through regulation to the nomination process to ensure that all candidates are aware of their obligations under section 44 of the Constitution. The implementation of these changes prior to the by-elections was supported by the Electoral Commissioner and by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in a unanimous recommendation. The latest advice I have from the Electoral Commissioner is that the regulations have been signed by the Special Minister of State and will be submitted to the Governor-General soon for his consideration, expected to be 29 May. Regardless of the date for submission to the Federal Executive Council, the AEC has advised me that it has commenced preparations to implement the regulations and will require approximately two weeks to do so. The implementation would need to be complete prior to the writs being issued.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I say to members: I'm giving this update as a courtesy—members on my right—and it would be in all their interests to listen to the entire statement. Let me repeat: the implementation would need to be complete prior to the writs being issued, because nominations open as soon as writs are issued, at which time candidates can start nominating. This is, in part, to accommodate the requirements of the Electoral Commission but, more importantly, so that all candidates in the forthcoming by-election—all candidates—have sufficient time to comply with the new requirements.


Turning now to the date for the by-elections, the Electoral Commissioner has advised me that there is a complication of the school holiday period affecting all four states subject to by-elections, extending across a three-week period from 30 June to 21 July. Although, as the commissioner advises, it is possible to hold by-elections in the school holiday period, it does create additional difficulties for voters and risks disenfranchisement and low turnout. Let me say this is particularly—particularly—the case in by-elections, for, whilst in a general election there are significant absentee voting opportunities outside the electorate in which a voter resides, in by-elections there are not. If there is to be a single date for all by-elections and the school holidays are to be avoided, this pushes the next possible date to 28 July. Although the Electoral Commission—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Members on both sides! Members on my right! The member for Bendigo! I say to those members interjecting: the majority of members are seeking to listen to my statement. Although the Electoral Commission would not usually provide advice about a preferred date, I can advise members on this occasion the Electoral Commissioner has advised that 28 July is the optimal date. As the commissioner notes in his advice to me: 'This achieves three things. It provides sufficient time for the AEC to implement the changes'—



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Isaacs is warned. The commissioner's advice states: 'It allows sufficient time for the AEC to implement the changes, enables prospective candidates to comply with the new requirements and ensures that voters are not disenfranchised.' I consider it is prudent in the current circumstances that I follow this advice and allow time for the changes related to section 44 to be implemented and avoid the by-elections taking place in the school holidays. I, therefore, propose to accept the commissioner's recommendation for the optimal date of 28 July. I will consult with the AEC about the date to issue the writs and the relevant dates for the by-elections and will advise the House when the dates have been settled.


One very important consideration for me has been that this will not impact on the elected members' ability to take up their seats in the House at the earliest opportunity because of the break in the sittings from 28 June until 13 August. The earliest date that any elected members could now take their seats regardless of the date for the by-elections is the resumption of the sittings on 13 August. Because of the particular nature of the issues surrounding these by-elections, I'm going to table the advice I've received from the Electoral Commissioner. There are two pieces of correspondence from the Electoral Commissioner, one dated 17 May 2018 and a further, updated letter of 23 May 2018, and this is not a precedent for the tabling of such advice by Speakers in the future.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, during your remarks, the member for Barton made a very unparliamentary remark, and she should withdraw it.



Mr Burke interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I say to the Manager of Opposition Business: the majority of members were listening. Some were interjecting and, surprisingly, not wanting to hear the statement or the reasons, but I have read them into the Hansard and the correspondence has been tabled. I couldn't hear what the member for Barton was particularly saying but I will ask her, as is the custom, whether she made an unparliamentary remark. The Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence.

",HoR,<title>PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION</title>,<title>Issue of Writ</title>,PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION,10,2
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (15:21):  On indulgence, I'd like to note a few things about the decision, respecting the fact that the decision is not only made by you in terms of the advice that you have received from the Australian Electoral Commission, and ask that my comments be seen very much in that context. There are a number of by-elections which have occurred since you took the chair. In North Sydney, the writs were issued within three days; in Bennelong, two days; in New England, the same day; in Batman, six days. It will now be, for these by-elections, a delay of 14 days and, instead of the people going to vote 35, 36 or 44 days later, they will go to vote 79 days later.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Isaacs will leave under 94(a).




The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.




The SPEAKER:  I'm going to hear the Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence briefly. I'm happy to hear the Leader of the House on indulgence, and then I will exercise a brief right of reply, but I'm not going to debate the matter.




Mr BURKE:
  I also respect that the decision is now made. The letters that you have tabled you said were on 17 May and 23 May. Had the decision been made within the time that the other by-election decisions were made, it would have been made before those letters were even received from the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission have claimed they want all candidates to know the new rules. I think that, for anyone running for these by-elections, if they don't know by now what the High Court has decided, there is nothing that will help them! 


The AEC normally would not recommend a date, as you have said. On this occasion, they have recommended a date, and they have used the fact that they want this new regulation as the reason. Now, they appeared before the relevant inquiry months ago. They had their involvement with the relevant inquiry through appearing last year. The regulations and discussions with the opposition happened more than a week ago. We have a situation now where that 79-day delay, which has not applied anywhere else, is on the basis of the Australian Electoral Commission, which, if the Prime Minister went down to Yarralumla and called an election today, would be able to conduct it for 150 seats in 33 days time. Instead, they say it has to be delayed all this period and it just happens to be on the day of the Labor Party national conference. It's a what-a-coincidence moment! What a coincidence from the Australian Electoral Commission! The decision now made—



The SPEAKER:  I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that the indulgence is brief and, as I said, in explaining these reasons, as I've done, I've tried to do it as a courtesy to the House. As I pointed out on Monday, the past practice has simply been for the Speaker to report resignations and then report after the writs have been issued. I'm sorry that some elected members are either unaware of that or don't appreciate it.




Mr Pyne:
  The point of order I wish to make is that an indulgence granted by you is also a courtesy. It's not an opportunity to have a debate and it certainly is not an opportunity to reflect on the Chair, which the Manager of Opposition Business is now perilously close to doing. You granted him an indulgence, which was generous, and he is taking advantage of it to debate a matter which, as a courtesy, you chose to tell the House of Representatives when you didn't need to. He should stop reflecting on the Chair.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business on indulgence—and he will wrap up his remarks.




Mr Burke:
  I raise one final point. Because of the way the Australian Electoral Commission have written to you and the arguments they have put, and because of the initial delay in waiting for their letters, communities around Australia that could have a representative on 16 June, had the writs been issued immediately, instead will not be represented in this place. What was allowed to happen in the other by-elections, including of members on that side, now means there will be a delay in parliamentary representation which could have been avoided and would not occur in the circumstances of a general election.



The SPEAKER:  As I said, I'm not going to debate the matter. It was my decision to grant the Manager of Opposition Business indulgence. I'm going to make a couple of remarks—and the House ought to be capable of listening to them, and those members who want to listen to them should be able to do so without a wall of interjections. I'll make a couple of points. Firstly, the Manager of Opposition Business made a point about the date of the first letter being received. Let me assure members of the House, without going into the details of what are private consultations, that I did not simply sit there as Speaker and wait for a letter to arrive. You have oral consultations and written advice, which I had requested; it's made clear in the correspondence at the start. With respect to the timing of the calling of the other by-elections, without going over all the issues again, I just reiterate that the special circumstances relate to section 44 and the regulation and to school holidays. I simply make that point.


On the inference that this is unprecedented—I think you said 79 days—I'm happy to stand corrected but I do spend a lot of time considering these issues and I'm going to make a point. I think you'll find that the Gippsland by-election in 2008—I carry a lot of these figures around in my head and I'm pretty sure they're right—took 80 days, and I think it took about 40 days to issue the writs. If there were any extenuating circumstances, I wasn't aware of them at the time. Both the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition were in the House at the time, so if they can think of any—I would just make that point. And that was a single electoral event, not five events caused across four states. So I'd just like to make those points. The letters have been tabled.

For those who have listened in silence, I thank you, because I owe it at least to all of you to explain the reasons. I thank the House.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (15:31):  It's a little hard to follow after that, given the outrage on this side of the House, but I shall attempt to do this subject justice, because justice it deserves. This government has been cutting hundreds of millions of dollars out of our public hospital system, hundreds of millions of dollars out of your public hospital system. That is what this government has been doing. The latest budget, in fact, actually cuts a further billion dollars out of our healthcare system. It does so by a few means. This government can't seem to help itself when it comes to health care.


Cuts in this new budget include: $416 million to GP visas; $336 million on increased use of generic and biosimilar medicines; and $190 million from the MBS review. Taken in isolation, some of these savings measures may not necessarily be a bad thing. For example, Labor offered bipartisan support for the MBS review. But some of these savings, frankly, don't stack up.


More than two weeks after the budget, we are still waiting for the government to explain the claimed savings from the GP visa changes, but the minister has been silent on this issue. AMA president, Michael Gannon, argued these savings won't be realised, because patients will move to other GPs. If that's true, the government has a half-a-billion-dollar back hole when it comes to its budget. The only other alternative is that these savings will be realised, because people are not accessing Medicare services—that's a cut to Medicare. The government should come out of hiding on this and actually explain this measure and say which it is. You have either got a hole in your budget, or people—particularly in country areas that have been relying on overseas trained doctors to access services—are actually going to have less access to Medicare services. You can't have it both ways. Whatever the case, there is a broader question here—namely, where is the $1 billion actually going to?




Mr Hunt:
  That's because you haven't asked me a question since the election, not one.




Ms CATHERINE KING:
  The minister is interjecting yet again from the table. I have to say, it is great that the minister actually stays for these MPIs. He's the only frontbench minister who actually stays to debate me on MPIs. I think that says something about how nervous he is. It is great, because he was missing in action, frankly, in the last election campaign—no debate between the Libs and Labor on health care. It is great that the minister's actually here, but I do note the fact that he feels the need to be here, that he actually has to be here. Are you feeling a bit of heat, mate? You'll get your time, sunshine. Here we are.


Excuse my cynicism, but I don't trust a single word that this government says when it comes to health care. The government makes the claim that it's going to redirect all of its savings into health care. I suspect most Australians will take a similar view to us, that the government's assurances when it comes to health care are absolutely worthless. By way of an example, there's $190 million in savings from the MBS review. There is just $25 million in new MBS listings. That is a cut to Medicare. Where is the rest of the money going? You can't say population growth and the use of services in Medicare is actually increasing Medicare. You just can't. Population growth is not actually a policy about increasing people's access to Medicare services and new innovations in Medicare. It is not going into new services.


We certainly know that it is not going into public hospitals. After four years of ongoing Abbott-Turnbull cuts to Australian public hospitals, they are in crisis across this country. When this government broke its 2013 election promise—tore up Labor's historic national health reform agreement with the states—it walked away from a commitment to fund an equal share of efficient growth in hospital costs. In case the minister doesn't remember, I'll show him. Here it is in black and white—or in blue and yellow, which I think were your colours then—your 2013 election commitment, which said you would match Labor's historic health and hospital reforms, funding 50 per cent of growth in the efficient price of hospital activity. That was your policy to match Labor. What has this government actually done? That is a commitment that was designed to end the blame game, to stop cost shifting between the states and to put budget certainty into our public hospital systems. But after the 2014 horror budget, what we saw was that this was not sacred. They said, 'No cuts to health'. There were not going to be any cuts to hospitals. They had their policy here, and this is what they've done.


The current Prime Minister eventually, after a campaign run by Labor, restored some of the funding in the lead up to the 2016 election campaign, because they knew they had a very big problem when it came to this. What he then did was offer 45 per cent of growth in the efficient price capped at 6.5 per cent. That, Minister, is a cut to our public hospitals. From 2017 to 2020 alone that is $715 million that you have cut from our public hospital system. Now what you have tried to do is lock that cut in for a further five years, to 2025. That is a cut of $2.8 billion out of our public hospital system. That is the record of this government.


He has been going around the country, trying to browbeat some of the states into signing this deal. Most of those that have signed, including the Labor states that have signed, have said very clearly that they have only done so—the Northern Territory actually hasn't signed yet, Minister. I know you have been claiming they have, but they actually haven't signed yet. What those states are saying very clearly to us is that they know this is an inadequate deal but they don't trust this government not to cut public hospitals further. That's what they are telling us. They've done so for budget certainty, and they are looking to us to fix this government's mess when it comes to our public hospital system. It is an inadequate deal and represents a $2.8 billion cut to our public hospitals from 2019.


Our public hospitals simply cannot keep up with demand at the moment. That is why we are seeing emergency department waiting times blow out across the country. Elective surgery waiting times are also getting longer and longer under this government. The Australian Medical Association put it best when they recently said:


… the current funding formula will doom our public hospitals to fail, and patients will suffer as a result.


That is the record of this minister and this government. It's the grimmest of warnings from one of the most respected medical groups, but this government has not been listening. It's been going around, trying to keep everything quiet on health, because it knows it's got a problem when it comes to health, represented by the Minister for Health, who is willing to actually debate on this issue. He is the only frontbench minister who takes MPIs—good on him. They are out there desperately trying to spin the line that they are spending more on health than ever before. That's what they're trying to say. What they're studiously neglecting to mention is that spending is declining on a per capita basis—the most important measure. As experts from the Macquarie University Centre for the Health Economy warned a fortnight ago as a result of this government spending trajectory, 'Australians will either become sicker or be forced to pay more for their medical care'. That is what they have said. The group's director, Henry Cutler, said:


… real health expenditure would grow by 1 per cent less than population growth over the forward estimates—


which is a cut, Minister. The government insists that spending more than they were, using the Abbott government as their baseline—that's what this minister does. This is what this minister does: he uses the Abbott 2014 budget as the baseline and then tries to say, 'We're putting $30 billion more into public hospitals.' You're putting in $30 billion more than the member for Warringah did when he was Prime Minister. That is the baseline that you're using. It's a pretty poor baseline given the billions of dollars it represented as a cut to our public hospital. The government insist that they're spending more, as I said, using that baseline—the lowest of low bars to use. If they really think that being slightly better than Tony Abbott on public hospitals is generous, then it shows just how out of touch the government are. The government know that their funding is lousy. That's why they've resorted to comparing spending in 2015 to 2020 with spending under their proposed deal for the subsequent five years. Of course the Commonwealth will spend more on public hospitals in 2025. There are going to be about five million more people in Australia in 2025 than there were in 2015. So, basically, they are fudging the numbers.


On Medicare, too, we know that the government's record is absolutely and utterly shameful. They have cut already out of the Medicare Benefits Schedule over $3 billion. That is their legacy when it comes to Medicare. The freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the savings that they've made from that, the cut on patients' rebates, the capacity for people to be able to access their doctor—that is the record of this government. Record cuts to Medicare, record destruction of our health— (Time expired)

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (15:41):  The opposition is very sensitive, because we have called out Labor's lies in Longman. We have called out Labor's lies in Longman, where they were running about and pretending that there have been cuts. You know what? Not only has there been, every year, in every state and territory, record funding for hospitals, record funding for Medicare and record funding for health under this government but, when you look at the very claims they make in Longman about Caboolture, there's an extraordinary story. Let me go right to the heart of the issue which seems to have excited them so much, because they have been caught out. Labor have been caught out, flat, plain lying as they did at the last election, but this time we're on to them from day one.


What do we hear from them? We hear that the Caboolture Hospital has somehow had a cut. They're half right and they're half wrong. They're right because Queensland Labor has cut funding. They're wrong because the federal coalition government has increased funding. How do we know this? Because the activity based funding which has been published confirms this. Let me give you some examples. This goes to credibility. When we look at the figures for Metro North, which includes Longman and the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, which I visited last week, and also includes Caboolture Hospital, we see that, over the last three years, coalition funding has gone up 38 per cent and Labor funding has gone up four per cent. But what is really instructive is to look at the last full year of funding. Coalition funding went up $120 million for the area, which includes Caboolture Hospital, in one year. What happened to Queensland Labor funding? There was a decrease of $21 million. So they were right in one respect. There have been some cuts to Caboolture Hospital and they are Queensland Labor's. They were silent on this. How could it be that you actually go there, stand outside the Caboolture Hospital and cover up your own side having made a cut of $21 million in the last year?


My favourite point is that the opposition shadow spokesperson for health loves to talk about the base year. So let me go to the base year, their last year of funding when they were in government. That was a $13 billion figure. Labor put in $13 billion, and since then the funding has gone up under the coalition to $14 billion for hospitals, to $15 billion for hospitals, to $17 billion to hospitals, to $18 billion to hospitals and to $20 billion—and in this budget the next four years are $21 billion, $22 billion, $23 billion and $24 billion. Each year, every year, every state, every territory: a record. That's the reality. And you know what is extraordinary? What you see is that funding has increased at a faster rate under the federal coalition than under the previous Labor government. We were starting from your base! We were starting from Labor's base. Each year, every year, a record in funding, and each year, every year, what we've seen is that the coalition has increased at a faster rate than Labor. That is exactly what we are seeing. It is the same whether it's in Medicare or it's in health as a whole. What we see is that the overall health budget is up $12.4 billion this year. It goes from $99 billion to $102 billion to $104 billion to $109 billion. Medicare goes up from $25 billion to $26 billion to $27 billion to $29 billion. That is up $4.8 billion.


What we see now is that Labor are so incapable of making their own arguments that they are now saying, 'Yes, it's going up, but the population's growing.' You know what? Medicare funding is going up. Let me give you some examples of new Medicare items which we brought in: 3D mammograms for up to 200,000 women are included in this budget, as is a new funding item—



Ms Catherine King interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Ballarat is warned.




Mr HUNT:
  for MRIs for men potentially with prostate cancer and new tests for cystic fibrosis. We have new cataract surgery items, which will have a major impact in many areas of rural and regional Australia. This is what we are actually doing. There is more funding in Medicare, more funding in hospitals—more funding right across health.


There is an additional $338 million for mental health services, including $100 million for support for older Australians, whether it's in residential care or in the community, for their mental health needs. There is funding for beyondblue for their extraordinary Way Back program, and I commend former Prime Minister Gillard for her work with the government and now with the states on that. This is a program to give people treatment at the very moment they are most likely to take their own lives. It's a cooperative program which we've embarked upon. Similarly, we're contributing $33 million to Lifeline. With the great Professor Patrick McGorry and other leaders such as Professor Kapur, Professor Helen Milroy and Professor Tracey Wade, from South Australia, who is an expert in eating disorders, we are putting together a $125 million Million Minds Mental Health initiative under the Medical Research Future Fund—the largest, longest, single investment in mental health research in Australian history.


Let us compare that with our friends on the other side. When you look at what's happening in Queensland, you see the absolute truth. In Mackay, we're increasing funding by 30 per cent; Labor at the state level are decreasing funding in that region by two per cent—a 32 per cent difference. Townsville is an extraordinary example. In Townsville we see that we're increasing funding by 25 per cent, and it is a zero per cent change over the last three years, but I had a look at the ABF figures for Queensland in the Townsville area for the last full year. It has gone from $374 million to $346 million. So Queensland Labor have cut their own funding to their own hospitals in their own seat by $28 million. So there you go. That is an extraordinary thing about which they are absolutely silent. If they want to have a debate about facts, let's go for broke. Let's have a debate about facts.


But there is something that is even more significant than that: a vision for the Australian health system. What we saw on budget night was a vision for the Australian health system which covered our primary care and a-once-in-a-generation reform of our rural workforce system, and I am delighted to have at the table the assistant minister who was one of the architects of that system. What we see here are 3,000 new doctors and 3,000 new nurses for rural Australia with better opportunities for doctors, better opportunities for nurses and better outcomes for patients. That is a fundamental reform of profound significance and meaning.


In addition to all those Medicare items that I mentioned—for example, for mammograms, for prostate cancer, for cystic fibrosis and for cataract surgery—what we also see is an investment in new medicines. There is $2.4 billion, including for Spinraza, this extraordinary medicine to assist with spinal muscular atrophy for kids who would otherwise never have that opportunity; and for Kisqali for over 3,150 breast cancer patients who wouldn't have access to that medicine. And that compares—and this is the thing—with what Labor did when Labor was in office. They deliberately made a decision not to follow the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. They did that on the statement of the former minister, who said they could not list everything that the PBAC provided. We are very happy to provide those quotes. We guarantee that we will do that.


They left medicines for pulmonary conditions, asthma, endometriosis, IVF and schizophrenia on the table on the side and chose not to advance those listings at the time that it was progressed. And they made deliberate, conscious decisions. That is the difference. In the end, when it comes to health, we don't just pledge; we deliver each year, every year, record funding, hospitals, Medicare, health and mental health. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (15:52):  That was an astounding contribution by the Minister for Health—



Ms Flint interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Boothby is warned.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Sadly, he was unprepared to own up to the truth or the facts as they were outlined by the shadow minister for health, the member for Ballarat, who, as you well know, Minister, is very accurate in her depiction of your funding arrangements and is very accurate in making very plain your cuts to the hospital system. I know it. I feel it in my communities. And I see it because of the reliance of people in rural and remote parts of Australia on the hospital system. And I know that you think you care, but you don't act as if you do. I think you have got real issues around making sure that the hospital systems are funded properly. You're not prepared to accept the evidence that you've cut $715 million from 2017 to 2020.


In my electorate, Mr Minister, that means $3.2 million from the Alice Springs Hospital, $350,000 from the Tennant Creek Hospital, $450,000 from the Gove District Hospital and $620,000 from the Katherine District Hospital. I'm not sure if you've ever been to any of those hospitals. I suspect you probably haven't. But I know the quality of work they do and the work they provide for our communities. I know how important they are in addressing issues to do with closing the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health because of the nature of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health in my communities and how much they rely on the secondary and tertiary care provided by these hospitals. And you, Mr Minister, seem to be not alive to the contributions they make or to the importance of improving their opportunities to provide further and better health care to those people.


Just so you recall: for people who live in remote and very remote areas of this country, mortality rates are 1.4 times that of metropolitan centres. For coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in all areas, the mortality rate is 1.2 to 1.5 times higher than in cities. And diabetes in very remote areas is 2.5 to four times higher. These people rely on the health services that are available to them. In this case in Alice Springs, for example, we've got tremendous physicians, great people doing top work. But they rely on the funding we make available to them, and you, Mr Minister, have decided by the decisions you've taken that the work they—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I recommend that the member address his directions through the chair.




Mr SNOWDON:
  The work that they do is not valued sufficiently by you to make sure that they get the infrastructure they require. Let me give you an indication of work which is being done in the Katherine Hospital. Minister, you may be aware that in 2012, for the first time, a physician started work at the Katherine Hospital. As a result of that physician starting work at the Katherine Hospital, 10,000 bed days were saved in the Darwin hospital. Those sorts of improvements in health outcomes for people in my community are very important. You might laugh at them and you might not take any notice of them, but they are extremely important.


What you say to the Australian people is, 'Look, we're doing more for Australians through the health system and the hospital system than was done under Labor.' That is simply not true, and you know it. The changes you have made to Medicare are impacting on the whole of the Australian community, and you know that as well. So not only are you impacting on the primary healthcare of people across the community but you're also impacting negatively on secondary and tertiary care in those communities.


I was going to come to the issue of Closing the Gap and talk about this budget in terms of the follow-up and support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan, which was, of course, introduced by us in a bipartisan way in 2013 to last for 10 years. We are five years on, and an implementation strategy which has been developed and supported by us has yet to be funded, Mr Minister. So I'm wondering: how seriously are you taking this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan, if you're taking it seriously at all? We know you've provided no funds for it. We know you're not taking it seriously, and it's very clear that your priorities are elsewhere, rather than looking after the health system of Australians wherever they might live.


The minister at the table, who is about to speak, understands regional communities and understands the importance of regional hospitals to regional communities. He ought to understand, if he does that, the negative impact this government's cuts are having on those regional hospitals, whether in the communities he comes from in northern New South Wales or in my communities in the Northern Territory.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-05-24,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (15:57):  I really relish this opportunity to respond to the outrageous propositions that we've just heard from the other side. It's like being in Groundhog Day. I wake up and come to an MPI, and they're still arguing the same spurious figures and arithmetic. Across the whole four pillars of the health system, whether it's hospital funding, Medicare funding, medical research or mental health, the funding has gone up.


We might just start with this simple arithmetic. When I left practice after 33 years in the hospital system, the funding from the federal government when the current opposition was in government was $13.3 billion. Now it's $21.182 billion, going up next year to $22.3 billion. For simple arithmetic—I know you used to work in banking—$22.3 billion next year is much better than $13.3 billion when they were in government. In my electorate, the Lyne electorate, the arithmetic is similar. Hunter New England Health Authority, which runs Taree and Gloucester hospitals, had $1.3 billion received from the Commonwealth. It is now up to $1.52 billion.


The member for Lingiari spoke about the Northern Territory funding—as I mentioned, Groundhog Day and sophistry, confusing the numbers. Out there, people don't understand. There's funding from state governments and territories, and there's funding from the Commonwealth, but our proportion in the Northern Territory in 2017-18 is $290 million. In 2019-20 it goes up to $307.8 million. Over the 10 years on the new national hospital agreement, there's an 82 per cent increase. That's simple mathematics.


The Minister for Health mentioned our Stronger Rural Health Strategy. There is a really great initiative where we're going to end up with more medical practitioners, more nurses and more allied health because of initiatives that we've delivered in this budget. We are expanding end-to-end medical school training in existing medical schools and also expanding Charles Sturt University, which is linking with Western Sydney University. We are streamlining general practice training and putting funds into more GP specialist training for rural generalists. There's $84 million for the Royal Flying Doctor Service for remote mental health, emergency and dental schemes. The other pillar is Medicare funding—$4.8 billion more.


The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—when I was practising in a hospital, we were dying to get the latest drugs, the biological agents, the amazing cancer drugs. Since we came into power in 2013, some 1,500 new drugs have been approved. That's $8.2 billion worth of new drugs. Whether it's heart failure, schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension, cancers, melanomas—the Minister for Health mentioned Spinraza. Young Finn in my electorate has spinal muscular atrophy. When that came through I spoke to his mum and she was in tears. We have been battling for this drug for the last couple of years—and this budget, and the pharmaceutical benefits approvals, have delivered it.


Our Medical Research Future Fund is delivering enormous benefits to medical, surgical and mental health research. There is now $7 billion in the Medical Research Future Fund and it will peak at $20 billion in 2020. The dividends it is delivering are already showing up. The Biomedical Translation Fund—whether it takes discoveries on the benchtop in the science labs through to the bedside by translation or helps find a cure for various types of brain cancer—is a huge investment in genome research.


Across all areas of the Health portfolio, there have been great initiatives. The best thing that ever happened to the health system in this country is the coalition government coming into power in 2013 and delivering in spades—more for hospitals, more for Medicare, more for pharmaceutical benefits, for all the new drugs, and for mental health. It is really good. I'm so proud that, having given up my medical career to come to this place, we have delivered the goods for the Australian people.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:02):  Budgets are about government priorities. Certainly in this budget, what we've seen is that there is no priority for health in this country. This government would rather give an $80 billion tax cut to the top end of town than look after people who require knee replacements, hip replacements and proper health services. We know that there is absolutely no increase in public hospital funding. The budget actually locks in the $715 million in cuts from the 2014 budget that the Abbott government brought down in 2014. The $715 million in cuts are still there. This means people in my electorate will have to wait longer and longer for knee replacements, for hip replacements, to see a specialist, to see their local GP and they'll have to pay more in co-payments towards their Medicare costs. That is what it means for those people.


The Turnbull government is continuing those cuts from 2014. For South Australia this budget means a shortfall of $12 million—$3.6 million for the Royal Adelaide Hospital, $5 million for the Flinders Medical Centre, $1.8 million for the Women's and Children's Hospital and $1.5 million for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, an iconic hospital in the western suburbs that serves a lot of the people in my electorate. This $12 million cut to hospitals serving the people of South Australia and Adelaide and my electorate is equivalent to an additional 33 nurses that could have been provided instead of cutting. It's nearly 18,000 extra people in emergency department visits and 29,000 outpatient visits. That's what it means for the people in my electorate of Hindmarsh. These cuts to health and hospitals are hurting everyday Australians across the country. All you have to do is look at the record of this government. The cost of seeing a doctor is the highest on record. The average waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record. The number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record, under this government's watch.


This government, as we all know, has also taken the axe to Medicare. I say this because you can go back and dress it up and paint it in any way you like—the government tries to describe us when we were campaigning on Medicare. The reality and the facts are that in 2013 when they won government, after promising not to cut a single cent from health, the first thing they did was try and introduce the co-payment. They pushed and pushed. They couldn't get it through. They tried again in the coming budget. Again they failed, so they tried to do the sneaky thing, and that was to put a freeze on payments to doctors. That is reality. That is not a furphy. That is not something that didn't take place. That is the reality, and that's where the Australian public lost confidence in this government when it comes to Medicare. We have a proud record on Medicare. Each and every one of us on this side pledged to protect Medicare. We've got that proud record because we introduced Medicare. We are the founders of Medicare. We believe in public health and we believe in a universal healthcare system.


In this budget, we know that another 1.7 million people say that they will skip seeing a specialist because of the current cuts and the costs that are involved. This has a devastating impact on many people, particularly older Australians in my electorate. If you want me to go to older Australians not in my electorate but across the country, we have seen one of the biggest con jobs on older Australians by this government. What we saw was 14,000 new places for people in aged care in terms of packages and we have 100,000 people on waiting lists, and it's growing by 20,000 every six months. What a con job!


Labor in government will fully reverse the government's cuts, by investing an extra $2.8 billion. This record investment will reduce emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, not bring those elective surgery waiting times up as will happen under this government and is already happening. It's also going to give more than 3,000 doctors, nurses and other hospital staff, and many who live in my electorate of Hindmarsh, the resources that they need to deliver the best care possible. We are proud of Medicare on this side of the House. We are proud that it was the Labor government that implemented Medicare. We are proud to continue to protect Medicare from the cuts that this government wants to bring. (Time expired)

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-05-24,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:07):  It's always nice to be in the cheap seats at the end of the debate and hearing yet another farrago of cuts and growth. As a health economist, it's probably worth defining a couple of terms, because when the fear campaign ceases to work—look, I confess: back in the 2016 election we were slightly wrong-footed by 'Mediscare'. We didn't think anyone would have the effrontery to actually put out fake Medicare cards and make out that Medicare was under threat and likely to be erased forever.


We're dealing, of course, with a Labor entity that created Medicare in 1975 and never really moved on. They live back in the era of payments, where it's all about saving Medicare, back in the mid-1970s. What they've abdicated completely from is any debate about private health insurance and any debate about how the PBAC and the PBS work—anything about the four pillars of Medicare. They've never seen a private hospital they weren't scared of. You're flat out getting a Labor MP into a Catholic hospital. They try to fake it in a non-state hospital and then hope they've got a couple of mates there from Victorian Catholic education to back them up when they don't know what to say.


These are Labor politicians without any clue on how the health system works. Have more than one of them ever worked in a hospital? I think they just recruited a second one. They managed to scrounge around and find a nurse. They've got a guy who's an actual paediatrician on extension 2311—you never call the guy. You never listen to the one specialist you've got. You never involve him in the debate. In fact, you never even invite him to do an MPI, because he knows too much. He might actually talk about something other than fictitious, completely ridiculous cuts to Medicare.


Let's define some terms. Let me have a crack at this as a health economist. Growth is numbers getting bigger? Cuts is, maybe, numbers getting smaller? When growth doesn't increase as fast as it did the previous year, it's a reduction in growth; it's not a cut, by any means. It's like a shyster walking down the street, offering to double your salary and then vanishing, then you go back and beat your boss up and say that he's halving your pay. It's rubbish! You never funded a single growth number you quote. You never found the money for it.


When this mob over here tell you they had a $52 billion health plan, remember, they only funded $2 billion of it—the rest of the money was never found. There was never any effort to find the money, because they were too busy funding bureaucrats, too busy putting people behind desks with executive toys, standing around water bubblers. They are very good at that to try and fake their unemployment data but, when it comes to hospitals, these MPs opposite know nothing more about the public hospital system than the visiting hours. They wouldn't know where to go except to the coffee cart in a public hospital. None of you have worked in a hospital. I see one bureaucrat who stood around a water bubbler and looked at numbers and said, 'Just say a number and put the word ""cuts"" after it.'


Let's be serious. Let's look at what's happening in Queensland. For every dollar the feds put in, the state is flat-out matching it now. In the great Mater Hospital of South Brisbane, we have seen negative-10 per cent funding growth from the state government while we are shovelling in a 10 per cent increase in funding—overall, in my own area, $404 million to $582 million; for the entire state, $2.7 billion up to 5.2 billion over five years of Commonwealth contribution; of nationwide $14 billion up to $23 billion. You need to be a kabuki artist to be able to turn that into a cut. You have to have a masters and be a third Dan in kabuki to turn that into a cut, because it's growth in funding. You can say, 'You are using a lower base.' Every year before has a lower base, because funding goes up every year. Of course the base of the previous year is lower.


That mob opposite are so tied up in their calisthenics, desperately trying to keep together that simple cuts argument but it is starting not to work with Australians. We are doing the right thing with HIV patients. We are doing the right thing in aged care. We are generously funding mental health. At every level, it looks bad for the Labor Party. This great party of health reform, in 1975, would be far wiser to say, in 2018, 'Good for them for continuing the increase in funding; we would advise you spend it in a different way. We would advise you to be more creative, to work not just in funding and need but in outcomes.' But, oh no, this party never heard of the word 'outcomes'. They never cared about how well the patient was; it's just about defending the funding and leaving the other stuff to the experts. When they walk through a hospital, they say, 'Careful, don't press that button.' I mean, you guys are absolutely petrified of health policy. Bring down the member for Macarthur, a man with a long career in public health provision. His extension is 2311. For those listening to the debate around the nation, 062772311, call that man and say, 'Come down and save Labor.'

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (16:12):  As a hospital pharmacist who worked at my local hospital in Wyong for 10 years before I was elected and who worked in mental health units for most of my life, Labor has a strong tradition in health and hospitals. We are the party of Medicare. I'm proud as a hospital pharmacist to say we are the party of the PBS. I am very proud to stand here today as a member of the Labor Party, as a hospital pharmacist and as a former mental health worker. I challenge anyone to walk into a public hospital or a mental health unit anywhere in Australia and say that our hospitals or our mental health units are properly funded.


Anyone who has sat in an emergency department knows that hospitals need more funding. Anyone who is waiting for elective surgery on a list that is getting longer and longer knows that our hospitals need more funding. Anyone who has been to a specialist lately knows it's not affordable. After four years of neglect under this government, our health system is in crisis. The dedicated staff working in these hospitals go to work each and every day to do their best with what they have but they are under strain. Our doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physios, OTs, speechies, social workers, psychologists and all hospital staff need more resources to provide the standard of care that they want to and the standard of care our community deserves. Resources are scarce. Everybody in our community, in our health system, knows that and everybody in our community and our health system cares about it except, it seems, this Liberal government that wants to cut $2.8 billion from Australia's public hospitals in the next seven years. 


People are now out of pocket by $38 every time they visit a GP. People are now out of pocket by $88 every time they see a specialist. Recently my sister was referred to a neurologist and was charged $440 up-front for a 20-minute consultation. With a young family, that's out of people's reach. That is not affordable for many, and it is causing people to delay or cancel specialist appointments and to delay or avoid filling a prescription. In fact, on the Central Coast of New South Wales each year, about 12,000 people skip a GP appointment, and about 21,000 people skip a specialist's appointment. As a pharmacist, I am especially concerned about the almost 21,000 people on the Central Coast who avoid or delay filling a prescription because of cost, risking their health and leading to greater long-term costs to our health system.


This budget shows that this government is failing to fund our hospitals and our healthcare services properly. Either it doesn't know or it doesn't care. The budget doesn't properly fund prevention to tackle the causes of many chronic and complex diseases. It has little on primary care. There's no more funding for hospitals and mental health services, and the further you live from a big city, the worse it is for your health under this government.


I heard from Narelle last week. Her daughter was recently turned away from a public mental health unit and was recommended a cup of herbal tea. She was later admitted and had to bring in essentials like toothpaste and soap. This is a system in crisis. This is a system that is broken.


In my electorate of Dobell, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, one in five of us are under 15 and one in five of us are over 65. Young people and older people are the biggest users of our public health system, those who need it most, and yet this government is letting down people in regional and remote Australia. On the Central Coast, one in five of our young people are looking for work, and more and more of our young people find themselves sleeping rough or homeless. Unemployment and insecure work have a direct and immediate effect on the health and wellbeing of people, yet this budget does nothing for young people and their mental health.


Labor will invest more in every single public hospital in the country, with an extra $2.8 billion in funding for more beds and shorter waiting times. Labor will invest $80 million to boost the number of eligible MRI machines and approve 20 new licences, meaning that 500,000 more scans will be funded by Medicare over the course of the first Labor budget. Labor will provide $12 million towards ovarian cancer and Australia's National Action Plan for Ovarian Cancer Research. Labor will make HIV history. As I have worked with sexual health clinics and have met many people living with HIV, this is very close to my heart. Labor will respond to the unique health needs of people in regional and rural Australia by developing a new national rural health strategy.


This government is failing our community on health care and hospitals. Labor is the party of public hospitals. Labor is the party of Medicare. Labor will always properly fund public hospitals and always protect Medicare.

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (16:17):  This MPI by the Labor opposition about their proposal that the government is cutting hospitals and health care is absolute nonsense. The federal Labor opposition and the Victorian Labor state government are running a campaign of lies regarding health funding across Australia and, in particular, Victorian hospital funding.




Ms Chesters:
  Including Frankston Hospital.




Mr CREWTHER:
  They are doing a disservice to and harming my constituents in Dunkley—and indeed, as the member opposite said, in Frankston. I am calling upon Labor to take responsibility for their lies and misinformation campaign, which is spreading a scare campaign for those working in health care in my electorate. It is certainly a reminder of their 'Mediscare' campaign at the last election, for which Labor still haven't apologised. It wasn't true, it isn't true and it will never be true. That scared many of my constituents in Dunkley, but I stood up for them on this, and I will continue to stand up for them against the lies that are being spread by those opposite.


The Labor Party are the real party of cuts, because they like to talk about them so much: cuts to health, cuts to Medicare, cuts to education, cuts for TAFE. They're all false, and none of these cuts are happening. They just love to use the word 'cuts' to cover the fact that they are the real party of cuts in this country, reducing our standard of living, when it comes to taxing your housing, your retirement savings, your income and so much more. The fact is that federal funding for public hospital services under the coalition has increased from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to a record $22.7 billion in 2020-21, a 70 per cent increase. That's about $10 billion more than when Labor were in government. How they frame that as a cut is beyond me.


Locally, at Peninsula Health, in Frankston in my electorate, their funding in 2013-14 from the state was about $170 million and from the federal government was $135 million. In 2016-17, state funding increased by about $24 million to $194.9 million, whereas federal funding increased by over $56 million to $191.6 million. Federal funding growth in Victorian hospitals, including at Peninsula Health, is more than double that of the state government. This is despite hospital management being primarily a responsibility of the state government.


It's not just about dollars; it's about the effectiveness of investment. Our funding is supporting more services, more doctors and more nurses in public hospitals. But Victoria has still not signed up to our new national hospitals agreement, despite the fact that it has been signed by WA, the ACT, Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. As far back as March this was an issue. I issued a media release on 1 March and told the Dunkley public that the Andrews Labor government, including the state Labor member for Frankston, Paul Edbrooke, have shunned Victorians and are spreading lies. I will not put up with such falsities being fed to local residents as well as employees in the healthcare sector on the important issue of health care.


Minister Hunt, the Minister for Health, an ardent supporter of health investment, especially on the Mornington Peninsula, particularly given he was born at Frankston Hospital, pointed out in that media release that Commonwealth funding has increased much faster than Victorian state funding. The new national hospitals agreement would provide Victorian hospitals with an additional $7.4 billion, an increase of 29.6 per cent, so Daniel Andrews is short-changing Victorians. We are at record levels of bulk billing. GP bulk-billing rates have increased from 82 per cent in Labor's last year in government to 85.8 per cent. Let's look at the 2016-17 financial year compared with Labor's last year in government. There were 21.6 million more bulk-billed GP visits and 1.9 million more bulk-billed specialist visits.


A big part of the 2018-19 budget was securing essential services. We know how to run the economy. We know how to grow the economy. We are increasing revenue, meaning we can spend more on essential services, we can deliver tax relief, we can get back to a surplus and we can pay more for health care. Indeed, that enables us to guarantee Medicare with an additional $4.8 billion over forward estimates. It means Spinraza and Kisqali— important things—are listed on the PBS to help local constituents in Dunkley. (Time expired)

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:22):  In my home town of Launceston we have one of the best regional hospitals in the country. I know because I was on the board of Tasmanian Health Organisation—North, which is responsible for the governance of the Launceston General Hospital. It has a proud history of innovation and care. Workers at the LGH are to be commended on the outstanding work they do despite cuts to hospital funding. Tasmanians remember all too well the Liberal promises that there would be no cuts to hospitals in 2013. What did we get? Four years of Prime Minister Abbott's and then Prime Minister Turnbull's cuts and neglect, and now Tasmania's public hospitals are in crisis.


The Liberals are worse than ignorant as to their role in a system in crisis. They even deny the fact that there are health cuts, just as we've heard today. Instead they rely upon the assertion they are delivering more funding than in years past. With growing presentations and acuity on one hand, increases in healthcare inflation outpacing other cost increases and Commonwealth funding failing to keep pace, it is no wonder that the Launceston General Hospital is not able to keep up with demand. Under the Liberals, the cuts to our hospitals are putting those workers under pressure and the lives of Tasmanians at risk. The stories, the personal stories, that I hear almost daily speak of the stresses placed upon our emergency department and hospital wards. The story late last year of a patient left waiting outside the LGH for treatment and constant stories of ambulance ramping tell me that the cuts to health this government has overseen need to be seriously addressed now. Instead, this government's budget prioritises tax cuts to big business ahead of the health of the Australian people.


The Prime Minister and his Liberal government are cutting $715 million from 2017 to 2020, including $1.95 million from the LGH in my electorate of Bass, equivalent to the cost of performing 542 cataract surgeries or 75 knee replacements. It's a big cut, enough to fund 4,745 outpatient appointments or 2,928 emergency department visits. From the North West Regional Hospital in Braddon, he is taking $730,000. This would be a complete disaster for the health of northern Tasmanians. Between the next election and 2025, the Prime Minister wants to cut $2.8 billion from Australia's public hospitals.


Labor, by contrast, has a proud record on public hospital funding. The last Labor government signed a historic national health reform agreement with the states and territories in 2011. The aim was to end the blame game and give public hospitals long-term budget certainty by funding an equal share of efficient growth in hospital costs. This is where the Liberal lies on increases in health funding come unstuck. They tore up that agreement. Now the federal government is delivering less each year of the total cost of running our hospitals, including the LGH and the North West Regional Hospital.


As Labor is not giving businesses an $80 billion tax cut, Labor can afford to reverse the Turnbull government's cuts to hospitals from 2019 to 2025 and create a $2.8 billion better hospital fund, a practical step to address these daily pressures. Labor has already committed to a $30 million investment to slash Tasmania's elective surgery backlog. This record investment will reduce emergency department and elective surgery waiting times. This is something that only a re-elected Justine Keay and I can promise our constituents in Braddon and Bass. Justine Keay and I know from our experience that our hardworking and dedicated health professionals—our medical specialists, surgeons, nurses and allied health workers and all the support staff—will continue to work above and beyond the call of duty to look after the patients that present to hospitals in the electorates of Bass and Braddon. However, it is the present Liberal state and federal governments that are responsible for the health crisis—the backlog in elective surgery and increases in wait times in our emergency departments, the front line of the crisis. Try telling someone, when they are waiting for over 30 months to get an appointment to see a specialist even before they are investigated for surgery, that the Liberals are doing a good job. The freeze on the Medicare rebate has meant that many people elect not to see a GP at the right time. This government is responsible for those cuts. (Time expired)

Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (16:27):  I rise to talk about this matter today, as I see it as an opportunity to discuss how the Turnbull government is guaranteeing essential services Australians rely on. The Turnbull government is increasing funding for hospitals, medicines and Medicare. The only alternative approach from those opposite is to basically lie. Labor lies are intrinsically linked to their modus operandi when it comes to health. We saw their profound Labor lie before the 2016 election with regard to 'Mediscare'.


Unlike the Labor Party, we ensure a constructive, measured approach to economic management, and the proof is in the pudding. For example, with Medicare, there is the Turnbull government's Medicare guarantee. In relation to bulk-billing, the GP bulk-billing rate as at December 2017 is 85.8 per cent, up from 81.9 per cent in Labor's last year in government. Under the Turnbull government, more Australians are seeing their doctor without having to pay. Federal funding for hospital services under our government increased from $13.3 billion to a record $22.7 billion in 2021, a 64 per cent increase.


I have worked in the consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical industry for many years and, based on the number of patients' stories which I've witnessed firsthand, I know medical research and new medicines are something that literally changes people's lives. Since coming into government, the coalition has listed more than 1,500 new and amended medicines, worth approximately $9 billion. These medicines will assist people suffering from conditions such as heart disease, cystic fibrosis, cancer, psoriasis, epilepsy and severe asthma. This is unlike Labor's record of listings. The record will show that Labor gave listings of life-saving medicines very little attention. They put it on the backburner. Why? Because they can't manage the economy. If you can't manage the economy, you can't list life-saving medicines.


I'm a passionate advocate for mental health services for all Australians and so very proud to be part of the Turnbull government, which is committed to providing access for all Australians to the services they need to support their mental health and wellbeing. The government is investing $4.3 billion in mental health services this year. We're making significant investment in early intervention services.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:30):  The last fortnight has been horrific for people in Gaza. On a single day, at least 58 Palestinians died and many thousands were maimed. Australia was one of only two nations to vote in the UN against an independent inquiry into the deaths. Our own Prime Minister has described them as tragic, yet we voted with the United States. As the heads of Christian churches wrote in December, the decision by President Trump to base the US Embassy in Jerusalem will 'yield hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division'. How true those words are proving to be. Many would see the US decision as part of the reason Palestinians have protested along the fences that cage them into the Gaza Strip. When you have deaths on only one side of a conflict, there needs to be an explanation. International law requires a proportionate response. On one side you have people with guns, on the other you have rocks. There's a responsibility for those who are highly armed and highly trained to act in a proportionate way. I struggle to understand why the Australian government would not back an independent inquiry.


Last year I visited Israel and the West Bank of Palestine for the first time, but I was not able to visit Gaza. What I saw saddened, angered and horrified me, not least because Australia has been a friend of Israel since its creation. A good friend must call out behaviour that is wrong. We are not a friend if we stand by and silently condone actions which damage the prospects of a lasting peace. Where Israeli law is clearly in breach of international law, we must speak. Israel is becoming increasingly isolated, as recent UN votes show. My time on the ground, looking at the facts of Palestinian lives and the realities of occupation, left me feeling that time is running out for a peaceful resolution and that more than ever friends are needed. Google the words 'Israeli wall' and look at the pictures that come onto your screen. The reality of what are, in fact, multiple walls that divide the Palestinians and Israelis shocked me. It's a brutal structure. In practice, it impacts on the lives of Palestinians, not just when they need to travel into Israel but in their daily lives. In many places, the wall divides towns, one half from the other. The wall is both a physical and a psychological barrier. If you want people to feel like they're in some kind of ongoing prison, then this is the way to do it.


Checkpoints dominate any journey between many Palestinian cities and towns and any trip to Israel. If you're Palestinian, to visit a doctor or hospital in Jerusalem you need a permit. To work in Jerusalem you need a permit. One of the people I spent time with was my friend Muna, who lives in Ramallah. She's my age and in a unique position in her family. As a woman over 50, she can visit her daughter and granddaughter in Jerusalem without a permit. An aid worker in the Jordan Valley told us of his conversation in recent years with local Israeli military leaders after confusion about when a checkpoint would be open or closed. The aid worker asked about the system and how effective it is. The response was: 'There is no system, and it's very effective.' That highlights for me the uncertainty with which Palestinians go about their lives. The rules can change in a heartbeat. The water and electricity might be on today or they might not be. Crossing the checkpoint might take minutes or hours or might not happen at all. Your permit might be valid or it might not be. These are the daily humiliations that Palestinians shared with us.


My visit showed me that the expansion of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in the Old City of Jerusalem is a serious matter. The demolition of Palestinian homes built without permits, because permits can't be issued, is a catch 22. The treatment of Bedouins, who have been relocated from their land to unproductive tracts of land, is just awful. The fact that Bedouin community schools and sanitation, funded by the European aid that comes in, are demolished is an outrage.


The military courts which Palestinians are subjected to for even minor offences are an unequal justice compared to what Israelis receive, and the human rights of children in these military courts is ignored. During my time in Israel and the West Bank—and I want to thank Lisa Arnold and Wendy Turner from APAN—I met warm and welcoming people, good people from all walks of life and all religions who want to live peacefully. They want to live without fear. Australia has a role in ensuring that both sides of this conflict have respect for each other, that each can be self-determining, that each has a state and that each can live safely within its borders.

 (Fenner) (09:47):  During my lifetime we in Australia have decriminalised homosexual acts between consenting adults. We have removed many forms of institutionalised discrimination against LGBT+ Australians. We have belatedly legislated same-sex marriage. There is more to be done in Australia, but there is much more to be done around the world. According to the ILGA's 2017 report, as of May 2017, 72 states continue to criminalise same-sex consensual activity—that is, more than one-third of the world's nations. There are currently eight nations in which the death penalty is imposed as a punishment for same-sex consensual sexual acts. Let me go to some examples.


This month in Malaysia we saw the release of Anwar Ibrahim, but it is a reminder that Malaysia continues to make sodomy illegal under section 377 of the Penal Code, which prohibits 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature'. In Bangladesh in the capital Dhaka, Xulhaz Mannan, the founder of Bangladesh's first and only LGBT magazine, was brutally hacked to death as punishment for his activism on behalf of same-sex-attracted Bangladeshis. In Tunisia, Bouhdid Belhedi, a campaigner for LGBT rights, was assaulted by Islamic extremists and beaten by a mob outside his house in Tunis as a policeman watched.


In Ecuador, gay people are forced to undergo conversion therapy in secret clinics, where they are raped and beaten even though homosexuality is legal. Since the 2013 military intervention in Egypt, at least 250 LGBT+ people have been arrested. In Aceh, the Indonesian police recently arrested 12 transgender people. In Iran, gay men are sometimes hanged. In Russia, homophobic violence is on the rise. In Syria, there are media reports of LGBT individuals being thrown from tall buildings headfirst and then stoned by bystanders. And although homosexuality is legal in Turkey, it has one of the worst records of human rights violations against LGBT+ people in Europe.


Homosexuality is not a choice. Being transgender is not a lifestyle. Equality is indivisible. Human rights are universal. It doesn't matter whether you approach politics from the standpoint of freedom or from the standpoint of equality. As individuals, as civil society, as a government, Australians must do more to stand up for LGBT+ rights around the globe.

 (Kingston) (10:18):  Last night I was highlighting the many sneaky cuts that this government has made when it comes to education, early education and veterans, but this is in the context of a budget that also gives $80 billion back to big business. That is what is so unfair about this budget. This government isn't there to provide high-quality services that Australians depend upon, education, health, but wants to give large tax cuts to multinational companies, which is of significant concern. It's for this reason that Labor will campaign as a much stronger alternative government that will invest in our hospitals and schools, has made tough decisions, won't be giving $80 billion back to big business, and will provide double the personal income tax cuts that the coalition is proposing for 10 million Australians. That is about helping ordinary Australians get on with the difficulty of the cost of living. That is about actually making sure that those that need support, those that are finding it tough, those that have not had wage growth for such a long time and that are continuing to struggle will get the support they need. That is a sharp, sharp contrast to the coalition that wants to give tax cuts to the big end of town. Labor wants to give tax cuts to working families in this country, families that deserve support, families that deserve assistance with the cost of living. I am proud to stand with this alternative vision for the country that we live in.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:20):  One of the truly remarkable things about budgets is that they really lay bare for all to see the priorities of a government. This budget indeed tells you everything you need to know about the Turnbull Liberal government. It gives an $80 billion tax handout to big business at the same time as it hits our schools and our hospitals with savage cuts. Despite shocking revelations of misconduct from the banking royal commission, it splashes the big banks with $17 billion in tax cuts at the same time that it cuts $26 million from the banking cop on the beat, ASIC. 


The budget looks after big business and high-income earners at the very expense of investment in health, education and vital public services. It cuts the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight, and it forces Australians to work until the age of 70. It locks in $17 billion worth of cuts to schools and confirms $2.2 billion worth of cuts to Australian universities. It maintains $2.8 billion worth of cuts to hospitals and keeps the Medicare freeze on specialist visits for a further year. It rips a further $270 million from TAFE and apprenticeships and levies more than $80 million in new cuts to the ABC. It axes 1,200 jobs from Centrelink, even though unanswered calls spiked from 29 million to 55 million last year. It delivers no new money for aged care, even though 105,000 older Australians are on the waiting list for home care packages. It proposes a radical attack on Australia's progressive taxation system, which would see a carer earning $40,000 on the same marginal tax rate as a lawyer earning $200,000. It squanders some of the best economic conditions in many years. Net debt is double what it was when the Liberals came to office and gross debt is set to be stuck well above half a trillion dollars for every year for the next 10 years. 


Unlike Mr Turnbull, Labor has a clear plan to bring back fairness. A Shorten Labor government will improve our schools, fix our hospitals and save Medicare. We will make universities more accessible, guarantee the future of TAFE and put local jobs first. We will take real action on climate change, invest in renewables and safeguard our environment for future generations. We'll deliver genuine tax relief for working Australians, protect pensioners and improve the bottom line. It's a plan we can afford because we've made the hard decisions to rein in tax breaks for high-income earners and we're not going to give big business, multinationals and the big banks an additional $80 billion tax handout. 


I would now like to step through a few of the concerns that I have about the impact of this budget on my community in Newcastle and, more broadly, for the nation. The University of Newcastle stands to lose an estimated $69 million as this government levies $2.2 billion worth of cuts on universities. This will undoubtedly hurt students, the wider community and, indeed, our regional economy more broadly. The university was able to protect students from those cuts this year, but that is an unsustainable pathway. When you rip $69 million out of a university, you cannot do so without impacting on student learning and student supports. 


I am deeply concerned about the government's budget plan to cut two per cent of medical training places from universities across the country to help fund its so-called Murray-Darling medical schools network. Just to be clear: I do not begrudge medical places in regional Australia—indeed, I come from a regional university with an outstanding medical school—but I am concerned about this blatantly political plan that is so obviously designed with electoral rather than policy outcomes in mind. 


It would be an absolute travesty if that plan were to come at the expense of places currently sitting in the nation's best regional medical training program, which is delivered in partnership by the University of Newcastle and the University of New England. This genuinely joint medical program provides the most successful model for regional medical training in the country. If anything, it should be boosted, not diminished. It runs three rural clinical schools in Tamworth, Armidale and Taree. It takes in almost twice the national average number of students from rural and regional communities. Graduates are also twice as likely to seek work in rural and regional areas. Not only that but the University of Newcastle graduates more than one-third of the nation's Indigenous doctors.


Why would you rip out these places? Why would you put a program like that at risk in order to stump up places that have an electoral advantage for the government? Why would you rip places from this medical training centre that has a clear, proven track record of delivering superior regional medical training? I've already personally raised with the minister my concerns about this issue, and I will certainly be seeking assurances that the University of Newcastle's leading medical program will be quarantined from this government's cuts.


This budget locks in $17 billion worth of cuts to schools. In my electorate of Newcastle that means that schools are each losing on average $350,000 over this year and next year alone. That will mean fewer teachers, less individual attention and less support for kids to achieve their full potential. What is worse is that the harshest cuts are being borne by the schools that can least afford it. Over the next two years alone public schools cop 86 per cent of the Liberals' most recent cuts. If that weren't bad enough, we recently learnt that Mr Turnbull has been busy doing more than 100 sneaky deals to give the elite private schools more cash from a $7 million secret slush fund.


Labor understands the importance of investing in education, of investing in our future generations. We think every child deserves the best start in life. Every child deserves a supportive learning environment to ensure that they reach their full potential, and that's why we are committed to restoring every single cent of the $17 billion that the Liberals have cut from our schools.


One of the truly tragic outcomes of this budget is the Turnbull Liberal government's ongoing cuts to TAFE. Hunter TAFE, which is in my part of the world, is Australia's largest regional TAFE and vocational education and training provider. It has been an incredibly important partner and a provider of that training in our community, but it's no secret that TAFE in New South Wales is on its knees. These cuts—this additional $270 million that the Turnbull Liberal government is now cutting from our TAFEs and apprentices—are adding to the crisis that we are already experiencing in TAFE. This extra $270 million cut to TAFE and apprentices is, of course, on top of more than $3 billion of cuts from previous Liberal government budgets.


Once again, it clearly demonstrates that the Turnbull Liberal government's priorities are completely wrong. No government should be prioritising tax cuts to foreign shareholders and the big banks while cutting federal government support to vocational education and training. Seriously, nobody thinks this is a good idea in my electorate and I doubt that they do even in Liberal electorates. It's astonishing that the government thinks that they should continue on this pathway of cuts into TAFE.


I'm very pleased Labor has committed to guaranteeing that under our government at least two out of three training dollars will go into TAFE, because we believe that TAFE must be at the front and centre of Australia's vocational education and training industries. We'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country and ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We will provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade. There is still a place in many communities for a strong TAFE body to provide trade skills for men and women. From Labor's perspective, universities and TAFE are equal partners in a higher education pathway. I am very pleased that Labor will also provide 20,000 adult apprenticeship programs for older workers who need to retrain. Nothing could be more important for our citizens.


Of course, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, you could be forgiven for thinking that there would be no more important priority for any government than the health and wellbeing of its citizens. So you can imagine how astonished I was to find that this budget continues to cut deeply into the budgets of our local hospitals in order to pay for big business tax cuts. This will mean increased delays for surgeries, that nurse and doctor numbers will decline and that emergency department waiting lists will increase. In Newcastle, the government is cutting close to $10 million from our local hospitals, and that is from the 2017-2020 years. The John Hunter Hospital, a major hospital in my region, which does not just service Newcastle but, indeed, provides emergency and trauma services through to the Queensland border, is standing to lose $6.88 million. The Calvary Mater Newcastle—again, the region's major oncology service provider—is losing $1.6 million. And, astonishingly, the John Hunter Children's Hospital is going to be cut by $1.2 million. Labor will fully reverse the Turnbull Liberal government's $2.8 billion worth of hospital cuts, as well as funding 500,000 more life-saving MRI scans through Medicare.


My community tells me how important those measures are and how appalling they find the ongoing attacks on local hospitals from this government. Like me, they find this to be both short-sighted and wrongheaded, and I would implore the government to rethink their ridiculous plans to cut further into the health budgets of this nation.


Of course, people in my region have grown used to the fact that Liberal governments do not any longer invest in significant public infrastructure projects in the Newcastle-Hunter region, so it was with great disappointment that there was no money on the table for the Glendale interchange and no investment for high-speed rail. It's astonishing that this government fails to understand the importance of connectivity between our major cities in Australia and why they might want to invest in a high-speed rail network on the eastern seaboard. The evaluation studies were done by Labor when we were in government. There's no need for any more feasibility studies. We know that high-speed rail would turbocharge regional economies like Newcastle's and understand the good that would have. But, of course, every year that we delay we have hundreds of millions of dollars added to the cost of trying to invest in these projects. Indeed, it concerns me that the transport corridor for the high-speed rail is still not protected.


There are many aspects that I would want to touch on, but I will end with the fact that there was, to my profound regret, no investment in a Commonwealth court registry in Newcastle. There are such physical constraints for that court and also a lack of personnel. We have been crying out for the Attorney-General to replace the judge who has just left and was transferred to Queensland. We are down a Federal Circuit Court judge again. We need one badly, and we need them now.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-05-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:35):  There's a growing crisis in this country, and it's evidenced by the fact that one in three young people either haven't got a job or haven't got the hours of work that they want. It's much, much worse for those young people who finish school and who don't have qualifications above that school level. If you look back over Australian history, what you will find is that the youth unemployment rate is always higher than the general employment rate and that every time we get into trouble when there's a recession the youth are hit harder and they have a disproportionately higher rise in their unemployment rise, so more of them are jobless.


What we also have usually found, looking back over history, is that give it a couple of years and, as better economic times come, the two come back into line and young people tend to start finding jobs again. But that hasn't happened since the GFC. Since the GFC, unemployment and underemployment for young people has continued to get worse, not better. We're almost a decade on from it, and we now have this appalling situation in this country where one in three young people can't find a job or don't have enough hours of work. They are getting screwed. The old measures that previously might have pumped up employment don't seem to be working any more. We are increasingly turning our backs on a generation of people who will find themselves without ever having had meaningful employment.


When the government does one of the most important things it does each year, which is hand down its budget, you would expect it would have laser-like focus and put up in lights the fact that so many people in this country are finding it very, very difficult to make ends meet and it's especially hard for young people. But there was nothing for young people in this budget. This is a budget that gives the middle finger to young people in this country. If you think about those one in three young people who either haven't got a job or aren't getting enough hours of work, many of them will be reliant on youth allowance and, if you get a bit older, they will be reliant on Newstart. The number of people who are in that situation where they're forced to rely on welfare because the government has not done enough to create meaningful jobs for them is growing.


The government trumpets its job-creation figures and ignores the fact that, really, those job-creation figures are just keeping up with population growth and that we have unemployment persistently stuck at over five per cent. If you again look back over history, you will find that between World War II and the 1970s the average unemployment rate in this country was two per cent. The government is consigning a whole bunch of people to the scrap heap. It's even worse for young people, and the budget has nothing for them. While they're looking for work that is not there at the moment, many of those people them are reliant on welfare. They are trying to find jobs that aren't there, and they're reliant on welfare in the meantime. What we know is that if you are reliant on Newstart to try to make ends meet while you're looking for another job, you are living in poverty.


Everyone is now screaming from the rooftops that the level of Newstart is so low that it's actually a barrier to people finding work. Why? Well, you spend all your time just trying to stay alive, trying to make ends meet, because you've got $40 a day. At the same time, the cost of rent is going through the roof. We find that in Melbourne, for example, if you're reliant solely on Newstart, there is not one rental property in the greater Melbourne area that is affordable for you. So we have people living in poverty.


This low level of Newstart is now becoming a barrier to people finding work because it's becoming a poverty trap. It's not just the Greens saying that. It's not just welfare organisations saying that. The Business Council of Australia has said that trying to get by on $40 a day, at a time when energy bills and housing are going through the roof, means that you don't have enough money to get yourself that extra haircut or to go and buy some extra clothes to get yourself ready for a job interview; you don't have the capacity to go and do the extra training that you need; you spend most of your life just trying to survive.


Many people were hoping that this budget might deliver something for all of those people who are looking for a job, and that it might help lift some Australians out of poverty while they're looking for a job. And the budget gave the middle finger to them as well. The budget said: 'There is nothing for you from this Liberal government if you are trying to find jobs that aren't there, because we're not creating them. And if you're living in poverty just trying to make ends meet, well, we don't care.'


So not only was the opportunity to help make Australia a more equal society passed up, because the government refused to do anything on that front, they also turned their back on last year's budget, when they said that housing was the most important issue. Remember that—when they said that making housing affordable was one of their priorities? There was not a single dollar in this budget to help make housing more affordable.


Things have changed a lot in the last couple of decades in Australia. People are going into record debt because the cost of housing is going up and up and up and other forms of income are not going up at all. And again it is worse for young people. Back in the 1990s, the average cost of a house was six times the average young person's income. Fast forward a couple of decades and the average cost of a house is 12 times an average young person's income. The Treasurer made a big song and dance about that a year or so ago but now seems to have completely forgotten. So there's no money in this budget to look after the people who are falling through the cracks, and there's nothing in this budget to address housing affordability, when we know that, if we had the guts to rein in negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, for example, we could use that money to build more affordable housing.


Start building more affordable housing that's available to people at the lower end of the spectrum and you'll kill a number of birds with one stone. You'll start putting people into work as we start to have a construction-led employment recovery. You'll also start bringing down rents because the housing will be affordable and you'll take a bunch of people out of that very tight rental market by delivering them public housing. Start building some affordable housing for key workers in our cities as well and you'll start to ease the pressure on them so that cleaners, nurses, ambulance officers and firefighters can afford to live near the places that they're servicing. That would be a sensible thing to do.


Nothing—nothing—from the government on that. Why? Because they want to make inequality worse by ending progressive taxation in Australia as we know it and giving a handout to big corporations and the very wealthy. It's going to cost $140 billion—money that we could use to build more affordable housing or to lift Newstart or to get dental into Medicare. Instead, the government says that the way to increase inequality in Australia—because that's ultimately what they're on about—is to get rid of Australia's progressive taxation system.


As a result of the proposals that this government is putting forward in this budget, in a few years time, when they get rid of and dismantle the progressive taxation system in Australia and phase 3 of the tax cuts kick in, someone who is earning the minimum wage will pay the same tax rate as a CEO on $200,000. Now, that is not fair. That is not fair, and it is a direct assault on egalitarianism in this country. We have a progressive taxation system for a reason. There is an acceptance in this country that if you earn a bit more, and especially if you're right at the top end, you can contribute a bit more. There is an understanding in Australia that we will be, and remain, a more equal society if we use money to invest in services like free health care and free public schools so that no matter how much you earn you've got the same rights as everyone else to get good quality health care and good quality education.


We understand in this country that the key to avoiding going down the US road and becoming a dog-eat-dog society, where everyone has to look after themselves, is making sure that every child in this country can get a world-class public school education if they want it and that you're never turned away from a public school because you're worried about the quality of the education. You know, as of right, that you've got that. And you know that if you get sick, you will be looked after in the hospitals in this country. And you also know—although this is increasingly coming under threat—that you're able to get to a GP as and when you need one without the gap costing you too much or being a disincentive for being able to go. Now, to do all of those things we need to ask big corporations to pay their fair share, not give them a tax cut. But we also need to maintain a progressive taxation system in this country.


If there's one thing that the budget has achieved, though, it's that they've successfully fired the starting gun in what's going to be a tax cuts auction going to the next election. And it's very, very disappointing to find that in this parliament the Greens are the only ones standing up saying: 'No, no tax cuts. Let's put the money into services instead.' And in doing that we are standing with the majority of the Australian people, because the majority of the Australian people know that whether it's $10 a week or $20 a week, most of that is going to disappear as power bills going up, as the cost of housing goes up and as the cost of going to see the doctor goes up. If you ask most people: 'What would you rather? Would you rather $10 or $20 a week? Or would you rather that money go into making sure you don't have to pay so-called 'voluntary' school fees when you send your kid to public school? To making sure that the gap between the cost of what Medicare provides and what you have to fork out of your pocket when you go to see the doctor gets brought down? Making sure that we re-regulate power prices?' they say that they would much rather government get involved and ensure that Australia remains an equal society. They know that $10 or $20 a week gets eaten up just like that.


And the best way to look after low-income earners is to lift the minimum wage and the best way of looking after people who are falling through the cracks is to lift Newstart. That is a better road to go down than engaging in this tax cuts arms race. Every time the opposition falls for the bait from this government on tax cuts and engages in this macho 'my tax cut is bigger than yours' contest going into an election, a little piece of the welfare state dies and a little piece of social democracy dies. We need to defend proper taxation as the price we pay for a civilised society. If we keep getting sucked into this idea that people want bribes of $10 or $20 a week instead of government taking action on the things that are actually putting people under pressure, then we're all going to lose.


So what should the government do instead? Well, let's re-regulate power prices in this country. That will save people more than $10 a week. Let's say that electricity is an essential service that shouldn't be run for profit, that should be in public hands and should be regulated. Let's do that. Let's build more affordable housing and bring down the cost of renting. That will save more than $10 or $20 a week. Let's put the money that's meant to be going into tax cuts for millionaires and instead put it back into public health or into Medicare and we'll bring down the cost of going to see a doctor. That will make people's quality of life much better. 


I think the Australian people would accept a fair level of taxation if they thought the government was spending it properly, if they thought it was going on public schools and public health and making sure Australia remains a more equal society. Most people would rather we do that than have this bribe-fest at every election. This is an appalling budget and I hope that very, very soon this government is no longer the government, but I hope that when there's a change we can shed this idea that we've always got to cut taxes, and, instead, put the focus on services.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:50):  This is a great opportunity for me to really bell the cat and put the last nail in the coffin on the coalition's attempts to portray itself as the better economic manager in this country. That really hasn't been true for a number of decades now. To put this situation in context, look at the reforms that the Hawke-Keating government delivered to us. They really set the platform for the 26 years of unbroken growth that we've had. The Howard government did contribute the institution of APRA but, beyond that, throughout the years, the main thing that they bequeathed to us was structural deficits. In order to address debt-and-deficit issues in the first half of their time in government, they sold off $76 billion of Commonwealth assets—sold off the farm, effectively. That gave you a short-term sugar hit, but, to give you an example of the impacts of that in the long term, we can take the RG Casey Building. They sold that for $200 million. We've now paid $300 million and more in rent on that facility. So, that immediate sugar hit has left us with long-term structural deficit outcomes. 


In addition to that, you can then look at what they were able to benefit from with the mining boom. Out of the mining boom they spent money like there was no tomorrow, so we had ridiculous spending initiatives like the baby bonus. Then we come to the dividend imputation measure they introduced. Keating introduced a measure there which tried to eliminate the double-taxation issue that was going on at the time, where the company tax factor was piled on with taxes on the profits from dividends, which was a sound measure. But then what Howard did was allow, in effect, a double dip there. At the time, that resulted in a $550 million hit to the budget. Now we're looking at an $8 billion to $10 billion hit to the budget, and, if you draw a line through that exponential curve, there was going to be a point where the dividend imputation was going to consume the entire federal budget. 


This is an unsustainable situation. Somebody has to get out and have the guts and the bravery to get out there in the Australian public and argue the case that this has to be done now for future generations. What this government is doing is intergenerational theft: PAYE taxpayers, all those young workers out there now, are going to be sustaining these people who claim, 'This is because we wanted to be independent of pensions.' Well, it's still government money, whatever you call it, and it's unsustainable. One thing that people have to factor in with that issue is that part of your retirement income will be health costs and aged-care services. The only way we can make that affordable, and not make it a user-pays American-style system—which I'm sure no Australian wants to see—is to be able to afford funding those services. The only way we can do that is to make sure we take the prudent measures Labor has put forward—fiscally responsible and prudent—that will deliver better savings and deficit reduction than the government is offering. 


How are we doing that? Removing that dividend imputation is the first part of the story. The rest includes: reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax, what we're doing on trusts, and what we're doing on not giving $80 billion away to big companies and, of course, on the $140 billion giveaway of tax relief to the wealthy. There are so many measures in that that would more than underpin what we want to do to make sure that people in their retirements are well looked-after and that they're not having to pay more—which will eat into their retirement income—on health services. 


When I talk about the economic credibility of this government being destroyed, never mind the 30 polls in a row; let's look at the statistics. What we've seen since 2013 is that there's been an extraordinary boom in global trade, domestic commerce and company profits around the world. So there should have been a significant uplift for Australia in that context, and we should have been maintaining our position relative to the rest of the OECD. But what have we seen instead? From 2009 to 2013, Australia's economic growth was close to the top of the 34 richest countries in the OECD. We've now slipped to 23rd in the list. 


When you look at productivity, we've now dropped to the lowest level since 2012 in the context of the washout of the GFC. Unemployment has now risen from the level which we were at in 2013. Those one million jobs that the government like to claim they created was the track that should have been happening as a year-on-year average with that economic pick-up, but it has actually been below world trends and a lot of that has been casualised. We are now at one of the highest casualisation rates in the OECD, and that's extremely disturbing. In terms of our jobless rate, in 2013 we were ranked seventh in the OECD; now we're down to 17th. So the government is losing here, and its economic credibility is completely destroyed in the context of how we should be looking at this picture in relation to other like nations. 


Then you look at Malcolm Turnbull. He comes into government and we all think he has been wanting to do this job for a long time and so the Prime Minister must obviously have an agenda, but we were sadly disappointed. I am very grateful to the folks at The Marcus Review, who have well documented the thought bubble failures of Malcolm Turnbull since he became Prime Minister. There was what they described in November 2015 as 'super tax episode 1', where Turnbull floated the thought bubble about a super contribution tax rate from 15 per cent to a flat rate 15 per cent discount on the contributor's marginal income tax. That disappeared. He rethought the negative gearing cap in March 2016 and the capital gains tax issue. That disappeared. On 30 March, he talked about building a 'taxation revolution'—another Penrith Park thought bubble in the tradition of Tony Abbott, with all those broken promises. So he has been undoing, effectively, the evolution in our federation of taxation on a more efficient basis. It would have completely destroyed our progressive revolution and evolution in that space. That was an utterly hopeless proposition. I think it was one that he picked up from the former member for Eden-Monaro, who had that as part of his policy proposals, which he set out to the IPA, and that sank without a trace. 


In April 2016, he said that the tax revolution was not going to happen, and that was April Fools' Day. So, no doubt, that was very appropriate on 1 April. And then there was 'super tax episode 2', where he tried to outlift Labor by increasing super contribution rates for anybody earning over $180,000. That died. Turnbull thought about building a high-speed rail revolution in 2016, and that died. Then, in May 2016, we had 'super tax episode 3', where he talked about having another go at raising more revenue by fiddling with people's super. That confused everybody, in particular, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, who was unable to explain that on radio, famously. In May 2016, both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister announced corporate tax cuts over a period of 10 years, which has absolutely no chance of happening. Then the Prime Minister crashed that plane into a mountain. It became a complete disaster when he tried to do an interview on that regarding the costings. In August 2016, he announced that he wanted to change the GST distribution system, and many interpreted that to mean that he was going to improve Western Australia's share of the GST. Actually, that wasn't what was proposed. He left them trying to work out exactly what was being proposed, and we still don't know, frankly. 


It's a terrible record of his time in government. At the same time, we all know the 2014 budget was cruel, vindictive. It really hurt the most vulnerable in our community. People think maybe the government have walked away from that. Well, a lot of those things are still floating around in subsequent budgets, like raising the pension age to 70 and trying to cut the energy supplement for our pensioners. Now we see their cuts to education and health, which is, to be clear, the cuts to the funding that was flowing from Labor under the health and hospital agreement and Gonski. There has definitely been a cut relative to that funding that was flowing. So they can't pretend there hasn't been. The idea that they're increasing their funding is like saying: 'We'll take four wheels off your car and we'll put one back on, so we're raising the funding. You should be grateful.' That is the classic style of this government. It's all been mythology.


I'm proud of Labor's budget initiatives, which would include bringing back a better hospital fund of $2.8 billion. Health is a big issue in my region. MRI scan facilities in hospitals would be really well received. There is what we want to do with private health insurance. Our initiatives in particular for TAFE—it is so essential for the workforce of the future—would be really well received. I'd love to talk more about the chaos in shipbuilding, which has increased since the last time I recited those issues, the OPV being the latest disaster in that space, which the Audit Office has highlighted, and also this mix-and-match effort the government have tried to make—it has been a disaster. So they're wasting a lot of money in that space. 


On the Snowy 2.0 project, I'd like to point out that in the Marsden Jacob Associates report on the feasibility of Snowy Hydro 2.0, their own flagship proposal—which actually wasn't theirs;  it was Snowy's—clearly sets out that, in order for Snowy 2.0 to be feasible, to be most successful in the new economic environment, you have to have an ambitious renewable energy target. They set out a long-term commitment of 60 per cent renewables by 2040. So the very report that establishes the viability, the economics and the market dynamics of Snowy Hydro 2.0 points out you have to have Labor's ambitious renewable energy targets to make it substantially a financial goer. 


In the time that I have left I would like to briefly comment on the issue of the malarial medicines, which has been very significant for veterans in recent times. A lot of our veterans suffered from effectively what was experimentation with new drugs. I was very fortunate in all my deployments to have used the drug doxycycline before these new experimentations came in. But we're now seeing a really significant issue emerging about the effects of those experimental drugs known as the quinolones family, including tafenoquine. I've had long discussions and communications with Stuart McCarthy, the president of the quinolone veterans and families group, and also Professor Jane Quinn of Charles Sturt University, who's working with that family group and helping the families and veterans. 


We really need to see some more vigorous action in this space. We need to get down to the nuts and bolts of how the big drug companies have been working in this space, because we've got some real suspicions and issues around that. We need to have a claims process that is cleaned up here. We know the UK are already accepting some claims in this space. It's really the neuropsychological aspects that have to be resolved very quickly now. We need an open and transparent outreach program that's a cooperative venture between the VVCS, DVA and veterans as soon as possible. We're really keen to work with the government on this issue. We would like to see Darren Chester, the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, meet with Stuart McCarthy and Jane Quinn. There's a lot of material that they've put together, which is available to any journalist. It's been sent to the government. If any journalist would like to reach out to me to get that material, I have copies of it. This is very serious, because we've had issues of perhaps an interconnection with suicides and other neurological problems as well as physiological problems. This process needs to be resolved; it needs to be open and transparent. We need to engage closely with the veterans groups and the professor and medical experts on this and get it resolved. I've been pleased to work with retired Colonel Ray Martin in Townsville on this. He's been really vigorous and hardworking on behalf of veterans in this space. 


The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, and other members of Labor have been very engaged on this issue, including the member for Herbert, Cath O'Toole, in particular, with so many veterans in her space, and Shayne Neumann. They have all been very vigorous in working with me and engaging with Amanda Rishworth, our shadow minister for veterans' affairs. They are all really determined to make sure we get a result on this. We're not in government, so that is obviously a big constriction, but we've been happy to try and reach out to ministers in the government; there have been so many of them in the veterans space, so hopefully we get some stability with my good friend the member for Gippsland, who I know will be concerned to do the right thing here. Obviously it's a big challenge getting your head around this whole issue with the family of quinolone medicines. We should draw on the examples and evidence emerging from overseas, but we need to do our own inquiry on this, and we need to do it deep and we need to do it fast. We need to see that happening now. I urge the government to engage with Stuart McCarthy and Jane Quinn at the earliest possible opportunity. We really do need to get the Specialist Medical Review Council review embracing the issues in relation to support for the veterans and families. But there is a bigger story to be told here that the veterans groups and families are concerned with in relation to how drug companies have operated and the various suspicions and concerns about that in relation to the information that's available on the impact and effect of these drugs. 


We also need Defence to be much more rigorous in how it implements new drugs in these spaces. I know, from talking to fellow veterans who deployed with me to Iraq for example, that some people who took the drugs and vaccinations related to the chemical weapons threat we faced there now suffer some of the severe side effects of those drugs. We need Defence to be really careful with this stuff in the future. We're talking about people here, not guinea pigs, and I think we're united across the aisles here on wanting to see something happen urgently in this space.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:05):  I endorse and support the comments that were made by the previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro. As someone who had responsibility for that issue during the previous term in my shadow capacity, I understand the distress and strain that it's causing in sectors of the veteran community. I endorse the comments by the member for Eden-Monaro, particularly the call for action by the government. They've been sitting on their hands on this issue for too long. I support and congratulate the member for Eden-Monaro for that contribution, and I endorse what he said, particularly because I was involved in that in my shadow capacity in my last term.


I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the five appropriation bills today, particularly as these are the bills that provide appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of government and allow for the implementation of the 2018-19 budget measures. It was only last night that I spoke in the second reading debate of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill. I talked about the lack of equity and the lack of fairness, especially for women, in this budget, and how it is, unfortunately, typical of what we expect from our colleagues opposite.


When I was discussing that bill I used the opportunity to again call out the government's appalling record on attracting women into its ranks, its appalling record not just in the House of Representatives but also the Senate, and its appalling record for getting rid of women and replacing them with men. I spoke about my concern, my deep concern—my rage actually—about the member for Ryan being dumped for a younger male colleague. I also expressed my concern about the member for Gilmore, and the fact that her preselection was being challenged. I was pleased to see this morning that the issue of the member for Gilmore has actually been fixed. There has been an intervention there, and we are going to continue to see a woman in the ranks there. Those opposite, their record on women is appalling. As I said last night, what part of 51 per cent of the population do you not understand? So I just wanted to put on the record that I was actually pleased for the member for Gilmore to see that news today. It's such a tragedy though that there was no intervention for the member for Ryan. It's a huge loss to the government's expertise.


Labor's women's budget statement noted that in the Treasurer's budget speech there wasn't a single mention of Australian women. There is nothing in the budget that directly addresses women's structural economic disadvantages. Is it really that surprising, given the fact that there are so few women actually in the government who are advising on women's issues, who are challenging policies and suggesting that women actually be considered in the whole process? Their numbers are appalling anyway, and they're actually getting rid of women rather than adding to the numbers—it's just breathtaking. We've got this complete disdain for women, this complete contempt for women, not just borne out in the budget but also in the preselection actions of those opposite, and, as usual, complete and utter contempt and disdain for Canberra.


In last year's budget, Canberra received a dismal 0.004 per cent of the national infrastructure spend, and in this year's budget we received a pathetic 0.02 per cent share. At least that's an improvement from the 0.004 per cent of the spend last year, but I remind Canberrans that the spend was $3 million—whoop dee-doo!—and it was for facilities and maintenance. We're not talking roads here and we're not talking buildings here; we're talking about upgrading of lighting and facilities. And—oh!—there was a review as well. That was regarded as an infrastructure spend by those opposite.


With such a paltry share of the national infrastructure spend last year and this year, it should come as no surprise to Canberrans that they are also being left behind by this government when it comes to the NBN rollout, which is a major infrastructure project for all of Australia. I really don't think I have to remind Canberrans about that. My community suffers some of the worst internet speeds in the country. Almost two years ago I launched the 'Send Me Your Speeds' campaign to get firsthand information about how bad our internet speeds are. Since then, I've shared the experiences of hundreds of Canberrans who are struggling to run businesses, who are struggling to study at home or who are struggling to engage in banking and communication with download and upload speeds of less than one megabit per second.


Canberra has faced countless problems with the NBN rollout under this government—delay after delay, woeful internet speeds and a patchwork of technology, some within the same street. In Canberra we've got fibre to the node, fibre to the premises and fibre to the kerb, often in one street, and a broken technology choice program. The list goes on of the abysmal rollout of the NBN here in Canberra.


Canberra is frustrated about the endless promises from those opposite that have not been delivered. They're frustrated, because the government has overpromised and underdelivered once again. Canberra was nothing more than a big blank space on the NBN rollout map until early last year. After tireless campaigning for my community, we finally managed to get onto the rollout map, and Canberra was looking forward to getting decent internet speeds. We were due for NBN rollout in the first half of this year, but then the goalposts moved and we were advised that the NBN was going to roll out at the end of this year. The utter disregard for Canberra continued with yet another delay. Some areas now won't be connected until some time between June and September next year. It took forever for us to get on the NBN rollout map, and I thank the community for working with me to get us, finally, onto the rollout map. This is the national capital, and here we were as just one big blank space on the NBN rollout map for way too long. Then, when we finally get on the rollout map, to great excitement and looking forward to it actually coming, what do we get? Delay, after delay, after delay, after delay. While the rollout happens on the north side of Canberra and the infrastructure is duplicated in central Canberra, most suburbs on the south side, particularly in the south-east part of Tuggeranong, are forced to wait and wait and wait. It's a slap in the face for the Tuggeranong suburbs expecting to be connected this year. It's a kick in the guts for the people looking forward to finally having an internet service that the government tells them will work.


As I said, I have been running this 'Send Me Your Speeds' campaign for some time. I've heard from hundreds of Canberrans, not just in my electorate but also from right across the ACT, and the feedback has been mind-blowing. Here, in the nation's capital in 2018, we have households fewer than 15 kilometres from Parliament House that are getting less than one megabit per second download speeds. We're talking particularly about south-east Tuggeranong. One person wrote to me about her ADSL plan, running at about 38 megabits per second download and 0.81 upload with no dropouts. She said: 'We recently installed a wireless video doorbell. It will not work properly as it needs an upload speed of at least two megabits per second.' So her internet speeds are so woeful that she can't even run a doorbell to her home. That's how bad it is: she can't even run a doorbell here in parts of Canberra, because the internet speeds are that bad.


Merryn, who lives in Conder, told me she's unable to watch streaming services or listen to music online with her speed of 3.73 megabits per second. Jane in Farrer gets a download speed of 0.89 megabits per second. Jason in Narrabundah gets a pathetic speed. Poor old Jason! I've documented Jason many a time. Listen to this. We're talking Narrabundah—five kays from here, if that. Five kays from Parliament House, poor old Jason, in Narrabundah in the nation's capital in 2018, is getting a pathetic 0.25 megabits per second.


The Canberra homes that have been connected to the NBN used to think they were the lucky ones. 'Finally,' they thought, 'this is the world-class internet that the Turnbull government has been promising me.' But it hasn't taken long for them to start tearing their hair out because of the frustrating, unreliable and out-of-date technology they've received. Thomas in Kambah says that, while his internet speeds have improved slightly on fibre-to-the-node NBN, it's a never-ending cycle of dropouts. First, there's no internet, so he reports it to his internet service provider. They monitor the connection and eventually they refer the issue to NBN. After a few days, the situation improves for a short time. And then the dropouts start again. Since switching to the NBN—again, this is breathtaking; this is in the nation's capital, in 2018, probably 10 to 15 kays from Parliament House—the longest time his internet has been running before it drops out is one day and 10 hours. This poor man has had an internet connection that has been consistent for one day and 10 hours—and, I can assure you, he is counting. With internet speeds delivered on the NBN that can't even operate a doorbell, how are Australian businesses—especially small businesses, especially in my electorate, only five, 10 or 15 kilometres from Parliament House—meant to achieve the success that they've been promised by this government and particularly by this Prime Minister?


This government has also created a digital divide in Canberra with its patchwork of technology, its second-rate copper and its lack of transparency in the rollout decisions. After campaigning tirelessly to get Canberra on the map, our next hurdle is the technology patchwork. A majority of homes in Canberra will get fibre to the node under the current NBN rollout, with some receiving fibre to the curb. Some homes may even be getting fibre to the premises. As I said, there are examples where we've got fibre to the curb, fibre to the premises and fibre to the node all in one street. Many people are reporting issues and slow speeds with the existing ADSL service, which relies on the existing copper lines.


So the question is: is there an upgrade plan for these copper lines? Who knows. When we ask these questions, we can't get any detail. During Senate estimates in February 2017, NBN Co said that there was no capital set aside to upgrade copper lines. So there's no detail in terms of what's actually happening there. At the moment there seems to be no money set aside for copper lines, and so that's just too bad for those who are experiencing these appalling speeds thanks to copper, because there is no plan, or no detail of any plan, for an upgrade to copper lines.


Fibre to the node is not new or impressive, and, as far as internet technologies go, it doesn't set the world on fire. It was initially deployed back in 2005, and countries such as Germany, the UK and New Zealand are now replacing the service with the more reliable fibre to the premises. Just think about that: it has been 13 years since this technology was first deployed internationally, and the countries that have deployed it have since moved on—they've upgraded. And what are we doing? We're building a second-rate copper NBN that costs more and does less. It's just breathtaking how this government expects us to be an innovation nation when we're dealing with this sort of technology based on copper. It's breathtaking.


Canberrans can't get high quality, reliable NBN even when they try. The Technology Choice Program was created to give consumers the choice to upgrade their technology if they were willing to pay for it. But, in addition to constant delays, poor speeds and continuous dropouts, the Technology Choice Program is another failure by this Turnbull government.


Gleneagles Estate has been negotiating with NBN Co for more than two years about upgrading the NBN. The estate currently has fibre to the node, but after consultation most of the residents decided they wanted to upgrade to fibre to the premises. In December 2014 the estate was quoted between $800,000 and $1 million. In 2017 that figure was updated to between $800,000 and $2 million. The estate challenged the figures and a revised amount of $76,000 was required to proceed with the design and quote. Even if you want choice, the cost of getting that choice is ridiculously prohibitive.


Canberrans are absolutely frustrated with this government's lack of a plan for the NBN, the fact we're constantly being delayed in terms of the rollout and the fact we've got this patchwork of technologies. So much for an 'innovation nation'. How can Canberrans do that when they can't even get a service that's going to ring their doorbell?

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:20):  At is heart, this budget, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and related bills, continues what the coalition has been doing from day one, since their election in 2013, which is to continually widen the gap between the haves and the need-mores. The reason I use the term 'need-mores' is that, particularly in the electorate that I represent, people are pretty proud that they can make what they can of what they have, but they clearly need more support. That's the case across Western Sydney. For example, look at the investments that governments should rightly be making—but this coalition has continually neglected—in things like schools, in things like TAFEs, in terms of the infrastructure for the growing area of Western Sydney, one of the fastest growing regions in the country. We still don't see the level of investment that should be there. They should especially be investing in things like hospitals and health care in our area. This budget delivered zip—nothing—particularly for Western Sydney, in a range of those different areas.


This government has committed itself to giving $80 billion to the biggest businesses in this country, it's committed to giving $17 billion to the big banks, and it's already delivered tax cuts of $16,000 to millionaires, but it still can cut to people who need more. It will cut preschool funding, particularly in Chifley, where it still has not been guaranteed to be renewed next year, which might affect just over 2,300 young kids in the Chifley electorate. Schools in Chifley still look set to lose $20 million over 2018 and 2019, because of this government, with its smoke and mirrors, and the defunding that has been occurring through Gonski 2.0. That will affect our area. They cut $3 billion from TAFEs and promised an additional $300 million in cuts this year. They've cut billions from universities, and I've got a big concern about what that does in terms of the University of Western Sydney.


With infrastructure in Western Sydney—as I said, one of the fastest growing regions in the country—the government makes a big deal about the north-south rail it's putting in, yet all it can do is $50 million for a study, when what we really need is a comprehensive approach to people movement in Western Sydney, where our region will rival the other side of the city, the east, in terms of growth. It is likely that 150,000 people will move in, just within the Chifley electorate and to the north of it, through the north-west growth centres—very little there. That's before we even get to talking about the NBN and its failure to keep pace with the local area.


But one of the most disgraceful things the government is doing is that in this budget they will deliver a $5.6 million cut that will affect Mount Druitt Hospital. Basically, it is roughly the same as if you were to cut 13,800 patient appointments—and we are going to see that cut. When you look at this budget, particularly for Chifley, you have cuts to school funding, you have future threats to preschool funding, you have no genuine funding of infrastructure, and you have continued cuts to TAFE—$3 billion, with $300 million extra, which will no doubt affect TAFEs like those in Mount Druitt. And, importantly, you'll see a $5.6 million cut that will affect Mount Druitt Hospital. That's before we even get to the point that there is an MRI in that hospital that has not received a Medicare licence, which would ensure that people aren't paying huge out-of-pocket expenses just to get an MRI scan at their own public hospital. It is an absolute disgrace: a $5.6 million cut, plus no licence for the MRI, sets back people in our area hugely.


In other parts of the budget, what you're seeing now from the coalition concerning job programs is effectively a continuation of the slow march away from the things they wanted to do when they first came into office and a crab walk towards the things Labor said should have happened when we left office and the types of things we've been talking about on the ground with employment service providers as we've moved across the country trying to find out how to make these failing job programs of the government work better. Bear this in mind: when the coalition came in, they were all beating their chests about how they would revamp Work for the Dole. They basically scaled up the number of places to 150,000 per year. They were told that this was way too big a jump, would be counterproductive, and it was questionable whether or not it would happen—and what happened? They started scaling it back. They realised that they'd made a mistake, that they hadn't listened. They put people onto the Work for the Dole at the six-month mark of unemployment, when people were telling them that was way too early. They then moved that from six to 12 months, back to where it should have been. In the last budget they then cut the coordinators that existed to help improve the way the program was going. Has anything been done to improve job outcomes? No. What we've seen as a result is still roughly 10 to 20 per cent of people getting jobs three months after going through the Work for the Dole program. We've seen very little evidence of that.


There's hardly any mention of young people and unemployment in this budget. If anything, the focus on older people and particularly digital skills uplift is what the Labor opposition has been saying publicly, through our discussion with job providers on the ground about getting people ready for the future of work and the impact of technology, should have been happening ages ago. Again, if we suggest an idea and they take it up, we welcome that, but it shows a lack of leadership or ability to think through the problems confronting people.


What a change there has been about innovation! A few years ago we were all agile and nimble—it was an exciting time to be alive—then all the talk faded away and is gone. They have pressed the innovation mute button, and they hardly talk about it. Our side has regularly been pressing the case for this, because you need innovation to drive the growth in new firms and jobs, but the government is trapped in the belief that, if they put out another report or announce another review, that equals innovation. It's garbage. In April 2016 Bill Ferris brought down his report to review the way R&D works in this country, and they only just got around to releasing their response to it—and what did they do? They flagged big cuts to R&D spending. From a government that styled itself as innovative, agile, creative and pro future, we're now seeing massive cuts to the R&D arrangements.


They had some other big announcements—for example, saying that we needed to start thinking more about the application of AI and setting ethical boundaries. They also announced that the DTA would get $700,000 in funding for blockchain. I welcome the ideas, because Labor had been championing them months before. We said last year that Australia should take leadership on the issue of artificial intelligence, and we saw very little out of the government on it, and also that the Digital Transformation Agency should be the central point for applying blockchain within government. We're glad the government have announced these things in their budget, because it's exactly what we've been pushing for.


The real tragedy is that this government rarely thinks ahead. If they're not thinking ahead, they're not planning ahead, and they have pushed acting into the never-never. One group that always has to think ahead is our local venture capital community. They have to have a sense of what's coming in the economy, and they need to be able to test those firms who have ideas that will have the greatest possible benefit to the economy down the track. For years the lack of capital availability to back good ideas in the Australian context has been a big issue. It has become less so recently. For example, in the 2017 year, we've seen capital raisings of about $1.2 billion. It has been fantastic, but we should certainly do more.


For some time, I've been absolutely staggered that our nation's pre-eminent fund, the Future Fund, refused to back local venture capital. It's not like they don't like venture capital; it's just they didn't like Australian venture capital. We have been pressing them since last year to explain this: out of the $2 billion that they put into venture capital, why is it they only invest one to two per cent here? Why is it that taxpayers' dollars can be used to support the growth and evolution of new firms and new jobs offshore, yet we see none of that happening here? In October, when the Future Fund was before estimates, they said that they didn't invest locally because they had doubts about the strength of the local VC community. In fact, the quote from the head of the Future Fund was:


I think one of the things that has held the Australian venture capital industry back is that, frankly, performance hasn't been very good …


Some in the VC community would probably agree with that, but things have changed.


What I found remarkable was that in October, before estimates, the head of the Future Fund said that there are doubts about VC, but his own chief investment officer, just a month before, speaking at the Australian Financial Review's innovation summit, basically castigated everyone else for not backing local VC. In fact, he said it was time for a 'paradigm change'. That's always a good way to get attention. It happens the minute you use that combination of words. Dr Raphael Arndt said at the summit:


To put all your retirement savings on a bet that robust economic growth and lower rates will continue is risky.


He then urged super funds to do more.


Well, in actual fact, Hostplus, AustralianSuper, HESTA, First State Super and all the pesky industry funds that the government likes to target, single out, chastise and harangue—and put in all these new legislative arrangements around and talk down to—have probably put more into local venture capital to back local firms and local jobs than what our own Future Fund has. We had the Future Fund hectoring super funds on one hand and then a month later their own CEO was before estimates saying there are big doubts about local VC performance. That was in October. Suddenly in April, we opened up the Sydney Morning Herald and John McDuling had scored himself an exclusive. Blackbird Ventures—which is a great firm with a great investment portfolio and which is backed by a lot of great Australian tech entrepreneurs—had suddenly scored some money out of the Future Fund. I absolutely congratulate the Future Fund for this. As has been revealed in estimates, Blackbird Ventures have scored anywhere between $20 million to $30 million to back locals. That is good.


Some things that came out of estimates were interesting. There were two things in particular. The Future Fund has outsourced decisions about which of the local VCs they'll back to Greenspring Associates. I don't have a problem with capable outfits making those decisions. They have to because of the quantum involved. But the thing I know, moving in this environment for a number of years now, is that VC tends to have a view—I've seen it, even when I have travelled in the United States—that they will only take a greater interest based on geographic proximity—that is, the closer your firm with the proposition wanting the money is to the location of the VC. They generally tend to back it that way. I don't know how many times Greenspring Associates will be out to Australia and if they've set themselves up here to do the local scoping work of the local venture capital market, but I have to say this is something we will keep an eye on. Labor has been pressing the Future Fund to do more in this space. If Greenspring Associates only does an occasional visit to Australia that might occasionally lead to one article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald about one VC that managed to score $20 million to $30 million out of the Future Fund, then there will be more questions asked by us.


The second thing that is not very clear from the head of the Future Fund, who appeared before estimates, is where they're going to go. For a group that is so fixed on stats, numbers and the concrete, they have not been forthcoming about how they will move from the one per cent to two per cent mark of current local investment from a $2 billion venture capital pool to something better. You would expect better. Don't get me wrong, I think what they're doing is good. We're not advocating a mandate and forcing them to do that. We certainly recognise you have to be very prudent about applying funds in this space, because it is a high-risk class. But the point is this: if the Future Fund has accepted the asset class and if the Future Fund has accepted investing $2 billion in venture capital, then clearly the appetite is there. If they get similar return rates here to what they're getting overseas, it is absolutely incumbent on our nation's Future Fund to back local venture capital.


This is me as a Labor MP arguing this, but a lot of our crew know that you need to back new firms with new ideas to put new drive into an economy that hasn't behaved the same since the GFC. We do need to be clear that Labor will push for this because we see a longer term economic benefit. If we see Greenspring turn up only once a year to scope out local VC and we see only one or two announcements made just to stop the hounding of the Future Fund, that not only is wrong in the short term but is denying us longer term economic prosperity. We will be fixed on this issue longer term.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:35):  I've got to say that, out of all the budgets that I've seen, this budget has the cruellest hoax attached to it. The cruel hoax is on the hopes and dreams of Australians. We see a budget that follows on from other budgets of the Abbott government and the Turnbull government. In the early ones we saw cuts to a whole range of things. For example, in the 2014-15 budget we saw in my own state over $60 billion of cuts to health. That was in one state. You can see the trickle-down effect that this has when you are in a public bed in a hospital. It has effects on it.


This budget is a hoax and a con. It says one thing but does another. It's a budget that continues making cuts to pensioners, hospitals, schools and universities and has new cuts for the ABC—the national icon, something that is revered by all Australians—and TAFE at the same time. We know that young people and mature-age people need skills to get into the workforce. TAFE has served us very well over the years. It skills up people who perhaps left school early or whose life, for whatever reason, took them in a different direction. TAFE skills them and assists them to get back into the workforce. They get a certificate. It's a stepping stone to bigger and better things.


This is a budget that delivers to the big end of town, to big business, while at the same time making cuts to some of our most vulnerable people. Let's have a look at this budget. It wants to deliver an $80 billion tax cut for the richest end of town, for the banks and the multinationals. Seventeen of those major companies pay no tax at all and yet they're going to be the recipients of the $80 billion tax cut. At the very same time as we're giving out $80 billion we're taking away the $14 a fortnight supplement from pensioners, from people who earn a mere pension, have a Commonwealth care card and struggle to keep a budget—and many do tighten their belts to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. We are taking away $14 a fortnight from those people. At the same time we're giving Australia's richest end of town $80 billion. I don't see how this is right and I don't see how this is fair. It is very un-Australian.


When I think of that scenario I just put to this place—the $80 billion tax cut and the cut to pensioners—the only thing that comes to mind is that this government wants to deliver radical right-wing policies. It is basically a wish list of big business, entrepreneurs who are wanting to make big bucks. It's their demand on the government. I cannot see any other reason for it, apart from the ideological reason.


As I said, it started in 2014 with the budgets of the Abbott government and it has continued. We have seen attacks on trade unions and the Human Rights Commission. Even a policy came in to water down section 18C of our racial discrimination laws. They backed off on that, not because they thought it was wrong but because they didn't have the numbers in the Senate to pass a bill that would have made it easier for people to discriminate against other people in this nation.


We have always been a nation that has put egalitarianism, fairness and equality before anything else in this nation, and that's why we have become the nation that we are—those things have been fundamental to our democracy. They've been fundamental to the way that we are as a culture here in Australia. And here you had a government that wanted to water down the Racial Discrimination Act to make it easier for people to attack other people on a race basis. There is only one reason for that, and that is an ideological right-wing mentality. That is the only reason a government would go down that track. 


We even saw the introduction of the deregulation of university course fees and the introduction of $100,000 up-front fees for people. Last year it was the company tax cuts, which have already delivered, as we heard from the previous speaker, $17 billion to the banks—at a time when we're hearing before the royal commission about banks charging the accounts of deceased people and meddling in children's bank accounts. This year, we see the radical proposal for a flat tax for people earning incomes between $40,000 and $200,000. So, if you're a cleaner working on $40,000 a year—subsidising the family's income because it may be part-time work, or it may be the only income you have—you will be asked to pay the same tax as most of us in this, who are on much more, pay. The flat tax for someone on $40,000 and someone on $200,000 will be the same. 


I, like other members on this side in this place, know that we live in one of the best countries in the world, and, as I said before, in a country that has always been fair. Our families—in my case—chose to make Australia home, and we're all proud to serve our local communities. And it's not just us who recognise what a great country we live in: our capital cities, such as Adelaide, where I come from, and Perth and Melbourne consistently rate in the top 10 liveable cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. This has come to be because of the way that we have been for years. It's come to be because of the equality that we've had, the equality that we've always strived for to ensure that we are a nation where people respect one another, regardless of whether you're a cleaner or a professor. We have this great equality in Australia, and we don't want to see it watered down, which is exactly what this government was doing with 18C. 


I don't think it's fair, as I said, for cleaners, aged-care workers, hospitality workers or retail workers to have their penalty rates cut. We know that this is the direction this government wants to go down. We know that someone who is working on weekends, who is giving up family time, shouldn't be penalised by having their penalty rates cut. It is wrong. Our progressive tax system in this nation has served us extremely well over the years, and it is one of the bedrocks of our system. It ensures that we have fairness in our society, based on the idea that those with greater means should contribute a little more. There's nothing wrong in that, and that's the way that this nation has operated for many years. It's a system that's served us well and will continue to serve us well.


Labor will deliver. On this side of the House, we will deliver a fairer system, a system that takes those things into perspective. We will deliver a bigger, a better and a fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians. That's almost double what the government has offered. We can afford to do more to help because we're not giving that $80 billion tax cut to the richest end of town. We're not delivering $17 billion to the banks and $80 billion across the board to some of the richest people in this country. That's why we can afford to have a bigger, better and fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians that is, as I said, double the amount that the government has offered. 


I am a member who represents an electorate with one of the largest proportions of people over the age of 65,  and I know that my colleague the member for Richmond also has a very similar electorate. In fact, when we came into this House, we were competing about who had the highest proportion of people aged over 65, and we were  always neck and neck. So I know that the member for Richmond understands the needs of older Australians, as we all do on this side. 


We know that they've worked all their lives, that they have contributed to this nation and that we now benefit from the fruits of the life that they lived and the contributions that they made. In many cases, they fought in wars to enable us to live the lives that we do. And all they're asking for is some dignity in their old age. What do I mean by providing dignity? Well, they need aged-care facilities that are appropriate facilities, and services that will look after them. Certainly, we know that extra home care packages are needed.


The aged-care announcement for older Australians that the minister made on budget night was one of the biggest cons that I've seen since I saw the movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin and Michael Caine. We know that 14,000 extra places were given in this budget, but we know that there's 100,000 people on the waiting list for aged-care packages. We know that the rate for people needing aged-care packages rises by approximately 10,000 per quarter. So we've already got 100,000 people on a waiting list for an aged-care package so that they can be looked after at home, because they're old and frail, but the list is growing currently, and it's growing at a rate of about 10,000 per quarter. So in 12 months that list will be 120,000.


The government has offered 14,000 packages and the list is still growing. This is the greatest con job that I've ever seen in terms of an announcement. It just doesn't make sense. If we really want to get to the bottom of the problem we have to offer many, many more packages. And it's not fair. When we look at the detail of what they've proposed, it is paid for through cuts to residential care. They've taken money away from residential care and will barely make a dent in the waiting list. As I said, the figures we had recently showed there were 20,000 places in the last six months. So we've got 100,000 and it grows by 10,000 every quarter, then we announce 14,000 places and it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. To me, that's a con job. It's an absolutely terrible trick to play on older Australians.


Apart from that, at the same time we're taking away the $14 energy supplement that assists them to pay their energy bills and which they receive every fortnight in their pension. At the same time as that, $80 billion is going to the richest end of town, to the people who, in their minds, need it the most. I can't work that out. And, of course, they're increasing the aged pension eligibility for someone to be eligible for an aged pension at the age of 70.


If this government wants to talk about our older Australians, I'm very proud to have listened to them. I listen to people every day who tell me how they struggle to survive and to live on a pension. These are people who have actually worked damn hard for their entire lives, and they do so still in the way that they look after grandkids, are a part of our community as volunteers and have contributed so much to this nation. I know so because I've held ageing forums with the shadow minister—the former minister, the member for Port Adelaide—in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I've advocated for a better and fairer go for those who need help. After giving so much to this nation, the least we could do is to give them some dignity in their old age.


We will be judged as a nation in the future by the way that we have looked after our elderly. We see some reports coming out in the media, where some of the aged-care facilities are allocating $6 a day for food—$6 a day for food! We saw that report recently, and that is a disgrace. It's something that governments should be investigating and looking into immediately.


Recently, I was contacted by a carer on behalf of her mother, who lives in the western suburbs of my electorate. She's lived in her house since the mid-1950s. She went through the process of an assessment and had ACAT approval in December 2015 for a level 3 to 4 package. My constituent has become frustrated and had to continue to follow up with the department, but to no avail. After raising this matter continuously we've finally secured a package, and she is receiving the support and respite that she deserves. So why does it require ministerial intervention to get a result? And what about those who don't speak up? It's just not right.


Labor in government has a proud record, a very proud record, of delivering for older Australians. I will continue to deliver, as will the member for Richmond, who is sitting next to me, and the member for Bruce, who I know has a big population of older Australians in his electorate. It is something that we on this side think is one of the most important things—that is, to give back to those that gave their entire lives for the next generation of Australians to live the wonderful lives that we have in this nation.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (11:50):  I too rise to speak on the appropriation bills. As many speakers on this side have pointed out, we do support the bills in the same way that convention has dictated for many years that we support supply; however, we also point out how our priorities are very different from those of the government. It must be stated that this budget, like every other one brought down by this Liberal-Nationals government, fundamentally and unequivocally fails the fairness test.


There will be an impact from this budget on my electorate. This budget puts big business and the banks ahead of the battlers on the North Coast. This National Party budget gives away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, including $17 billion for the big banks, and it makes locals pay for it with savage cuts to schools, hospitals and pensions. That's what the National Party have done with this budget. In fact, they own it.


The budget fails the fairness test on so many levels. It fails the fairness test on pensioners. The government is cutting the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight, and forcing people to keep working until they're 70. It fails the fairness test on education. The government is still cutting $17 billion from schools, and it now has $270 million in new cuts to TAFE. It fails the fairness test on hospitals. The government's cuts means Australians will be left on hospital waiting lists for much longer. It also fails the fairness test on Medicare. The government's freeze on the rebate for specialists means that Australians will pay more when they visit the doctor.


It's important to note that, on the back of the best global economic conditions in more than a decade, this government has failed the fiscal responsibility test it set for itself. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Abbott-Turnbull government came into office in 2013, and this year's deficit is 6½ times bigger than the Liberals and Nationals predicted in their first budget, their horror budget, of 2014—and we all remember that one! This budget is wrong in its priorities and it fails every test of fairness and every test of fiscal responsibility.


Pensioners and seniors in my electorate on the New South Wales North Coast are some of the biggest losers when it comes to this budget. The government is keeping the unfair plan to increase Australia's pension age to 70, meaning we'll have one of the oldest pension ages in the world. And it's important to know that in every single budget that the Liberals and Nationals have handed down they've tried to cut the pension in order to cut taxes for big business. Pensioners remember that the government tried to cut the pension indexation, a cut that would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of pensioners. They also remember that the Liberals and Nationals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension for around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. Budgets are all about choices, and once again the Prime Minister has chosen the banks and the big end of town over Australia's pensioners.


When it comes to health, Labor are the party that believe in universal health care, and we're determined to fix our hospitals. The Liberals and Nationals have cut funding for Medicare and hospitals in every year since they first got into government after the 2013 election. The budget fails in the hospital and healthcare area on a very large scale. At the same time they're giving that big tax cut to big business, they're persisting with their cruel $715 million cut to hospitals over the next two years and they're keeping their Medicare rebate freeze in place for years to come. This is forcing up out-of-pocket costs to see specialists. They've also failed to do anything to address the private health insurance affordability crisis and they've failed to adopt Labor's plan to scrap the unfair and discriminatory tampon tax. This budget proves yet again that the government cares more about tax cuts for big business and multimillionaires than it does about the health of ordinary Australians.


Meanwhile, their hospital cuts are putting doctors, nurses and hospital staff under increasing pressure, forcing delays in surgeries and making emergency department waiting times even worse. Contrast this with Labor's plans. We're committed to building better hospitals, with record funding for beds, doctors and nurses, and we've announced our plan to cap health insurance premium price rises at two per cent for two years. Labor's better hospitals fund will see a $2.8 billion extra investment, fully reversing the Turnbull government's cuts, and we'll be funding more beds in emergency departments and wards, more doctors, more nurses and more health staff. The funding will be targeted at reducing emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, which have blown out under this government.


A Shorten Labor government will also ensure more communities have affordable access to life-saving scans, expanding Medicare subsidised access to diagnostic imaging in areas where there are shortages. We'll invest $80 million to boost the number of eligible MRI machines and approve 20 new licences, which means half a million more scans will be funded by Medicare. This is vitally important for regional communities such as mine. Labor's commitment will mean more affordable scans for Australians, addressing shortages in communities that need them the most. 


Also, as I've mentioned, many parts of Australian society are suffering because of this government's wrong priorities. On the North Coast of New South Wales, in particular, there is a homelessness crisis and a housing affordability crisis. Our state National Party MPs have done nothing to alleviate this crisis at a state level, and their federal mates just make it even worse. The Turnbull government's budget has again failed to deliver anything that will actually alleviate either the housing or the homelessness crisis. The government continues to ignore those young Australians who are seeking to purchase their first home by refusing to adopt our changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. 


Let's have a look at their record. Since coming to government in 2013, the Liberal-National government has presided over a crisis in which home ownership rates for young Australians have collapsed to their lowest level in the 30 years. Fewer than 40 per cent own their own home compared with 60 per cent just a generation ago. Rental stress has risen substantially. Anglicare's recent Rental Affordability Snapshot has revealed that less than three per cent of private rental dwellings are affordable for a single person on the minimum wage. Data from the 2016 census has revealed that the number of Australians experiencing homelessness has dramatically risen by 13.7 per cent since 2011. Those are damaging statistics. 


I make the point that, despite the gross inaction of the Liberal-National government, in my electorate and in many others there are remarkable people, institutions and organisations that are doing great work when it comes to homelessness. One such person is John Lee, the president and founder of You Have A Friend. He has 80 volunteers providing over 300 meals a week to the homeless and marginalised in my region. He gets no assistance from any government agency to do that. I always like to congratulate John and those like him who do a wonderful job out there. 


Another area that is subject to the government's cruel cuts is aged-care services. The budget has revealed a cruel hoax at the centre of the government's aged-care plan. The government is slashing residential care to try and fix the home care crisis it created. The fact is that there is no new money at all in the budget for the funding of home care and residential aged care. More than 21,000 residential aged care places will be cut over the next three years to pay for the very small increase in the number of home care packages, and none of this will solve the crisis in home care created by the government: 3½ thousand places a year will not keep pace with demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017. In my electorate, we have a very high proportion of seniors. This is a huge issue. They are desperately trying to get home care packages, and we've just seen cuts by this government.


Another harsh cut is that to the ABC. We all remember on the eve of the 2013 election that the member for Warringah, then the opposition leader who was to become the Prime Minister, said that there would be no cuts to the ABC. That is what he said. It turned out to be another broken promise. The government imposed cuts of over $250 million on the ABC, and now the current Prime Minister's budget contains a further $127 million in cuts to the ABC. The government just keeps proceeding with cuts to the ABC. The government has also frozen indexation of operational funding for the ABC, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. What this means in reality at the ABC is cuts to jobs, cuts to content and cuts to services. This will have a devastating impact across the country, but particularly in the regions where we value so much our local ABC and the services it provides. It's another shameful cut by this government.


Also, under this government, education at all levels is under threat, yet again. The Prime Minister and his Liberal-National government insist on giving handouts to big business at the expense of our children's education and wellbeing. When it comes to preschools, our youngest minds are facing uncertainty, with around 350,000 preschools and families facing the prospect of absolutely no further provision of new funding. It means one of two things: fees will increase or services will close. Next year, families will have to start paying for their children to start preschool, without any certainty that the preschools will be funded. One in four families will be worse off come 2 July, under the Turnbull government's unfair childcare package. We believe education is an essential part of a child's development, but this government doesn't. It prefers to put big business before Australian families. 


The government continues its assault on education with its schools policy. Its policy is not needs based, it's not sector-blind and it's certainly not fair. In contrast to the government, we're fully committed to the fair funding of our schools and, in particular, our public schools. In government, Labor will restore every dollar of the $17 billion that the Liberals and Nationals have cut from schools. Under Labor the neediest schools will get the biggest funding increases in the fastest time. Our public schools are among the nation's most important institutions, and one of the most fundamental responsibilities of any government should be to ensure public schools are fairly funded to deliver quality education.


There are government cuts for our TAFE students as well. The government cut funding for skills and TAFE in order to pay for those big business tax handouts. The budget cuts an extra $270 million from TAFE and training. That's on top of the $3 billion of cuts in previous budgets—shameful! In contrast, Labor will invest in TAFE, skills, vocational education and higher education. Under us the number of Australians getting a university education will soar by about 200,000, thanks to our plan to abolish the Turnbull government's unfair cap on student places. Australia's future depends so much on properly investing in our preschools, schools, TAFEs and universities so that all of them can deliver the best quality education to all of our students.


Labor's approach to budget tax cuts is much fairer for middle Australia, and so much fairer for locals on the North Coast in my electorate. We're proud of our much fairer tax plan that will deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians across the country. A Shorten Labor government will be guided by clear fiscal principles, including repairing the budget in a fair way that doesn't ask the most vulnerable Australians to carry the heaviest burden. The Turnbull government's budget makes those most vulnerable people carry the heaviest burden. We'll more than offset new spending with savings and revenue improvements. Our plan is much fairer and more responsible because we've made all the right calls when it comes to tax reform.


As well as making those correct calls, we will also, as I've said, deliver extra funding for public hospitals and 20 new MRI machines to regional centres and outer suburbs, and abolish the Prime Minister's cap on university places and the up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places in courses where Australia needs the skills. That is a major commitment which is very important for training. We can deliver all these commitments across all those areas because of our choices and priorities. Unlike the Prime Minister and this Liberal-National government, we won't give out $80 billion in tax handouts to big business and the banks; we will particularly prioritise areas like education, health and hospitals.


The extent of some cuts in another area was only revealed yesterday—that is, the government's cutting of over 500 Australian Federal Police staff. As a former police officer I feel strongly about this. Yesterday we heard damning evidence at Senate estimates, which exposed the impact of the Prime Minister's savage cuts to the Australian Federal Police. At yesterday's hearing it was confirmed by the AFP Commissioner that there would be a $205 million cut to resourcing the AFP over the forward estimates. There's a cut of over 500 Australian Federal Police staff. That is a huge number when it comes to resources within the Federal Police. Instead of supporting those dedicated officers in the AFP to perform their critically important work, the Liberals and Nationals have chosen to cut AFP funding and slash over 500 staff. It is truly shameful that our AFP are being cut so harshly.


In conclusion I specifically note the role of the National Party in this harsh budget. They're wholly responsible for these cruel measures and how they affect the regions. The National Party own all the cuts and harsh measures. The Nationals have abandoned the people of the regions in areas like mine, the New South Wales North Coast. We will spend every single day up until the next election reminding people in the country, the regions and rural Australia that the National Party has abandoned them. This National Party budget gives away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business—including, very importantly, $17 billion for the big banks. It makes local people in regional and rural Australia pay for it with savage cuts to schools, hospitals and pensioners. That's what the National Party have done with their budget. They can go out to country Australia and explain why they have $80 billion for tax cuts, including $17 billion for the big banks, why funding for their schools, their hospitals and their ABC has been cut, and why there is no funding to support homeless people, education and other important services. I can tell you what people in regional and rural Australia will say to them: 'We've had enough of you. You've abandoned us. You're looking after the top end of the town and not people in rural and regional Australia.'


I can tell you this: the people who do look after those in regional and rural Australia are us; that's the Labor Party. We stand with them. We stand with those ordinary battlers who are doing it tough out there. That's our priority. You've got the Turnbull Liberal-National government, and their priority is big business and the banks. It's pretty straightforward. Labor's priority is the battlers, the working class, the middle class and people doing it tough. We stand with them, and we certainly stand with them in regional and rural Australia. We'll continue to do that. Every day up until the next election we'll be doing that, particularly across the country, and we'll be reminding them what the National Party have done to them with their support of this unfair budget.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (12:05):  I rise to speak on the appropriation bills, which are the Turnbull government's decisions about how they will tax Australians and how they will spend Australians' tax dollars once they've collected them. Just like budgets past, they deliver a clear picture of what the Turnbull government stands for. This, sadly, is a coalescence of no vision. They have no vision at all. Contrary to the rhetoric from the Treasurer on budget night, the Prime Minister in the media and every single government MP speaking on the bill, the Liberal and National Party do not stand for fairness. Fairness is not a quality you can fake, fairness is not a quality you can rote learn and fairness is not a quality you can trot out when it suits your political interests in the electoral cycle and then shove far down in the bottom drawer. Fairness comes from the heart and not from a focus group. It's a set of values and a belief that informs every decision you make.


I want to use this speech today to go through some of the elements of this budget, piece by piece, to explain exactly how out of touch the Turnbull government is when it comes to policies that damage Australia and do not set out a clear future. What we have is a budget that is slightly less cruel than other coalition budgets, but it is yet another attempt by the coalition to trick Australians into believing that the coalition care about everyone rather than just the top end of town. The government's fiscal strategy, as unveiled in 2014, has failed. Federal government gross debt has surged from $310 billion in 2014 to over $534 billion this year. Net debt, as a share of GDP, has risen from 13.1 per cent in 2013 to a disgraceful nearly 20 per cent this year. If the coalition government ever claims that they're competent economic managers, Australians need to tell them that they're dreaming.


This budget, yet again, demonstrates the failure of the Turnbull government to properly fund frontline health services, particularly hospitals and Medicare. Fundamentally, the Turnbull government does not care about the health of Australians; they believe it should be a private responsibility. The Turnbull government doesn't care about protecting our wonderful public health system. It does not fundamentally believe in Medicare. Health fairness is not in the DNA of the coalition government. This government is ripping $160 million out of Queensland public hospitals. What's that the equivalent of? It's the equivalent of 240,000 emergency department visits or 44,000 cataract extractions that can change someone's life. It's the equivalent of 6,150 knee replacements, which might enable someone to go back to work, or 26,500 births. That's a lot of money. It will affect every Queenslander and every Queensland family. The next time someone is cradling one of their children or sitting with a loved one in the emergency ward, soothing their distress, they will simply have to wait longer to receive the necessary health care.


For people living in Brisbane's south side in Moreton, the hospitals that service the needs of their families will have their funding slashed by this uncaring Turnbull government. The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital will have its funding cut by more than $2 million and Princess Alexandra Hospital will have its funding cut by more than $13 million, and we know how many Queenslanders these hospitals look at. The Turnbull government simply do not understand fairness nor do they understand the damage they are doing to our public hospital system. In question time and after question time, they stand and try to pull the wool over the eyes of Australians and tell them that there are no cuts to hospitals; but we know that this is simply not true. The budget papers reveal this.


Here are the facts: in the 2013 election platform, the Liberal Party stated that they would fund public hospitals at 50 per cent growth funding of the efficient price of the cost of hospital services. That was in the Liberal Party's election commitment. Then, the 2014, 2015, 2016 and now 2018 budget papers show that the government is in fact only funding public hospitals at 45 per cent of growth in hospitals and a cap of 6.5 per cent overall growth in funding. This volte-face from the government represents a $715 million cut to Australian hospitals between 2017 and 2020. What does that translate into? A $3.2 million cut to QEII hospital and a $13 million cut to the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Shame!


As a former teacher and a parent with two boys, one in primary school and one in high school, I know that education is crucial. It has always been important to me. Unfortunately, we see a Turnbull government that does not value education—not education for all, that's for sure. In this budget, the Turnbull government missed the chance to restore the $17 billion cut from Australian schools. That's right—the coalition can find $17 billion in tax cuts for the big banks, but they can't find $17 billion to educate our kids. Here's the bottom line; it's very simple. Under Labor led by Bill Shorten, Labor will restore every cent. Of this funding we'll put it back into our schools, nearly 90 per cent of it will go to public schools—the schools needing it the most, the schools that do the heaviest lifting in society. 


In Moreton, $15 million has been ripped from public schools, and this Turnbull budget will not restore it. Shame! These cuts will mean fewer teachers for Moreton schools, less one-on-one attention for children in Moreton and less help with the basics like reading, writing and maths for Moreton schoolkids. I've said it before and it's so true: the Turnbull government are economic vandals masquerading as politicians. They want to talk about how the economy works for big business, but they don't think about how our economy works for everyone, especially if our kids can't get a decent education. We know from the Gonski investigation that productivity gains come from investing in education. The Turnbull government are short-sighted. We know that investing in our schools benefits everyone and our country. 


I'm appalled that the Turnbull government is ripping a further $270 million from TAFE, skills and apprenticeships in this year's budget, and that $270 million cut comes on top of the more than $3 billion—yes, $3 billion—that this out-of-touch government has already ripped from vocational education and training. This comes at a time when nine out of 10 new jobs created in the next four years will need either a university degree or some sort of TAFE qualification. That's why Labor believes in quality universities and strong public TAFEs, working side by side, equal partners investing in our nation's future. Labor's alternative vision in this space could not be clearer. Let's go through it. 


Labor, under Bill Shorten, will stop the slide to dodgy private providers and back public TAFE all the way. We'll renovate campuses and rebuild workshops. We will ensure that two out of every three, as a minimum, of our training dollars go to public TAFE. We'll invest in programs to help older workers retrain later in life. Also, in our first term, Labor will cover all up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places in high-priority sectors. We would expect at least half of these opportunities to go to the women of Australia. Under Labor, a skills vacancy will not last one day longer than it takes to train an Australian to do that job. 


I've spoken about Labor's vision for education—primary, secondary and vocational—and now I'll finish the quadrella with tertiary. There is a quote from Confucius that I often like to use when discussing education, which says: 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.' Labor takes the long-term view of education. In government, Labor uncapped degree places and opened the doors of university to a new generation. Tens of thousands of students became the first person in their family to go to university—the 'fair go' in action. But the Liberal freeze on university funding means 10,000 fewer places are available next year and, by 2032, over 200,000 people will miss out. And who misses out? Bizarrely, the once great National Party—the people that are supposed to believe in the bush—have wandered off the back roads and hit a bore drain and they're locking students from regional Australia out of university and doing the same to working-class kids. 


A Shorten Labor government would restore certainty to this sector. We will uncap places, providing our nation with over 200,000 more university graduates. What does this mean for Moreton and the southside? When Labor first uncapped places there were 1,455 more uni places from 2008 through to 2016. Under Labor's new policy we'll see about 2,150 more students in Moreton alone on their way to university and the opportunities that brings. In Queensland, it would mean nearly 38,000 more students realising their dreams of a university qualification and the careers that follow. Under Labor, a university education is not a privilege you inherit; it's an opportunity you earn with talent and hard work.


If you search through these budget papers you won't find a single cent for the critical Cross River Rail, linking Dutton Park, on the south side of the city, with many places beyond—another snub by the Turnbull government for all who live in South East Queensland. The existing inner-city rail crossing over the Brisbane River, Merivale Bridge, is at full capacity. Infrastructure Australia has known this for years. We've tried to tell Prime Minister Turnbull, but he just doesn't get it. He must be too focused on Sydney. The four stations that are linked to it, that are common across the entire train network—Roma Street, Central Station, Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills stations—then cause a bottleneck and a scheduling nightmare, one that actually flows right through to Redcliffe, to Beenleigh on the Ipswich line, to the Gold Coast, to Ferny Grove, to the Sunshine Coast and out to Cleveland. Every train that travels in Brisbane basically goes through these four stations, yet it's at capacity. The federal Labor Party committed $2.24 billion to partner with the Queensland Labor government to get this project done. In this budget the endlessly out-of-touch Turnbull government failed to take up our offer of bipartisanship to deliver this critical piece of congestion-busting public transport infrastructure that would serve all Queenslanders. Sadly, they are contributing to productivity bottlenecks in Queensland and it is not good enough. Queenslanders know that Cross River Rail will help to reduce congestion on local roads and get southsiders back home to their families after work much sooner.


But there is another important piece of infrastructure that was also overlooked by the Turnbull government. There is no mention of it at all in the budget papers: the Cooper Plains rail crossing. I wrote to Prime Minister Turnbull before the budget asking him to stand up and help southsiders. Sadly, I'm yet to hear back. Maybe my letter got lost in the post or something! So, I stand here again, publicly asking the Prime Minister, the infrastructure minister and Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk, all members of the Liberal and National parties: surely they can work something out and join the Queensland government to get this mess sorted?


I know that under Lord Mayor Campbell Newman two of the rail crossings on the north side were funded on a fifty-fifty basis. Sadly, Lord Mayor Quirk is offering only 15 per cent for the people on the south side of Brisbane. I note that it would be unfair that any northsider would want the southside to be treated the same! I've got a solution for this mess. I think it should be funded a third by the federal government, a third by the state government and a third by local government. The lord mayor has to go up only a further 18 per cent from the 15 per cent. That's my solution. What could be fairer in terms of getting things sorted?


I know the people of Moreton are sick of people arguing about the politics of who's responsible for the roads, the rail and the footpaths and all that sort of thing, and they are sick of buck-passing. I'm bringing the boom gate down on that sort of politics. My commitment to them is that I will get it done for you.


In every single budget that the coalition government has handed down since they took office in September 2013 they have tried to cut the pension—the coalition government has tried to cut the pension. Let's look at very recent history under coalition governments. The 2018 budget has done nothing to reverse the cuts already made, or to stop Mr Turnbull's cruel cut to the energy supplement. They've added 14,000 additional high-level Home Care Packages—a tick for that—while actually reducing the number of residential care places—a big cross for that. It is a bit of chicanery from the government, given that in its 2016 budget they had already cut aged care by $1.2 billion. With 105,000 older Australians currently on the waiting lists for Home Care Packages, 14,000 places over four years will not even keep pace with the current demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone.


Labor has always protected pensioners and always will. Labor's recently announced pensioner guarantee will ensure that pensioners can still access cash refunds from excess dividend imputation credits. I will continue to fight to stop the government cutting the energy supplement and also increasing the pension age to 70. Surely, that decision could only be made by someone who had never done a week of labouring in their life. Recently I stood in this parliament and spoke about the fundamental unfairness of the Turnbull government's personal income tax plan. That unfairness is why Labor is seeking to get the bills split so that we can immediately support the parts that are fair. Labor will support the initial tranche to begin on 1 July and then go further to deliver bigger, better and fairer tax cuts for 10 million Australians after that.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  I thank the member for Moreton and will just remind him—he's a very experienced member—that when addressing the Prime Minister not to do so by his surname. I didn't stop you; I let you finish. Thank you to the member for Moreton.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:20):  In speaking to these appropriation bills, I want to highlight that there are two truisms in budgets and in politics. The first, in terms of budgets, is that they are about choices. The second, in terms of politics, is that it is often that which is small that can be the most significant. It may not be the biggest line item in the budget, but it is certainly of enormous significance: I am talking about this government's $83.7 million cut to the ABC. I want to make it clear that Labor will fight these cuts. It is quite apparent that this government fails to appreciate the strong faith and value that Australians have when it comes to their ABC. It is a trusted institution and it is one that is relied on for quality news, as a provider in regional Australia and for emergency broadcasting.


It was quite telling in Senate estimates last night, for example, where we did have some specific questioning about the potential impact of these budget cuts on Tasmania. The question asked by Senator Urquhart to the ABC was, 'Can you guarantee Tasmania will be spared any cuts because of the government's budget decision?' The CFO of the ABC replied, 'No, Senator, I cannot guarantee Tasmania will not experience any cuts.' This comes off the back of then Leader of the Opposition Abbott's solemn promise on the eve of the 2013 election of no cuts to the ABC. This is a persistent reminder that the Liberals can't be trusted when it comes to such an important public institution. Since the 2014 budget, we have already seen a cut of some quarter of a billion dollars to the ABC. Since 1 July 2014, around 800 jobs have been lost at the ABC, including 23 at ABC Tasmania. Now, with this latest cut of around $84 million, we know that this will have—and cannot it be ruled out, as the ABC has said—adverse impacts on Tasmania.


I took the opportunity, since the questioning was about Tasmania, to have a look at the track record of the former member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley. Speaking on appropriation bills nearly four years ago, he talked about why he wanted to be a member of parliament. He said:


I wanted to be a member of parliament since I was 12—


Good on him. He said:


It was to ensure that the excellent services that Australians have come to expect are sustainable into the future. … This budget fulfils those aspirations.


That was the 2014 budget. The aspiration was to cut around a quarter of a billion dollars from the ABC. That was when, as I said, the night before the 2013 election a solemn promise was made that there would not be cuts to the ABC. I would like to know where those aspirations are for a strong, viable and independent public broadcaster. It is very clear that support for the ABC is strong. For example, a poll done by the Australia Institute found that 70 per cent of people wanted a strong ABC and 60 per cent of people agreed the ABC needed a boost to long-term funding. They view it as critical to a healthy democracy and oppose a cut to ABC funding.


The Essential Reportcame out only the other day. Let's look at the specific line items of what people do and don't support in this budget. Total opposition to cutting spending on the ABC was 45 per cent. Indeed, a list of items in the budget were assessed. It is abundantly clear that people trust the ABC and do not want it cut. We had the Minister for Communications yesterday in Senate estimates specifically asked, 'Can you make a declaratory statement—can you declare—whether or not the people of Australia can trust you with the ABC?' He gave a response that had all the enthusiasm of a wet weekend. He replied, 'They can have confidence that this government will always support the independence of the ABC and assure that it is appropriately resourced.' The truth of the matter is, indeed, a very different story. This government has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted with the ABC. It just shows how out of touch this Prime Minister is with the Australian people.


The ABC is the public broadcaster, not the state broadcaster—a distinction that appears to be lost on this Prime Minister and his minister. I think it is clear that there is a stark contrast when you look at attitudes towards the ABC and at the attitudes of the government and individual government members—and I'm sure the member sitting at the table will agree with me as well. We on this side of the parliament actually believe in the ABC. It's something that we actually support—we support public broadcasting as an important part of our democracy; it is a trusted institution—whereas it is quite clear that those in the government do not in their heart of hearts support the ABC.


This budget once again exposes the weakness of this Prime Minister. I have another choice quote. In 2013 the now Prime Minister said:


… there is no more committed defender of public broadcasting … than me.


Well, God help us! In 2014 he said:


… the role of the public broadcasters in our national life today is more important than ever, as the business model of the newspapers in particular is under threat and newsrooms dwindle.


With defenders like that, the ABC certainly doesn't need any enemies—they've got enough on that side of the parliament.


What have we seen from the Liberals and this Prime Minister on the ABC? As I said, on the eve of the 2013 election the member for Warringah gave a solemn promise, while staring down the barrel of a camera, 'No cuts to the ABC.' Have a look at their record. They cut $254 million over five years in the horror 2014 budget. In 2016 they cut a further $28 million from the enhanced news-gathering service that Labor helped set up. In 2018 they cut a further $83.7 million from the ABC with a freeze on indexation. The reality is that Liberal cuts to the ABC hurt and they have consequences. Since 2014 around 800 ABC staff have lost their jobs, the Australia Network has been axed, shortwave radio has been shut down and the number of hours of ABC factual programming has dropped by 60 per cent, drama has dropped by 20 per cent and documentaries have dropped by 13.5 per cent.


Then in 2015 the Prime Minister appointed Senator Fifield—a card-carrying member of the IPA—as the Minister for Communications. The minister's membership of the IPA is disclosed in his register of interests and was confirmed at Senate estimates yesterday. Let's have a look at what the IPA advocates. It advocates that the ABC be broken up. In 2012, in the article 'Be like Gough: 75 radical ideas to transform Australia'—one I'm sure Gough certainly would not have endorsed—the following items are listed:


50 Break up the ABC and put out to tender each individual function


51 Privatise SBS


In October 2008 the now Minister for Communications said in an address to the Australian Adam Smith Club:


Conservatives have often floated the prospect of privatising the ABC and Australia Post. There is merit in such proposals.


This minister is a serial complainer about the ABC. The list of what he has complained about is as long as your arm: everything from the date of the Triple J Hottest 100 to a host of others. We know that this government did a dirty backdoor deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation for the repeal of the two-out-of-three media ownership rule. Senator Pauline Hanson has basically said the ABC is a waste of money. We had well-known reports of her threats to block some of these changes unless money was cut from the ABC budget. We have three bills currently before the parliament and a faux 'competitive neutrality' inquiry. Those three bills include, supposedly, some commitments to rural and regional Australia—it is quite ironic that this government thinks by cutting the ABC it can expand the services it provides—a so-called 'fair and balanced' bill and a bill about salary disclosure. Now Australians risk losing much-loved programs and services just because this Prime Minister won't stand up to those in his own party that simply hate the ABC.


It is very clear that the ABC is one of our most important public institutions. It contributes to our national identity, reflects our cultural diversity and encourages our musical, dramatic and performing arts interests. When there's a need for trusted emergency information during natural disasters, the ABC is there. As I said, the latest polling shows that most voters oppose the funding cuts to the ABC in this budget. In that Australia Institute poll, 58 per cent of respondents disagreed with the following statement:


The ABC and SBS should get less funding and provide fewer online and streaming services, so that they don't undermine commercial media.


Labor has a strong record of fighting for the ABC. It's not just about fighting the cuts. The Leader of the Opposition made very clear in his budget reply statement, which was very well received, his and Labor's commitment to always stand up for the ABC and to fight these cuts. It's not just funding cuts that we're going to fight—and of course we are fighting them and we will continue to do that—it's about opposing the government bills already before us, aimed to undermine the ABC. We'll call out this faux 'competitive neutrality' inquiry for what it is: a vindictive attack on the ABC. We affirm the value of the ABC and we know that a grassroots movement of Australians know, love and continue to support the ABC.


Friends of the ABC are not only in Labor; they are members of the public. As I said, sometimes the items you think are the smallest end up having the most significance. I know that the more Australians find out about and come to understand what these cuts to the ABC will mean for Australians, the more people will be opposed. It is essential that the ABC endure as a trusted independent voice that adds to the diversity of news and provides an opportunity for Australian stories to be produced, seen and heard. We on this side of the House believe it's imperative for the ABC to be properly supported by government, not stretched too thinly, as it delivers on its mandate in the contemporary media environment.


It's very clear that you can't trust the Liberals—or One Nation, for that matter—with the ABC. The ABC cannot sustain another term of this destructive Liberal government and its vendetta against our trusted public broadcaster. Liberal cuts mean cuts to the ABC content and services that people trust and rely upon. Labor will continue to fight for the ABC, because we know what an important institution it is in our democratic processes. We have a strong record of supporting the ABC, and we will continue to do so.


In conclusion, we know that there is a cut of $83.7 million to the ABC in this budget. You only have to look at the Minister for Communications' thought processes here. He announces a cut to the ABC and then announces that he's going to undertake an efficiency review into what savings can be made at the ABC. At least when the current Prime Minister held the post of Minister for Communications he held a couple of inquiries into ABC efficiencies before he made the cuts. The current minister makes the cuts and then does the review afterwards. This budget pauses indexation of the ABC's operational funding, amounting to that $83.7 million cut.


This will have an impact on what the ABC can do. It's quite clear, as I said, from budget estimates yesterday and as it continues today, that the ABC will need to make those difficult choices. It cannot guarantee, for example, that services and jobs will not be cut in Tasmania. Following that, it is quite clear that it cannot guarantee where else its services will be cut. As they have said themselves, there is no fat left to cut—it's cutting into muscle. It's cutting into that muscle that is an important institution of our democracy.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:35):  I begin my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and related bills by associating myself with those very fine words from the member for Greenway. She is absolutely correct. Over the last five years, the Turnbull and Abbott governments have continued to eat away at our ABC—a national icon and an institution particularly needed in rural and regional Australia, including in my own region. I just make a genuine appeal to the government to restore the ABC's funding and to give the ABC every opportunity it has to thrive, as it has done for so long, and, in doing so, extending so many important broadcasting services to rural and regional Australia.


Yesterday I spoke on the government's tax changes, where I canvassed the economy pretty extensively. I won't go there again today in respect of these bills. Rather, I want to talk briefly about three things. I want to speak about Qantas's plans for a new pilot training school, a very important move by them; I want to speak about AGL's Liddell power plant in my electorate; and I want to talk a little about Australian agriculture and its future—in particular, the performance of its ministers and the impact that has had on the agriculture department.


It's well known that we have a massive shortage of pilots, not only here in Australia but internationally. In fact, many of our pilots are being poached by other countries, which exacerbates the problem here in Australia. To its credit, Qantas has taken the initiative of doing something about it and is massively expanding domestic training here in Australia. In doing so, it intends to establish at least one new flying school. I had the opportunity to speak with Qantas executives last night and they said that it might no longer be just one school, that it might be a number of schools. They made that comment mainly because there has emerged intense competition amongst regional towns for the opportunity to host such a school.


If it were to be one single school, we'd be talking about literally hundreds of trainees each year going through the school, wherever it might be situated. Obviously, that would be a significant economic boost for any township or local community. I'm told that up to 40 towns or more have expressed an interest across every state and territory, so it's an interesting venture for Qantas and it will be a challenge for Qantas to make its decision. As was pointed out to me last night, it will be one friend and potentially 39 upset communities—although, as I said, maybe in the end Qantas will do a number of smaller schools rather than one big school.


But today, as I did last night, I'm making a pitch for my own local community. My hometown, Cessnock, has a largely-unused aerodrome, as we traditionally called it. It's used by private pilots only—often by people visiting the vineyards, of course. But it is an aerodrome in good shape and which, in fact, still has some infrastructure around it. Whether it be fit for purpose for Qantas is another question, but I don't think they expect to walk into any town where the building for a physical school would be ready for them.


Cessnock is only two hours drive from Sydney on the M1, so I can think of no better location. It's close to Sydney but not too close for air traffic purposes. I'm told that the aircraft involved would only be light aircraft, so I don't see any real community opposition. I see it as only a win-win for Cessnock. Of course, Qantas will make its own decision on the merits of each of the propositions put to it, but I can't imagine somewhere better, at least in terms of location, than my home town of Cessnock. The aerodrome is nestled right in the heart of Hunter wine country. While I'm sure Qantas is keen not to be mixing the consumption of our world's finest wines with flying, in my experience, if you want to retain people on these courses, it's good to have them train somewhere not isolated but close to a capital city and somewhere that is just generally a wonderful place to spend a large part of their life for 15 months or so. Again, I think Cessnock fits that bill exactly. 


Given the intensity of the competition, I expect state governments will become involved. Qantas will enjoy, one would think, the outcomes of the energies of each of those state governments as they seek to ensure that the school, or schools, is situated in their own state. So, today I make an appeal to the Premier of New South Wales and her senior cabinet colleagues to have a look at the proposition of Cessnock as the host of that training school and to do all it can to give us the very best chance of securing that school. 


I think one of the things that Qantas will have in mind is the desire to avoid going somewhere where they're not particularly wanted for some reason, whether it be flight path issues et cetera or whether it be an already busy town that doesn't have the infrastructure to host the additional demand on that infrastructure. I should have said that Cessnock has the benefit of lots of accommodation capacity, because the tourism traffic is lumpy; it's mainly around weekends. So I think there's an opportunity to argue the case on accommodation. 


But there are a number of things that could be done in Cessnock that would enhance our bid for that school, and chief amongst them is access from the CBD onto the new Hunter Expressway. Labor funded and built the Hunter Expressway. It has been a great boon not only for Cessnock but for the region. There's also the unexpected or impossible-to-avoid other effects of a big project like that—for instance, the way it redirects other local traffic and the demand it puts on other local roads. Cessnock desperately needs the help of the state government, and I would like to think the Commonwealth could play a role, too. We need a link to the Hunter Expressway and some form of ring-road around Cessnock so that the people living in the growing suburbs aren't using the CBD for their exit out of town as they commute to work each morning and their arrival home each evening. So I make an appeal to Gladys Berejiklian to look at that proposal and to do everything she can, along with her cabinet colleagues, to secure that school for Cessnock, remembering that a very large corrective services or jail project has just been imposed on the local town, with no infrastructure support to accommodate the change and the demand that that massive jail expansion is creating. So there is every reason for Gladys Berejiklian to become more engaged in Cessnock, our aspirations and our challenges. 


I want to say something quickly about Alinta's bid for AGL. I view this as a stunt. I don't believe Alinta was ever serious about buying the Liddell Power Station. I think it was a stunt encouraged by our Prime Minister to try to skew the debate around energy in his favour. I believe Alinta might have had some hope of taking the power station but only on the expectation that they would be heavily subsidised by the Turnbull government. I believe that they believed it was a possibility, because the Prime Minister was so determined and so politically desperate to make that proposition work. 


I recently met with the mayor of Port Augusta, Sam Johnson, a very capable person, and he reminded me of Alinta's history in his own backyard. When Alinta closed down power stations without giving any real notice to the community and the council, it had devastating economic effects for Port Augusta. Thankfully his community—in part, I suspect, due to the good work of the council and the former Labor South Australian government—has regenerated itself, basically on the back of renewable energy technologies. But Alinta has a bad track record. Its Chinese-based partner, or the entity which would have controlled Alinta, I'm told is registered in the Cayman Islands, and that sends all the wrong signals to the Australian community generally. I think people know what that means.


I lament the fact that AGL's plans for investment in the upper Hunter have been frustrated and delayed. We should be getting on with the very good plan they have to ensure that the upper Hunter remains the powerhouse of New South Wales, and every day that the Prime Minister runs interference on it is a day delayed along our path to greater energy capacity as well as renewable forms of energy generation. This will create many jobs for many, many decades to come, not just for a couple of years such as with the proposed extension of Liddell. Of course coal-fired power generation will continue to play a role with the upgrade of the Bayswater Power Station, just across the road from Liddell. If AGL is allowed to get on with its plans, we will remain the powerhouse of New South Wales and we will continue to create jobs in power generation—in coal, in gas, in large-scale solar, in battery storage and pumped hydro. It's a very good plan, and the Prime Minister should get out of the way.


I'm genuinely concerned for our agriculture sector. There is a lot of talk about going to $100 billion in value by 2030. I think we can do much better than that. That is just normal trajectory. That would be a performance that would just match what we'd done for the last 10 or 20 years. We can do better, but we need real government guidance and real government leadership. We need an agriculture department that is capable, effective, efficient and properly resourced, and that's not what we have at the moment. In Senate estimates last night, we canvassed the department's 2017-18 corporate plan. Under the banner of 'Our capability', and under 'Policy' specifically, it says:


Consultation with stakeholders has indicated the department needs to strengthen its capability to develop agriculture and water resources policy, and to influence other policies affecting our portfolio industries and rural communities.


In its testimony, the secretary of the department did better than that, or put the point more bluntly: the department, under the watch of Barnaby Joyce, lost its policy capacity and so far has done no better under the new minister. Nothing could be more important than policy capacity.


In their corporate plan they go on about the need to identify 'policy skills gaps', 'shifting to a longer term focus' and 'improving our engagement with stakeholders to build trust'. This is the key point: there is no trust. When you force the relocation of an entity like the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, you don't build trust with stakeholders, industry or your staff. You do just the opposite. When you take roles and responsibilities off states so that you can create a pork-barrelling exercise in the name of the Regional Investment Corporation, you don't build trust. You do just the opposite. And if we're going to be successful in agriculture, if we're going to meet our aspirations, the role of the states will be absolutely crucial. What the member for New England has done in the past, as agriculture minister, does not build trust with the states. It does exactly the opposite. When you give the live sheep trade an unconditional pass to go on with its atrocities in animal welfare, you don't build trust. You build disaster. And when you blame the regulator, your own department, for the debacle that is the live sheep trade, you don't build trust. You undermine your departmental officials and leave them with the view that they're not valued and they'd be better off somewhere else.


There is the same result when you tell people, with spouses working in Canberra and with children in Canberra schools, that they don't have a job any longer if they're not prepared to move to Armidale in regional New South Wales. That's not how you build trust; that's the exact opposite of how you build trust. You must respect our departmental officials and the role extended to them. They must be able to trust that the minister will give proper guidance, respect what they do and provide them with the support they need to do their job effectively on behalf of the Australian community. In the last five years, just the opposite has been taking place. You know the old story: those who are best in the department, who know they can secure work, will move on and those who are not so sure will stay. I'm not saying those who have stayed are not good staffers. Some of them will be, of course, and they will have stayed out of loyalty to the government and the department. But it is reaching disaster point. The Prime Minister needs to take control, needs to talk to the new minister and needs to tell the new minister that he needs to turn the ship around.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (12:51):  The budget this year is just like every other Liberal budget: it fails the fairness test. The Liberal's budget looks after big business at the expense of people who work and struggle. The budget gives an extra $80 billion tax handout to big business, including $17 billion for big banks, at the same time as it hits schools and hospitals with savage cuts. It's not just like previous budgets; it still has the nasties from the nastiest of Liberal budgets, the 2014 Abbott budget. Remember the pride that the Abbott government had when they were cutting funding to schools and hospitals, how proud they were of that appalling 2014 budget, the plans to axe the energy supplement for pensioners and some of the most vulnerable people in our community, and increasing the pension age to 70? Those so-called zombie measures are still in this budget. The government aren't bragging about them this year, as they did last year and in 2014; but those measures are still there, quietly sitting there and waiting to strip money away from pensioners, from our capacity to educate our children and from the health system that supports us when we are sick.


The budget locks in the cutting of the energy supplement for pensioners, costing pensioners around $14 a fortnight. The budget will force Australians to work until they're 70 before they're eligible for pension. There are $17 billion in cuts to schools and $2.2 billion in cuts to universities. There are cuts to hospitals and cuts to Medicare by keeping the rebate freeze on specialists for one more year. It seems the government learnt nothing from 2014. They're cutting away at the living standards of pensioners, cutting funding to our basic services and giving billions of dollars to big companies, many of which are overseas, and $17 billion of that $80 billion going to the big banks.


It also goes further and has some new nasty cuts. There's another $270 million in new cuts to TAFE and apprentices on top of extraordinary cuts that they've already applied. There's more than another $80 million in new cuts to the ABC. There is a $1.5 billion cut to remote housing by ending the national partnership agreement. The old cuts are still there, and they've added some new cuts. These are cuts that they apply in order to help pay for a massive $80 billion tax cut to big companies. I have to be a little bit fair here, in that the Liberal government says they are also going to provide tax relief for low- and middle-income Australians with the first tranche on 1 July of this year. It is actually paid at the end of the financial year. It is around $10 a week for someone on $125,000. If you're on one of the lower incomes, it's maybe $4 or $5 a week. As always with this tricky government, it's all a bit strange. There's a second and third tranche. The first comes one comes in 1 July, which is between $4 and $10 a week for low- and middle-income earners.


The second and third tranches—they are in 2022 and 2024, so are two elections away; elect Malcolm Turnbull twice and you'll get them—target people on much higher incomes. So, we've got the first tranche for people on low- and middle-incomes. Then, in 2024, some six years away, there are tax cuts that are much larger for people on higher incomes. The interesting thing—and this is where their trickiness comes in—they've said that if Labor doesn't support the tax cuts in 2022 and 2024 now, then the people who need tax cuts now won't get them. So, Labor has to support all of it, including the big tax cuts in 2022 and 2024, two elections away, in order for people who really do need tax cuts to get them now. Quite frankly, I feel like saying, 'So there! Support our big cuts or you won't get your little ones.' This is the nature of the government that we have.


We have said quite clearly that if they split the bill, Labor is prepared to support that first tranche of tax cuts right now—we can pass it today. The people who would get those cuts are suffering from stagnating wages, the cost of living is rising, rents in my area of Parramatta are some of the highest in Sydney, and the median house price passed $1 million over a year ago. People are actually struggling and that tax cut for the low- and middle-income earners will actually make a difference. But, the government is holding it to ransom—either the opposition supports tax cuts for the wealthier end of town or people who need it most don't get it.


Remember when they did this with the NDIS? This is not the first time they've played this trick. They tried to hold people with disability hostage, claiming that the money wasn't in the budget and Labor had to agree to all sorts of cuts in order to guarantee funding. It didn't work, and suddenly the money was there after all, as it always was. It was a hostage attempt then to use people with disabilities to try to force the Labor Party to make other cuts to other sections of the community, and they're doing it again now.


The budget doesn't pass the fairness test, but it also doesn't pass the fiscal test. In fact, it doesn't pass the government's own fiscal test. The Liberal Party used to rail against a 'debt and deficit disaster' and now there's barely a peep from them. That's not surprising actually, because it's much, much, much worse now than it was when they came to government. On the back of the best global economic conditions in more than a decade, when the world is growing, when other economies are growing and doing well, we find that Australia is going almost the opposite way. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. If the Liberals in opposition thought that the Labor Party's debt and deficit coming out of a global financial crisis was a disaster, what is it when it's double that now under the best global conditions we've had for a decade? The world economy is growing and still the debt is double, the net debt is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. On their watch, gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time in history, and it will remain above half a trillion dollars every year for the next decade. Both types of debt are growing faster under this government than under the previous Labor government, which had a financial crisis to contend with. This year's deficit, 2017-18, is 6.5 times bigger than the Liberals predicted in their 'horror budget' of 2014.


The budget fails the fairness test, it fails the fiscal test and it also fails the future test, because if there's one thing you have to get right to build for the future it's the education of our children. When you look carefully at the figures—and they didn't mention this in their budget presentation on that Tuesday night—after the end of next year there is no funding for universal access to preschool—none. Labor introduced a commitment that children get 15 hours of preschool. There are 2,429 children in the Parramatta federal electorate who will be left in limbo when that funding comes to an end at the end of next year. There are 350,000 children across Australia who access preschool each year who depend on this funding. The government just flippantly says, 'Well, we fund it every year.' But it's not in the budget—it's not in the forward estimates. If you intend to fund it put it in the forward estimates. Have you left it out to make the surplus look bigger at some point in the future? Is that why you've left it out? If you're going to fund it, put it in the budget. Let me explain something to those of you who don't understand this. Businesses like childcare centres have to build assets. They have to renovate and update. They have all sorts of things they have to spend money on. They actually need certainty. Doing it year by year does not work for businesses that actually have to invest in capital in order to provide their services.


Nor does it work for families. Anyone who knows parents in this day and age knows how difficult it is to organise the care of children in future years. Parents know: they look around, they pick their childcare centre and they pick their preschool, finding the best ones and trying to get their children into those centres before they return to work. They move house sometimes for the best care for their children. They need certainty. It's not okay to remove funding for universal access to preschool after 2019. It's not okay. If you're going to fund it, put it in the budget and let parents and businesses do what they need to do to provide the services that our children need to do well in the future.


And also for schools—in Parramatta, schools will lose over $28 million: $18.3 million from public schools and $9.8 from Catholic schools. That's not okay. Then consider the massive amounts that this government has already ripped out of TAFE and apprenticeships, and they're now ripping out more. That pathway also disappears for people in my community, and it's incredibly important. We have construction all over the place in Parramatta, but if our young people can't learn a trade, because our TAFEs and our vocational education systems are being ripped apart by this government, one has to ask: what's the point? Our young people need those jobs and they need the training in order to get them.


We'll also lose $12 million from Westmead Hospital. And, as if that isn't bad enough, we'll lose $2.09 million from Cumberland Hospital. Anybody who has been in my electorate and who has visited the Cumberland Hospital knows that, of all of the hospitals, that's the one which cannot afford to lose that kind of money. These are dreadful cuts.


But there are three areas where the government claims they're actually going to put money in. I just want to deal with those. First of all, there's home care. They made a rather tricky promise to create 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over four years. What they didn't say is that they were taking the money out of residential aged care to pay for it. It wasn't new money for the 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over four years, it's a transfer of money. It's a hoax, particularly when you understand that there are 100,000 people on the waiting list now.


There are 150 electorates, so if it were averaged out that's 666 people in my electorate who'd be on the waiting list. I've got 12,000 people over the age of 70 and there's 666 on the waiting list. This 14,000 over four years is 23.3 places a year per electorate. We've got a waiting list of at least 666 and I've got 12,000 people over the age of 70, with more of those needing home care every year, and they're offering, by transferring money out of residential aged care, 23.3 places per electorate per year. Are they kidding? And that was worth announcing in the budget? That was actually important enough and impressive enough, in their eyes, to announce in the budget—really?


Obviously, they haven't spoken to any of the people who are desperate for in-home care. People are actually going to nursing homes because they can't get their home care packages. People are leaving the homes they have lived in all their lives, and leaving their partners, and going into nursing homes because this is a stuff-up. And they announced 23.3 places a year with great pride and great fanfare in the budget. Really!


Infrastructure: airport rail in Western Sydney was the great announcement. Yay! But there's no money to build it; it's another feasibility study. It's a hoax. We need airport rail and we need it to be there the day the airport opens. We need to plan it early enough for businesses to leverage the route and to make their plans as well. If you want to build a new city you've got to get the planning right and you've got to give other people time to do what they need to do to make the most of what you're doing. If you're putting in airport rail then get it done. Make a decision! How many feasibility studies? How many scoping studies? Put the money there to build it. Without money to build it, it's just paper. How long is this going to go on?


On the Great Barrier Reef: I know that a lot of people in my community really care about the health of our oceans. Many people write to me about marine parks and I know they care about this. They might have thought: 'Oh, $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef? Good!' It comes on top of figures that show Commonwealth funding to arrest declining water quality has been dropping by $11 million a year under this government, so they've been going backwards. But that $444 million is going to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, an organisation that had an $8 million budget and 10 staff last year. There wasn't even a tender process. This is an organisation chaired by John Schubert, the former chair of Esso. This is a private foundation that had 10 staff and an $8 million budget, and that's the organisation that is getting the great package for the Great Barrier Reef: $444 million without a tender process. 


I would love to have time to talk about the wonderful things that Labor has in its policy, but, quite frankly, at the moment, the single most important thing we can do is just point out to people the hoax in this budget. There are tax cuts for low-income earners, but only if the parliament agrees to major tax cuts for high-income earners six years down the track. There is supposedly new funding for home care packages that is actually taken from residential home care and isn't even a drop in this ocean of backlog that this country faces. There are cuts to preschools, cuts to schools, cuts to TAFEs, cuts to universities—cuts to every single service that our young people need to build good lives. This is a hoax, and the fact that this government got up there and spruiked it on the night as a great thing shows that either they're completely out of touch or it's a big con.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:18):  Last night I was highlighting the many sneaky cuts that this government has made when it comes to education, early education and veterans, but this is in the context of a budget that also gives $80 billion back to big business. That is what is so unfair about this budget. This government isn't there to provide high-quality services that Australians depend upon, education, health, but wants to give large tax cuts to multinational companies, which is of significant concern. It's for this reason that Labor will campaign as a much stronger alternative government that will invest in our hospitals and schools, has made tough decisions, won't be giving $80 billion back to big business, and will provide double the personal income tax cuts that the coalition is proposing for 10 million Australians. That is about helping ordinary Australians get on with the difficulty of the cost of living. That is about actually making sure that those that need support, those that are finding it tough, those that have not had wage growth for such a long time and that are continuing to struggle will get the support they need. That is a sharp, sharp contrast to the coalition that wants to give tax cuts to the big end of town. Labor wants to give tax cuts to working families in this country, families that deserve support, families that deserve assistance with the cost of living. I am proud to stand with this alternative vision for the country that we live in.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:20):  One of the truly remarkable things about budgets is that they really lay bare for all to see the priorities of a government. This budget indeed tells you everything you need to know about the Turnbull Liberal government. It gives an $80 billion tax handout to big business at the same time as it hits our schools and our hospitals with savage cuts. Despite shocking revelations of misconduct from the banking royal commission, it splashes the big banks with $17 billion in tax cuts at the same time that it cuts $26 million from the banking cop on the beat, ASIC. 


The budget looks after big business and high-income earners at the very expense of investment in health, education and vital public services. It cuts the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight, and it forces Australians to work until the age of 70. It locks in $17 billion worth of cuts to schools and confirms $2.2 billion worth of cuts to Australian universities. It maintains $2.8 billion worth of cuts to hospitals and keeps the Medicare freeze on specialist visits for a further year. It rips a further $270 million from TAFE and apprenticeships and levies more than $80 million in new cuts to the ABC. It axes 1,200 jobs from Centrelink, even though unanswered calls spiked from 29 million to 55 million last year. It delivers no new money for aged care, even though 105,000 older Australians are on the waiting list for home care packages. It proposes a radical attack on Australia's progressive taxation system, which would see a carer earning $40,000 on the same marginal tax rate as a lawyer earning $200,000. It squanders some of the best economic conditions in many years. Net debt is double what it was when the Liberals came to office and gross debt is set to be stuck well above half a trillion dollars for every year for the next 10 years. 


Unlike Mr Turnbull, Labor has a clear plan to bring back fairness. A Shorten Labor government will improve our schools, fix our hospitals and save Medicare. We will make universities more accessible, guarantee the future of TAFE and put local jobs first. We will take real action on climate change, invest in renewables and safeguard our environment for future generations. We'll deliver genuine tax relief for working Australians, protect pensioners and improve the bottom line. It's a plan we can afford because we've made the hard decisions to rein in tax breaks for high-income earners and we're not going to give big business, multinationals and the big banks an additional $80 billion tax handout. 


I would now like to step through a few of the concerns that I have about the impact of this budget on my community in Newcastle and, more broadly, for the nation. The University of Newcastle stands to lose an estimated $69 million as this government levies $2.2 billion worth of cuts on universities. This will undoubtedly hurt students, the wider community and, indeed, our regional economy more broadly. The university was able to protect students from those cuts this year, but that is an unsustainable pathway. When you rip $69 million out of a university, you cannot do so without impacting on student learning and student supports. 


I am deeply concerned about the government's budget plan to cut two per cent of medical training places from universities across the country to help fund its so-called Murray-Darling medical schools network. Just to be clear: I do not begrudge medical places in regional Australia—indeed, I come from a regional university with an outstanding medical school—but I am concerned about this blatantly political plan that is so obviously designed with electoral rather than policy outcomes in mind. 


It would be an absolute travesty if that plan were to come at the expense of places currently sitting in the nation's best regional medical training program, which is delivered in partnership by the University of Newcastle and the University of New England. This genuinely joint medical program provides the most successful model for regional medical training in the country. If anything, it should be boosted, not diminished. It runs three rural clinical schools in Tamworth, Armidale and Taree. It takes in almost twice the national average number of students from rural and regional communities. Graduates are also twice as likely to seek work in rural and regional areas. Not only that but the University of Newcastle graduates more than one-third of the nation's Indigenous doctors.


Why would you rip out these places? Why would you put a program like that at risk in order to stump up places that have an electoral advantage for the government? Why would you rip places from this medical training centre that has a clear, proven track record of delivering superior regional medical training? I've already personally raised with the minister my concerns about this issue, and I will certainly be seeking assurances that the University of Newcastle's leading medical program will be quarantined from this government's cuts.


This budget locks in $17 billion worth of cuts to schools. In my electorate of Newcastle that means that schools are each losing on average $350,000 over this year and next year alone. That will mean fewer teachers, less individual attention and less support for kids to achieve their full potential. What is worse is that the harshest cuts are being borne by the schools that can least afford it. Over the next two years alone public schools cop 86 per cent of the Liberals' most recent cuts. If that weren't bad enough, we recently learnt that Mr Turnbull has been busy doing more than 100 sneaky deals to give the elite private schools more cash from a $7 million secret slush fund.


Labor understands the importance of investing in education, of investing in our future generations. We think every child deserves the best start in life. Every child deserves a supportive learning environment to ensure that they reach their full potential, and that's why we are committed to restoring every single cent of the $17 billion that the Liberals have cut from our schools.


One of the truly tragic outcomes of this budget is the Turnbull Liberal government's ongoing cuts to TAFE. Hunter TAFE, which is in my part of the world, is Australia's largest regional TAFE and vocational education and training provider. It has been an incredibly important partner and a provider of that training in our community, but it's no secret that TAFE in New South Wales is on its knees. These cuts—this additional $270 million that the Turnbull Liberal government is now cutting from our TAFEs and apprentices—are adding to the crisis that we are already experiencing in TAFE. This extra $270 million cut to TAFE and apprentices is, of course, on top of more than $3 billion of cuts from previous Liberal government budgets.


Once again, it clearly demonstrates that the Turnbull Liberal government's priorities are completely wrong. No government should be prioritising tax cuts to foreign shareholders and the big banks while cutting federal government support to vocational education and training. Seriously, nobody thinks this is a good idea in my electorate and I doubt that they do even in Liberal electorates. It's astonishing that the government thinks that they should continue on this pathway of cuts into TAFE.


I'm very pleased Labor has committed to guaranteeing that under our government at least two out of three training dollars will go into TAFE, because we believe that TAFE must be at the front and centre of Australia's vocational education and training industries. We'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country and ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We will provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade. There is still a place in many communities for a strong TAFE body to provide trade skills for men and women. From Labor's perspective, universities and TAFE are equal partners in a higher education pathway. I am very pleased that Labor will also provide 20,000 adult apprenticeship programs for older workers who need to retrain. Nothing could be more important for our citizens.


Of course, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, you could be forgiven for thinking that there would be no more important priority for any government than the health and wellbeing of its citizens. So you can imagine how astonished I was to find that this budget continues to cut deeply into the budgets of our local hospitals in order to pay for big business tax cuts. This will mean increased delays for surgeries, that nurse and doctor numbers will decline and that emergency department waiting lists will increase. In Newcastle, the government is cutting close to $10 million from our local hospitals, and that is from the 2017-2020 years. The John Hunter Hospital, a major hospital in my region, which does not just service Newcastle but, indeed, provides emergency and trauma services through to the Queensland border, is standing to lose $6.88 million. The Calvary Mater Newcastle—again, the region's major oncology service provider—is losing $1.6 million. And, astonishingly, the John Hunter Children's Hospital is going to be cut by $1.2 million. Labor will fully reverse the Turnbull Liberal government's $2.8 billion worth of hospital cuts, as well as funding 500,000 more life-saving MRI scans through Medicare.


My community tells me how important those measures are and how appalling they find the ongoing attacks on local hospitals from this government. Like me, they find this to be both short-sighted and wrongheaded, and I would implore the government to rethink their ridiculous plans to cut further into the health budgets of this nation.


Of course, people in my region have grown used to the fact that Liberal governments do not any longer invest in significant public infrastructure projects in the Newcastle-Hunter region, so it was with great disappointment that there was no money on the table for the Glendale interchange and no investment for high-speed rail. It's astonishing that this government fails to understand the importance of connectivity between our major cities in Australia and why they might want to invest in a high-speed rail network on the eastern seaboard. The evaluation studies were done by Labor when we were in government. There's no need for any more feasibility studies. We know that high-speed rail would turbocharge regional economies like Newcastle's and understand the good that would have. But, of course, every year that we delay we have hundreds of millions of dollars added to the cost of trying to invest in these projects. Indeed, it concerns me that the transport corridor for the high-speed rail is still not protected.


There are many aspects that I would want to touch on, but I will end with the fact that there was, to my profound regret, no investment in a Commonwealth court registry in Newcastle. There are such physical constraints for that court and also a lack of personnel. We have been crying out for the Attorney-General to replace the judge who has just left and was transferred to Queensland. We are down a Federal Circuit Court judge again. We need one badly, and we need them now.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-05-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:35):  There's a growing crisis in this country, and it's evidenced by the fact that one in three young people either haven't got a job or haven't got the hours of work that they want. It's much, much worse for those young people who finish school and who don't have qualifications above that school level. If you look back over Australian history, what you will find is that the youth unemployment rate is always higher than the general employment rate and that every time we get into trouble when there's a recession the youth are hit harder and they have a disproportionately higher rise in their unemployment rise, so more of them are jobless.


What we also have usually found, looking back over history, is that give it a couple of years and, as better economic times come, the two come back into line and young people tend to start finding jobs again. But that hasn't happened since the GFC. Since the GFC, unemployment and underemployment for young people has continued to get worse, not better. We're almost a decade on from it, and we now have this appalling situation in this country where one in three young people can't find a job or don't have enough hours of work. They are getting screwed. The old measures that previously might have pumped up employment don't seem to be working any more. We are increasingly turning our backs on a generation of people who will find themselves without ever having had meaningful employment.


When the government does one of the most important things it does each year, which is hand down its budget, you would expect it would have laser-like focus and put up in lights the fact that so many people in this country are finding it very, very difficult to make ends meet and it's especially hard for young people. But there was nothing for young people in this budget. This is a budget that gives the middle finger to young people in this country. If you think about those one in three young people who either haven't got a job or aren't getting enough hours of work, many of them will be reliant on youth allowance and, if you get a bit older, they will be reliant on Newstart. The number of people who are in that situation where they're forced to rely on welfare because the government has not done enough to create meaningful jobs for them is growing.


The government trumpets its job-creation figures and ignores the fact that, really, those job-creation figures are just keeping up with population growth and that we have unemployment persistently stuck at over five per cent. If you again look back over history, you will find that between World War II and the 1970s the average unemployment rate in this country was two per cent. The government is consigning a whole bunch of people to the scrap heap. It's even worse for young people, and the budget has nothing for them. While they're looking for work that is not there at the moment, many of those people them are reliant on welfare. They are trying to find jobs that aren't there, and they're reliant on welfare in the meantime. What we know is that if you are reliant on Newstart to try to make ends meet while you're looking for another job, you are living in poverty.


Everyone is now screaming from the rooftops that the level of Newstart is so low that it's actually a barrier to people finding work. Why? Well, you spend all your time just trying to stay alive, trying to make ends meet, because you've got $40 a day. At the same time, the cost of rent is going through the roof. We find that in Melbourne, for example, if you're reliant solely on Newstart, there is not one rental property in the greater Melbourne area that is affordable for you. So we have people living in poverty.


This low level of Newstart is now becoming a barrier to people finding work because it's becoming a poverty trap. It's not just the Greens saying that. It's not just welfare organisations saying that. The Business Council of Australia has said that trying to get by on $40 a day, at a time when energy bills and housing are going through the roof, means that you don't have enough money to get yourself that extra haircut or to go and buy some extra clothes to get yourself ready for a job interview; you don't have the capacity to go and do the extra training that you need; you spend most of your life just trying to survive.


Many people were hoping that this budget might deliver something for all of those people who are looking for a job, and that it might help lift some Australians out of poverty while they're looking for a job. And the budget gave the middle finger to them as well. The budget said: 'There is nothing for you from this Liberal government if you are trying to find jobs that aren't there, because we're not creating them. And if you're living in poverty just trying to make ends meet, well, we don't care.'


So not only was the opportunity to help make Australia a more equal society passed up, because the government refused to do anything on that front, they also turned their back on last year's budget, when they said that housing was the most important issue. Remember that—when they said that making housing affordable was one of their priorities? There was not a single dollar in this budget to help make housing more affordable.


Things have changed a lot in the last couple of decades in Australia. People are going into record debt because the cost of housing is going up and up and up and other forms of income are not going up at all. And again it is worse for young people. Back in the 1990s, the average cost of a house was six times the average young person's income. Fast forward a couple of decades and the average cost of a house is 12 times an average young person's income. The Treasurer made a big song and dance about that a year or so ago but now seems to have completely forgotten. So there's no money in this budget to look after the people who are falling through the cracks, and there's nothing in this budget to address housing affordability, when we know that, if we had the guts to rein in negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, for example, we could use that money to build more affordable housing.


Start building more affordable housing that's available to people at the lower end of the spectrum and you'll kill a number of birds with one stone. You'll start putting people into work as we start to have a construction-led employment recovery. You'll also start bringing down rents because the housing will be affordable and you'll take a bunch of people out of that very tight rental market by delivering them public housing. Start building some affordable housing for key workers in our cities as well and you'll start to ease the pressure on them so that cleaners, nurses, ambulance officers and firefighters can afford to live near the places that they're servicing. That would be a sensible thing to do.


Nothing—nothing—from the government on that. Why? Because they want to make inequality worse by ending progressive taxation in Australia as we know it and giving a handout to big corporations and the very wealthy. It's going to cost $140 billion—money that we could use to build more affordable housing or to lift Newstart or to get dental into Medicare. Instead, the government says that the way to increase inequality in Australia—because that's ultimately what they're on about—is to get rid of Australia's progressive taxation system.


As a result of the proposals that this government is putting forward in this budget, in a few years time, when they get rid of and dismantle the progressive taxation system in Australia and phase 3 of the tax cuts kick in, someone who is earning the minimum wage will pay the same tax rate as a CEO on $200,000. Now, that is not fair. That is not fair, and it is a direct assault on egalitarianism in this country. We have a progressive taxation system for a reason. There is an acceptance in this country that if you earn a bit more, and especially if you're right at the top end, you can contribute a bit more. There is an understanding in Australia that we will be, and remain, a more equal society if we use money to invest in services like free health care and free public schools so that no matter how much you earn you've got the same rights as everyone else to get good quality health care and good quality education.


We understand in this country that the key to avoiding going down the US road and becoming a dog-eat-dog society, where everyone has to look after themselves, is making sure that every child in this country can get a world-class public school education if they want it and that you're never turned away from a public school because you're worried about the quality of the education. You know, as of right, that you've got that. And you know that if you get sick, you will be looked after in the hospitals in this country. And you also know—although this is increasingly coming under threat—that you're able to get to a GP as and when you need one without the gap costing you too much or being a disincentive for being able to go. Now, to do all of those things we need to ask big corporations to pay their fair share, not give them a tax cut. But we also need to maintain a progressive taxation system in this country.


If there's one thing that the budget has achieved, though, it's that they've successfully fired the starting gun in what's going to be a tax cuts auction going to the next election. And it's very, very disappointing to find that in this parliament the Greens are the only ones standing up saying: 'No, no tax cuts. Let's put the money into services instead.' And in doing that we are standing with the majority of the Australian people, because the majority of the Australian people know that whether it's $10 a week or $20 a week, most of that is going to disappear as power bills going up, as the cost of housing goes up and as the cost of going to see the doctor goes up. If you ask most people: 'What would you rather? Would you rather $10 or $20 a week? Or would you rather that money go into making sure you don't have to pay so-called 'voluntary' school fees when you send your kid to public school? To making sure that the gap between the cost of what Medicare provides and what you have to fork out of your pocket when you go to see the doctor gets brought down? Making sure that we re-regulate power prices?' they say that they would much rather government get involved and ensure that Australia remains an equal society. They know that $10 or $20 a week gets eaten up just like that.


And the best way to look after low-income earners is to lift the minimum wage and the best way of looking after people who are falling through the cracks is to lift Newstart. That is a better road to go down than engaging in this tax cuts arms race. Every time the opposition falls for the bait from this government on tax cuts and engages in this macho 'my tax cut is bigger than yours' contest going into an election, a little piece of the welfare state dies and a little piece of social democracy dies. We need to defend proper taxation as the price we pay for a civilised society. If we keep getting sucked into this idea that people want bribes of $10 or $20 a week instead of government taking action on the things that are actually putting people under pressure, then we're all going to lose.


So what should the government do instead? Well, let's re-regulate power prices in this country. That will save people more than $10 a week. Let's say that electricity is an essential service that shouldn't be run for profit, that should be in public hands and should be regulated. Let's do that. Let's build more affordable housing and bring down the cost of renting. That will save more than $10 or $20 a week. Let's put the money that's meant to be going into tax cuts for millionaires and instead put it back into public health or into Medicare and we'll bring down the cost of going to see a doctor. That will make people's quality of life much better. 


I think the Australian people would accept a fair level of taxation if they thought the government was spending it properly, if they thought it was going on public schools and public health and making sure Australia remains a more equal society. Most people would rather we do that than have this bribe-fest at every election. This is an appalling budget and I hope that very, very soon this government is no longer the government, but I hope that when there's a change we can shed this idea that we've always got to cut taxes, and, instead, put the focus on services.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:50):  This is a great opportunity for me to really bell the cat and put the last nail in the coffin on the coalition's attempts to portray itself as the better economic manager in this country. That really hasn't been true for a number of decades now. To put this situation in context, look at the reforms that the Hawke-Keating government delivered to us. They really set the platform for the 26 years of unbroken growth that we've had. The Howard government did contribute the institution of APRA but, beyond that, throughout the years, the main thing that they bequeathed to us was structural deficits. In order to address debt-and-deficit issues in the first half of their time in government, they sold off $76 billion of Commonwealth assets—sold off the farm, effectively. That gave you a short-term sugar hit, but, to give you an example of the impacts of that in the long term, we can take the RG Casey Building. They sold that for $200 million. We've now paid $300 million and more in rent on that facility. So, that immediate sugar hit has left us with long-term structural deficit outcomes. 


In addition to that, you can then look at what they were able to benefit from with the mining boom. Out of the mining boom they spent money like there was no tomorrow, so we had ridiculous spending initiatives like the baby bonus. Then we come to the dividend imputation measure they introduced. Keating introduced a measure there which tried to eliminate the double-taxation issue that was going on at the time, where the company tax factor was piled on with taxes on the profits from dividends, which was a sound measure. But then what Howard did was allow, in effect, a double dip there. At the time, that resulted in a $550 million hit to the budget. Now we're looking at an $8 billion to $10 billion hit to the budget, and, if you draw a line through that exponential curve, there was going to be a point where the dividend imputation was going to consume the entire federal budget. 


This is an unsustainable situation. Somebody has to get out and have the guts and the bravery to get out there in the Australian public and argue the case that this has to be done now for future generations. What this government is doing is intergenerational theft: PAYE taxpayers, all those young workers out there now, are going to be sustaining these people who claim, 'This is because we wanted to be independent of pensions.' Well, it's still government money, whatever you call it, and it's unsustainable. One thing that people have to factor in with that issue is that part of your retirement income will be health costs and aged-care services. The only way we can make that affordable, and not make it a user-pays American-style system—which I'm sure no Australian wants to see—is to be able to afford funding those services. The only way we can do that is to make sure we take the prudent measures Labor has put forward—fiscally responsible and prudent—that will deliver better savings and deficit reduction than the government is offering. 


How are we doing that? Removing that dividend imputation is the first part of the story. The rest includes: reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax, what we're doing on trusts, and what we're doing on not giving $80 billion away to big companies and, of course, on the $140 billion giveaway of tax relief to the wealthy. There are so many measures in that that would more than underpin what we want to do to make sure that people in their retirements are well looked-after and that they're not having to pay more—which will eat into their retirement income—on health services. 


When I talk about the economic credibility of this government being destroyed, never mind the 30 polls in a row; let's look at the statistics. What we've seen since 2013 is that there's been an extraordinary boom in global trade, domestic commerce and company profits around the world. So there should have been a significant uplift for Australia in that context, and we should have been maintaining our position relative to the rest of the OECD. But what have we seen instead? From 2009 to 2013, Australia's economic growth was close to the top of the 34 richest countries in the OECD. We've now slipped to 23rd in the list. 


When you look at productivity, we've now dropped to the lowest level since 2012 in the context of the washout of the GFC. Unemployment has now risen from the level which we were at in 2013. Those one million jobs that the government like to claim they created was the track that should have been happening as a year-on-year average with that economic pick-up, but it has actually been below world trends and a lot of that has been casualised. We are now at one of the highest casualisation rates in the OECD, and that's extremely disturbing. In terms of our jobless rate, in 2013 we were ranked seventh in the OECD; now we're down to 17th. So the government is losing here, and its economic credibility is completely destroyed in the context of how we should be looking at this picture in relation to other like nations. 


Then you look at Malcolm Turnbull. He comes into government and we all think he has been wanting to do this job for a long time and so the Prime Minister must obviously have an agenda, but we were sadly disappointed. I am very grateful to the folks at The Marcus Review, who have well documented the thought bubble failures of Malcolm Turnbull since he became Prime Minister. There was what they described in November 2015 as 'super tax episode 1', where Turnbull floated the thought bubble about a super contribution tax rate from 15 per cent to a flat rate 15 per cent discount on the contributor's marginal income tax. That disappeared. He rethought the negative gearing cap in March 2016 and the capital gains tax issue. That disappeared. On 30 March, he talked about building a 'taxation revolution'—another Penrith Park thought bubble in the tradition of Tony Abbott, with all those broken promises. So he has been undoing, effectively, the evolution in our federation of taxation on a more efficient basis. It would have completely destroyed our progressive revolution and evolution in that space. That was an utterly hopeless proposition. I think it was one that he picked up from the former member for Eden-Monaro, who had that as part of his policy proposals, which he set out to the IPA, and that sank without a trace. 


In April 2016, he said that the tax revolution was not going to happen, and that was April Fools' Day. So, no doubt, that was very appropriate on 1 April. And then there was 'super tax episode 2', where he tried to outlift Labor by increasing super contribution rates for anybody earning over $180,000. That died. Turnbull thought about building a high-speed rail revolution in 2016, and that died. Then, in May 2016, we had 'super tax episode 3', where he talked about having another go at raising more revenue by fiddling with people's super. That confused everybody, in particular, Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, who was unable to explain that on radio, famously. In May 2016, both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister announced corporate tax cuts over a period of 10 years, which has absolutely no chance of happening. Then the Prime Minister crashed that plane into a mountain. It became a complete disaster when he tried to do an interview on that regarding the costings. In August 2016, he announced that he wanted to change the GST distribution system, and many interpreted that to mean that he was going to improve Western Australia's share of the GST. Actually, that wasn't what was proposed. He left them trying to work out exactly what was being proposed, and we still don't know, frankly. 


It's a terrible record of his time in government. At the same time, we all know the 2014 budget was cruel, vindictive. It really hurt the most vulnerable in our community. People think maybe the government have walked away from that. Well, a lot of those things are still floating around in subsequent budgets, like raising the pension age to 70 and trying to cut the energy supplement for our pensioners. Now we see their cuts to education and health, which is, to be clear, the cuts to the funding that was flowing from Labor under the health and hospital agreement and Gonski. There has definitely been a cut relative to that funding that was flowing. So they can't pretend there hasn't been. The idea that they're increasing their funding is like saying: 'We'll take four wheels off your car and we'll put one back on, so we're raising the funding. You should be grateful.' That is the classic style of this government. It's all been mythology.


I'm proud of Labor's budget initiatives, which would include bringing back a better hospital fund of $2.8 billion. Health is a big issue in my region. MRI scan facilities in hospitals would be really well received. There is what we want to do with private health insurance. Our initiatives in particular for TAFE—it is so essential for the workforce of the future—would be really well received. I'd love to talk more about the chaos in shipbuilding, which has increased since the last time I recited those issues, the OPV being the latest disaster in that space, which the Audit Office has highlighted, and also this mix-and-match effort the government have tried to make—it has been a disaster. So they're wasting a lot of money in that space. 


On the Snowy 2.0 project, I'd like to point out that in the Marsden Jacob Associates report on the feasibility of Snowy Hydro 2.0, their own flagship proposal—which actually wasn't theirs;  it was Snowy's—clearly sets out that, in order for Snowy 2.0 to be feasible, to be most successful in the new economic environment, you have to have an ambitious renewable energy target. They set out a long-term commitment of 60 per cent renewables by 2040. So the very report that establishes the viability, the economics and the market dynamics of Snowy Hydro 2.0 points out you have to have Labor's ambitious renewable energy targets to make it substantially a financial goer. 


In the time that I have left I would like to briefly comment on the issue of the malarial medicines, which has been very significant for veterans in recent times. A lot of our veterans suffered from effectively what was experimentation with new drugs. I was very fortunate in all my deployments to have used the drug doxycycline before these new experimentations came in. But we're now seeing a really significant issue emerging about the effects of those experimental drugs known as the quinolones family, including tafenoquine. I've had long discussions and communications with Stuart McCarthy, the president of the quinolone veterans and families group, and also Professor Jane Quinn of Charles Sturt University, who's working with that family group and helping the families and veterans. 


We really need to see some more vigorous action in this space. We need to get down to the nuts and bolts of how the big drug companies have been working in this space, because we've got some real suspicions and issues around that. We need to have a claims process that is cleaned up here. We know the UK are already accepting some claims in this space. It's really the neuropsychological aspects that have to be resolved very quickly now. We need an open and transparent outreach program that's a cooperative venture between the VVCS, DVA and veterans as soon as possible. We're really keen to work with the government on this issue. We would like to see Darren Chester, the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, meet with Stuart McCarthy and Jane Quinn. There's a lot of material that they've put together, which is available to any journalist. It's been sent to the government. If any journalist would like to reach out to me to get that material, I have copies of it. This is very serious, because we've had issues of perhaps an interconnection with suicides and other neurological problems as well as physiological problems. This process needs to be resolved; it needs to be open and transparent. We need to engage closely with the veterans groups and the professor and medical experts on this and get it resolved. I've been pleased to work with retired Colonel Ray Martin in Townsville on this. He's been really vigorous and hardworking on behalf of veterans in this space. 


The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, and other members of Labor have been very engaged on this issue, including the member for Herbert, Cath O'Toole, in particular, with so many veterans in her space, and Shayne Neumann. They have all been very vigorous in working with me and engaging with Amanda Rishworth, our shadow minister for veterans' affairs. They are all really determined to make sure we get a result on this. We're not in government, so that is obviously a big constriction, but we've been happy to try and reach out to ministers in the government; there have been so many of them in the veterans space, so hopefully we get some stability with my good friend the member for Gippsland, who I know will be concerned to do the right thing here. Obviously it's a big challenge getting your head around this whole issue with the family of quinolone medicines. We should draw on the examples and evidence emerging from overseas, but we need to do our own inquiry on this, and we need to do it deep and we need to do it fast. We need to see that happening now. I urge the government to engage with Stuart McCarthy and Jane Quinn at the earliest possible opportunity. We really do need to get the Specialist Medical Review Council review embracing the issues in relation to support for the veterans and families. But there is a bigger story to be told here that the veterans groups and families are concerned with in relation to how drug companies have operated and the various suspicions and concerns about that in relation to the information that's available on the impact and effect of these drugs. 


We also need Defence to be much more rigorous in how it implements new drugs in these spaces. I know, from talking to fellow veterans who deployed with me to Iraq for example, that some people who took the drugs and vaccinations related to the chemical weapons threat we faced there now suffer some of the severe side effects of those drugs. We need Defence to be really careful with this stuff in the future. We're talking about people here, not guinea pigs, and I think we're united across the aisles here on wanting to see something happen urgently in this space.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:05):  I endorse and support the comments that were made by the previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro. As someone who had responsibility for that issue during the previous term in my shadow capacity, I understand the distress and strain that it's causing in sectors of the veteran community. I endorse the comments by the member for Eden-Monaro, particularly the call for action by the government. They've been sitting on their hands on this issue for too long. I support and congratulate the member for Eden-Monaro for that contribution, and I endorse what he said, particularly because I was involved in that in my shadow capacity in my last term.


I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the five appropriation bills today, particularly as these are the bills that provide appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of government and allow for the implementation of the 2018-19 budget measures. It was only last night that I spoke in the second reading debate of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill. I talked about the lack of equity and the lack of fairness, especially for women, in this budget, and how it is, unfortunately, typical of what we expect from our colleagues opposite.


When I was discussing that bill I used the opportunity to again call out the government's appalling record on attracting women into its ranks, its appalling record not just in the House of Representatives but also the Senate, and its appalling record for getting rid of women and replacing them with men. I spoke about my concern, my deep concern—my rage actually—about the member for Ryan being dumped for a younger male colleague. I also expressed my concern about the member for Gilmore, and the fact that her preselection was being challenged. I was pleased to see this morning that the issue of the member for Gilmore has actually been fixed. There has been an intervention there, and we are going to continue to see a woman in the ranks there. Those opposite, their record on women is appalling. As I said last night, what part of 51 per cent of the population do you not understand? So I just wanted to put on the record that I was actually pleased for the member for Gilmore to see that news today. It's such a tragedy though that there was no intervention for the member for Ryan. It's a huge loss to the government's expertise.


Labor's women's budget statement noted that in the Treasurer's budget speech there wasn't a single mention of Australian women. There is nothing in the budget that directly addresses women's structural economic disadvantages. Is it really that surprising, given the fact that there are so few women actually in the government who are advising on women's issues, who are challenging policies and suggesting that women actually be considered in the whole process? Their numbers are appalling anyway, and they're actually getting rid of women rather than adding to the numbers—it's just breathtaking. We've got this complete disdain for women, this complete contempt for women, not just borne out in the budget but also in the preselection actions of those opposite, and, as usual, complete and utter contempt and disdain for Canberra.


In last year's budget, Canberra received a dismal 0.004 per cent of the national infrastructure spend, and in this year's budget we received a pathetic 0.02 per cent share. At least that's an improvement from the 0.004 per cent of the spend last year, but I remind Canberrans that the spend was $3 million—whoop dee-doo!—and it was for facilities and maintenance. We're not talking roads here and we're not talking buildings here; we're talking about upgrading of lighting and facilities. And—oh!—there was a review as well. That was regarded as an infrastructure spend by those opposite.


With such a paltry share of the national infrastructure spend last year and this year, it should come as no surprise to Canberrans that they are also being left behind by this government when it comes to the NBN rollout, which is a major infrastructure project for all of Australia. I really don't think I have to remind Canberrans about that. My community suffers some of the worst internet speeds in the country. Almost two years ago I launched the 'Send Me Your Speeds' campaign to get firsthand information about how bad our internet speeds are. Since then, I've shared the experiences of hundreds of Canberrans who are struggling to run businesses, who are struggling to study at home or who are struggling to engage in banking and communication with download and upload speeds of less than one megabit per second.


Canberra has faced countless problems with the NBN rollout under this government—delay after delay, woeful internet speeds and a patchwork of technology, some within the same street. In Canberra we've got fibre to the node, fibre to the premises and fibre to the kerb, often in one street, and a broken technology choice program. The list goes on of the abysmal rollout of the NBN here in Canberra.


Canberra is frustrated about the endless promises from those opposite that have not been delivered. They're frustrated, because the government has overpromised and underdelivered once again. Canberra was nothing more than a big blank space on the NBN rollout map until early last year. After tireless campaigning for my community, we finally managed to get onto the rollout map, and Canberra was looking forward to getting decent internet speeds. We were due for NBN rollout in the first half of this year, but then the goalposts moved and we were advised that the NBN was going to roll out at the end of this year. The utter disregard for Canberra continued with yet another delay. Some areas now won't be connected until some time between June and September next year. It took forever for us to get on the NBN rollout map, and I thank the community for working with me to get us, finally, onto the rollout map. This is the national capital, and here we were as just one big blank space on the NBN rollout map for way too long. Then, when we finally get on the rollout map, to great excitement and looking forward to it actually coming, what do we get? Delay, after delay, after delay, after delay. While the rollout happens on the north side of Canberra and the infrastructure is duplicated in central Canberra, most suburbs on the south side, particularly in the south-east part of Tuggeranong, are forced to wait and wait and wait. It's a slap in the face for the Tuggeranong suburbs expecting to be connected this year. It's a kick in the guts for the people looking forward to finally having an internet service that the government tells them will work.


As I said, I have been running this 'Send Me Your Speeds' campaign for some time. I've heard from hundreds of Canberrans, not just in my electorate but also from right across the ACT, and the feedback has been mind-blowing. Here, in the nation's capital in 2018, we have households fewer than 15 kilometres from Parliament House that are getting less than one megabit per second download speeds. We're talking particularly about south-east Tuggeranong. One person wrote to me about her ADSL plan, running at about 38 megabits per second download and 0.81 upload with no dropouts. She said: 'We recently installed a wireless video doorbell. It will not work properly as it needs an upload speed of at least two megabits per second.' So her internet speeds are so woeful that she can't even run a doorbell to her home. That's how bad it is: she can't even run a doorbell here in parts of Canberra, because the internet speeds are that bad.


Merryn, who lives in Conder, told me she's unable to watch streaming services or listen to music online with her speed of 3.73 megabits per second. Jane in Farrer gets a download speed of 0.89 megabits per second. Jason in Narrabundah gets a pathetic speed. Poor old Jason! I've documented Jason many a time. Listen to this. We're talking Narrabundah—five kays from here, if that. Five kays from Parliament House, poor old Jason, in Narrabundah in the nation's capital in 2018, is getting a pathetic 0.25 megabits per second.


The Canberra homes that have been connected to the NBN used to think they were the lucky ones. 'Finally,' they thought, 'this is the world-class internet that the Turnbull government has been promising me.' But it hasn't taken long for them to start tearing their hair out because of the frustrating, unreliable and out-of-date technology they've received. Thomas in Kambah says that, while his internet speeds have improved slightly on fibre-to-the-node NBN, it's a never-ending cycle of dropouts. First, there's no internet, so he reports it to his internet service provider. They monitor the connection and eventually they refer the issue to NBN. After a few days, the situation improves for a short time. And then the dropouts start again. Since switching to the NBN—again, this is breathtaking; this is in the nation's capital, in 2018, probably 10 to 15 kays from Parliament House—the longest time his internet has been running before it drops out is one day and 10 hours. This poor man has had an internet connection that has been consistent for one day and 10 hours—and, I can assure you, he is counting. With internet speeds delivered on the NBN that can't even operate a doorbell, how are Australian businesses—especially small businesses, especially in my electorate, only five, 10 or 15 kilometres from Parliament House—meant to achieve the success that they've been promised by this government and particularly by this Prime Minister?


This government has also created a digital divide in Canberra with its patchwork of technology, its second-rate copper and its lack of transparency in the rollout decisions. After campaigning tirelessly to get Canberra on the map, our next hurdle is the technology patchwork. A majority of homes in Canberra will get fibre to the node under the current NBN rollout, with some receiving fibre to the curb. Some homes may even be getting fibre to the premises. As I said, there are examples where we've got fibre to the curb, fibre to the premises and fibre to the node all in one street. Many people are reporting issues and slow speeds with the existing ADSL service, which relies on the existing copper lines.


So the question is: is there an upgrade plan for these copper lines? Who knows. When we ask these questions, we can't get any detail. During Senate estimates in February 2017, NBN Co said that there was no capital set aside to upgrade copper lines. So there's no detail in terms of what's actually happening there. At the moment there seems to be no money set aside for copper lines, and so that's just too bad for those who are experiencing these appalling speeds thanks to copper, because there is no plan, or no detail of any plan, for an upgrade to copper lines.


Fibre to the node is not new or impressive, and, as far as internet technologies go, it doesn't set the world on fire. It was initially deployed back in 2005, and countries such as Germany, the UK and New Zealand are now replacing the service with the more reliable fibre to the premises. Just think about that: it has been 13 years since this technology was first deployed internationally, and the countries that have deployed it have since moved on—they've upgraded. And what are we doing? We're building a second-rate copper NBN that costs more and does less. It's just breathtaking how this government expects us to be an innovation nation when we're dealing with this sort of technology based on copper. It's breathtaking.


Canberrans can't get high quality, reliable NBN even when they try. The Technology Choice Program was created to give consumers the choice to upgrade their technology if they were willing to pay for it. But, in addition to constant delays, poor speeds and continuous dropouts, the Technology Choice Program is another failure by this Turnbull government.


Gleneagles Estate has been negotiating with NBN Co for more than two years about upgrading the NBN. The estate currently has fibre to the node, but after consultation most of the residents decided they wanted to upgrade to fibre to the premises. In December 2014 the estate was quoted between $800,000 and $1 million. In 2017 that figure was updated to between $800,000 and $2 million. The estate challenged the figures and a revised amount of $76,000 was required to proceed with the design and quote. Even if you want choice, the cost of getting that choice is ridiculously prohibitive.


Canberrans are absolutely frustrated with this government's lack of a plan for the NBN, the fact we're constantly being delayed in terms of the rollout and the fact we've got this patchwork of technologies. So much for an 'innovation nation'. How can Canberrans do that when they can't even get a service that's going to ring their doorbell?

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:20):  At is heart, this budget, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and related bills, continues what the coalition has been doing from day one, since their election in 2013, which is to continually widen the gap between the haves and the need-mores. The reason I use the term 'need-mores' is that, particularly in the electorate that I represent, people are pretty proud that they can make what they can of what they have, but they clearly need more support. That's the case across Western Sydney. For example, look at the investments that governments should rightly be making—but this coalition has continually neglected—in things like schools, in things like TAFEs, in terms of the infrastructure for the growing area of Western Sydney, one of the fastest growing regions in the country. We still don't see the level of investment that should be there. They should especially be investing in things like hospitals and health care in our area. This budget delivered zip—nothing—particularly for Western Sydney, in a range of those different areas.


This government has committed itself to giving $80 billion to the biggest businesses in this country, it's committed to giving $17 billion to the big banks, and it's already delivered tax cuts of $16,000 to millionaires, but it still can cut to people who need more. It will cut preschool funding, particularly in Chifley, where it still has not been guaranteed to be renewed next year, which might affect just over 2,300 young kids in the Chifley electorate. Schools in Chifley still look set to lose $20 million over 2018 and 2019, because of this government, with its smoke and mirrors, and the defunding that has been occurring through Gonski 2.0. That will affect our area. They cut $3 billion from TAFEs and promised an additional $300 million in cuts this year. They've cut billions from universities, and I've got a big concern about what that does in terms of the University of Western Sydney.


With infrastructure in Western Sydney—as I said, one of the fastest growing regions in the country—the government makes a big deal about the north-south rail it's putting in, yet all it can do is $50 million for a study, when what we really need is a comprehensive approach to people movement in Western Sydney, where our region will rival the other side of the city, the east, in terms of growth. It is likely that 150,000 people will move in, just within the Chifley electorate and to the north of it, through the north-west growth centres—very little there. That's before we even get to talking about the NBN and its failure to keep pace with the local area.


But one of the most disgraceful things the government is doing is that in this budget they will deliver a $5.6 million cut that will affect Mount Druitt Hospital. Basically, it is roughly the same as if you were to cut 13,800 patient appointments—and we are going to see that cut. When you look at this budget, particularly for Chifley, you have cuts to school funding, you have future threats to preschool funding, you have no genuine funding of infrastructure, and you have continued cuts to TAFE—$3 billion, with $300 million extra, which will no doubt affect TAFEs like those in Mount Druitt. And, importantly, you'll see a $5.6 million cut that will affect Mount Druitt Hospital. That's before we even get to the point that there is an MRI in that hospital that has not received a Medicare licence, which would ensure that people aren't paying huge out-of-pocket expenses just to get an MRI scan at their own public hospital. It is an absolute disgrace: a $5.6 million cut, plus no licence for the MRI, sets back people in our area hugely.


In other parts of the budget, what you're seeing now from the coalition concerning job programs is effectively a continuation of the slow march away from the things they wanted to do when they first came into office and a crab walk towards the things Labor said should have happened when we left office and the types of things we've been talking about on the ground with employment service providers as we've moved across the country trying to find out how to make these failing job programs of the government work better. Bear this in mind: when the coalition came in, they were all beating their chests about how they would revamp Work for the Dole. They basically scaled up the number of places to 150,000 per year. They were told that this was way too big a jump, would be counterproductive, and it was questionable whether or not it would happen—and what happened? They started scaling it back. They realised that they'd made a mistake, that they hadn't listened. They put people onto the Work for the Dole at the six-month mark of unemployment, when people were telling them that was way too early. They then moved that from six to 12 months, back to where it should have been. In the last budget they then cut the coordinators that existed to help improve the way the program was going. Has anything been done to improve job outcomes? No. What we've seen as a result is still roughly 10 to 20 per cent of people getting jobs three months after going through the Work for the Dole program. We've seen very little evidence of that.


There's hardly any mention of young people and unemployment in this budget. If anything, the focus on older people and particularly digital skills uplift is what the Labor opposition has been saying publicly, through our discussion with job providers on the ground about getting people ready for the future of work and the impact of technology, should have been happening ages ago. Again, if we suggest an idea and they take it up, we welcome that, but it shows a lack of leadership or ability to think through the problems confronting people.


What a change there has been about innovation! A few years ago we were all agile and nimble—it was an exciting time to be alive—then all the talk faded away and is gone. They have pressed the innovation mute button, and they hardly talk about it. Our side has regularly been pressing the case for this, because you need innovation to drive the growth in new firms and jobs, but the government is trapped in the belief that, if they put out another report or announce another review, that equals innovation. It's garbage. In April 2016 Bill Ferris brought down his report to review the way R&D works in this country, and they only just got around to releasing their response to it—and what did they do? They flagged big cuts to R&D spending. From a government that styled itself as innovative, agile, creative and pro future, we're now seeing massive cuts to the R&D arrangements.


They had some other big announcements—for example, saying that we needed to start thinking more about the application of AI and setting ethical boundaries. They also announced that the DTA would get $700,000 in funding for blockchain. I welcome the ideas, because Labor had been championing them months before. We said last year that Australia should take leadership on the issue of artificial intelligence, and we saw very little out of the government on it, and also that the Digital Transformation Agency should be the central point for applying blockchain within government. We're glad the government have announced these things in their budget, because it's exactly what we've been pushing for.


The real tragedy is that this government rarely thinks ahead. If they're not thinking ahead, they're not planning ahead, and they have pushed acting into the never-never. One group that always has to think ahead is our local venture capital community. They have to have a sense of what's coming in the economy, and they need to be able to test those firms who have ideas that will have the greatest possible benefit to the economy down the track. For years the lack of capital availability to back good ideas in the Australian context has been a big issue. It has become less so recently. For example, in the 2017 year, we've seen capital raisings of about $1.2 billion. It has been fantastic, but we should certainly do more.


For some time, I've been absolutely staggered that our nation's pre-eminent fund, the Future Fund, refused to back local venture capital. It's not like they don't like venture capital; it's just they didn't like Australian venture capital. We have been pressing them since last year to explain this: out of the $2 billion that they put into venture capital, why is it they only invest one to two per cent here? Why is it that taxpayers' dollars can be used to support the growth and evolution of new firms and new jobs offshore, yet we see none of that happening here? In October, when the Future Fund was before estimates, they said that they didn't invest locally because they had doubts about the strength of the local VC community. In fact, the quote from the head of the Future Fund was:


I think one of the things that has held the Australian venture capital industry back is that, frankly, performance hasn't been very good …


Some in the VC community would probably agree with that, but things have changed.


What I found remarkable was that in October, before estimates, the head of the Future Fund said that there are doubts about VC, but his own chief investment officer, just a month before, speaking at the Australian Financial Review's innovation summit, basically castigated everyone else for not backing local VC. In fact, he said it was time for a 'paradigm change'. That's always a good way to get attention. It happens the minute you use that combination of words. Dr Raphael Arndt said at the summit:


To put all your retirement savings on a bet that robust economic growth and lower rates will continue is risky.


He then urged super funds to do more.


Well, in actual fact, Hostplus, AustralianSuper, HESTA, First State Super and all the pesky industry funds that the government likes to target, single out, chastise and harangue—and put in all these new legislative arrangements around and talk down to—have probably put more into local venture capital to back local firms and local jobs than what our own Future Fund has. We had the Future Fund hectoring super funds on one hand and then a month later their own CEO was before estimates saying there are big doubts about local VC performance. That was in October. Suddenly in April, we opened up the Sydney Morning Herald and John McDuling had scored himself an exclusive. Blackbird Ventures—which is a great firm with a great investment portfolio and which is backed by a lot of great Australian tech entrepreneurs—had suddenly scored some money out of the Future Fund. I absolutely congratulate the Future Fund for this. As has been revealed in estimates, Blackbird Ventures have scored anywhere between $20 million to $30 million to back locals. That is good.


Some things that came out of estimates were interesting. There were two things in particular. The Future Fund has outsourced decisions about which of the local VCs they'll back to Greenspring Associates. I don't have a problem with capable outfits making those decisions. They have to because of the quantum involved. But the thing I know, moving in this environment for a number of years now, is that VC tends to have a view—I've seen it, even when I have travelled in the United States—that they will only take a greater interest based on geographic proximity—that is, the closer your firm with the proposition wanting the money is to the location of the VC. They generally tend to back it that way. I don't know how many times Greenspring Associates will be out to Australia and if they've set themselves up here to do the local scoping work of the local venture capital market, but I have to say this is something we will keep an eye on. Labor has been pressing the Future Fund to do more in this space. If Greenspring Associates only does an occasional visit to Australia that might occasionally lead to one article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald about one VC that managed to score $20 million to $30 million out of the Future Fund, then there will be more questions asked by us.


The second thing that is not very clear from the head of the Future Fund, who appeared before estimates, is where they're going to go. For a group that is so fixed on stats, numbers and the concrete, they have not been forthcoming about how they will move from the one per cent to two per cent mark of current local investment from a $2 billion venture capital pool to something better. You would expect better. Don't get me wrong, I think what they're doing is good. We're not advocating a mandate and forcing them to do that. We certainly recognise you have to be very prudent about applying funds in this space, because it is a high-risk class. But the point is this: if the Future Fund has accepted the asset class and if the Future Fund has accepted investing $2 billion in venture capital, then clearly the appetite is there. If they get similar return rates here to what they're getting overseas, it is absolutely incumbent on our nation's Future Fund to back local venture capital.


This is me as a Labor MP arguing this, but a lot of our crew know that you need to back new firms with new ideas to put new drive into an economy that hasn't behaved the same since the GFC. We do need to be clear that Labor will push for this because we see a longer term economic benefit. If we see Greenspring turn up only once a year to scope out local VC and we see only one or two announcements made just to stop the hounding of the Future Fund, that not only is wrong in the short term but is denying us longer term economic prosperity. We will be fixed on this issue longer term.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:35):  I've got to say that, out of all the budgets that I've seen, this budget has the cruellest hoax attached to it. The cruel hoax is on the hopes and dreams of Australians. We see a budget that follows on from other budgets of the Abbott government and the Turnbull government. In the early ones we saw cuts to a whole range of things. For example, in the 2014-15 budget we saw in my own state over $60 billion of cuts to health. That was in one state. You can see the trickle-down effect that this has when you are in a public bed in a hospital. It has effects on it.


This budget is a hoax and a con. It says one thing but does another. It's a budget that continues making cuts to pensioners, hospitals, schools and universities and has new cuts for the ABC—the national icon, something that is revered by all Australians—and TAFE at the same time. We know that young people and mature-age people need skills to get into the workforce. TAFE has served us very well over the years. It skills up people who perhaps left school early or whose life, for whatever reason, took them in a different direction. TAFE skills them and assists them to get back into the workforce. They get a certificate. It's a stepping stone to bigger and better things.


This is a budget that delivers to the big end of town, to big business, while at the same time making cuts to some of our most vulnerable people. Let's have a look at this budget. It wants to deliver an $80 billion tax cut for the richest end of town, for the banks and the multinationals. Seventeen of those major companies pay no tax at all and yet they're going to be the recipients of the $80 billion tax cut. At the very same time as we're giving out $80 billion we're taking away the $14 a fortnight supplement from pensioners, from people who earn a mere pension, have a Commonwealth care card and struggle to keep a budget—and many do tighten their belts to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. We are taking away $14 a fortnight from those people. At the same time we're giving Australia's richest end of town $80 billion. I don't see how this is right and I don't see how this is fair. It is very un-Australian.


When I think of that scenario I just put to this place—the $80 billion tax cut and the cut to pensioners—the only thing that comes to mind is that this government wants to deliver radical right-wing policies. It is basically a wish list of big business, entrepreneurs who are wanting to make big bucks. It's their demand on the government. I cannot see any other reason for it, apart from the ideological reason.


As I said, it started in 2014 with the budgets of the Abbott government and it has continued. We have seen attacks on trade unions and the Human Rights Commission. Even a policy came in to water down section 18C of our racial discrimination laws. They backed off on that, not because they thought it was wrong but because they didn't have the numbers in the Senate to pass a bill that would have made it easier for people to discriminate against other people in this nation.


We have always been a nation that has put egalitarianism, fairness and equality before anything else in this nation, and that's why we have become the nation that we are—those things have been fundamental to our democracy. They've been fundamental to the way that we are as a culture here in Australia. And here you had a government that wanted to water down the Racial Discrimination Act to make it easier for people to attack other people on a race basis. There is only one reason for that, and that is an ideological right-wing mentality. That is the only reason a government would go down that track. 


We even saw the introduction of the deregulation of university course fees and the introduction of $100,000 up-front fees for people. Last year it was the company tax cuts, which have already delivered, as we heard from the previous speaker, $17 billion to the banks—at a time when we're hearing before the royal commission about banks charging the accounts of deceased people and meddling in children's bank accounts. This year, we see the radical proposal for a flat tax for people earning incomes between $40,000 and $200,000. So, if you're a cleaner working on $40,000 a year—subsidising the family's income because it may be part-time work, or it may be the only income you have—you will be asked to pay the same tax as most of us in this, who are on much more, pay. The flat tax for someone on $40,000 and someone on $200,000 will be the same. 


I, like other members on this side in this place, know that we live in one of the best countries in the world, and, as I said before, in a country that has always been fair. Our families—in my case—chose to make Australia home, and we're all proud to serve our local communities. And it's not just us who recognise what a great country we live in: our capital cities, such as Adelaide, where I come from, and Perth and Melbourne consistently rate in the top 10 liveable cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. This has come to be because of the way that we have been for years. It's come to be because of the equality that we've had, the equality that we've always strived for to ensure that we are a nation where people respect one another, regardless of whether you're a cleaner or a professor. We have this great equality in Australia, and we don't want to see it watered down, which is exactly what this government was doing with 18C. 


I don't think it's fair, as I said, for cleaners, aged-care workers, hospitality workers or retail workers to have their penalty rates cut. We know that this is the direction this government wants to go down. We know that someone who is working on weekends, who is giving up family time, shouldn't be penalised by having their penalty rates cut. It is wrong. Our progressive tax system in this nation has served us extremely well over the years, and it is one of the bedrocks of our system. It ensures that we have fairness in our society, based on the idea that those with greater means should contribute a little more. There's nothing wrong in that, and that's the way that this nation has operated for many years. It's a system that's served us well and will continue to serve us well.


Labor will deliver. On this side of the House, we will deliver a fairer system, a system that takes those things into perspective. We will deliver a bigger, a better and a fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians. That's almost double what the government has offered. We can afford to do more to help because we're not giving that $80 billion tax cut to the richest end of town. We're not delivering $17 billion to the banks and $80 billion across the board to some of the richest people in this country. That's why we can afford to have a bigger, better and fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians that is, as I said, double the amount that the government has offered. 


I am a member who represents an electorate with one of the largest proportions of people over the age of 65,  and I know that my colleague the member for Richmond also has a very similar electorate. In fact, when we came into this House, we were competing about who had the highest proportion of people aged over 65, and we were  always neck and neck. So I know that the member for Richmond understands the needs of older Australians, as we all do on this side. 


We know that they've worked all their lives, that they have contributed to this nation and that we now benefit from the fruits of the life that they lived and the contributions that they made. In many cases, they fought in wars to enable us to live the lives that we do. And all they're asking for is some dignity in their old age. What do I mean by providing dignity? Well, they need aged-care facilities that are appropriate facilities, and services that will look after them. Certainly, we know that extra home care packages are needed.


The aged-care announcement for older Australians that the minister made on budget night was one of the biggest cons that I've seen since I saw the movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin and Michael Caine. We know that 14,000 extra places were given in this budget, but we know that there's 100,000 people on the waiting list for aged-care packages. We know that the rate for people needing aged-care packages rises by approximately 10,000 per quarter. So we've already got 100,000 people on a waiting list for an aged-care package so that they can be looked after at home, because they're old and frail, but the list is growing currently, and it's growing at a rate of about 10,000 per quarter. So in 12 months that list will be 120,000.


The government has offered 14,000 packages and the list is still growing. This is the greatest con job that I've ever seen in terms of an announcement. It just doesn't make sense. If we really want to get to the bottom of the problem we have to offer many, many more packages. And it's not fair. When we look at the detail of what they've proposed, it is paid for through cuts to residential care. They've taken money away from residential care and will barely make a dent in the waiting list. As I said, the figures we had recently showed there were 20,000 places in the last six months. So we've got 100,000 and it grows by 10,000 every quarter, then we announce 14,000 places and it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. To me, that's a con job. It's an absolutely terrible trick to play on older Australians.


Apart from that, at the same time we're taking away the $14 energy supplement that assists them to pay their energy bills and which they receive every fortnight in their pension. At the same time as that, $80 billion is going to the richest end of town, to the people who, in their minds, need it the most. I can't work that out. And, of course, they're increasing the aged pension eligibility for someone to be eligible for an aged pension at the age of 70.


If this government wants to talk about our older Australians, I'm very proud to have listened to them. I listen to people every day who tell me how they struggle to survive and to live on a pension. These are people who have actually worked damn hard for their entire lives, and they do so still in the way that they look after grandkids, are a part of our community as volunteers and have contributed so much to this nation. I know so because I've held ageing forums with the shadow minister—the former minister, the member for Port Adelaide—in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I've advocated for a better and fairer go for those who need help. After giving so much to this nation, the least we could do is to give them some dignity in their old age.


We will be judged as a nation in the future by the way that we have looked after our elderly. We see some reports coming out in the media, where some of the aged-care facilities are allocating $6 a day for food—$6 a day for food! We saw that report recently, and that is a disgrace. It's something that governments should be investigating and looking into immediately.


Recently, I was contacted by a carer on behalf of her mother, who lives in the western suburbs of my electorate. She's lived in her house since the mid-1950s. She went through the process of an assessment and had ACAT approval in December 2015 for a level 3 to 4 package. My constituent has become frustrated and had to continue to follow up with the department, but to no avail. After raising this matter continuously we've finally secured a package, and she is receiving the support and respite that she deserves. So why does it require ministerial intervention to get a result? And what about those who don't speak up? It's just not right.


Labor in government has a proud record, a very proud record, of delivering for older Australians. I will continue to deliver, as will the member for Richmond, who is sitting next to me, and the member for Bruce, who I know has a big population of older Australians in his electorate. It is something that we on this side think is one of the most important things—that is, to give back to those that gave their entire lives for the next generation of Australians to live the wonderful lives that we have in this nation.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (11:50):  I too rise to speak on the appropriation bills. As many speakers on this side have pointed out, we do support the bills in the same way that convention has dictated for many years that we support supply; however, we also point out how our priorities are very different from those of the government. It must be stated that this budget, like every other one brought down by this Liberal-Nationals government, fundamentally and unequivocally fails the fairness test.


There will be an impact from this budget on my electorate. This budget puts big business and the banks ahead of the battlers on the North Coast. This National Party budget gives away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, including $17 billion for the big banks, and it makes locals pay for it with savage cuts to schools, hospitals and pensions. That's what the National Party have done with this budget. In fact, they own it.


The budget fails the fairness test on so many levels. It fails the fairness test on pensioners. The government is cutting the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight, and forcing people to keep working until they're 70. It fails the fairness test on education. The government is still cutting $17 billion from schools, and it now has $270 million in new cuts to TAFE. It fails the fairness test on hospitals. The government's cuts means Australians will be left on hospital waiting lists for much longer. It also fails the fairness test on Medicare. The government's freeze on the rebate for specialists means that Australians will pay more when they visit the doctor.


It's important to note that, on the back of the best global economic conditions in more than a decade, this government has failed the fiscal responsibility test it set for itself. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Abbott-Turnbull government came into office in 2013, and this year's deficit is 6½ times bigger than the Liberals and Nationals predicted in their first budget, their horror budget, of 2014—and we all remember that one! This budget is wrong in its priorities and it fails every test of fairness and every test of fiscal responsibility.


Pensioners and seniors in my electorate on the New South Wales North Coast are some of the biggest losers when it comes to this budget. The government is keeping the unfair plan to increase Australia's pension age to 70, meaning we'll have one of the oldest pension ages in the world. And it's important to know that in every single budget that the Liberals and Nationals have handed down they've tried to cut the pension in order to cut taxes for big business. Pensioners remember that the government tried to cut the pension indexation, a cut that would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of pensioners. They also remember that the Liberals and Nationals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension for around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. Budgets are all about choices, and once again the Prime Minister has chosen the banks and the big end of town over Australia's pensioners.


When it comes to health, Labor are the party that believe in universal health care, and we're determined to fix our hospitals. The Liberals and Nationals have cut funding for Medicare and hospitals in every year since they first got into government after the 2013 election. The budget fails in the hospital and healthcare area on a very large scale. At the same time they're giving that big tax cut to big business, they're persisting with their cruel $715 million cut to hospitals over the next two years and they're keeping their Medicare rebate freeze in place for years to come. This is forcing up out-of-pocket costs to see specialists. They've also failed to do anything to address the private health insurance affordability crisis and they've failed to adopt Labor's plan to scrap the unfair and discriminatory tampon tax. This budget proves yet again that the government cares more about tax cuts for big business and multimillionaires than it does about the health of ordinary Australians.


Meanwhile, their hospital cuts are putting doctors, nurses and hospital staff under increasing pressure, forcing delays in surgeries and making emergency department waiting times even worse. Contrast this with Labor's plans. We're committed to building better hospitals, with record funding for beds, doctors and nurses, and we've announced our plan to cap health insurance premium price rises at two per cent for two years. Labor's better hospitals fund will see a $2.8 billion extra investment, fully reversing the Turnbull government's cuts, and we'll be funding more beds in emergency departments and wards, more doctors, more nurses and more health staff. The funding will be targeted at reducing emergency department and elective surgery waiting times, which have blown out under this government.


A Shorten Labor government will also ensure more communities have affordable access to life-saving scans, expanding Medicare subsidised access to diagnostic imaging in areas where there are shortages. We'll invest $80 million to boost the number of eligible MRI machines and approve 20 new licences, which means half a million more scans will be funded by Medicare. This is vitally important for regional communities such as mine. Labor's commitment will mean more affordable scans for Australians, addressing shortages in communities that need them the most. 


Also, as I've mentioned, many parts of Australian society are suffering because of this government's wrong priorities. On the North Coast of New South Wales, in particular, there is a homelessness crisis and a housing affordability crisis. Our state National Party MPs have done nothing to alleviate this crisis at a state level, and their federal mates just make it even worse. The Turnbull government's budget has again failed to deliver anything that will actually alleviate either the housing or the homelessness crisis. The government continues to ignore those young Australians who are seeking to purchase their first home by refusing to adopt our changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. 


Let's have a look at their record. Since coming to government in 2013, the Liberal-National government has presided over a crisis in which home ownership rates for young Australians have collapsed to their lowest level in the 30 years. Fewer than 40 per cent own their own home compared with 60 per cent just a generation ago. Rental stress has risen substantially. Anglicare's recent Rental Affordability Snapshot has revealed that less than three per cent of private rental dwellings are affordable for a single person on the minimum wage. Data from the 2016 census has revealed that the number of Australians experiencing homelessness has dramatically risen by 13.7 per cent since 2011. Those are damaging statistics. 


I make the point that, despite the gross inaction of the Liberal-National government, in my electorate and in many others there are remarkable people, institutions and organisations that are doing great work when it comes to homelessness. One such person is John Lee, the president and founder of You Have A Friend. He has 80 volunteers providing over 300 meals a week to the homeless and marginalised in my region. He gets no assistance from any government agency to do that. I always like to congratulate John and those like him who do a wonderful job out there. 


Another area that is subject to the government's cruel cuts is aged-care services. The budget has revealed a cruel hoax at the centre of the government's aged-care plan. The government is slashing residential care to try and fix the home care crisis it created. The fact is that there is no new money at all in the budget for the funding of home care and residential aged care. More than 21,000 residential aged care places will be cut over the next three years to pay for the very small increase in the number of home care packages, and none of this will solve the crisis in home care created by the government: 3½ thousand places a year will not keep pace with demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017. In my electorate, we have a very high proportion of seniors. This is a huge issue. They are desperately trying to get home care packages, and we've just seen cuts by this government.


Another harsh cut is that to the ABC. We all remember on the eve of the 2013 election that the member for Warringah, then the opposition leader who was to become the Prime Minister, said that there would be no cuts to the ABC. That is what he said. It turned out to be another broken promise. The government imposed cuts of over $250 million on the ABC, and now the current Prime Minister's budget contains a further $127 million in cuts to the ABC. The government just keeps proceeding with cuts to the ABC. The government has also frozen indexation of operational funding for the ABC, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. What this means in reality at the ABC is cuts to jobs, cuts to content and cuts to services. This will have a devastating impact across the country, but particularly in the regions where we value so much our local ABC and the services it provides. It's another shameful cut by this government.


Also, under this government, education at all levels is under threat, yet again. The Prime Minister and his Liberal-National government insist on giving handouts to big business at the expense of our children's education and wellbeing. When it comes to preschools, our youngest minds are facing uncertainty, with around 350,000 preschools and families facing the prospect of absolutely no further provision of new funding. It means one of two things: fees will increase or services will close. Next year, families will have to start paying for their children to start preschool, without any certainty that the preschools will be funded. One in four families will be worse off come 2 July, under the Turnbull government's unfair childcare package. We believe education is an essential part of a child's development, but this government doesn't. It prefers to put big business before Australian families. 


The government continues its assault on education with its schools policy. Its policy is not needs based, it's not sector-blind and it's certainly not fair. In contrast to the government, we're fully committed to the fair funding of our schools and, in particular, our public schools. In government, Labor will restore every dollar of the $17 billion that the Liberals and Nationals have cut from schools. Under Labor the neediest schools will get the biggest funding increases in the fastest time. Our public schools are among the nation's most important institutions, and one of the most fundamental responsibilities of any government should be to ensure public schools are fairly funded to deliver quality education.


There are government cuts for our TAFE students as well. The government cut funding for skills and TAFE in order to pay for those big business tax handouts. The budget cuts an extra $270 million from TAFE and training. That's on top of the $3 billion of cuts in previous budgets—shameful! In contrast, Labor will invest in TAFE, skills, vocational education and higher education. Under us the number of Australians getting a university education will soar by about 200,000, thanks to our plan to abolish the Turnbull government's unfair cap on student places. Australia's future depends so much on properly investing in our preschools, schools, TAFEs and universities so that all of them can deliver the best quality education to all of our students.


Labor's approach to budget tax cuts is much fairer for middle Australia, and so much fairer for locals on the North Coast in my electorate. We're proud of our much fairer tax plan that will deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians across the country. A Shorten Labor government will be guided by clear fiscal principles, including repairing the budget in a fair way that doesn't ask the most vulnerable Australians to carry the heaviest burden. The Turnbull government's budget makes those most vulnerable people carry the heaviest burden. We'll more than offset new spending with savings and revenue improvements. Our plan is much fairer and more responsible because we've made all the right calls when it comes to tax reform.


As well as making those correct calls, we will also, as I've said, deliver extra funding for public hospitals and 20 new MRI machines to regional centres and outer suburbs, and abolish the Prime Minister's cap on university places and the up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places in courses where Australia needs the skills. That is a major commitment which is very important for training. We can deliver all these commitments across all those areas because of our choices and priorities. Unlike the Prime Minister and this Liberal-National government, we won't give out $80 billion in tax handouts to big business and the banks; we will particularly prioritise areas like education, health and hospitals.


The extent of some cuts in another area was only revealed yesterday—that is, the government's cutting of over 500 Australian Federal Police staff. As a former police officer I feel strongly about this. Yesterday we heard damning evidence at Senate estimates, which exposed the impact of the Prime Minister's savage cuts to the Australian Federal Police. At yesterday's hearing it was confirmed by the AFP Commissioner that there would be a $205 million cut to resourcing the AFP over the forward estimates. There's a cut of over 500 Australian Federal Police staff. That is a huge number when it comes to resources within the Federal Police. Instead of supporting those dedicated officers in the AFP to perform their critically important work, the Liberals and Nationals have chosen to cut AFP funding and slash over 500 staff. It is truly shameful that our AFP are being cut so harshly.


In conclusion I specifically note the role of the National Party in this harsh budget. They're wholly responsible for these cruel measures and how they affect the regions. The National Party own all the cuts and harsh measures. The Nationals have abandoned the people of the regions in areas like mine, the New South Wales North Coast. We will spend every single day up until the next election reminding people in the country, the regions and rural Australia that the National Party has abandoned them. This National Party budget gives away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business—including, very importantly, $17 billion for the big banks. It makes local people in regional and rural Australia pay for it with savage cuts to schools, hospitals and pensioners. That's what the National Party have done with their budget. They can go out to country Australia and explain why they have $80 billion for tax cuts, including $17 billion for the big banks, why funding for their schools, their hospitals and their ABC has been cut, and why there is no funding to support homeless people, education and other important services. I can tell you what people in regional and rural Australia will say to them: 'We've had enough of you. You've abandoned us. You're looking after the top end of the town and not people in rural and regional Australia.'


I can tell you this: the people who do look after those in regional and rural Australia are us; that's the Labor Party. We stand with them. We stand with those ordinary battlers who are doing it tough out there. That's our priority. You've got the Turnbull Liberal-National government, and their priority is big business and the banks. It's pretty straightforward. Labor's priority is the battlers, the working class, the middle class and people doing it tough. We stand with them, and we certainly stand with them in regional and rural Australia. We'll continue to do that. Every day up until the next election we'll be doing that, particularly across the country, and we'll be reminding them what the National Party have done to them with their support of this unfair budget.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (12:05):  I rise to speak on the appropriation bills, which are the Turnbull government's decisions about how they will tax Australians and how they will spend Australians' tax dollars once they've collected them. Just like budgets past, they deliver a clear picture of what the Turnbull government stands for. This, sadly, is a coalescence of no vision. They have no vision at all. Contrary to the rhetoric from the Treasurer on budget night, the Prime Minister in the media and every single government MP speaking on the bill, the Liberal and National Party do not stand for fairness. Fairness is not a quality you can fake, fairness is not a quality you can rote learn and fairness is not a quality you can trot out when it suits your political interests in the electoral cycle and then shove far down in the bottom drawer. Fairness comes from the heart and not from a focus group. It's a set of values and a belief that informs every decision you make.


I want to use this speech today to go through some of the elements of this budget, piece by piece, to explain exactly how out of touch the Turnbull government is when it comes to policies that damage Australia and do not set out a clear future. What we have is a budget that is slightly less cruel than other coalition budgets, but it is yet another attempt by the coalition to trick Australians into believing that the coalition care about everyone rather than just the top end of town. The government's fiscal strategy, as unveiled in 2014, has failed. Federal government gross debt has surged from $310 billion in 2014 to over $534 billion this year. Net debt, as a share of GDP, has risen from 13.1 per cent in 2013 to a disgraceful nearly 20 per cent this year. If the coalition government ever claims that they're competent economic managers, Australians need to tell them that they're dreaming.


This budget, yet again, demonstrates the failure of the Turnbull government to properly fund frontline health services, particularly hospitals and Medicare. Fundamentally, the Turnbull government does not care about the health of Australians; they believe it should be a private responsibility. The Turnbull government doesn't care about protecting our wonderful public health system. It does not fundamentally believe in Medicare. Health fairness is not in the DNA of the coalition government. This government is ripping $160 million out of Queensland public hospitals. What's that the equivalent of? It's the equivalent of 240,000 emergency department visits or 44,000 cataract extractions that can change someone's life. It's the equivalent of 6,150 knee replacements, which might enable someone to go back to work, or 26,500 births. That's a lot of money. It will affect every Queenslander and every Queensland family. The next time someone is cradling one of their children or sitting with a loved one in the emergency ward, soothing their distress, they will simply have to wait longer to receive the necessary health care.


For people living in Brisbane's south side in Moreton, the hospitals that service the needs of their families will have their funding slashed by this uncaring Turnbull government. The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital will have its funding cut by more than $2 million and Princess Alexandra Hospital will have its funding cut by more than $13 million, and we know how many Queenslanders these hospitals look at. The Turnbull government simply do not understand fairness nor do they understand the damage they are doing to our public hospital system. In question time and after question time, they stand and try to pull the wool over the eyes of Australians and tell them that there are no cuts to hospitals; but we know that this is simply not true. The budget papers reveal this.


Here are the facts: in the 2013 election platform, the Liberal Party stated that they would fund public hospitals at 50 per cent growth funding of the efficient price of the cost of hospital services. That was in the Liberal Party's election commitment. Then, the 2014, 2015, 2016 and now 2018 budget papers show that the government is in fact only funding public hospitals at 45 per cent of growth in hospitals and a cap of 6.5 per cent overall growth in funding. This volte-face from the government represents a $715 million cut to Australian hospitals between 2017 and 2020. What does that translate into? A $3.2 million cut to QEII hospital and a $13 million cut to the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Shame!


As a former teacher and a parent with two boys, one in primary school and one in high school, I know that education is crucial. It has always been important to me. Unfortunately, we see a Turnbull government that does not value education—not education for all, that's for sure. In this budget, the Turnbull government missed the chance to restore the $17 billion cut from Australian schools. That's right—the coalition can find $17 billion in tax cuts for the big banks, but they can't find $17 billion to educate our kids. Here's the bottom line; it's very simple. Under Labor led by Bill Shorten, Labor will restore every cent. Of this funding we'll put it back into our schools, nearly 90 per cent of it will go to public schools—the schools needing it the most, the schools that do the heaviest lifting in society. 


In Moreton, $15 million has been ripped from public schools, and this Turnbull budget will not restore it. Shame! These cuts will mean fewer teachers for Moreton schools, less one-on-one attention for children in Moreton and less help with the basics like reading, writing and maths for Moreton schoolkids. I've said it before and it's so true: the Turnbull government are economic vandals masquerading as politicians. They want to talk about how the economy works for big business, but they don't think about how our economy works for everyone, especially if our kids can't get a decent education. We know from the Gonski investigation that productivity gains come from investing in education. The Turnbull government are short-sighted. We know that investing in our schools benefits everyone and our country. 


I'm appalled that the Turnbull government is ripping a further $270 million from TAFE, skills and apprenticeships in this year's budget, and that $270 million cut comes on top of the more than $3 billion—yes, $3 billion—that this out-of-touch government has already ripped from vocational education and training. This comes at a time when nine out of 10 new jobs created in the next four years will need either a university degree or some sort of TAFE qualification. That's why Labor believes in quality universities and strong public TAFEs, working side by side, equal partners investing in our nation's future. Labor's alternative vision in this space could not be clearer. Let's go through it. 


Labor, under Bill Shorten, will stop the slide to dodgy private providers and back public TAFE all the way. We'll renovate campuses and rebuild workshops. We will ensure that two out of every three, as a minimum, of our training dollars go to public TAFE. We'll invest in programs to help older workers retrain later in life. Also, in our first term, Labor will cover all up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places in high-priority sectors. We would expect at least half of these opportunities to go to the women of Australia. Under Labor, a skills vacancy will not last one day longer than it takes to train an Australian to do that job. 


I've spoken about Labor's vision for education—primary, secondary and vocational—and now I'll finish the quadrella with tertiary. There is a quote from Confucius that I often like to use when discussing education, which says: 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.' Labor takes the long-term view of education. In government, Labor uncapped degree places and opened the doors of university to a new generation. Tens of thousands of students became the first person in their family to go to university—the 'fair go' in action. But the Liberal freeze on university funding means 10,000 fewer places are available next year and, by 2032, over 200,000 people will miss out. And who misses out? Bizarrely, the once great National Party—the people that are supposed to believe in the bush—have wandered off the back roads and hit a bore drain and they're locking students from regional Australia out of university and doing the same to working-class kids. 


A Shorten Labor government would restore certainty to this sector. We will uncap places, providing our nation with over 200,000 more university graduates. What does this mean for Moreton and the southside? When Labor first uncapped places there were 1,455 more uni places from 2008 through to 2016. Under Labor's new policy we'll see about 2,150 more students in Moreton alone on their way to university and the opportunities that brings. In Queensland, it would mean nearly 38,000 more students realising their dreams of a university qualification and the careers that follow. Under Labor, a university education is not a privilege you inherit; it's an opportunity you earn with talent and hard work.


If you search through these budget papers you won't find a single cent for the critical Cross River Rail, linking Dutton Park, on the south side of the city, with many places beyond—another snub by the Turnbull government for all who live in South East Queensland. The existing inner-city rail crossing over the Brisbane River, Merivale Bridge, is at full capacity. Infrastructure Australia has known this for years. We've tried to tell Prime Minister Turnbull, but he just doesn't get it. He must be too focused on Sydney. The four stations that are linked to it, that are common across the entire train network—Roma Street, Central Station, Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills stations—then cause a bottleneck and a scheduling nightmare, one that actually flows right through to Redcliffe, to Beenleigh on the Ipswich line, to the Gold Coast, to Ferny Grove, to the Sunshine Coast and out to Cleveland. Every train that travels in Brisbane basically goes through these four stations, yet it's at capacity. The federal Labor Party committed $2.24 billion to partner with the Queensland Labor government to get this project done. In this budget the endlessly out-of-touch Turnbull government failed to take up our offer of bipartisanship to deliver this critical piece of congestion-busting public transport infrastructure that would serve all Queenslanders. Sadly, they are contributing to productivity bottlenecks in Queensland and it is not good enough. Queenslanders know that Cross River Rail will help to reduce congestion on local roads and get southsiders back home to their families after work much sooner.


But there is another important piece of infrastructure that was also overlooked by the Turnbull government. There is no mention of it at all in the budget papers: the Cooper Plains rail crossing. I wrote to Prime Minister Turnbull before the budget asking him to stand up and help southsiders. Sadly, I'm yet to hear back. Maybe my letter got lost in the post or something! So, I stand here again, publicly asking the Prime Minister, the infrastructure minister and Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk, all members of the Liberal and National parties: surely they can work something out and join the Queensland government to get this mess sorted?


I know that under Lord Mayor Campbell Newman two of the rail crossings on the north side were funded on a fifty-fifty basis. Sadly, Lord Mayor Quirk is offering only 15 per cent for the people on the south side of Brisbane. I note that it would be unfair that any northsider would want the southside to be treated the same! I've got a solution for this mess. I think it should be funded a third by the federal government, a third by the state government and a third by local government. The lord mayor has to go up only a further 18 per cent from the 15 per cent. That's my solution. What could be fairer in terms of getting things sorted?


I know the people of Moreton are sick of people arguing about the politics of who's responsible for the roads, the rail and the footpaths and all that sort of thing, and they are sick of buck-passing. I'm bringing the boom gate down on that sort of politics. My commitment to them is that I will get it done for you.


In every single budget that the coalition government has handed down since they took office in September 2013 they have tried to cut the pension—the coalition government has tried to cut the pension. Let's look at very recent history under coalition governments. The 2018 budget has done nothing to reverse the cuts already made, or to stop Mr Turnbull's cruel cut to the energy supplement. They've added 14,000 additional high-level Home Care Packages—a tick for that—while actually reducing the number of residential care places—a big cross for that. It is a bit of chicanery from the government, given that in its 2016 budget they had already cut aged care by $1.2 billion. With 105,000 older Australians currently on the waiting lists for Home Care Packages, 14,000 places over four years will not even keep pace with the current demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone.


Labor has always protected pensioners and always will. Labor's recently announced pensioner guarantee will ensure that pensioners can still access cash refunds from excess dividend imputation credits. I will continue to fight to stop the government cutting the energy supplement and also increasing the pension age to 70. Surely, that decision could only be made by someone who had never done a week of labouring in their life. Recently I stood in this parliament and spoke about the fundamental unfairness of the Turnbull government's personal income tax plan. That unfairness is why Labor is seeking to get the bills split so that we can immediately support the parts that are fair. Labor will support the initial tranche to begin on 1 July and then go further to deliver bigger, better and fairer tax cuts for 10 million Australians after that.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  I thank the member for Moreton and will just remind him—he's a very experienced member—that when addressing the Prime Minister not to do so by his surname. I didn't stop you; I let you finish. Thank you to the member for Moreton.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:20):  In speaking to these appropriation bills, I want to highlight that there are two truisms in budgets and in politics. The first, in terms of budgets, is that they are about choices. The second, in terms of politics, is that it is often that which is small that can be the most significant. It may not be the biggest line item in the budget, but it is certainly of enormous significance: I am talking about this government's $83.7 million cut to the ABC. I want to make it clear that Labor will fight these cuts. It is quite apparent that this government fails to appreciate the strong faith and value that Australians have when it comes to their ABC. It is a trusted institution and it is one that is relied on for quality news, as a provider in regional Australia and for emergency broadcasting.


It was quite telling in Senate estimates last night, for example, where we did have some specific questioning about the potential impact of these budget cuts on Tasmania. The question asked by Senator Urquhart to the ABC was, 'Can you guarantee Tasmania will be spared any cuts because of the government's budget decision?' The CFO of the ABC replied, 'No, Senator, I cannot guarantee Tasmania will not experience any cuts.' This comes off the back of then Leader of the Opposition Abbott's solemn promise on the eve of the 2013 election of no cuts to the ABC. This is a persistent reminder that the Liberals can't be trusted when it comes to such an important public institution. Since the 2014 budget, we have already seen a cut of some quarter of a billion dollars to the ABC. Since 1 July 2014, around 800 jobs have been lost at the ABC, including 23 at ABC Tasmania. Now, with this latest cut of around $84 million, we know that this will have—and cannot it be ruled out, as the ABC has said—adverse impacts on Tasmania.


I took the opportunity, since the questioning was about Tasmania, to have a look at the track record of the former member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley. Speaking on appropriation bills nearly four years ago, he talked about why he wanted to be a member of parliament. He said:


I wanted to be a member of parliament since I was 12—


Good on him. He said:


It was to ensure that the excellent services that Australians have come to expect are sustainable into the future. … This budget fulfils those aspirations.


That was the 2014 budget. The aspiration was to cut around a quarter of a billion dollars from the ABC. That was when, as I said, the night before the 2013 election a solemn promise was made that there would not be cuts to the ABC. I would like to know where those aspirations are for a strong, viable and independent public broadcaster. It is very clear that support for the ABC is strong. For example, a poll done by the Australia Institute found that 70 per cent of people wanted a strong ABC and 60 per cent of people agreed the ABC needed a boost to long-term funding. They view it as critical to a healthy democracy and oppose a cut to ABC funding.


The Essential Reportcame out only the other day. Let's look at the specific line items of what people do and don't support in this budget. Total opposition to cutting spending on the ABC was 45 per cent. Indeed, a list of items in the budget were assessed. It is abundantly clear that people trust the ABC and do not want it cut. We had the Minister for Communications yesterday in Senate estimates specifically asked, 'Can you make a declaratory statement—can you declare—whether or not the people of Australia can trust you with the ABC?' He gave a response that had all the enthusiasm of a wet weekend. He replied, 'They can have confidence that this government will always support the independence of the ABC and assure that it is appropriately resourced.' The truth of the matter is, indeed, a very different story. This government has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted with the ABC. It just shows how out of touch this Prime Minister is with the Australian people.


The ABC is the public broadcaster, not the state broadcaster—a distinction that appears to be lost on this Prime Minister and his minister. I think it is clear that there is a stark contrast when you look at attitudes towards the ABC and at the attitudes of the government and individual government members—and I'm sure the member sitting at the table will agree with me as well. We on this side of the parliament actually believe in the ABC. It's something that we actually support—we support public broadcasting as an important part of our democracy; it is a trusted institution—whereas it is quite clear that those in the government do not in their heart of hearts support the ABC.


This budget once again exposes the weakness of this Prime Minister. I have another choice quote. In 2013 the now Prime Minister said:


… there is no more committed defender of public broadcasting … than me.


Well, God help us! In 2014 he said:


… the role of the public broadcasters in our national life today is more important than ever, as the business model of the newspapers in particular is under threat and newsrooms dwindle.


With defenders like that, the ABC certainly doesn't need any enemies—they've got enough on that side of the parliament.


What have we seen from the Liberals and this Prime Minister on the ABC? As I said, on the eve of the 2013 election the member for Warringah gave a solemn promise, while staring down the barrel of a camera, 'No cuts to the ABC.' Have a look at their record. They cut $254 million over five years in the horror 2014 budget. In 2016 they cut a further $28 million from the enhanced news-gathering service that Labor helped set up. In 2018 they cut a further $83.7 million from the ABC with a freeze on indexation. The reality is that Liberal cuts to the ABC hurt and they have consequences. Since 2014 around 800 ABC staff have lost their jobs, the Australia Network has been axed, shortwave radio has been shut down and the number of hours of ABC factual programming has dropped by 60 per cent, drama has dropped by 20 per cent and documentaries have dropped by 13.5 per cent.


Then in 2015 the Prime Minister appointed Senator Fifield—a card-carrying member of the IPA—as the Minister for Communications. The minister's membership of the IPA is disclosed in his register of interests and was confirmed at Senate estimates yesterday. Let's have a look at what the IPA advocates. It advocates that the ABC be broken up. In 2012, in the article 'Be like Gough: 75 radical ideas to transform Australia'—one I'm sure Gough certainly would not have endorsed—the following items are listed:


50 Break up the ABC and put out to tender each individual function


51 Privatise SBS


In October 2008 the now Minister for Communications said in an address to the Australian Adam Smith Club:


Conservatives have often floated the prospect of privatising the ABC and Australia Post. There is merit in such proposals.


This minister is a serial complainer about the ABC. The list of what he has complained about is as long as your arm: everything from the date of the Triple J Hottest 100 to a host of others. We know that this government did a dirty backdoor deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation for the repeal of the two-out-of-three media ownership rule. Senator Pauline Hanson has basically said the ABC is a waste of money. We had well-known reports of her threats to block some of these changes unless money was cut from the ABC budget. We have three bills currently before the parliament and a faux 'competitive neutrality' inquiry. Those three bills include, supposedly, some commitments to rural and regional Australia—it is quite ironic that this government thinks by cutting the ABC it can expand the services it provides—a so-called 'fair and balanced' bill and a bill about salary disclosure. Now Australians risk losing much-loved programs and services just because this Prime Minister won't stand up to those in his own party that simply hate the ABC.


It is very clear that the ABC is one of our most important public institutions. It contributes to our national identity, reflects our cultural diversity and encourages our musical, dramatic and performing arts interests. When there's a need for trusted emergency information during natural disasters, the ABC is there. As I said, the latest polling shows that most voters oppose the funding cuts to the ABC in this budget. In that Australia Institute poll, 58 per cent of respondents disagreed with the following statement:


The ABC and SBS should get less funding and provide fewer online and streaming services, so that they don't undermine commercial media.


Labor has a strong record of fighting for the ABC. It's not just about fighting the cuts. The Leader of the Opposition made very clear in his budget reply statement, which was very well received, his and Labor's commitment to always stand up for the ABC and to fight these cuts. It's not just funding cuts that we're going to fight—and of course we are fighting them and we will continue to do that—it's about opposing the government bills already before us, aimed to undermine the ABC. We'll call out this faux 'competitive neutrality' inquiry for what it is: a vindictive attack on the ABC. We affirm the value of the ABC and we know that a grassroots movement of Australians know, love and continue to support the ABC.


Friends of the ABC are not only in Labor; they are members of the public. As I said, sometimes the items you think are the smallest end up having the most significance. I know that the more Australians find out about and come to understand what these cuts to the ABC will mean for Australians, the more people will be opposed. It is essential that the ABC endure as a trusted independent voice that adds to the diversity of news and provides an opportunity for Australian stories to be produced, seen and heard. We on this side of the House believe it's imperative for the ABC to be properly supported by government, not stretched too thinly, as it delivers on its mandate in the contemporary media environment.


It's very clear that you can't trust the Liberals—or One Nation, for that matter—with the ABC. The ABC cannot sustain another term of this destructive Liberal government and its vendetta against our trusted public broadcaster. Liberal cuts mean cuts to the ABC content and services that people trust and rely upon. Labor will continue to fight for the ABC, because we know what an important institution it is in our democratic processes. We have a strong record of supporting the ABC, and we will continue to do so.


In conclusion, we know that there is a cut of $83.7 million to the ABC in this budget. You only have to look at the Minister for Communications' thought processes here. He announces a cut to the ABC and then announces that he's going to undertake an efficiency review into what savings can be made at the ABC. At least when the current Prime Minister held the post of Minister for Communications he held a couple of inquiries into ABC efficiencies before he made the cuts. The current minister makes the cuts and then does the review afterwards. This budget pauses indexation of the ABC's operational funding, amounting to that $83.7 million cut.


This will have an impact on what the ABC can do. It's quite clear, as I said, from budget estimates yesterday and as it continues today, that the ABC will need to make those difficult choices. It cannot guarantee, for example, that services and jobs will not be cut in Tasmania. Following that, it is quite clear that it cannot guarantee where else its services will be cut. As they have said themselves, there is no fat left to cut—it's cutting into muscle. It's cutting into that muscle that is an important institution of our democracy.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:35):  I begin my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and related bills by associating myself with those very fine words from the member for Greenway. She is absolutely correct. Over the last five years, the Turnbull and Abbott governments have continued to eat away at our ABC—a national icon and an institution particularly needed in rural and regional Australia, including in my own region. I just make a genuine appeal to the government to restore the ABC's funding and to give the ABC every opportunity it has to thrive, as it has done for so long, and, in doing so, extending so many important broadcasting services to rural and regional Australia.


Yesterday I spoke on the government's tax changes, where I canvassed the economy pretty extensively. I won't go there again today in respect of these bills. Rather, I want to talk briefly about three things. I want to speak about Qantas's plans for a new pilot training school, a very important move by them; I want to speak about AGL's Liddell power plant in my electorate; and I want to talk a little about Australian agriculture and its future—in particular, the performance of its ministers and the impact that has had on the agriculture department.


It's well known that we have a massive shortage of pilots, not only here in Australia but internationally. In fact, many of our pilots are being poached by other countries, which exacerbates the problem here in Australia. To its credit, Qantas has taken the initiative of doing something about it and is massively expanding domestic training here in Australia. In doing so, it intends to establish at least one new flying school. I had the opportunity to speak with Qantas executives last night and they said that it might no longer be just one school, that it might be a number of schools. They made that comment mainly because there has emerged intense competition amongst regional towns for the opportunity to host such a school.


If it were to be one single school, we'd be talking about literally hundreds of trainees each year going through the school, wherever it might be situated. Obviously, that would be a significant economic boost for any township or local community. I'm told that up to 40 towns or more have expressed an interest across every state and territory, so it's an interesting venture for Qantas and it will be a challenge for Qantas to make its decision. As was pointed out to me last night, it will be one friend and potentially 39 upset communities—although, as I said, maybe in the end Qantas will do a number of smaller schools rather than one big school.


But today, as I did last night, I'm making a pitch for my own local community. My hometown, Cessnock, has a largely-unused aerodrome, as we traditionally called it. It's used by private pilots only—often by people visiting the vineyards, of course. But it is an aerodrome in good shape and which, in fact, still has some infrastructure around it. Whether it be fit for purpose for Qantas is another question, but I don't think they expect to walk into any town where the building for a physical school would be ready for them.


Cessnock is only two hours drive from Sydney on the M1, so I can think of no better location. It's close to Sydney but not too close for air traffic purposes. I'm told that the aircraft involved would only be light aircraft, so I don't see any real community opposition. I see it as only a win-win for Cessnock. Of course, Qantas will make its own decision on the merits of each of the propositions put to it, but I can't imagine somewhere better, at least in terms of location, than my home town of Cessnock. The aerodrome is nestled right in the heart of Hunter wine country. While I'm sure Qantas is keen not to be mixing the consumption of our world's finest wines with flying, in my experience, if you want to retain people on these courses, it's good to have them train somewhere not isolated but close to a capital city and somewhere that is just generally a wonderful place to spend a large part of their life for 15 months or so. Again, I think Cessnock fits that bill exactly. 


Given the intensity of the competition, I expect state governments will become involved. Qantas will enjoy, one would think, the outcomes of the energies of each of those state governments as they seek to ensure that the school, or schools, is situated in their own state. So, today I make an appeal to the Premier of New South Wales and her senior cabinet colleagues to have a look at the proposition of Cessnock as the host of that training school and to do all it can to give us the very best chance of securing that school. 


I think one of the things that Qantas will have in mind is the desire to avoid going somewhere where they're not particularly wanted for some reason, whether it be flight path issues et cetera or whether it be an already busy town that doesn't have the infrastructure to host the additional demand on that infrastructure. I should have said that Cessnock has the benefit of lots of accommodation capacity, because the tourism traffic is lumpy; it's mainly around weekends. So I think there's an opportunity to argue the case on accommodation. 


But there are a number of things that could be done in Cessnock that would enhance our bid for that school, and chief amongst them is access from the CBD onto the new Hunter Expressway. Labor funded and built the Hunter Expressway. It has been a great boon not only for Cessnock but for the region. There's also the unexpected or impossible-to-avoid other effects of a big project like that—for instance, the way it redirects other local traffic and the demand it puts on other local roads. Cessnock desperately needs the help of the state government, and I would like to think the Commonwealth could play a role, too. We need a link to the Hunter Expressway and some form of ring-road around Cessnock so that the people living in the growing suburbs aren't using the CBD for their exit out of town as they commute to work each morning and their arrival home each evening. So I make an appeal to Gladys Berejiklian to look at that proposal and to do everything she can, along with her cabinet colleagues, to secure that school for Cessnock, remembering that a very large corrective services or jail project has just been imposed on the local town, with no infrastructure support to accommodate the change and the demand that that massive jail expansion is creating. So there is every reason for Gladys Berejiklian to become more engaged in Cessnock, our aspirations and our challenges. 


I want to say something quickly about Alinta's bid for AGL. I view this as a stunt. I don't believe Alinta was ever serious about buying the Liddell Power Station. I think it was a stunt encouraged by our Prime Minister to try to skew the debate around energy in his favour. I believe Alinta might have had some hope of taking the power station but only on the expectation that they would be heavily subsidised by the Turnbull government. I believe that they believed it was a possibility, because the Prime Minister was so determined and so politically desperate to make that proposition work. 


I recently met with the mayor of Port Augusta, Sam Johnson, a very capable person, and he reminded me of Alinta's history in his own backyard. When Alinta closed down power stations without giving any real notice to the community and the council, it had devastating economic effects for Port Augusta. Thankfully his community—in part, I suspect, due to the good work of the council and the former Labor South Australian government—has regenerated itself, basically on the back of renewable energy technologies. But Alinta has a bad track record. Its Chinese-based partner, or the entity which would have controlled Alinta, I'm told is registered in the Cayman Islands, and that sends all the wrong signals to the Australian community generally. I think people know what that means.


I lament the fact that AGL's plans for investment in the upper Hunter have been frustrated and delayed. We should be getting on with the very good plan they have to ensure that the upper Hunter remains the powerhouse of New South Wales, and every day that the Prime Minister runs interference on it is a day delayed along our path to greater energy capacity as well as renewable forms of energy generation. This will create many jobs for many, many decades to come, not just for a couple of years such as with the proposed extension of Liddell. Of course coal-fired power generation will continue to play a role with the upgrade of the Bayswater Power Station, just across the road from Liddell. If AGL is allowed to get on with its plans, we will remain the powerhouse of New South Wales and we will continue to create jobs in power generation—in coal, in gas, in large-scale solar, in battery storage and pumped hydro. It's a very good plan, and the Prime Minister should get out of the way.


I'm genuinely concerned for our agriculture sector. There is a lot of talk about going to $100 billion in value by 2030. I think we can do much better than that. That is just normal trajectory. That would be a performance that would just match what we'd done for the last 10 or 20 years. We can do better, but we need real government guidance and real government leadership. We need an agriculture department that is capable, effective, efficient and properly resourced, and that's not what we have at the moment. In Senate estimates last night, we canvassed the department's 2017-18 corporate plan. Under the banner of 'Our capability', and under 'Policy' specifically, it says:


Consultation with stakeholders has indicated the department needs to strengthen its capability to develop agriculture and water resources policy, and to influence other policies affecting our portfolio industries and rural communities.


In its testimony, the secretary of the department did better than that, or put the point more bluntly: the department, under the watch of Barnaby Joyce, lost its policy capacity and so far has done no better under the new minister. Nothing could be more important than policy capacity.


In their corporate plan they go on about the need to identify 'policy skills gaps', 'shifting to a longer term focus' and 'improving our engagement with stakeholders to build trust'. This is the key point: there is no trust. When you force the relocation of an entity like the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, you don't build trust with stakeholders, industry or your staff. You do just the opposite. When you take roles and responsibilities off states so that you can create a pork-barrelling exercise in the name of the Regional Investment Corporation, you don't build trust. You do just the opposite. And if we're going to be successful in agriculture, if we're going to meet our aspirations, the role of the states will be absolutely crucial. What the member for New England has done in the past, as agriculture minister, does not build trust with the states. It does exactly the opposite. When you give the live sheep trade an unconditional pass to go on with its atrocities in animal welfare, you don't build trust. You build disaster. And when you blame the regulator, your own department, for the debacle that is the live sheep trade, you don't build trust. You undermine your departmental officials and leave them with the view that they're not valued and they'd be better off somewhere else.


There is the same result when you tell people, with spouses working in Canberra and with children in Canberra schools, that they don't have a job any longer if they're not prepared to move to Armidale in regional New South Wales. That's not how you build trust; that's the exact opposite of how you build trust. You must respect our departmental officials and the role extended to them. They must be able to trust that the minister will give proper guidance, respect what they do and provide them with the support they need to do their job effectively on behalf of the Australian community. In the last five years, just the opposite has been taking place. You know the old story: those who are best in the department, who know they can secure work, will move on and those who are not so sure will stay. I'm not saying those who have stayed are not good staffers. Some of them will be, of course, and they will have stayed out of loyalty to the government and the department. But it is reaching disaster point. The Prime Minister needs to take control, needs to talk to the new minister and needs to tell the new minister that he needs to turn the ship around.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2018-05-24,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (12:51):  The budget this year is just like every other Liberal budget: it fails the fairness test. The Liberal's budget looks after big business at the expense of people who work and struggle. The budget gives an extra $80 billion tax handout to big business, including $17 billion for big banks, at the same time as it hits schools and hospitals with savage cuts. It's not just like previous budgets; it still has the nasties from the nastiest of Liberal budgets, the 2014 Abbott budget. Remember the pride that the Abbott government had when they were cutting funding to schools and hospitals, how proud they were of that appalling 2014 budget, the plans to axe the energy supplement for pensioners and some of the most vulnerable people in our community, and increasing the pension age to 70? Those so-called zombie measures are still in this budget. The government aren't bragging about them this year, as they did last year and in 2014; but those measures are still there, quietly sitting there and waiting to strip money away from pensioners, from our capacity to educate our children and from the health system that supports us when we are sick.


The budget locks in the cutting of the energy supplement for pensioners, costing pensioners around $14 a fortnight. The budget will force Australians to work until they're 70 before they're eligible for pension. There are $17 billion in cuts to schools and $2.2 billion in cuts to universities. There are cuts to hospitals and cuts to Medicare by keeping the rebate freeze on specialists for one more year. It seems the government learnt nothing from 2014. They're cutting away at the living standards of pensioners, cutting funding to our basic services and giving billions of dollars to big companies, many of which are overseas, and $17 billion of that $80 billion going to the big banks.


It also goes further and has some new nasty cuts. There's another $270 million in new cuts to TAFE and apprentices on top of extraordinary cuts that they've already applied. There's more than another $80 million in new cuts to the ABC. There is a $1.5 billion cut to remote housing by ending the national partnership agreement. The old cuts are still there, and they've added some new cuts. These are cuts that they apply in order to help pay for a massive $80 billion tax cut to big companies. I have to be a little bit fair here, in that the Liberal government says they are also going to provide tax relief for low- and middle-income Australians with the first tranche on 1 July of this year. It is actually paid at the end of the financial year. It is around $10 a week for someone on $125,000. If you're on one of the lower incomes, it's maybe $4 or $5 a week. As always with this tricky government, it's all a bit strange. There's a second and third tranche. The first comes one comes in 1 July, which is between $4 and $10 a week for low- and middle-income earners.


The second and third tranches—they are in 2022 and 2024, so are two elections away; elect Malcolm Turnbull twice and you'll get them—target people on much higher incomes. So, we've got the first tranche for people on low- and middle-incomes. Then, in 2024, some six years away, there are tax cuts that are much larger for people on higher incomes. The interesting thing—and this is where their trickiness comes in—they've said that if Labor doesn't support the tax cuts in 2022 and 2024 now, then the people who need tax cuts now won't get them. So, Labor has to support all of it, including the big tax cuts in 2022 and 2024, two elections away, in order for people who really do need tax cuts to get them now. Quite frankly, I feel like saying, 'So there! Support our big cuts or you won't get your little ones.' This is the nature of the government that we have.


We have said quite clearly that if they split the bill, Labor is prepared to support that first tranche of tax cuts right now—we can pass it today. The people who would get those cuts are suffering from stagnating wages, the cost of living is rising, rents in my area of Parramatta are some of the highest in Sydney, and the median house price passed $1 million over a year ago. People are actually struggling and that tax cut for the low- and middle-income earners will actually make a difference. But, the government is holding it to ransom—either the opposition supports tax cuts for the wealthier end of town or people who need it most don't get it.


Remember when they did this with the NDIS? This is not the first time they've played this trick. They tried to hold people with disability hostage, claiming that the money wasn't in the budget and Labor had to agree to all sorts of cuts in order to guarantee funding. It didn't work, and suddenly the money was there after all, as it always was. It was a hostage attempt then to use people with disabilities to try to force the Labor Party to make other cuts to other sections of the community, and they're doing it again now.


The budget doesn't pass the fairness test, but it also doesn't pass the fiscal test. In fact, it doesn't pass the government's own fiscal test. The Liberal Party used to rail against a 'debt and deficit disaster' and now there's barely a peep from them. That's not surprising actually, because it's much, much, much worse now than it was when they came to government. On the back of the best global economic conditions in more than a decade, when the world is growing, when other economies are growing and doing well, we find that Australia is going almost the opposite way. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. If the Liberals in opposition thought that the Labor Party's debt and deficit coming out of a global financial crisis was a disaster, what is it when it's double that now under the best global conditions we've had for a decade? The world economy is growing and still the debt is double, the net debt is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. On their watch, gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time in history, and it will remain above half a trillion dollars every year for the next decade. Both types of debt are growing faster under this government than under the previous Labor government, which had a financial crisis to contend with. This year's deficit, 2017-18, is 6.5 times bigger than the Liberals predicted in their 'horror budget' of 2014.


The budget fails the fairness test, it fails the fiscal test and it also fails the future test, because if there's one thing you have to get right to build for the future it's the education of our children. When you look carefully at the figures—and they didn't mention this in their budget presentation on that Tuesday night—after the end of next year there is no funding for universal access to preschool—none. Labor introduced a commitment that children get 15 hours of preschool. There are 2,429 children in the Parramatta federal electorate who will be left in limbo when that funding comes to an end at the end of next year. There are 350,000 children across Australia who access preschool each year who depend on this funding. The government just flippantly says, 'Well, we fund it every year.' But it's not in the budget—it's not in the forward estimates. If you intend to fund it put it in the forward estimates. Have you left it out to make the surplus look bigger at some point in the future? Is that why you've left it out? If you're going to fund it, put it in the budget. Let me explain something to those of you who don't understand this. Businesses like childcare centres have to build assets. They have to renovate and update. They have all sorts of things they have to spend money on. They actually need certainty. Doing it year by year does not work for businesses that actually have to invest in capital in order to provide their services.


Nor does it work for families. Anyone who knows parents in this day and age knows how difficult it is to organise the care of children in future years. Parents know: they look around, they pick their childcare centre and they pick their preschool, finding the best ones and trying to get their children into those centres before they return to work. They move house sometimes for the best care for their children. They need certainty. It's not okay to remove funding for universal access to preschool after 2019. It's not okay. If you're going to fund it, put it in the budget and let parents and businesses do what they need to do to provide the services that our children need to do well in the future.


And also for schools—in Parramatta, schools will lose over $28 million: $18.3 million from public schools and $9.8 from Catholic schools. That's not okay. Then consider the massive amounts that this government has already ripped out of TAFE and apprenticeships, and they're now ripping out more. That pathway also disappears for people in my community, and it's incredibly important. We have construction all over the place in Parramatta, but if our young people can't learn a trade, because our TAFEs and our vocational education systems are being ripped apart by this government, one has to ask: what's the point? Our young people need those jobs and they need the training in order to get them.


We'll also lose $12 million from Westmead Hospital. And, as if that isn't bad enough, we'll lose $2.09 million from Cumberland Hospital. Anybody who has been in my electorate and who has visited the Cumberland Hospital knows that, of all of the hospitals, that's the one which cannot afford to lose that kind of money. These are dreadful cuts.


But there are three areas where the government claims they're actually going to put money in. I just want to deal with those. First of all, there's home care. They made a rather tricky promise to create 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over four years. What they didn't say is that they were taking the money out of residential aged care to pay for it. It wasn't new money for the 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over four years, it's a transfer of money. It's a hoax, particularly when you understand that there are 100,000 people on the waiting list now.


There are 150 electorates, so if it were averaged out that's 666 people in my electorate who'd be on the waiting list. I've got 12,000 people over the age of 70 and there's 666 on the waiting list. This 14,000 over four years is 23.3 places a year per electorate. We've got a waiting list of at least 666 and I've got 12,000 people over the age of 70, with more of those needing home care every year, and they're offering, by transferring money out of residential aged care, 23.3 places per electorate per year. Are they kidding? And that was worth announcing in the budget? That was actually important enough and impressive enough, in their eyes, to announce in the budget—really?


Obviously, they haven't spoken to any of the people who are desperate for in-home care. People are actually going to nursing homes because they can't get their home care packages. People are leaving the homes they have lived in all their lives, and leaving their partners, and going into nursing homes because this is a stuff-up. And they announced 23.3 places a year with great pride and great fanfare in the budget. Really!


Infrastructure: airport rail in Western Sydney was the great announcement. Yay! But there's no money to build it; it's another feasibility study. It's a hoax. We need airport rail and we need it to be there the day the airport opens. We need to plan it early enough for businesses to leverage the route and to make their plans as well. If you want to build a new city you've got to get the planning right and you've got to give other people time to do what they need to do to make the most of what you're doing. If you're putting in airport rail then get it done. Make a decision! How many feasibility studies? How many scoping studies? Put the money there to build it. Without money to build it, it's just paper. How long is this going to go on?


On the Great Barrier Reef: I know that a lot of people in my community really care about the health of our oceans. Many people write to me about marine parks and I know they care about this. They might have thought: 'Oh, $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef? Good!' It comes on top of figures that show Commonwealth funding to arrest declining water quality has been dropping by $11 million a year under this government, so they've been going backwards. But that $444 million is going to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, an organisation that had an $8 million budget and 10 staff last year. There wasn't even a tender process. This is an organisation chaired by John Schubert, the former chair of Esso. This is a private foundation that had 10 staff and an $8 million budget, and that's the organisation that is getting the great package for the Great Barrier Reef: $444 million without a tender process. 


I would love to have time to talk about the wonderful things that Labor has in its policy, but, quite frankly, at the moment, the single most important thing we can do is just point out to people the hoax in this budget. There are tax cuts for low-income earners, but only if the parliament agrees to major tax cuts for high-income earners six years down the track. There is supposedly new funding for home care packages that is actually taken from residential home care and isn't even a drop in this ocean of backlog that this country faces. There are cuts to preschools, cuts to schools, cuts to TAFEs, cuts to universities—cuts to every single service that our young people need to build good lives. This is a hoax, and the fact that this government got up there and spruiked it on the night as a great thing shows that either they're completely out of touch or it's a big con.
