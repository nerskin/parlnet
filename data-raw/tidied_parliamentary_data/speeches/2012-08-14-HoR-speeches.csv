Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 2 July 2012, of Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams during combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


We are here once again to acknowledge the sacrifice of an Australian and an Australian family in the war in Afghanistan. Sergeant Blaine Diddams joined the army at 18 years old. It was a job he held and loved for most of his adult life, a life that came to an end with an insurgent's bullet in Afghanistan's Chaura Valley last month. Sergeant Diddams was killed in the field on operations. This was a soldier's death—a death with honour, facing the enemy with his mates by his side.


Sergeant Diddams was farewelled at Karrakatta Cemetery. I attended the funeral; the Leader of the National Party was there representing the opposition; the Minister for Defence was there; and Ms Moylan was there as the local member. It was a day of profound sadness. Every death hurts, and pain was on display that day. Every day and every night that our soldiers continue to fight in Afghanistan, every day that we have troops overseas in harm's way, you hope the family will not be receiving some fateful news—but they do. That is the thankless reality of war. That is the price embraced when we as a government, as a parliament and as a nation send our forces abroad. We should be humbled by the fact that men like Blaine Diddams accept that risk freely. There are few things more remarkable in a democracy than a soldier willing to give his life for his country.


The loss of Blaine Diddams is the 33rd Australian death in Afghanistan. It is a grievous toll, a loss of life that has brought sadness to so many homes and to so many families. I extend my deepest sympathy to Blaine's widow, Toni-Ann; his daughter, Elle-Lou; his son, Henry; his parents, Peter and Cate; and his siblings, Christian, Luke Nikki and Sian.


I also wish to extend my sympathy to his other family, the Australian Defence Force, and particularly the Special Air Service Regiment. I know I speak for both sides of this House when I say to them and to all those other families who mourn a loss from Afghanistan that however bitter those losses are—and they must be very bitter indeed—they have not been in vain. The disruption and eradication of terrorism is one of the great security goals of our time. We are a world away from the dark days of 2001 when al-Qaeda and its allies acted with impunity, when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan with cruelty and fear. Today it is a very different picture. Al-Qaeda has been degraded and disrupted everywhere. Its founder, Osama Bin Laden, has been killed and its former sanctuary of Afghanistan is progressing steadily through the transition process to full security control by its own army and police. Blaine Diddams saw more of that process than most other Australians due to his seven deployments since November 2001. He saw the progress because he helped deliver the progress—and ultimately he gave his life for it. I say today to the House and to the Australian people that that sacrifice was not in vain. This 'soldier's soldier' goes to his rest loved by his family, missed by his mates and honoured by his nation. Blaine Diddams's service and sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:06):  I rise to support the eloquent words of the Prime Minister. Yes, Australia has lost another fine soldier. SAS Sergeant Blaine Diddams was truly a remarkable warrior. As the Prime Minister pointed out, he was on his seventh tour of duty to Afghanistan and had been previously deployed on four occasions to Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. He was 'a warrior's warrior'.


Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Toni-Ann; his children, Elle-Lou and Henry; and his parents, Peter and Cate. Some 33 Australians have now paid the highest possible price for our freedom. This country is truly honoured to have had such men in its service.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:07):  I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, both in expressing condolences to the family and friends and mates of Sergeant Blaine Diddams and also in expressing support for our mission in Afghanistan. Sergeant Diddams was killed during an engagement with insurgents in Afghanistan on 2 July this year. His death was our first fatality this year, our 33rd overall in Afghanistan. Again, his death was not only a terrible blow to an Australian family, but also a terrible blow to our nation.


Sergeant Diddams enlisted in the Army in 1990, and he joined the Special Air Services Regiment, the SAS, in 1995. He was a patrol commander at Special Operations Task Group and, as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, he was on his seventh tour to Afghanistan since 2001. Sergeant Diddams's death has been deeply felt by the SAS Regiment in Swanbourne. As members from Western Australia in particular would know, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Curtin, is the regiment's local member and she attended the funeral as the local member. The SAS is highly regarded in Swanbourne and in Western Australia. The shudder that went through the Swanbourne and Perth communities was not unexpected given the regard with which the SAS is held. It was an honour to attend Sergeant Diddams's funeral with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, representing the Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Curtin.


This is the 16th fatality in our Special Operations Task Group, which includes members of the SAS, the Commando Regiment at Holsworthy and the Incident Response Regiment. I had the opportunity of reflecting upon this earlier today in an unrelated meeting with General Gilmore, the commander of our Special Operations Task Group. As the Prime Minister has indicated, our objective in Afghanistan is to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for terrorists. As the transition process affirmed in Lisbon and in Chicago makes clear, we will not be in Afghanistan forever, but we do want to ensure that the Afghan National Security Forces are in a position to accept responsibility for security.


Sergeant Diddams was a devoted family man and a dedicated professional soldier. He was a dedicated member of the SAS and very, very highly regarded by the SAS family and the broader Army. Our condolences are with his wife, Toni-Ann; his children, Elle-Lou and Henry; his parents, Peter and Cate; his wider family; his friends; and his mates. Lest we forget.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (14:10):  I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence in honouring Sergeant Blaine Diddams, who was tragically killed in Afghanistan on 2 July 2012. I pass on my sincere condolences to his wife, Toni-Ann; his daughter, Elle-Lou; his son, Henry; his parents, Peter and Cate; and his siblings, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. To Blaine's dad, Peter, who was a young officer in Vietnam with 1046 Squadron in 1969, I say this: Peter, your son fought well. He was a leader of the elite, of the SAS. By any measure he was 'a soldier's soldier', and collectively we are incredibly proud of him, as we are of you. Blaine led tough men, he fought tough fights and he has paid a tough price.


Sergeant Diddams was a career soldier. He joined the Army at 18, and by his 24th birthday, when many are starting careers, he had passed the gruelling SAS selection course and had been posted to the west. By his 31st birthday he had already deployed to Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. By his last birthday, his 41st, he had deployed to Afghanistan seven times. His was truly a life lived serving our nation. Sergeant Diddams's actions on that fateful day, and over his exceptional career, would fill tomes; his love for his family, community and nation would fill volumes. We are lesser for his passing, we are stronger for his serving, and we are humbled by his deeds.


The SAS develops incredible soldiers, and it is because of their skills that the regiment has shouldered a disproportionate burden in Afghanistan. They have paid the price, as Rudyard Kipling remarked in his 1892 poem Tommy, for being 'uniforms that guard you while you sleep'. Perhaps few of us spare a thought for the price paid for us to sleep well. Kipling knew that the price was the loss of men like Blaine Diddams. So let us this day commit to write another verse in Kipling's famous poem, a verse that tells of community honour to match battlefield deeds, a verse of government care, compassion and support to match soldierly bravery, heroism and sacrifice. Let us write a verse through our policy work that would make Kipling proud.


Today we honour one of the toughest of the tough, 'a soldier's soldier' whose uniform guarded us while we slept. Today we honour Sergeant Blaine Diddams and we humbly thank him and his family for the burden they have borne for the freedom we enjoy. Lest we forget.



The SPEAKER:  As a mark of respect, I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:14):  In front of members of the Hughes family, we honour and acknowledge the death of Robert Hughes. I was contacted by the member for Wentworth shortly after the death of Robert Hughes and he asked that the parliament have an appropriate opportunity to honour his life's work. It was a particularly poignant request, coming from someone with a family connection through his wife, Lucy. So we gather today to honour a very full and very remarkable life.


Robert Hughes's writings are so familiar to Australians, so significant and so influential that the titles of his books have become part of our everyday language. That cannot be said for many authors but it is certainly very true of him. Few people who ever lived can have been so completely cosmopolitan and completely Australian as Robert Hughes. In The Fatal Shore he described our nation as surrounded by the 'wide, wrinkled, glimmering sheet of our imprisoning sea,' a marvellous and poignant sentiment from one of our greatest expatriate Australians, who lived so much of his life overseas.


In Homer we read that 'the death of heroes is marked by funeral games, contests of skill in honour of a great person and their loss'. We have seen the same sort of spirit in the eulogies offered by many in honour of Robert Hughes—from Peter Carey to Peter Craven. This great prose stylist has been honoured by many great sentences in the days since his death. His was a public life but, of course, his death is an occasion of private grief. On behalf of the Australian parliament and the people of Australia, we should today say this loudly and unambiguously: we honour a great Australian. Our thoughts are with his family and friends here and everywhere. We have certainly lost one of Australia's great sons.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:16):  I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister. Robert Hughes was that rare creature: a critic who turned out to be a greater artist than most of those whose work he assessed. In hospital 14 years ago, after his infamous car crash, he apparently asked for enough life to be granted to him to write a masterpiece; in fact, he already had. The Fatal Shorewas not a complete history of early Australia, but it was a brilliant and riveting account of our convict experience. Many fine words have been written about this remarkable man. I would simply seek to adopt words from the obituary in the Spectator, which said:


… we should thank a great Australian, who was an intellectual without being an academic and a fighter without being a bully, for the arguments he gave us against conformism from whatever quarter it came.


He did remarkable work. He will be much missed. On behalf of the coalition, we send our deepest sympathies to all who knew him and, in particular, to his family.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2012-08-14,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:18):  It is my honour to rise in support of this statement of condolence for Robert Hughes, who was born in Sydney in 1938 and died on 6 August in New York aged 74. Robert Hughes unravelled the mysteries of the art world and, in doing so, he reached out to new audiences, to people who themselves were not art experts. He was an internationally acclaimed critic but he was the great celebrator of the modernist adventure—a story he narrated frankly, sometimes brutally frankly, with a thick Australian accent.


He was also a great chronicler of the Australian underbelly in convict times, exposing a history we chose to forget. He was the finest travel writer since Ruskin. A man of letters, Hughes illuminated the arts with simplicity of language. He traversed the fine line between popular culture and making culture popular. He was part of the Sydney push, the wave of expats that left Australia during the height of the cultural cringe. But he was not a critic for the sake of criticism; he was a wordsmith and part of the vanguard that explained Australia to the world. He built bridges of ideas, knowledge and wit from our island home and he was, above all, a committed Australian.


Open any chapter of the international bestsellers The Shock of The Newand The Fatal Shore and you find the words of a universal storyteller who could translate the most complex of ideas. From the art of Australia to his tomes on Goya and Rome, he understood that art and culture are fundamental to defining history and to defining a nation. So he was a critic in the very best of terms. He was a critic who inspired reflection and advancement. Robert Hughes, therefore, hands over a mantle to the next generation of artists, writers and critics to themselves be the wave of the future, to be inspired and to do their best.


One of the most memorable quotes from Robert Hughes was published in Time magazine: 'The greater the artist, the greater the doubt. Perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.' And so whilst we mourn him we will stand forever in his light. My condolences go to his wife, Doris Downes; to his sister, Constance Crisp; to his brothers, Tom and Geoffrey; to his family; and to the member for Wentworth and his wife, Lucy, Robert Hughes's niece.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2012-08-14,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (14:21):  Can I thank, on behalf of Bob's family, the very generous words of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for the Arts. Bob would have been very chuffed to hear them, if a little bemused. He was the youngest of four. His brother Tom—who is with us today with his wife, Chrissie, and who is Lucy's father—the elder by 15 years, became in effect in loco parentis after Bob's father, Geoffrey, died when he was only 12.


Bob's father, Geoffrey, was a hero, and not just to his youngest son. He had been a fighter ace in the First World War and among his many victories had shot down no less than Lothar von Richthofen, the brother of the Red Baron himself.


The Hughes family were staunch and pious Catholics. Bob's great-grandfather, John, had made a fortune but, as Bob often lamented, had given away most of it in building churches and schools. John had established the Order of the Sacred Heart in Australia; his daughters had become nuns; and the Hughes family home, Kincoppal, had become a convent and a school. 'If John Hughes was not in heaven,' Bob often said, 'God didn't know the value of money.'


Bob's mother, Margaret Vidal, was the daughter of the Vicar of Barnsley. Geoffrey's squadron was based nearby and he wooed her with love letters dropped from his Bristol fighter biplane into her father's garden. There were Tom, born in 1923, Constance in 1924, Geoffrey in 1928, and then there was a long gap and then Robert in 1938. How sad it is for those three that Bob has gone. As Tom said to me last week, he was 'last to arrive and first to leave'.


Everything about Bob Hughes, for good or ill, was forged here in Australia. For all his years in New York, he never ceased to be, sound like and think like an Australian. His keen eye, his ability to see things and not just look at them, was honed by years of fishing for leatherjackets and bream on the jetty at Rose Bay, just as his intellect, his love of history and the arts, was inspired by the Jesuits at Riverview. Rambunctiously rebellious all his life, the objects of his often scathing criticism would have loved to have dismissed him as an uncouth Australian. But the depth of his scholarship and his erudition, matched with a remarkable eloquence, made that impossible. 


It would have been the easiest thing in the world for Robert to be seduced, you might even say corrupted, by the big money in the New York art scene—so many billionaire collectors, so many dealers, so many shamelessly commercial artists, each following in the footsteps of Andy Warhol, who was for art, Bob said, what Henry Ford was for automobiles: the first master of mass production.


Bob was always short of money. No matter what he earned he always found a way to spend it, or lose it in a divorce settlement, yet he did not compromise his judgment and fall into lockstep with what he saw as the conmen of the contemporary art industry, of whom two of his particular betes noire were Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.


His account of Australia's convict system, The Fatal Shore, is probably the best-read Australian history. It exposed, in Bob's compelling prose, the sadistic brutality bound up in our nation's founding—a system that not only dispossessed and all but destroyed the native people but then flogged and tortured the prisoners it had brought to the other end of the world. His description of Joseph Foveaux's reign of terror on Norfolk Island still makes our blood run cold—a commandant so cruel that he would stand downwind of a flogging so that the mist of blood and flesh shaken out of the lash would blow onto his face.


Bob used to say that America was founded as a religious experiment and our country was founded as a jail, but he went on to note that if you ever wanted proof that vice and crime are not genetic, on any view Australians were less violent, more law-abiding and more justly compassionate than Americans.


If more Australians have read Bob Hughes the historian, around the world he was without doubt the late 20th century's most influential art critic. His book and television series TheShock of the New expounded the art of the modern world, the machine world—the world of railways, steam engines and total war. Young, impossibly handsome, with a rich vocabulary and an even richer, rolling voice—now booming and declamatory, now quieter, drawing you into some delicious irony—Bob became the face and the authority on the art of our world, the modern world. A worthy successor to Kenneth Clark and his Civilisation, Bob was as filled with the energy and excitement of the modern age as Clark was with a wistful appreciation of ancient beauties receding from our view.


And then he did it again. In 1997 he produced American Visions—'a love letter to America', as he described it—an equally monumental book and television series which told the story of America's art from the naive portraits and landscapes of the first settlers to the magnificence of the gilded age and right up to his own time to the art of those he loved and admired, like Robert Rauschenberg, and those that he did not love at all, like Warhol.


Bob lamented the way today's contemporary art seems to have become disconnected from the politics and the terrifying dramas of our own day. Goya's etchings Desastres de la Guerra—or 'Disasters of War'—scream to us still about the horror of Napoleon's war in Spain as powerfully as Picasso's painting of Guernica does of the mindless barbarity of the German bombing of that Basque market town. But, he asked, where is the great art of 9-11? Was the unbelievable spectacle of the fall of the twin towers—a disaster he saw from his own window in Soho—so surreal, so unimaginable, it could not be painted? As wars rage across the Middle East, Damien Hirst suspends a dead shark in formaldehyde and lines thousands of pills up on mirrored shelves, while Jeff Koons casts Michael Jackson and his monkey like a pair of glossy plaster saints.


Bob's critics said he didn't get it—that he, the man who brought us The Shock of the New was now himself uncomfortable with the newest new. I rather think he did get it and, moreover, was dismayed that so few of us could see that we in fact were the ones being got.


As Simon Crean said, if confidence is the prize given to the mediocre, it was a prize that Bob could never win. Throughout his life, despite all his successes and triumphs and honours, he was besieged by self-doubt. He was 12 when his father died—old enough to know him as a saint and a hero, but not old enough to know that he was, like the rest of us, just a man. 'I am resigned,' Bob wrote, 'to the fact that I shall never placate his ghost, that I cannot be, in my siblings' view, anything like the man GEF Hughes was; that he constitutes a sort of one-man tribunal from whose now unenforceable verdicts there is no appeal.' As a longstanding observer of the Hughes family, I can say that, rather than that, his siblings and his family saw him as a latter-day Clancy. While they, the serried ranks of lawyers in Sydney, were chained to 'the round eternal of the cashbook and the journal', Bob wandered the plains of the world, leading a life they could only envy.


Bob was married three times—to Danne Emerson, to Victoria Whistler and to Doris Downes, his widow, who was with him when he died. His only son, Danton, tragically took his own life in 2002.


Bob's failing health and the consequences of his car accident all made his last decade the darkest—despite the best efforts of his family and friends. It began with that terrible car accident in Western Australia. A head-on collision saw him trapped in the wreck of a rental car, every bone on the right side of his body smashed, barely alive. It was an Aboriginal man from the Bidyadanga settlement nearby, Joe Fishhook, who found him and the local people came to 'sing him alive'. Certainly he stayed alive. He asked his fishing guide, Danny O'Sullivan, to shoot him if the petrol flooding onto the roadway caught alight. It did not come to that. Danny said to him, 'You're the toughest old bastard I know.' Robert, ever the realist, said, 'That's bullshit, Danny.' Danny reflected that he had gone a bit too far. 'Well,' he said, 'you're the toughest old art critic I know.'


There were some classic Bob Hughes moments when he was in hospital—on one occasion his intubated, bandaged, wired-up body, barely alive it seemed, a mass of tubes and wires and steel, waved its one free hand to a nurse and signalled that he wanted to write something. A piece of paper was brought. His scribblings were incomprehensible. After a while someone reckoned it was in Catalan, the language of Barcelona, the subject of one of his greatest books, and he had written with a characteristic courtesy: 'Would you please be so kind as to call me a taxi. I wish to go to a good hotel.'


Finally we sprang him out of hospital and brought him home to recuperate with us for several months. It was the year of the republican referendum and Bob, first in a wheelchair and then with his calipers, became a prominent advocate for the yes vote. I think he had a swing at you, Tony, in one of those debates.




Mr Abbott:
  He missed!




Mr TURNBULL:
  Yes, he missed! What a loss for the nation it would have been if he had connected! But passionate though Bob was in his republican advocacy, he was always full of fun. 'Welcome chardonnay-swilling elitists' he opened one speech to the republican faithful, and I remember him making a life-long devotee of Cecilia Hannon by addressing her as 'the flower of the republic, the boronia of liberty!'


When Bob is described, as he often is, as a man's man, the speaker, usually another man, is thinking of his love of fishing and shooting or even perhaps his fondness for food and wine in measures illiberal. But the women in his life, my wife and daughter especially, would agree that he was indeed a man's man with most masculine failings, including untidiness, waywardness and a remarkable ability, even by the high standards of his gender, to make a mess in the kitchen utterly out of proportion to the meal he had produced. He could dismember a mud crab with such enthusiasm that there were bits of shell and crab meat not only in his hair and eyebrows but on the ceiling as well. And, of course, he was always indulged. He was a generous host and a colourful guest. Lucy especially always gave Bob free rein. He could do no wrong as far as Lucy was concerned; he had a leave pass denied to all other men in her life.


Daisy and Alex, whom he loved as though they were his own, called him WU, for Wicked Uncle, and Bob revelled in that title. All his life, no matter how successful he was, he was always, in his mind's eye, the naughty younger brother. So today we note—and I thank the House for noting—the death of one of our greatest writers, one of the world's greatest critics. But as many of us have seen over the past week, his legacy of writing and of television is so vast and still so compelling, so in a sense the great man, the public man, the titan of arts and letters, will never leave us. And so I trust I have not trespassed on the courtesy of the House in allowing just for a while the private Bob to shoulder aside the public man because it is only that Bob who has left us.


Farewell, Uncle Bob, surely there will never be another WU.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:16):  Deputy Speaker, given that the legislation on this issue is the next item of business before the parliament, I would suggest that it might suit the House to have that legislation debated so that we can indeed get on with it, which the opposition have suggested is appropriate and which the government has suggested is appropriate. I would ask for the cooperation of the opposition to actually deal with the legislation rather than have a 90-minute debate that ends in nothing.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the House has put a proposition. The opposition has rejected it. The Leader of the Opposition has the call in respect of the MPI.

Mr ALBANESE

That the business of the day be called on.


So that we can discuss the legislation, as was advised to the opposition this morning.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the House is not assisting by the last comment. The question is that the business of the day be called on.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:27):  Before proceeding, I want to apologise to both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Tangney. I was probably a little hasty during question time. I was hoping probably not to be back in the position I am finding myself in again, but the constant interjections and gratuitous advice from both sides of the House have gone past their use-by date.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (21:30):  The National Food Plan green paper recently put out by Labor pays very little attention to irrigated agriculture and Australia's 40,000 irrigators. These farmers make the major contribution to food production and food security in the country. I was disappointed in the green paper and this omission in particular but not surprised. After all, this is the Gillard government, which has wilfully presided over the biggest transfer of water out of food and fibre production to a Commonwealth environmental water holder which has no science behind its water use intentions.


I am particularly concerned about the economic and community impacts of the Labor government's ongoing effort to buy back irrigation water in northern Victoria, but this is compounded by the maladministration and incompetence of the state-owned Goulburn-Murray Water authority as it tries to modernise the century-old irrigation system. The Victorian ombudsman has already reported his serious concerns about this maladministration and project delivery and has given all sorts of advice about what should be done. Unfortunately, that advice has not been followed through.


In 2002 the Goulburn-Murray Water authority managed over 1,640 gigalitres of high-security irrigation water on farms covering over 68,000 square kilometres and utilising over 6,300 kilometres of gravity-fed channels. More than 1,000 irrigators supported 52 great little towns and two cities. They generated the country's biggest regional transport sector, over 20 food factories and the biggest exports of milk products out of the country and supported icon brands like Heinz tomato sauce and Goulburn Valley preserved fruits. We had and still claim the very well deserved label of the food bowl of Australia.


However, by 2012, the over 1,600 gigalitres of high-security irrigation water producing food had been reduced by 32 per cent to some 1,000 gigalitres. Some of this loss was due to farmers forced to sell their water downstream during the drought, but much of it was in response to the government choosing to enter the irrigators' market, offering tenders, distorting the water prices but pleasing the banks, which could then retire some debt.


The results of Tony Burke's most recent water tenders have not yet been announced but again he targeted high-security water in the southern Murray-Darling.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  I have just made the point about members using the appropriate title.




Dr STONE:
  I beg your pardon: the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Dr STONE:
  His most recent water tenders have not yet been announced, but again he targeted high-security water in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, water that once grew the food to feed the nation. Some claim that the city- and union-centric Labor Party is simply ignorant of the impacts and consequences of this ruinous water and agricultural policy. Unfortunately, Craig Knowles, the Chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, has belled the cat. At a public meeting at Swan Hill on 22 February this year, he said: 'If we take 30 per cent of your water out of this community, it will have damaging, severe, devastating effects.' When the public demanded to know why Labor was continuing its 'devastating' water buyback policies, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority chair declared: 'We've said that to the government: ""Don't do it this way."" We don't support that; I want to be clear about that.' Apparently, Craig Knowles's pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Irrigation buybacks continue, even though we have now removed more than 30 per cent of water in what are 'damaging, severe, devastating' impacts. We are in that zone that Mr Knowles identified.


This is a serious problem. It is madness, I can hear you say. What about the 52 towns and two cities? What about the jobs? What about the farm families who want to rebuild their herds and orchards after the drought? What about the growing global food task? What about all those export earnings in jeopardy if you continue to diminish the water available for irrigation? Unfortunately, part of the deal for an extra $1 billion to fix up the irrigation system was another 214 gigalitres to be taken out of the Goulburn-Murray irrigation system. That is in return for the $1 billion for stage 2 upgrading to be funded by the federal government. This is a serious problem for us.


The solution lies in the Goulburn-Murray Water authority being transferred into an irrigator owned cooperative, where it can become efficient and smart. GMW is now $266 million in debt. It employs over 800 people. This is ridiculous, when you compare similar authorities that are irrigator cooperatives in New South Wales. They deliver similar amounts of water with only 122 staff compared to the over 850 employed by the state owned agency in Victoria. We have to do better. My 52 towns and two cities deserve better. They will work hard to rebuild the herds and grow back the orchards, but they cannot do it if their irrigation water is being taken away by irresponsible government policy and incompetent and inefficient water authorities.
