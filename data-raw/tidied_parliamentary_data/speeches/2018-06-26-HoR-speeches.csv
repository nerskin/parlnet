Ms KEARNEY 
(Batman) (13:29):  Australia is about to become a country whose so-called leaders are willing to cut a vital form of assistance that will force people into destitution and see children end up on the street. Minister Dutton and the Prime Minister are about to cut the Status Resolution Support Services, without any legislative redress. All they need is one stroke of their red pens. Many people currently in Australia waiting for a decision about their visa or protection status are about to lose a tiny amount of financial support, support that is less than Newstart, that allows them to eat, be clothed and be housed while they learn English or look for a job. It is not their fault that their protection status is in limbo. They are waiting on the Minister for Home Affairs's department to do its job. I have spoken to people who have been waiting nearly a decade for their cases to be finalised. It is not their fault that they cannot find work. Work is hard enough for anyone to find these days. The fault lies with this terrible government.


Let's be clear: the people who rely on SRSS are people who want to make a go of it here. They want to be productive members of our community, they want to be part of the Australian way of life and they want to be good neighbours, to put in and make good. They are exactly the same mould of people who have come through hard times, like so many of us, to find a place of safety. They are tough, brave and resilient, but the minister wants to break them, demonise them and kick them when they are down, and Australians are not like that. The Australians I know would always give someone a start in the hope they make the most of it.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:00):  Coal has a very important role in our energy mix, and I have no doubt it will for many, many years to come—possibly forever. Who can tell? The reality is that we have a technology-agnostic approach to energy policy. The subsidies are coming to an end. The renewable energy target will be complete in 2020. It will all be met. And what we have with the National Energy Guarantee is, for the first time, the combination of abilities to ensure that power is affordable, that it's reliable, that you have enough dispatchable power to keep the lights on, and, of course, that you meet the Paris commitments that we've entered into. 


We are already seeing our energy policies working. Already we've seen that the wholesale price of gas has halved in the last 18 months. There was a massive shortage of gas on the east coast of Australia created by the Labor Party, created by a federal Labor government and a Queensland state Labor government, which allowed gas to be exported from the east coast without any regard to the domestic consequences. We've resolved that with additional gas supply. We've already seen the wholesale cost of generation down 30 per cent over the last year. And, finally, we're now starting to see a reduction in the cost of energy for mums and dads, for small businesses, for families. Retail prices are starting to come down for both families and small business. So, we're turning the corner on energy costs—energy costs driven up by the combination of left-wing ideology and Labor incompetence. Ideology and idiocy are a very dangerous combination. That is what the Labor Party brings to economics. 


Today we've heard in the Leader of the Opposition's latest captain's call, his latest attack or riposte to the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler went out and said Labor should be friendly to business. So what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He says to thousands of family-owned small and medium businesses across the country: if he's elected Prime Minister, he's going to jack up their tax. That's what he wants to do. He is going to put at risk millions of Australians' jobs. Not only is he going to put up personal income tax; he's going to put up the tax of the businesses that employ more than half of the Australian private sector workforce. 



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business has the call.




Mr Burke:
  Mr Speaker, I'm just asking if there can be a passing reference that's relevant to the question about coal-fired power stations. 



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Minister for the Environment and Energy will cease interjecting. The Manager of Opposition Business makes a valid point of order. There can be a passing reference. I was about to pull the Prime Minister up. That was a very specific question, and it was very specific to coal-fired power stations.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (14:16):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, federal government departments are increasingly entering into single contracts with national suppliers at the expense of smaller Tasmanian companies, hoping to supply goods and services exclusively or principally in Tasmania. The result of this discriminatory contracting is often substandard and expensive goods and services because Tasmania is obviously a unique regional and rural market physically dislocated from the mainland. Quite simply, Tasmania is entirely unfamiliar to many national suppliers who don't even have a presence there. Prime Minister, will you review this matter so that Australians relying on federal government agencies located in Tasmania and Tasmanians relying on local federal government services start getting a better deal?

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:17):  I want to thank the honourable member for his question. In March 2017—so, last year—the government made significant changes to procurement rules to maximise competition and ensure that Australian businesses of all sizes are able to compete for government contracts on a level footing. We want to see more government work going to local businesses, and there are many reasons why that should be done—accountability being one of them, local jobs being another, the connectedness and engagement with the community being vitally important. 


Of course, taxpayer value for money is the primary test. Naturally, it is taxpayers' money, which must be spent as prudently as possible. The new Commonwealth Procurement Rules require that benefits to the Australian economy be considered when assessing the value-for-money of tenders for non-construction procurements above $4 million and construction procurements above $7½ million. And potential suppliers to government will continue to be treated equitably and cannot be discriminated against based on their size, location or ownership. More broadly, the government is backing business to create local jobs, including in Tasmania, where there are over 1,200 businesses with a turnover between $2 million and $50 million. One of them that I mentioned a moment ago, Stubbs Constructions in Burnie, is a good example of the type of Tasmanian business that the member for Denison should be fighting for as he stands up and condemns, as I trust he will, Labor's disgraceful announcement today that it is going to jack up the company tax on small and medium family-owned businesses, including in Tasmania. 


The honourable member knows that Tasmania is doing better than it has for many years. It has a good Liberal government, under Will Hodgman. It's benefiting from our pro-growth policies here in Canberra. We have provided real incentive to those Tasmanian businesses and others like them around the country. In this captain's call aimed at the member for Grayndler, a rebuke to the member for Grayndler, out of the indignation and vanity of the Leader of the Opposition, he's announced today, without any consultation, that those very Tasmanian businesses are going to have to pay more tax under a Labor government. The honourable member should be well aware of that and should be saying to his constituents what a shocking threat to their jobs the Labor Party represents.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (14:21):  I'm grateful for the question, because it does highlight the fact that on this side of the House we are so absolutely committed to and focused on making sure we open up more export opportunities for Australian businesses. We've done that in a number of ways. We have opened up important markets, export markets, that are helping to power Australia's economic growth and job creation—like China, Japan, Korea and the TPP-11, which the Leader of the Opposition said was a vanity project and a waste of time, and the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which the Leader of the Opposition called a dud deal. But we continue to open up these opportunities because we know they're good for Australia's businesses. We know the Export behaviour and business performance report showed that Australian export businesses pay their employees more and increase wages at a faster rate.



Ms Butler interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Griffith is warned.




Mr CIOBO:
  Many of these export businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises—businesses like King Island Kelp, which exports to the EU and other markets, a great example in north-west Tasmania of a business that's exporting to the world, helping to drive our economy and helping to make sure that it creates jobs.


The question was: are there alternatives? Well, there are alternative approaches, because what we saw today in the captain's call from the Leader of the Opposition was a decision to abandon those small to medium-sized enterprises, a decision to walk away, despite the fact that historically this Leader of the Opposition backed it. He actually said in 2011, 'Reducing the corporate tax rate will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages.'


Now we see a backflip on tax, but he's combining that backflip with a triple rollback—a rollback on small-business tax cuts, a rollback on personal income tax cuts and a rollback on border protection. They're going to take away income tax cuts from nine million Australians. They're going to hit 20,000 businesses, businesses that employ 1.5 million Australians, with a tax sledgehammer. But the fact is that not all are like that on the Labor side. There are one or two over there who have a different view. We have, of course, the member for Grayndler.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  'Who me—Albo?' 'Who me?' he says to The Sydney Morning Herald.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will refer to members by their correct titles.




Mr CIOBO:
  Certainly. We know that that member has a different view. You see, he sees himself as the new Messiah of the Australian Labor Party. He wants to lead them into the Promised Land. But, like in the Life of Brian, on that side you've got the opposition frantically ringing up the backbench, saying, 'He's not the Messiah; he's just a very naughty boy,' because we can see today they're opening the gulf between the two of them. He too claims he's not the Messiah, but, like that immortal line from Monty Python, 'Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.' The fact is: we now see the splits opening up on Labor. He's going hard left and he's trying to be more centrist. (Time expired)

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:18):  At the end of this week, families are going to be hit twice by this government and its cruel cuts. On Sunday, we are going to see the penalty rates that Australian workers rely on cut by this government. And then on Monday, the Turnbull government's new, unfair childcare system will come in—a system that will make it harder for so many children to get access to early education and childcare. We know that cutting workers' entitlements is an article of faith for the Liberal Party. It is an article of faith for the Liberal Party to cut from workers—to cut penalty rates and to cut their working conditions. They have never shied away from that. But I thought they cared about early education and access to early education for so many people. But of course it is clear now that their ideological crusade is not just about penalty rates and cutting and stripping workers' rights but also about denying children—often the most vulnerable children—access to early education.


When these new childcare changes which the minister has been talking up come in, we know from the government's own information that 279,000 families will be worse off as a result. The majority of these are low-income and vulnerable families. That is 279,000 families across this country. We know the plight of families is absolutely no concern for this government. The fate of this activity test that the government's introducing will come to fruition shortly. We know that the government is now requiring families to meet a set of complex activity and income tests in order to qualify for the childcare subsidy. This activity test is all about treating early education as glorified babysitting. It doesn't seem to understand that your child, no matter where you come from, should get access to early education. Children in families where parents aren't working will have their child care cut in half, to 12 hours of subsidy per week, and children in families earning over $65,000 where one parent is at home caring will have no access to subsidies. Where is the National Party when it comes to these families? The National Party says that it stands up for families and that it loves to support families. Well, the National Party has gone missing in action, and instead we are seeing families being denied access to early education, and we will have many families in electorates right around this country that will no longer get access.


The minister has often said that it's only Labor that has spoken out against these changes. Well, he is misleading the Australian public and the community, because, of course, there have been many people in the sector who have been vocal about the impact that this activity test will have. Australian Community Children's Services have said that the changes take Australia backwards in the early childhood policy arena. The Early Learning Association Australia said:


… we're very concerned about the notion of children being impacted because of effectively the actions or inactions of their parents.


The New South Wales Liberal government—the Liberal government—said:


… reducing the minimum hours of subsidised care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children is inconsistent with universal access commitments.


So there are all these groups—all those that work at the coalface—that understand that the government's new, unfair changes will have an impact on children.


But of course this Turnbull government is so arrogant and out of touch it does not believe that children in families that may not meet its cookie-cutter activity test deserve access to early education. The minister has stated that those parents at home should basically go and get a job and stop bludging off the taxpayer. In January he said it would be 'a waste of taxpayers' dollars' to 'support child care for people who are sitting at home'. There you have it: Australia's education minister saying that parents that may have complex family arrangements where one parent may need to stay at home are just couch potatoes and their children are less deserving of early education.


Let's just consider who these families might be. There are cases that have been widely canvassed in the media involving ill parents and carers such as Rebecca Tucker, who has breast cancer and cannot look for work because she is undergoing chemotherapy. She needs access to early education and child care, but what will she get under this government? Nothing. Olivia White is self-employed, has wide variation in the hours she works and will regularly fail the fortnightly activity test. This government says that she's not doing enough. They say she's just a couch potato. Of course, there's the mother—or father—at home with two or three children who is also caring for elderly parents who can no longer live independently. She's just a bludger, according to this government. She doesn't deserve early education for her young children. So it is inappropriate and absolutely disgraceful that this government is cutting support for so many children.


We on this side of the House know the importance of quality early education. It leads to a range of better educational, social and health outcomes for children later in life. It literally lays down the solid foundations for life. But this government would rather give $80 billion away in corporate tax cuts than invest in early education. Talk about priorities! 


If it were just utter ideology, I could probably understand it, because we know that this government does not care about working people or about families. We've seen in this area of childcare changes complete incompetence by the minister as well. Currently, with only a few days to go, 235,000 families have not been able to register on the new system—20 per cent of families are not registered—and from 2 July they are going to miss out on support. In response to these families not registering, what has the minister had to say? The minister said: 'It is their fault. Why are families being so lazy? They just need to get onto myGov and register.' That just demonstrates that the minister is completely out of touch. What else has happened is that a number of providers have not been able to register. Once again the minister's response is just to say that they are lazy. This minister doesn't take any responsibility. These are his childcare changes and this is his program. He needs to stop blaming families and centres.


The government's new system was meant to put downward pressure. 'The hourly fee cap will put downward pressure on prices'—that is what the minister said. This is his usual spin and it is not backed up by facts. We are now hearing that fees are going up by 10 per cent. Under this government, families are already seeing increases of more than $2,000. What has the minister had to say? He said, 'I encourage any families being ripped off to consider what alternatives may be available to them.' There is proof again of an out-of-touch minister who has no idea about moving your child from one childcare centre to another. Children develop relationships with their carers and develop connections with the other children, and often there are no vacancies available. Plucking children out of one centre and putting them in another centre and letting the free market rip is just not the answer when it comes to early education. Unfortunately, that is the attitude of the minister.


Finally, we heard the minister representing the minister in the House talk about compliance and quality. The budget just handed down by the government ripped out money when it comes to compliance and quality. They took $20 million out of ensuring and enforcing quality in the sector. So, while they want to give $17 billion to the big banks, they take $20 million out that was supporting states and territories actually improving quality. This means that there will be fewer checks on centres, less compliance and less security and confidence for families. 


It's not good for this minister to take a hands-off approach when it comes to early education. We want to see a minister committed to early education, committed to quality and committed to access. Unfortunately, this minister has proven he is not up to the job. Labor are up to the job. We will deliver quality early education for families across this country. We won't blame families and centres when it comes to his failed system.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Children and Families) (15:29):  Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. There is $2.5 billion extra for our new childcare subsidy system. That's on top of the $1.2 billion safety net that we have in the system. Some of the biggest beneficiaries are in electorates that those on the other side represent. In fact, Lalor is the electorate that will benefit the most out of this—with 13,303 new beneficiaries of this system. Over one million families will benefit as a result of this government's reforms to the childcare system. 


We saw under the previous Labor government a massive spike in costs. That amounted to a 53 per cent cost increase. Child care is not affordable when you have increases of that magnitude. We will provide the greatest subsidy. We will remove the cap for those on low and middle incomes. Unless you're earning over $187,000, there will be no cap on the number of hours you can claim as long as you are meeting the activity test. The subsidy will be paid directly to the childcare centre, but there's an hourly rate cap to prevent that exponential increase in the cost of child care. For those with an income of under $67,000 per year the subsidy will go up from 72 per cent to 85 per cent. They're the people that need the most support. A family on a $60,000-a-year income whose childcare centre charges $100 a day will be up for only $15 a day. As the income increases up to $351,000, it drops down from that 85 per cent to 50 per cent, 20 per cent and so on, then to zero. That's because we feel that people earning $351,000 per year should be able to look after themselves. The biggest subsidy goes to those most in need.


The member for Kingston has mentioned in public that she will not upset the new system but will observe it for a year, and I'm very pleased to let the member for Kingston know that in her electorate 7,160 more people will benefit from the system. The beneficiaries are far greater than those who have adequate income to put their children in child care. In my electorate 4,300 will benefit. In nearby Paterson 6,900 will benefit. North of me in the seat of Cowper 5,800 will benefit. In Braddon 3,000 will benefit.


The other criticism put up is that vulnerable people and children will suffer. We have an additional childcare subsidy that provides extra subsidies to families with children at risk of serious neglect or abuse, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, grandparent carers and people moving from income support into work. In fact children at risk of serious abuse will qualify for up to 50 hours of child care a week at 100 per cent of the subsidy rate and up to 120 per cent of the hourly rate cap. Families moving from income support will get a subsidy of 95 per cent of their childcare fees. That is encouraging them into work. The activity test is quite reasonable: volunteering, working or studying will easily be reasonable activity to qualify for the subsidies.


The other criticism the member for Kingston brought up was that patients with health conditions will be left short. In the childcare safety net are conditions and additional childcare subsidies for people who are undergoing cancer treatment and have medical conditions or hospitalisations, and they're excused from the activity test. The member for Kingston needs to read the policy. At the moment they don't even have a policy. We just have a failed policy that we're trying to correct, and 950,000 people have registered for it. I encourage any of those that haven't to go onto the myGov website and enter their details. A moderate, middle-income family working full-time, earning $80,000 a year, with two children under the age of six in long day care will be $8,000 better off a year. For those earning $150,000 a year the benefit won't be as great, but they'll be $1,000 better off. We also have our commitment to universal access to early learning of a quality nature in the first year before school. That's $870 million over two years. It goes on and on.


As I said before: 'hypocrisy, thy name is Labor' applies to the comments about changes to weekend penalty rates. The decisions were made by the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Fair Work Commission, which is a creature of the Labor Party. They dreamt up the scheme. They appointed all the current officers in there. Hypocrisy—you only have to look at how so many workers were so short-changed by changes the Leader of the Opposition brought in when he was working at the AWU. At McDonald's, young people lost all their weekend penalty rates. If you had worked at McDonald's for three years you would now be $15,000 worse off. At Big W, where penalty rates were cut to zero, they'd be $13,400 worse off. As I said: hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.


There are plenty of small businesses that are suffering because they have to pay uncompetitive penalty rates. There was a modest change in hospitality, retail and pharmacy that was gradually brought in. There are still very generous penalty rates on weekends, but they are just more affordable for small businesses. Some of the small businesses in my electorate actually can't operate at the moment. The penalty rates were so deleterious to these small businesses that the big unionised employers had a strategic advantage. They can't operate because the unions organised a worse deal for them. That's where the Fair Work Ombudsman came to this decision. It wasn't a government decision. And it was the Labor Party that created the Fair Work Commission and the ombudsman. It's hypocrisy, again. We are committed to supporting the independent umpire.


We have such a good childcare system coming in. Almost one million people will be so much better off. The rate is dependent on how much work is being done—the more you work, the more you can claim. Those on low incomes are getting the greatest support. Those with incomes under $67,000 are getting the greatest subsidy. There is a childcare safety net so that those who can't work because they are ill or because they are grandparents who are no longer in the workforce are excused from the activity test. Those who are coming off income support and getting back into the workforce get a larger subsidy.


Looking at these figures, the biggest beneficiaries are the electorates that are represented by members on the other side. My good friend the member for McEwen is going to have 10,200 families that are better off. The members for La Trobe and Lalor will get big increases, and I've mentioned Kingston. Child care became unaffordable with this rebate cap and increasing the subsidy from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, which they brought in. The Productivity Commission said they were the architects of the increase, because there was no capping of the hourly rate. It just gave a free kick. There was criticism that quality assurance wasn't happening. In the last year there have been 4,500 visits to childcare centres in the compliance— (Time expired)

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (15:38):  There's no doubt about this government. It always wants its pound of flesh, but it takes it from the poorest. I rise today to speak about the priorities of this government and its unfair cuts to child care and its unfair cuts to penalty rates—because it's all about fairness. I have strong views on both these topics, but I'll start first with the cuts to penalty rates. It's simply incomprehensible that the government would even fathom allowing the penalty rates of the hardest working and most disadvantaged Australians to be ripped away. In my electorate of Macarthur, over 8,000 residents work in retail and an additional 5,000 work in the accommodation and food services industries. Collectively, this equates to about 20 per cent of workers from my community who are facing real attacks on their standard of living by Malcolm Turnbull and his government. I will not allow the government to continue on this trajectory without a fight.


This is a fight that affects the poorest in my community. It affects people who are trying and struggling to make ends meet in an environment where housing, power prices and transport are increasingly unaffordable. And yet this government is content to allow money to be ripped away from those most disadvantaged. Over Australia, almost five million hardworking, everyday people rely on penalty rates to help make ends meet. On a backbencher politician's salary of over $200,000, some of those opposite might not understand what that means. But, for many in my community, getting fairly paid with penalty rates can mean the difference between being able to put a roof over their heads and putting food on the table. Maybe those opposite should understand that. These are cuts to the most hardworking, disadvantaged, shift-working people in my community. Those opposite may not understand that, but this is a real cut to people's standard of living at a time when they're giving thousands of dollars in tax cuts to those earning large amounts of money. It is patently unfair.


Workers like police officers, firefighters, paramedics, nurses, retail workers and hospitality workers and workers in manufacturing, tourism and many other sectors all rely on penalty rates to make ends meet. Yet, under the leadership of this Prime Minister, penalty rates for hospitality, fast-food industries, retail and pharmacy will be cut again on Sunday, 1 July. I see that as a tragedy. I see it as an attack on the most disadvantaged workers in my community, often workers with young families, who are trying to make ends meet, trying to put a roof over their heads and food on the table. It's dreadful. I wonder if those opposite have ever had to rely on penalty rates.




Mr Laundy:
  Yes, 100 per cent.




Dr FREELANDER:
  You're kidding me—you had to rely on penalty rates?




Mr Laundy:
  It's called my university career. I relied on them for years.

  In addition to the government's agenda of cuts to marine parks, changes to the HELP scheme and axing of the pensioners' energy supplement, it is now cutting child care, again, for the most disadvantaged. As I've mentioned before, this is an issue of fairness; it's an issue that the government should be facing, but it can't. We know that the government's childcare changes will leave one in four families worse off, including the most disadvantaged. I could talk for hours about this, as a paediatrician, and how important it is that the most disadvantaged children in our community not miss out because of this government's policies. These are the consequences of the government's inability to look at fairness in our community, and it's a shame. (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (15:43):  If those on the opposition benches, including the member for Macarthur, want to support the vulnerable in our community, if they want to support the hard workers, then they will support the coalition policies, because the coalition policies are spending more money on childcare reform, more money on workers and more money on families in our country. Unlike Labor's shambolic childcare policy, which on their watch saw fees absolutely skyrocket, the coalition government is putting $2.5 billion back into the sector. The opposition didn't do that. We are delivering a fundamentally fair package that provides the highest rate of subsidy to those on the lowest income levels, with more hours of subsidy for those who work the most. That is what is called fundamentally fair. The coalition is increasing the base subsidy from around 72 per cent to 85 per cent for more than 370,000 families earning around $66,000 or less a year. Low- and middle-income families earning up to around $186,000 will no longer be limited by an annual cap on the amount of child care they can access. That's more than 85 per cent of families using child care. Families earning more than $186,000 would also benefit from an increased annual rebate cap of $10,190. Introducing hourly rate caps recommended by the Productivity Commission will help put downward pressure on fee increases—



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mrs PRENTICE:
  well, support our policies if you want to fix it—by setting a limit on what hourly fee the government will subsidise based on an efficient price of what it costs to deliver child care. The $1.2 billion childcare safety net—




Ms Rishworth:
  They went up 10 per cent this week. It's not working.




Mrs PRENTICE:
  It doesn't start until 1 July. Support this policy if you want to support hardworking men and women in Australia—hardworking families, the vulnerable in our community.


The coalition government is increasing Australia's investment in early childhood education; it's not cutting it—once again another scaremongering campaign from those on the other side, probably suited to the campaigns for the by-elections, where they're not going down too well, because the coalition government is delivering an extra $2.5 billion over the next four years, which will help more than one million Australian families. Low- and middle-income families will be the greatest beneficiaries from this package.


The opposition leader has always been big on promises and short on delivering. Instead of attempting to govern in the interests of their union puppetmasters, the opposition should be considering how they should serve their constituencies and the families in their constituencies. On penalty rates, it was the Leader of the Opposition who, as the employment minister, established the Fair Work Commission. It was the Leader of the Opposition who, as the employment minister, appointed a former trade union leader as the Commissioner of the Fair Work Commission. It was the Leader of the Opposition who instigated the four-yearly review of penalty rates by the Fair Work Commission, and it was the Leader of the Opposition who said he would accept the decision of the Fair Work Commission. He publicly went out there and said the opposition would accept the decision of the Fair Work Commission. But then, after 39 days of hearings, 143 witnesses and more than 6,000 submissions, the Fair Work Commission handed down, in February last year, a 500-page decision and the Leader of the Opposition doesn't like the decision. He doesn't like the decision made by the body he set up. He appointed the commission, and he should accept the decision. He doesn't like it, so he's spat his dummy. The Leader of the Opposition and the opposition—

The opposition think it's fair that the local mum-and-dad hot food shop should pay $8 an hour more on Sundays for their workers than McDonald's. The opposition think it's fair that the local hardware shop should pay more for their workers than Bunnings, because the opposition don't support hardworking Australians. The coalition government are delivering record economic growth and record jobs. Unlike the opposition, we are the friends of the families and workers of Australia.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (15:49):  This is an arrogant and out-of-touch government with all the wrong priorities, and the people of regional and rural Australia have been abandoned by this government and, in particular, by the National Party. As I often say, National Party choices hurt, and their choices—their bad choices—hurt the people in the country time and time again. Whether it's the National Party's cuts to health care, their cuts to education, their cuts to penalty rates, their cuts to pensions or their cuts to child care, the fact is National Party MPs have time and time again come into this House and voted against the interests of regional Australia. That is a fact. The reality is that times are always tougher when the National Party's in government, especially with many of the changes coming into place on 1 July—firstly, the cuts to penalty rates. Nationally, up to 4.5 million workers rely on penalty rates: police officers, firefighters, paramedics, nurses and workers in health care, aged care, retail, hospitality, tourism and many other sectors.


Penalty rates for hospitality, fast-food, retail and pharmacy awards will be cut again this Sunday, 1 July. In regional areas like my electorate, thousands are employed in these industries. The penalty rate cuts will hurt local workers and severely cut their take-home pay but will also be devastating for our local economy and local businesses as less money will be spent. Those opposite don't understand this issue. Cutting penalty rates hurts workers and impacts upon regional economies and local businesses; that is a fact. We believe it's fundamentally unfair to cut the wages of some of Australia's lowest paid workers—people who rely on penalty rates to pay the bills, put food on the table and raise their children. We need to protect those in our community who will be badly affected when these penalty rates are cut.


This government won't do anything to help them, and it shows how wrong its priorities are and how harsh its choices are. The penalty rate cuts will be devastating throughout the nation, but they will hit really hard in regional and rural areas. We know the Prime Minister and his government continue to actively campaign for those cuts to penalty rates and refuse to protect workers who rely on those penalty rates. I call on the government to do the right thing and support our bill to protect penalty rates. Just this week the Leader of the Opposition introduced a bill to protect those penalty rates that will be cut this July, next July and the July after that. Our bill would stop those cuts and ensure penalty rates would never be cut again. Stopping those cuts to penalty rates could happen if the Prime Minister and his Liberal-National government joined us to bring this bill on for a vote and voted for it.


This government has had eight opportunities in the parliament to protect penalty rates, and it voted against protecting them eight times. That's eight specific times that National Party members have voted against the interests of people in regional and rural Australia—a shameful record! This is an attack on low-paid workers, who will have those penalty rates cut again this weekend on 1 July. This time the cuts will be even deeper for them. Penalty rates are not a luxury; they put food on the table and pay the bills. It's clear that the only way to protect penalty rates is to elect a Shorten Labor government. That's something that people in regional areas know: only Labor will stand up for them. In the regions and rural parts of Australia The Nationals will be held responsible for their continued cuts to penalty rates and their continued refusal to support workers.


As well as the harsh cuts to penalty rates, the government's unfair changes to child care begin next week. We already know the new system will leave one in four families worse off: over 270,000 families. It's an unfair package from an out-of-touch and arrogant government. The Liberal-National childcare package will hurt those families who can least afford it and reduce access to early education for those kids who need it most. Childcare fees under this government have gone up over $2,000 on average. It's time this out-of-touch and arrogant government understands that families are doing it tough and need assistance. It's not being provided by this government at all.


This government and the National Party have totally abandoned regional and rural Australia. As I say constantly in this House, National Party choices hurt. People in the regions know how harsh the decisions that the National Party make are. In contrast to all of those harsh choices by the National Party, Labor has always fought for the country and for the regions. We have always delivered for regional Australia by investing in health care and schools, building roads and infrastructure, and addressing inequality. Very importantly, Labor supports a fairer tax system, unlike The Nationals, who, shamefully, support tax cuts for multinationals and big business. What a clear contrast and a clear difference! Labor stands up for the country. That's the reality. That's what we do. Only Labor deliver again and again for the people of regional and rural Australia, because we have their backs. We have the backs of people in country Australia, and we will always support them and always stand with them, unlike this government, which prioritises multimillionaires and big business over country people.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (15:54):  Talk about leading with your chin! The shadow minister over there really has led with her chin on this MPI. The government's 'unfair cuts'—I suppose the opposition are talking about the tax cuts, are they? Is that what they're talking about, the tax cuts? I don't know. This government has overseen some of the most significant income tax reductions in Australian political history. Ninety-four per cent of Australian workers will be paying 32.5 cents in the dollar. Australians will be getting to keep more of their hard-earned money. This is what it's all about. This is what good government is all about. It's ensuring that Australians get to keep more of their hard-earned money and spend it the way they choose. They can spend it on their family, or if they have their own business they can reinvest it into the business. But those on that side of the House would have no idea what I'm talking about when I talk about reinvesting in their own businesses, because they're all union hacks. That is an absolute fact.


The tax cuts that we passed through the Senate just last week were absolutely the best tax reductions in Australian political history. We're trying to do the same thing with corporate tax. On this side of the House we believe that Australians should pay the least amount of tax that is necessary. Those on the other side believe that paying tax is a privilege. If that's a privilege—I guess it just goes to the mind set and to the difference between us and them.


Let's look at the Fair Work Commission. The Fair Work Commission is an independent body. Some of the members opposite are lawyers. Perhaps they may have been decent criminal lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but they seem not to understand the concept that the Fair Work Commission has made this decision. They talk about the government making this decision in relation to Sunday penalty rates but they know—at least the lawyers over there should know—that it wasn't the government's decision. It was in fact the independent umpire' decision. It's worth restating the transcript of an interview with Neil Mitchell and the Leader of the Opposition in April 2016:


MITCHELL: … Will you accept their findings given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister?


SHORTEN: Yes.


MITCHELL: You'll accept them?


SHORTEN: Yes.


MITCHELL: Even if they reduce Sunday Penalty rates?


SHORTEN: Well, I said I'd accept the independent tribunal …


Yet, here he is today, surrounded by his Labor colleagues, refusing to accept the decision of the independent umpire. You can't have it both ways. The Fair Work Commission is independent. The Fair Work Commission made a 500-page decision based on almost 6,000 submissions, 143 witnesses and 39 days of hearings. It is the Fair Work Commission that you established and stacked with your own commissioners. But, because they made a decision you're not happy with, you constantly say that this is not fair, that it is not right. It's your people who made that decision, so you don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to complaining about the Fair Work Commission. Before the penalty rate decision for permanent staff on Sundays, a bed and breakfast had to pay $10 an hour more than a five-star hotel. How can you call that fair? (Time expired)

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (15:59):  We all know that this Sunday 700,000 workers in hospitality, fast food, retail and pharmacy industries will suffer another cut to their penalty rates. For those workers and the 4½ million working Australians across other industries like emergency services—our first responders—nursing, manufacturing and tourism, penalty rates are essential to making ends meet. We know that, and many of us in this place have worked in some of those industries—



Mr Wallace interjecting—




Mr KHALIL:
  despite what the member for Fisher says. We know how hard these people work and we know how low some of their wages are—




Mr Wallace:
  Are they being cut under this?




Mr KHALIL:
  But of course the member for Fisher and his leader, the Prime Minister, have probably never had to rely on penalty rates, have you, to get by? Because in all the Prime Minister's arrogance—



Mr Wallace interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Fisher.




Mr KHALIL:
  he just doesn't understand what it's like to need penalty rates. None of them over that side can comprehend that the estimated average cut of $77 that these people will suffer can be the difference between putting food on the table, buying shoes for the kids or keeping the lights on. He's never had to face that difficult question, has he?


When I was younger, like many of us on this side probably, I worked some of these jobs to get by as well. I worked as a cleaner. I worked night shifts in a service station. I worked in retail and hospitality and washed dishes in restaurants. And, yes, I also went to university, because those aspirational Labor policies gave me access to a university education. Those are the policies of Labor governments. I've spoken before in this House about how I grew up in a housing commission. It was Labor policies and those visionary Labor governments that gave me and my family access to affordable housing, universal health care and education. I will forever be grateful for those Labor policies giving me, and millions of other Australians like me, the best possible start in life, despite our postcode. These are the things that Labor governments do.


That's why we on this side of the House will never think it's fair to inflict a pay cut on some of the lowest-paid workers in this country, people who rely on that little bit of extra money to pay the bills and raise their children. And that's why Labor has introduced legislation in this place to protect the penalty rates. But the coalition is content to do nothing to protect these people. In fact, they voted against Labor's attempts to protect penalty rates—eight times in total. They back the big end of town; we know that. And they do it at the expense of the ordinary working and middle-class Australians who rely on penalty rates to get by. For a coalition government to treat a tax handout to millionaires and multinational companies as more important than protecting the most vulnerable in our communities is so bizarre and obscene that I can't understand it. I assume some on the other side are intelligent enough to understand how bizarre that is.


Let's not forget that this government's unfair changes to childcare are also set to begin on 2 July, and we've heard about how this unfair package of cuts will hurt those families who can least afford it. It reduces access to early education for those kids who need it most. One in four families will be worse off because of the government's proposed changes to child care. That's some 279,000 families nationwide, and, in my electorate of Wills, that's 2,225 families that will be negatively impacted. The Turnbull government's unfair childcare package will hurt those families whose can least afford it because it reduces access to early education for those kids who need it most.


While its attack on early childhood education is bad enough, education as a whole is within the sights of the government. Education, let's remember, is the key to opportunity. It was bequeathed to us, regardless of our postcode or our ethnicity, by successive Labor governments, who were committed to the idea of equality of opportunity and access to education. But that's now under siege by this government. This government has cut $2.8 billion from TAFE and about $22 billion from primary and secondary education. In stark contrast, under the previous Labor government, 1,600 people in my electorate of Wills were able to go to university because of the Rudd-Gillard government's policies, and it's projected that, under a future Labor government, under our policies, an additional 1,500 people in my electorate will receive the opportunity of a university education. That's aspiration. That's giving people the opportunity to achieve and progress based on their merit.


But the Liberals want to make Australian students pay $100,000 a degree, and the only reason $100,000 degrees aren't a reality is that Labor and the crossbenchers have blocked the Liberals' plan in the Senate. Australian students now make up the sixth-highest contribution to the cost of university education compared to other economies. (Time expired)

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:04):  With this MPI, you have to hand it to Labor—you've got to give them a bit of credit. They're always misleading, always deceiving, always denying the truth. We just had the member for Wills over there tell us that we've been cutting money out of education—out of secondary and primary school. What is it about record spending that you do not understand? Record spending, by the very name, indicates to us that it is higher than the level that existed before. The Labor Party demonstrate complete amnesia when it comes to their statements in the past on so many issues. Most importantly, there is no baseless scare campaign, however unbelievable or however outrageous, that they will not promote. Apart from having no memory, they seem to have no shame either. I suspect, after their latest commitment to unwind the already legislated tax cuts to small and medium business, they have no brains either.


Labor are conducting a consistent attack on business. The leader, the member for Maribyrnong, said no less in an address to the BCA. They now attack the independent umpire's decision on penalty rates. The Labor Party have a penchant for forgetfulness. They forget Mr Shorten's record. The PM says the member for Maribyrnong is the champion of stripping away penalty rates. Well, he's right. He made a deal with Cleanevent to abolish 50 per cent penalty rates with no compensation for workers, but he hoovered up a secret kickback for the union, which suggests that he is the champion. The shoppies' union have engineered deals with young workers at McDonald's which have made them $5,000 a year worse off than the award. There were special deals for KFC, Woolworths, Big W and Bunnings, all delivering substantially less than the award, while small, struggling businesses have to pay higher rates. For the workers, with friends like those, they sure don't need enemies.


What is plain is that as a result of the unions doing these secret deals with big business for undisclosed reasons, small businesses have been handed a wages sheet which runs at a significant premium to competitors because they lack the ability to do these secret, under-the-table deals. I say to the workers: have a look at what that mob does to you. Have a look at what the Labor Party are doing to you. Have a look at what they want to do. They want to destroy your jobs, take away your personal tax cuts and raid your retirement savings.


The Fair Work Commission was established under Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It was designed by the ALP to protect Australian workers' rights so that Australian workers would never again be exploited, we were told. The member for Maribyrnong personally appointed the commission members that made the decision to reduce the penalty rates. We assume that he appointed people he trusted. We would assume that he appointed people that he considered to be intelligent and trustworthy. He also put in a mechanism dictating that awards would be reviewed every four years, perhaps even suspecting that when that occurred he might no longer be in government.


The commission took 6,000 submissions, saw 143 witnesses and had 39 days of hearings. It was a well-considered decision. Why? It was because they knew that the scale of the penalty rates—particularly those inflicted on the hospitality sector—was destroying jobs. They voted and they ruled in favour of those people who need jobs, the unemployed people. When asked on Neil Mitchell's program if he would accept Fair Work's decision—I know this has been brought up by previous speakers—the member for Maribyrnong answered twice, 'Yes, yes.' A bit like the cock crowing three times, he answered, 'Yes, yes,' and then said, 'I said I would accept the independent tribunal.' Now we know that he won't accept the independent tribunal's decision. Every possible variable was under the opposition's control, and now he sooks that his personally selected people at his government's organisation got it wrong. Perhaps he should consider that maybe he has it wrong. Perhaps he is driven by factors other than workers' interests.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:09):  On Sunday, penalty rates will be cut again. That means nearly 700,000 Australians will be up to $77 a week worse off. In my electorate of Macquarie, one in six workers are in hospitality and retail, and they can now legally have their pay cut. These workers live locally and service our tourism sector, which, of course, booms at weekends. When the work is done, these same workers spend their money locally, but they'll have less to spend from Sunday. That's $77 a week less to spend on groceries; $77 less to pay for kids' shoes; $77 less towards that ever-growing electricity bill.


The Prime Minister has no problem with these workers losing this money. Penalty rates have never been an important thing to him. He will never understand the reason why young people, older people, low-skilled workers, mums, dads and students opt for weekend and late-night work when they are filling in their availability for shifts. It is not because they don't want to have the same Sunday as everybody else; it's because they don't have a choice. They need the money and they need their penalty rates protected. When wages are stagnant and at record lows, this government is boasting about a $10 a week tax cut. It is sitting back, gloating, while some workers lose $77 a week.


I see that hair and beauty workers are the next to face the threat to their penalty rates for Sunday work. This is one of the lowest paid trades in Australia. We will not sit on the sidelines and watch these workers being forced down the same dead end as their hospitality and retail colleagues. Only Labor will restore and protect workers' penalty rates, and the government should be supporting our bill.


Penalty rates are not the only thing changing as the new financial year clicks over. On Monday, the support parents get towards their childcare costs changes. We know that a quarter of families will be worse off under the new system for a multitude of reasons, and that's 1,300 in my electorate of Macquarie. They don't work enough hours; they don't study or volunteer enough hours; or they earn too much money. One of my childcare centres in the lower Blue Mountains tells me that it has many families with one parent working who will lose benefits, and that means fewer days of child care. Whatever the reason for people losing their subsidy, I object to any child missing out on quality early learning that sets them up to better transition to school and is in the interests of every single child in every classroom. When we fail to invest in early childhood training, we pay a huge price further down the line.


The implementation of this new scheme has been a total shemozzle. One father in my electorate said that he had to take a whole day off work to go into Centrelink, because he couldn't input the information in the online system. He said the whole process was a debacle and the staff at Centrelink felt that they had not been given sufficient training and information needed to help parents. Childcare services are confused. The training and support they've received is inadequate. My childcare suppliers say they've looked at the information given to families and are finding it very difficult to make sense of it. What hope do parents have? There is so much uncertainty, but what is certain is that this government hasn't got it right for the most vulnerable families.


There is another change happening this weekend. It isn't about penalty rates or child care; it is about our children and the world that we leave our children. On 1 July, the Turnbull government's marine park management plans will begin the largest removal of an area from conservation in history. No government anywhere in the world has ever removed this much area from protection on land or sea. Think about that. If you think this means people will now be able to go fishing in more places, you're wrong. The recreational fishers are losing the largest recreation-only fishing area in the world. The only people dominating these waters will be large-scale industrial-fishing and long-lining trawlers, who now have a standing invitation from the Australian government to exploit our marine life for their profit.


The Coral Sea will go from being the jewel in the crown of the Commonwealth marine parks and protecting the eastern side of the Great Barrier Reef to now being a haven for long-line fishing and trawling. It is an absolute disgrace. The Prime Minister and this environment minister will now forever have the global reputation of removing more area from conservation than anyone anywhere else, ever. We haven't given up. They should be ashamed, but we haven't given up. The plan to cut marine parks can still be disallowed in the other place, and we will keep fighting. (Time expired)

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (16:14):  I'm trying to work out how the government's unfair cuts, including those cuts to child care and penalty rates, have impacts on marine parks and fishing! It's a very broad scope, and I've got to say that for those fishermen who aren't getting their penalty rates, because they've got their children in child care, it's tragic! It's a great stretch, but it clearly shows that when it comes to the depth of this topic, those opposite have got nothing. They couldn't even fill out their MPI time to talk about the topic. 


It reminds me a little bit, I've got to say, of: 'promise and not provide, talk and not deliver, deceive, but, worse, disappoint'. That was the example of the opposition when it was formerly in government, when they talked about what is a cut and what isn't a cut. I want to run through this. It reminds me of when I was a good-looking young man and this nice girl was going to come up to me and we were going to go on a date that night. My mate said it was never going to happen. But I was there. I turned up. I had my little rose and I was all psyched up. Do you know what happened? She didn't turn up. I should have known: promise, not provide, talk, don't deliver, deceive, and I was disappointed. 


That has been the case when it comes to education, particularly. All of the 118 schools in the electorate of Mallee have got more under our government. Every childcare centre is going to be better off in our area. This is the contrast. We have a package here for child care that actually does deliver. It delivers for vulnerable children. There is a child safety net for families earning under $66,000—they are going to get a little bit of extra assistance. For a person earning $60,000 who has a family and child care costs of $100 a day, they will be subsidised to the extent that it is only going to cost them $15 a day. When it comes to looking after children and families, it actually is the National Party that is delivering. There was a lot of criticism of the National Party by the opposition, who said they represent regional Australia. They don't even come out and visit regional Australia. I can't remember when a Labor MP actually visited my part of the world.




Ms Stanley:
  A month ago; I was there!




Mr BROAD:
  On a delegation, and that was a nice experience. I will talk about penalty rates for a moment. There is a very interesting argument going on here about who should determine the rates that an employer pays their employees. We go down a very dangerous pathway when we decide that this chamber is going to make that determination. If I was an employee, I would shudder in my boots at that concept. If I was an employer, I would shudder in my boots at that concept. Of course, people losing some working entitlements in penalty rates was not popular in my patch. It wasn't; let's be honest about it. But what also wasn't popular was shops choosing to shut because they couldn't afford to stay open. 




Ms Kearney:
  Shops will shut because people don't have money to spend in them!




Mr BROAD:
  This is a reason you should come out to my patch. On a Sunday afternoon, shops would be shut in tourist towns like Stawell, Mildura and Swan Hill. Do you know who was missing out? It was the person who was working in that shop—they weren't getting a wage, because the shop was shutting. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  No, the invite is there. Come and have a look and talk to both the workers and the shop owners and you will know. You will find that the shops were shutting. That's just an example of how you have built an ideology, instead of actually coming and having a chat to the people involved. If those shops are choosing to shut because they can't afford to stay open—the takings aren't enough for those shops in those country towns—the worker misses out, the owner of the business misses out, and, ultimately, the town misses out. Ultimately, what I want is profitable shops. I want profitable shops that employ Australians. Ultimately, I think it's a very, very dangerous precedent to go down a pathway where you allow this chamber to pick people's wages. Just think about that for a moment. There is an independent commission. Governments and oppositions can put forward their points of view, but, ultimately, the commission makes the rulings, and their rulings need to be adhered to. I think this MPI is just tokenism. Be very careful of what you wish for, because it would undermine the welfare of workers right across Australia if Labor had their way.

Government amendments will ensure that this defence applies to journalists as well as to editorial and support staff who reasonably believe that their conduct was in the public interest. The new secrecy offences ensure that harmful information cannot be released, while also providing appropriate defences to maintain freedom of speech, the press and expression.


With respect to treason, treachery and other threats to security, the EFI bill will update and simplify the longstanding offences of treason and treachery. These are some of the oldest offences on the statute book, and as such they require modernisation and updates to the language to reflect the modern environment and international law concepts of armed conflict.


The EFI bill will also repeal archaic and outdated offences from part II of the Crimes Act. These offences will be modernised and moved to the Criminal Code to ensure that Commonwealth criminal law appropriately supports the needs of the Australian Defence Force and protects Australia's democracy.


The new offences will criminalise threats to Australia's security, including advocating mutiny, assisting prisoners of war to escape, facilitating military-style training for a foreign government, and the use of force, violence or intimidation to interfere with Australian democratic or political rights. Government amendments to these offences include extending the good-faith defence to the offence of advocating mutiny, introducing a defence for staff of the United Nations or the International Committee of the Red Cross for the military-style-training offence, and reducing the penalty for the offence of interference with political rights and duties.


With respect to sabotage, the EFI bill will also introduce comprehensive sabotage offences into the Criminal Code. The new sabotage offences will criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia's national security. The new offences will apply higher penalties where sabotage offences are committed on behalf of foreign principals and will also contain offences that apply where a person's conduct does not immediately cause damage but leaves an item or system vulnerable to future misuse or exploitation. Government amendments to the EFI bill will also broaden the defence to sabotage offences to include private owners and operators of public infrastructure.


With respect to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the final point is that the EFI bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to ensure that the powers under the act are available to investigate the offences contained in the EFI bill.


With respect to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, while it's the case that foreign actors are free to promote their interests in Australia and in our free and open society, this must be done in a lawful, transparent and open way. The FITS Bill will provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about the forms and sources of foreign influence in Australia. Decision-makers in the Australian government and the public should know what interests are being advanced in respect of particular decisions or processes. However, it is difficult to assess the interests of foreign actors when they use intermediaries to advance their interests or activities, such as lobbying or the communication of information or material. This concealment ultimately undermines the ability of the decision-maker and the public to evaluate and reach informed decisions on the basis of those representations.


For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. The FITS Bill will create a scheme that requires persons undertaking certain activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register. The person who registers will be required to disclose information about the nature of their relationship with the foreign principal and activities undertaken pursuant to that relationship. The disclosure requirements will be ongoing, and additional disclosure will be required during elections. Some of the information which a person discloses will be made publicly available, and the FITS Bill also introduces criminal offences for noncompliance with the registry scheme.


The FITS Bill will require persons who undertake activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register under the scheme, depending on who the foreign principal is and the activities that the person undertakes. The term 'foreign principal' in the FITS Bill will capture a foreign government, a foreign political organisation, and persons and entities closely related to foreign governments and foreign political organisations. The FITS Bill will require registration where a person engages in parliamentary or political lobbying, communicates information or material designed to influence debate, or makes certain disbursements. Certain information about registrants and their activities will be made publicly available.


With respect to transparency notices, the FITS Bill will empower the secretary of the department to issue a transparency notice setting out whether a particular entity or individual is related to a foreign government. This mechanism will ensure that a person who undertakes registrable activities on the entity's or individual's behalf will be required to register under the scheme. Transparency notices will assist potential registrants to understand whether they are required to register and will also shed light where a company or individual seeks to conceal their relationship with a foreign principal.


The bill also provides for certain exemptions. The FITS Bill will exempt a range of organisations and persons from registering under the scheme. The exemptions extend to humanitarian assistance, legal advice, diplomatic activities, religious activities, commercial or business pursuits, industry representative bodies, individuals making personal legal representations, registered charities, activities with an artistic purpose, certain registered organisations and certain professions. These exemptions appropriately restrict the application of the scheme to those organisations and persons which seek to influence Australian political and government decisions or processes in a way that threatens Australian institutions.


The FITS Bill will also introduce offences, which will ensure compliance with the scheme. It will be a criminal offence for a person who is liable to register not to be registered under the scheme. (Extension of time granted) Criminal offences will also apply for failing to fulfil responsibilities under the scheme or providing false or misleading information in purported fulfilment of responsibilities and also for destroying records. It will also be a criminal offence not to comply with a notice from the secretary requiring information in relation to the scheme.


By way of conclusion I'd like to thank all of my parliamentary colleagues for recognising the important need for the measures in these two bills. Comprehensive criminal laws are a critical part of Australia's response to the threat of espionage and foreign interference. The EFI bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this threat and to ensuring that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers that they need to respond to the broad spectrum of foreign interference and related criminal activities directed against Australia's interests.


Legislative reform is clearly a critical step in shedding light on foreign influence. The FITS Bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this issue and to ensuring that the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes.


Ultimately, no member of this House—indeed, no citizen of our great democracy—should underestimate the threat being faced by the Australian government, Australian society and Australian democracy. That threat is from new forms of espionage practised in the modern age. These bills are detailed and legally complex, but the central principle of their necessity can be described simply by saying that we cannot protect Australia against modern espionage in the age of Skyfall with counterintelligence laws drafted for the era of Goldfinger. In fact, the threat of espionage wedded to the technologies of a digital age is now catalysed by something even more potentially dangerous. Likely even more dangerous and potentially even more damaging than traditional espionage is the practice that traditional spying now morphs into a massively broad and inventive range of covert foreign interference, or hidden foreign influence, in our democratic systems. The phenomenon of foreign principals attempting to influence our democracy is neither new nor unexpected, but what in the modern age of information technology and digital communications demonstrates true cunning and what can cause immense harm are foreign influence cloaked in the disguise of a purely or uniquely Australian veneer or foreign advocacy channelled by and through a recognised and seemingly independent Australian voice, which might be paid for or directed by foreign principals in a way that is hidden from sight.


Deception has always been at the heart of espionage, and so transparency is the evergreen counterintelligence to propaganda. So it is that this legislative combination of new foreign interference offences and a register to make transparent the links of Australian advocacy to foreign principals brings Australian counterintelligence laws into the modern age. Ian Fleming once said of his most famous character in espionage that boredom was the only vice that he utterly condemned, and indeed literary commentators have noted that this character displayed both a craving for routine and a hatred of boredom. The practice of modern espionage now being encountered in so many Western democracies across the globe—and the prevalence of deception wedded not merely to traditional spying but to interference and attempts to influence democratic outcomes—means that the only certainty our excellent national security agencies have is that there'll be nothing routine about the threats that they will need to counter and that their government will need to legislate accordingly against. I commend these bills to the House.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (16:19):  We were at the point where we were noting that defences will apply to ensure that the offences do not apply too broadly, including a defence specifically applying to journalists. Government amendments will ensure that this defence applies to journalists as well as to editorial and support staff who reasonably believe that their conduct was in the public interest. The new secrecy offences ensure that harmful information cannot be released, while also providing appropriate defences to maintain freedom of speech, the press and expression.


With respect to treason, treachery and other threats to security, the EFI bill will update and simplify the longstanding offences of treason and treachery. These are some of the oldest offences on the statute book, and as such they require modernisation and updates to the language to reflect the modern environment and international law concepts of armed conflict.


The EFI bill will also repeal archaic and outdated offences from part II of the Crimes Act. These offences will be modernised and moved to the Criminal Code to ensure that Commonwealth criminal law appropriately supports the needs of the Australian Defence Force and protects Australia's democracy.


The new offences will criminalise threats to Australia's security, including advocating mutiny, assisting prisoners of war to escape, facilitating military-style training for a foreign government, and the use of force, violence or intimidation to interfere with Australian democratic or political rights. Government amendments to these offences include extending the good-faith defence to the offence of advocating mutiny, introducing a defence for staff of the United Nations or the International Committee of the Red Cross for the military-style-training offence, and reducing the penalty for the offence of interference with political rights and duties.


With respect to sabotage, the EFI bill will also introduce comprehensive sabotage offences into the Criminal Code. The new sabotage offences will criminalise conduct causing damage to a broad range of critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia's national security. The new offences will apply higher penalties where sabotage offences are committed on behalf of foreign principals and will also contain offences that apply where a person's conduct does not immediately cause damage but leaves an item or system vulnerable to future misuse or exploitation. Government amendments to the EFI bill will also broaden the defence to sabotage offences to include private owners and operators of public infrastructure.


With respect to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the final point is that the EFI bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to ensure that the powers under the act are available to investigate the offences contained in the EFI bill.


With respect to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, while it's the case that foreign actors are free to promote their interests in Australia and in our free and open society, this must be done in a lawful, transparent and open way. The FITS Bill will provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about the forms and sources of foreign influence in Australia. Decision-makers in the Australian government and the public should know what interests are being advanced in respect of particular decisions or processes. However, it is difficult to assess the interests of foreign actors when they use intermediaries to advance their interests or activities, such as lobbying or the communication of information or material. This concealment ultimately undermines the ability of the decision-maker and the public to evaluate and reach informed decisions on the basis of those representations.


For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. The FITS Bill will create a scheme that requires persons undertaking certain activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register. The person who registers will be required to disclose information about the nature of their relationship with the foreign principal and activities undertaken pursuant to that relationship. The disclosure requirements will be ongoing, and additional disclosure will be required during elections. Some of the information which a person discloses will be made publicly available, and the FITS Bill also introduces criminal offences for noncompliance with the registry scheme.


The FITS Bill will require persons who undertake activities on behalf of a foreign principal to register under the scheme, depending on who the foreign principal is and the activities that the person undertakes. The term 'foreign principal' in the FITS Bill will capture a foreign government, a foreign political organisation, and persons and entities closely related to foreign governments and foreign political organisations. The FITS Bill will require registration where a person engages in parliamentary or political lobbying, communicates information or material designed to influence debate, or makes certain disbursements. Certain information about registrants and their activities will be made publicly available.


With respect to transparency notices, the FITS Bill will empower the secretary of the department to issue a transparency notice setting out whether a particular entity or individual is related to a foreign government. This mechanism will ensure that a person who undertakes registrable activities on the entity's or individual's behalf will be required to register under the scheme. Transparency notices will assist potential registrants to understand whether they are required to register and will also shed light where a company or individual seeks to conceal their relationship with a foreign principal.


The bill also provides for certain exemptions. The FITS Bill will exempt a range of organisations and persons from registering under the scheme. The exemptions extend to humanitarian assistance, legal advice, diplomatic activities, religious activities, commercial or business pursuits, industry representative bodies, individuals making personal legal representations, registered charities, activities with an artistic purpose, certain registered organisations and certain professions. These exemptions appropriately restrict the application of the scheme to those organisations and persons which seek to influence Australian political and government decisions or processes in a way that threatens Australian institutions.


The FITS Bill will also introduce offences, which will ensure compliance with the scheme. It will be a criminal offence for a person who is liable to register not to be registered under the scheme. (Extension of time granted) Criminal offences will also apply for failing to fulfil responsibilities under the scheme or providing false or misleading information in purported fulfilment of responsibilities and also for destroying records. It will also be a criminal offence not to comply with a notice from the secretary requiring information in relation to the scheme.


By way of conclusion I'd like to thank all of my parliamentary colleagues for recognising the important need for the measures in these two bills. Comprehensive criminal laws are a critical part of Australia's response to the threat of espionage and foreign interference. The EFI bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this threat and to ensuring that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers that they need to respond to the broad spectrum of foreign interference and related criminal activities directed against Australia's interests.


Legislative reform is clearly a critical step in shedding light on foreign influence. The FITS Bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this issue and to ensuring that the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes.


Ultimately, no member of this House—indeed, no citizen of our great democracy—should underestimate the threat being faced by the Australian government, Australian society and Australian democracy. That threat is from new forms of espionage practised in the modern age. These bills are detailed and legally complex, but the central principle of their necessity can be described simply by saying that we cannot protect Australia against modern espionage in the age of Skyfall with counterintelligence laws drafted for the era of Goldfinger. In fact, the threat of espionage wedded to the technologies of a digital age is now catalysed by something even more potentially dangerous. Likely even more dangerous and potentially even more damaging than traditional espionage is the practice that traditional spying now morphs into a massively broad and inventive range of covert foreign interference, or hidden foreign influence, in our democratic systems. The phenomenon of foreign principals attempting to influence our democracy is neither new nor unexpected, but what in the modern age of information technology and digital communications demonstrates true cunning and what can cause immense harm are foreign influence cloaked in the disguise of a purely or uniquely Australian veneer or foreign advocacy channelled by and through a recognised and seemingly independent Australian voice, which might be paid for or directed by foreign principals in a way that is hidden from sight.


Deception has always been at the heart of espionage, and so transparency is the evergreen counterintelligence to propaganda. So it is that this legislative combination of new foreign interference offences and a register to make transparent the links of Australian advocacy to foreign principals brings Australian counterintelligence laws into the modern age. Ian Fleming once said of his most famous character in espionage that boredom was the only vice that he utterly condemned, and indeed literary commentators have noted that this character displayed both a craving for routine and a hatred of boredom. The practice of modern espionage now being encountered in so many Western democracies across the globe—and the prevalence of deception wedded not merely to traditional spying but to interference and attempts to influence democratic outcomes—means that the only certainty our excellent national security agencies have is that there'll be nothing routine about the threats that they will need to counter and that their government will need to legislate accordingly against. I commend these bills to the House.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:56):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority annual report 2017 together with the minutes of proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms HENDERSON:
  by leave—On 28 March 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, appeared before the Standing Committee on Economics as part of the review of APRA's annual report 2017. As chair of this committee, I'm very pleased to table this report. The committee examined APRA's activities supervising and enforcing prudential standards and practices in the Australian financial system. APRA explained that its focus has been on improving resilience in the financial system. The committee scrutinised APRA on its work on issues of governance, risk management and culture in financial institutions. In particular, the committee focused on measures to reinforce sound lending practices to ensure that Australian banks remained prudentially strong. In addition, the committee examined the new Banking Executive Accountability Regime, otherwise known as BEAR.


While APRA is seeking to improve responsible lending practices in the Australian financial sector, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. The disturbing evidence coming out of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry suggests that the major banks, in a number of cases, are moving from a low base when improving their responsible lending practices.


In recent years, APRA has provided guidance on lending practices that was aimed at maintaining strong lending in an environment of heightened risks. The benchmark limiting the growth of investor loans to 10 per cent, issued in December 2014, was updated in guidance from APRA on 26 April 2018. From 1 July 2018, financial institutions will no longer have to meet this requirement if they are able to provide APRA with certain assurances about the strength of their lending practices. The benchmark limiting the flow of new interest-only lending, established in APRA guidance on 31 March 2017, remains in place.


Strengthening accountability measures for senior executives was a key recommendation of the committee's review of the four major banks. The BEAR will provide mechanisms to make senior bank executives more accountable and subject to additional oversight by APRA. It comes into effect on 1 July 2018 for the major banks. There will be a measured transition for smaller institutions. 


The committee also sees a need to continue to improve competition in the banking sector. In its review of the four major banks, the committee previously called for removing barriers to new entrants to the sector. It welcomes the recent changes to the restrictions on institutions using the term 'bank' in lifting this barrier to new entrants. 


The new crisis-management powers introduced by the government provide important new tools for APRA. They will empower APRA to better prepare and take decisive action to more quickly and effectively address crises in Australia's financial system. 


The proposed changes to superannuation will improve governance and transparency in the industry. The committee expects that, once the measures are implemented, it will better position APRA-related superannuation licensees to deliver sound outcomes for their members. The committee notes that APRA has extended its strategic focus to superannuation and will monitor APRA's performance in this area. 


Certainly one of the issues raised in this respect was third-party transactions of superannuation members' funds, particularly to unions. This is money belonging to members, and I am concerned that APRA—these were issues that I raised—has not been focused enough on regulating these practices which undermine the confidence that members have in the trustees of superannuation funds. I trust that these matters will be better regulated and there will be a strong regulatory eye on these practices in the future. 


In closing, I want to reiterate the very strong action that our government is taking to reform the banking and financial services sector across Australia. Over and above the reforms that we have passed to bolster the resources, penalties and powers available to ASIC, the Turnbull government very proudly has passed legislation to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, and a one-stop shop dispute resolution scheme to provide consumers with independent and timely access to justice and access to compensation where appropriate. 


As I've talked about, the government has also passed legislation to create the new BEAR regime, with enhanced powers for APRA to remove and disqualify an executive or director, to direct adjustments to remuneration policies and variable pay and to enforce new prudential risk-management conduct obligations with penalties of up to $200 million where these are not met. 


In March 2017, legislation was passed to establish a new Commonwealth company, the Financial Advisor Standards and Ethics Authority, to lift the professional, education and ethical standards of financial advisers. We've seen in evidence before the royal commission that some financial advisers have fallen well short of expected standards. We've passed legislation to cap the incentives paid to advisers for the sale of life insurance products. We've also passed new laws to ensure that retail client moneys are protected where financial firms become insolvent. 


In December 2017, the government introduced legislation to bolster the whistleblower protection regime in the Corporations Act by providing protection for a wider range of disclosures, protection for anonymous disclosures and easier access to justice for those who suffer reprisals as a result of blowing the whistle. These are all very, very important reforms in strengthening our banking and financial services industry and the sector across the country. 


On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the chairman of APRA, Mr Wayne Byers, and other APRA representatives for appearing at the public hearing. 


I commend the report to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:04):  by leave—When it comes to financial services, the main show in town at the moment is, of course, the banking royal commission. We've seen some shocking revelations from that inquiry at the moment into financial services and banks, particularly in the wealth management sector, where we saw numerous cases of victims of predatory lending, alleged fraud, fees for no service and clear breaches of the Future of Financial Advice reforms and section 961B of the Corporations Act. It should never be forgotten that it was this government, the Turnbull government, that opposed that royal commission for 600 days, and Labor ensured that we pushed the government to establish this important inquiry. Labor have been totally vindicated in our calls for a royal commission into banking and finance in this country.


One of the worst offenders at the moment, unfortunately, is the once mighty Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It's got to the situation where there have been special inquiries by our regulators into what's been going on at the Commonwealth Bank. In the recent inquiry that we held with APRA, we discussed that with the representatives from APRA—in particular their inquiry into the Commonwealth Bank's governance, its culture and its accountability frameworks. What APRA determined in respect of what was going on in the Commonwealth Bank can basically be summed up in one sentence: too much focus on profit and not enough focus on culture, accountability and their customers. That's exactly what's been going on in the Commonwealth Bank and, unfortunately, in too many other banks and financial service providers in this country.


It took a Labor government, when we were in office, to actually put in place a best-interests duty in our legislation to ensure that financial advisers actually have to act in the best interests of their customers, because—believe it or not—prior to Labor instilling that legislation in 2012, there was no legal obligation for financial advisers to act in the best interests of their client, and guess what: they didn't. In many cases, they didn't. It was this government and its representatives that opposed Labor putting those Future of Financial Advice reforms in that legislation. So if the government had had its way, when you look at it, the cases in the evidence that's coming out of the royal commission—those shocking cases of what the counsel assisting the royal commission is recommending be prosecuted as criminal conduct—would not have been illegal. They simply would have been a bad look for some of the banks. That should never, ever be forgotten.


So there has been too much focus on profit and not enough on customers, accountability and culture. The Commonwealth Bank has had to enter into enforceable undertakings and a remediation program that's now being overseen by APRA, and APRA have assured our committee that they will continue to monitor what's going on in the Commonwealth Bank. Heap on top of that the AUSTRAC scandal and the alleged clear breaches of Australia's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing laws by our biggest bank. The Commonwealth Bank have entered into a settlement with AUSTRAC, and it's a record settlement fine, up to $700 million, that the Commonwealth Bank will pay. When I questioned, in particular, the chairwoman of the Commonwealth Bank and the former CEO when they appeared before our committee on the last occasion, they used this notion of the sub judice rule. They said: 'Oh, we can't answer many of those questions, because these matters are before the court. We can't answer these questions, because these matters are before the court and they may be sub judice.' I made the point at that hearing that I wanted the Commonwealth Bank to answer those questions because it was likely that the matter would be settled and the Australian people would never, ever find out what had actually gone on in the Commonwealth Bank's boardroom and their decision-making processes about the AUSTRAC scandal. Well, what do you know? That's exactly what's happened. The Commonwealth Bank have settled the matter, and the Australian public are none the wiser about what's actually been going on in this bank. So I'm looking forward to representatives of the Commonwealth Bank coming back to our committee in October this year to, hopefully, answer some of those questions.


There was also clear discussion about the macroprudential standards that have been instituted by APRA—in particular the limit on the flow of new interest-only lending to 30 per cent of new residential mortgage lending, following an earlier 10 per cent benchmark. What the banks basically did in meeting that target was to push up the cost of interest-only lending. But they didn't do it only for new loans; they did it for existing loans as well. So existing customers got hit with the increase in the cost of credit on their existing loans, when clearly APRA and the regulator were talking about stemming the flow of new loans. I think most Australians would disagree with the approach of the banks there. Really, that's one of the reasons why a lot of Australians hate the banks—because they do things like this. They give an inch and take a mile when it comes to these macroprudential changes. That's exactly what the banks have done.


There was also a discussion about the competitive nature of those reforms and the fact that they locked in a market share for some of the bigger players compared to the smaller players, and, in many respects, have stifled competition in that market. They are the issues that were discussed. We look forward to our continuing relationship with APRA. I thank the officers of APRA and I thank the officers of our committee for the fine work that they do.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (17:14):  I begin my contribution this afternoon by acknowledging the severity of the drought our country currently faces, which is experienced by not only our farmers and their families but also the rural communities that rely so heavily on the health of the farming sector. When our farming income is down then the local economy is also down. If ever there were an issue in the parliament on which we should be taking a bipartisan approach, this is it. I'm not suggesting that this speech will be particularly bipartisan, because we seem to be somewhat beyond that, but with the departure of the member for New England I believe there is still an opportunity for us to regroup and approach drought on a bipartisan basis.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  That's very good to hear, Member for Hunter.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  It is all right to extend sympathy to our farming families, which I do tonight on behalf of the opposition, but they need much more than sympathy; they need a parliament and a government working for them, making the real and meaningful responses to drought that can take us well and truly into the future in a way that offers them confidence. Whatever those policies look like, they need to be underpinned by the basic acceptance that drought in our country should no longer be treated as abnormal event, something which will come along occasionally and which, hopefully, won't last too long, and that, rather, our climate is changing—and neither this evening nor the course of this policy debate is the time to argue about what is causing the change; that is for another day—in a way which is making it far more difficult for our farming communities. We need to recognise that is unlikely to change; it's the new normal. We need to accept that protracted drought will be with us again and again, part of our climate on a permanent basis, and approach the policy with those fundamentals in mind.


I am still not sure why the Prime Minister recently had a drought tour. I would've thought that, after five years in government and at least seven years of drought, he might've understood the drought and what we as a parliament should be doing about it. More surprisingly, he didn't come back from the drought tour with a policy announcement. I accept that prime ministers look for a photo opportunity when parts of our community are facing natural disasters, but they usually do that ahead of a policy announcement, and on the Prime Minister's return, disappointingly, he offered no such thing.


The fact that we are debating this Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 this evening poses four key questions for me. First of all, what has happened in drought policy over the last 10 years? I think that's worth sharing with the House. Second, why are we debating this bill before the House now in June 2018? Third, what does the future hold for drought policy in this country? That's something I've already touched on. Fourth, what are the government's policy priorities, and how do the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors rate in the government's considerations?


Ten years ago now, back in 2008, Commonwealth and state governments started to reflect upon the history of drought policy in this country and its failings. In 2013 something quite historic took place: the Commonwealth and each of the states and territories agreed to a whole new approach to drought policy and entered into an intergovernmental agreement which will have lasted five years, coming to an end 1 July this year, only days away. A number of principles were embraced within that agreement. I should say that agreement had the support of key farm leadership groups like the National Farmers' Federation, and within this parliament it had bipartisan support. It was agreed, with the helping hand and guidance of a Productivity Commission report, that the way we were doing drought policy in this place was failing our farmers, our economy, our communities and indeed, of course, the budget. We were spending a billion dollars a year on a number of initiatives which usually fall under the umbrella of exceptional circumstances. They were costing us a billion dollars a year. A considerable proportion of farming families, as the Productivity Commission indicated, have been on the welfare payment for many, many years—too many years. Of course, the Productivity Commission identified the fact that many of our farm businesses hadn't made a profit for many years, and it was clear that the drought policies that were in place were not working and were failing our farmers, our communities and our economies.


So the states and the Commonwealth said, 'Let's try a new approach,' and the agreement was underpinned by a number of principles. I want to share them with the House. There are five of them. The first was to assist farm families and primary producers to adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability. The second was to encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage business risks. The third was to ensure families in hardship have access to a support payment that recognises the special circumstances of a farmer, and that's the principle which is leading us to this debate tonight. The fifth was to provide a framework for jurisdictions' responses during periods of drought. I missed the fourth; I'm sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was to ensure that social support services are accessible to farm families. So they are the principles that underpin the intergovernmental agreement which comes to an end on 1 July this year.


Of course, the governments—plural, because it commenced under the former Labor government—moved pretty quickly to establish farm household allowance as one of those key principles. Farm household allowance, for those who don't know this area well, is basically an unemployment benefit for farmers. It comes with a more generous or liberal assets test, because obviously farmers can be very cash poor in times of hardship—not necessarily just drought—but still be quite asset rich and unable, of course, to readily pass off those assets. So we need a welfare payment. I think the welfare payment is an important part of the equation, and farm household allowance represents that welfare payment.


Importantly, the COAG discussion included an embrace of the idea that the welfare payment should not be ongoing ad infinitum. The concept is really that farmers should get income support for a period of time—three years was chosen—and in that time they should be expected, with some government support and guidance, to make themselves more resilient and more adaptable, to embrace new business models, maybe to get other off-farm income or maybe to leave the land, if that's absolutely necessary and they conclude that that's the only option available to them.


What brings us to the debate tonight is the fact that a couple of thousand farming families have now reached the end of their three-year entitlement to farm household allowance, and the government is now seeking to extend it by one year for those who are already on it or have just left farm household allowance because their time has expired—and, indeed, for those who are coming onto it. I need to make clear to the House that, for new entrants on the farm household allowance, the period will now be four years, not three—thus the considerable impact on the budget bottom line. It's not just existing farmers; there will be future farmers as well.


The problem with all of that is that the work simply hasn't been done along the way. We've lost five years, basically. The first act of the member for New England when he became the minister was actually to abolish the COAG process. The whole concept of the IGA relied upon the idea of greater collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states. It's true that, as the mainland managers, under our Constitution the states have to be part of the equation; they have to be part of the solution. There was an entity called the Standing Council on Primary Industries, which dealt with these matters under the umbrella of COAG. SCoPI, the Standing Council on Primary Industries, was not only the ministers meeting but also the committee on which the secretaries were represented. It was the role of that COAG committee to continue to progress the next stages of that drought reform plan.


That was then pulled away. Under pressure, it was eventually replaced with a thing called AGMIN—that is, the ag ministers group—which didn't have anything like the construction, secretarial support or resourcing that the Standing Council on Primary Industries had. I'll never understand why SCoPI was abolished, but it was a great mistake by this government. It was a decision authorised by no less than the Prime Minister of the day. It is something the current Prime Minister hasn't sought to turn around; he should turn it around. If we're going to have any hope of producing real and meaningful drought policy in this place, we need a COAG process and we need it very quickly. We've seen other areas of government policy where we've been let down by the diminution of the COAG process.


What we have had over the last five years is an increasing reliance on concessional loans. It was a former Labor government that first went down the path of concessional loans for our farmers. At that time, it was not because of drought but because of high indebtedness. That was the major issue of the day. I still believe that, in the higher interest rate environment at that time, there was a role for concessional loans, but this government has fallen into the trap of offering concessional loans for just about any hill any business ever faces: Northern Australia infrastructure loans, concessional loans to farmers—and the list goes on and on. But, as a drought response, the reality is that more debt or switching debt is simply not a solution or an option for many farmers. It entails challenging your relationship with the bank. We've learnt time and time again in this place that it means going through a terrible number of hoops in terms of paperwork during the application process. It is very, very difficult.


We've had this over-reliance on concessional loans, and of course the concessional loans have allowed the government to spruik the capital value of the land. We read in the Agricultural competitiveness white paper the government's $4 billion investment. It is a failed document; I think there's a general consensus in the sector on that now. It's $4 billion because that would be the total capital value of all the loans if they were all lent out. Of course, that's not the cost to the budget bottom line. The cost of the budget bottom line is the cost of administering the loans and any bad debts. We need to look at the difference between the government's bond-borrowing rate and the interest rate of the loans. The cost to government is not great. The government has become very fond of these loans because it doesn't cost the budget bottom line and it allows them to spruik that larger amounts of money are going to our farmers. It's a sleight of hand, it's not an approach which is conducive to bipartisanship in this place and it's certainly not a way of helping our farmers.


By way of completeness, I acknowledge that the government has improved the farm management deposit scheme in recent years. That's a good thing. It's a very wise policy to allow people to put money away in good times for use in bad times and to use the taxation system to make that attractive. We should continue to make that a key centrepiece of drought policy. The government has also done a little bit of work around capital depreciation—that is, accelerated depreciation for certain infrastructure projects on-farm, whether it be water or otherwise. The problem is that accelerated depreciation is no good to someone who's not making a profit. You have to spend the money in the first place but if you're suffering a very bad drought then you're not likely to have the money to invest.


That takes me to the Regional Investment Corporation. The government is so fond of these loans that it's now going to establish the so-called Regional Investment Corporation in Orange. Why Orange? I think you know the answer to that: because that's where the Nationals lost a state seat for the first time in 69 years, and the best way to grab it back from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party might be to run a little boondoggle or pork-barrelling exercise out to Orange. The problem with the Regional Investment Corporation—



Mr Broad interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I acknowledge that the member for Mallee would have liked to have had the Regional Investment Corporation, but I will put his mind at rest by saying, 'Don't worry; I don't think the Regional Investment Corporation will ever eventuate.' I don't think we're going to have a regional investment corporation. I've already mentioned 1 July, which is supposed to be day that the Regional Investment Corporation opens its doors and starts making farmers right around the country happy and gives a huge boost to our national economy. Everywhere Mr Littleproud goes, no matter what the problem in the agricultural sector, he says, 'Don't worry; you're going to have the Regional Investment Corporation.'


Well, that isn't happening. There won't be any doors opening in Orange on 1 July—at the end of this week or whenever that is—because the Regional Investment Corporation has no real objective, no CEO and no staff. It doesn't even have a location, let alone a building. In fact, the board turned up in Orange I think for the first time last week. There is a board. The minister has appointed a board, and they met in a park. We had the APVMA team, small as it is, meeting at Macca's in Armidale, in the electorate of New England.



Mr Broad interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I'll pick up the member for Mallee's interjections—no reflection on Macca's; it's a good choice. Their coffee's not too bad. But we have the APVMA CEO holding her business in Macca's in Armidale and now we have the RIC board meeting on a park bench in Orange. This is a disgrace. It should stop and it should stop now. The new minister should walk away from the antics of the former minister and just say: 'This is enough. This is not working. This is $28 million of money which could go to drought-affected farmers tomorrow.' That would be a better use of the money.


What is the RIC going to do if ever it opens, unlikely as that is? It's going to do the same thing the states are already doing through their rural adjustment authorities: it's going to administer concessional loans to farmers, but only new loans. We'll have a situation where the states will continue to administer old loans for up to 10 years and the Regional Investment Corporation will administer new loans. This is just silly. It's a duplication and an unnecessary one. The minister will say, 'The states weren't doing a very good job of it.' Well, I challenge that, but a good minister would work with the states, bring them in and say: 'I'm not completely happy with the way these loans are being administered. Let's do it better.' That's what a minister showing leadership would do, but it's certainly not what this minister is doing. I should say that the RIC is allegedly also going to administer some water infrastructure loans. We shall see.


While I think of it, I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Turnbull Government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farmers and agricultural industries"".


I'm sure the member for Griffith will be happy to second that for me.




Ms Butler:
  Quite right!




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  The APVMA is a shocking pork-barrelling exercise that threatens our farming community. It's already destroying productivity in the farming community. The Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is a critical part of our farm economy and makes sure not only that farmers get their crop sprays and other chemicals and veterinary medicines that they need but also that they get them in a timely way—when new products are offered to the market, they get to the market very quickly. This forced relocation to Armidale is destroying the joint. Staff have left in a mass exodus, and it's impacting on the entity's capacity to do its job. I'll make a bet now: in the not-too-distant future the new minister, finally, will be making big changes. He will be revisiting the general policy order and saying, 'We are going to extend the time available to the APVMA to make this work,' but, more importantly, they will be changing it in a way that will allow more people to stay here in Canberra to work. In the not-too-distant future this government will be admitting that the APVMA relocation has been a failure. They will be left with no choice but to pretend they're having a relocation to Armidale, but in fact a large number of staff will be working here in Canberra, because they cannot find the personnel—the expert lawyers and the regulatory scientists—they need to do that work.


I challenge Minister Littleproud: he should just run up the white flag now and differentiate himself from the former minister and say: 'We're not going to waste $50 million or more on this relocation to Armidale. We're not going to undermine the productivity of our farmers. We're not going to threaten consumer health, because we eat the stuff that those sprays are used on and we want to make sure the regulator is up to the job. And we're not going to undermine our exports, because the APVMA plays a role in that regulatory regime, as well. We're not going to do that. We're going to gut this idea, forget the pork barrel and bring the APVMA back to Canberra, where it absolutely belongs.'


In posing my question—why are we debating this bill now?—I've touched on the history. People have already gone off the farm household allowance. They have exhausted their entitlement and here we are, in the last sitting fortnight, rushing a bill through the parliament to create this extension. We are still very unclear about what hoops people will have to go through who have already come off the farm household allowance. I invite the minister to explain that further to us when he makes his closing remarks. Is it going to be as hard as it was for people when they first went on the farm household allowance? Remember the member for New England saying: 'Oh, they don't have to apply or wait; they just get it.' That is the statement that led to the doctoring of his Hansard and subsequently the dismissal of his departmental secretary—one of the darkest periods of our history in this place. Why are we debating a bill that needs to be given effect basically from 1 July—this week? The government couldn't work out a month, two months or six months ago that in the absence of any other policy work in the last five years they're going to have to extend the farm household allowance? They had to wait until now? This is just incredible. Was it the drought tour that convinced the Prime Minister that he needed to extend the farm household allowance by a year? Surely not. I hope not, because that was just obvious to all and sundry.


What does the future hold for drought policy in this country? This is an interesting question. Something very curious happened in the Federation Chamber last night. I welcome the fact that during the week of the Prime Minister's infamous drought tour the relatively new Minister for Agriculture and Water started talking about climate, recognising the things I was saying earlier about accepting drought as not an abnormal event. He talked about resilience, he talked about adaptation and he talked about the challenge for some people in some parts of the country that were capable of being farmed 100 years ago and are not so capable of being farmed today. He was using all the right language. But the member for Calare had a motion on drought last night in which he mentioned none of those things. Interestingly, the member for New England contributed to that debate and, again, mentioned none of those things. I'm glad the member for Mallee is here, because he did. He understands this subject pretty well, in my view, and I'll give credit where credit is due. But who's in charge? Is the former member for New England still in charge of drought policy? He's still in denial, still wanting to roll out the boondoggles and defend his legacy. Or is the new minister in charge, backed by people like the member for Mallee? I hope it's the new minister, and I wish the member for Mallee the best in that regard, because we do need to get this job done. We need to embrace the intergovernmental agreement review. We need to rebuild the SCoPI process and construction, because that's the first step.


The other question I posed was on government priorities. Remember when agriculture was one of this government's five pillars of the economy? They hardly talk about the agriculture sector anymore. The member for New England was very fond of claiming credit when commodity prices were high and everything was good, but, now we have a crisis in all sorts of places, including the dairy industry, no-one wants to talk about agriculture anymore.


Let's have a look at the legislative agenda. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017 was introduced into this House on 25 October last year. This bill enjoys bipartisan support. It has disappeared. The Export Control Bill 2017, a very important bill, was introduced into the Senate on 7 December last year. It hasn't been prioritised and has disappeared. It's an important bill which enjoys bipartisan support. The Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, another very important bill, was introduced into the House on 28 March last year. It is still in the House. It was introduced and has disappeared. The penalties for breaches of animal welfare standards in the live export trade were introduced on 24 May, never to be seen again. We know the reason for the last one: I foreshadowed an amendment, and the government won't bring the bill back, because it's fearful of people crossing the floor and of losing the vote.


How does this reflect on the government's priorities for agriculture? They won't even bring bipartisan bills into the House for debate and to be voted upon. They won't even put these bills on the legislative agenda. I don't have time to go through them tonight, but these are important bills. The department of agriculture is spending a very large slice of its time and resources trying to work out how to make the APVMA work in Armidale and the Regional Investment Corporation work in Orange, when it should be focusing on these very important and meaningful matters that affect our agricultural sector.


When the former minister was here, we heard about dams which were unproven, uneconomic and will never come to reality, and silly stunts around carp eradication. I said so many times that he was the worst agriculture minister in the history of Federation. That's in the past. I want the new minister to step forward and demonstrate that he's prepared to take the agriculture portfolio seriously. It's not just agriculture; they wiped fisheries and forestry out of the portfolio title—another silly mistake. We don't hear the new minister talk about fisheries or forestry. I know Senator Ruston does work in that area, but people want to hear their lead minister talk about these issues.


For five years a crisis has been looming in forestry because of our failure to grow the plantation estate, and what have we had in response? We've had an issues paper, which was eventually turned into a discussion paper and, last year, by no less than the Prime Minister himself, turned into a plan to have a plan—and we're still waiting for the plan. For five years we've known about the problem and have had nothing but discussion papers, the formation of committees et cetera. It's not good enough.


The opposition will be supporting this bill because, in the absence of any real progress on national drought reform for five years, we've no choice now but to further help farmers who haven't made that transition and haven't been given appropriate guidance or support by the government. Farmers will need another year, but what happens after that? Surely we'll be back here next year asking ourselves the same question if this government is not prepared to get serious about rebuilding the COAG process and about real collaboration with the states. Mr Littleproud has said it, but we want to see him walk the talk. They need to be serious about embracing the concept that the climate is changing and the change is here to stay. It has to be about resilience and adaptation. We have to help people find new business models, retrain and, sadly for some, acknowledge that they might not have an ongoing concern, because of a severely changing climate.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  Is the amendment seconded?




Ms Butler:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form 'that the amendment be agreed to'. The question is now that the amendment be agreed to.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,13,1,speech
"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:45):  In rising to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, can I respectfully ask that the member for Hunter hang around for a few minutes—hopefully, he does. I sat here and listened for half an hour and, like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he did his best to dismantle the federal government's position on what it's going to do. But, also like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he forgot to talk about what he was going to do.


The extension of farm household support is less than 12 months; I was hoping for a little more. Member for Hunter, it wasn't until 24 minutes into your contribution on the bill that you actually started to mention what you might do, and I thought: 'I'm excited. There's going to be an alternate position—finally.' I actually believe that the member for Hunter can do it. He's probably the first Labor member that I've seen who genuinely has a real passion for the portfolio, and that's really welcome. He's got a genuine interest. I hope he hangs around, because I'm going to talk a little less about the politics and a little more about drought policy.


In my maiden speech, I gave a recognition that successive parliaments over many, many years hadn't developed a good drought policy—and we probably still haven't, if we're honest with ourselves. The fact is that we live in a country that is going to experience significant rainfall at times; it is also going to experience significant dry times. It is right for the member for Hunter to talk about climate, because there is no doubt that we're having more challenging climatic conditions around our agricultural sector. If you're a believer in climate change—some of my farmers are and some of my farmers aren't—you will at least adhere to the concept that rainfall seems to be more sporadic and that, when rain does come, the downpours are heavier, which means that we need greater intervention, particularly around water catchments. There is a good argument for dams as a result of climate change.


I want to talk about a number of things that have been good and then touch on some things that would be significant improvements. I think farm household support is a basic. It's not rocket science. If we have a family that is not working and is living in a poor suburb in one of our towns, we make sure that they've got groceries on the table. If you've got a farming business that might have a large amount of assets but then, even though they're having a go, because of the seasonal conditions they are in difficulty, it's only fair that they also have groceries on the table. It is nice that drought support is being extended for a fourth year. I wonder whether it should even be indefinite. What we simply want to say is that, if you're having a dip, we're going to ensure that you're able to feed your children and that you're able to put shoes on their feet and uniforms on their backs so that they can go to school. So it does surprise me that this support even had a three-year cut-off.


Of course, what we want is farm businesses to be profitable, sound and not to have to rely on farm household support—and many of them are. The farm management deposit has been a good system. I point out that we have legislated so that a farm management deposit can be used against an existing loan. That has been taken up by Rural Bank. It's the only bank in Australia that has taken it up. That would be a very simple way of at least making those farm managements more attractive and more competitive in the interest rate component.


I think we also need to be very mindful of time of entry. That's something we haven't got our head around. I bought my first farm when I was 22 years old. In the drought of 2002, when I harvested my crop—and, for those who are interested in grain growing, when you sow wheat, you sow it at about two bushels an acre, so about 60 kilograms an acre—my harvest was 30 kilograms an acre. I got less than half back. I remember that, when I was a young farmer, my wife was working, and, even though she was only earning $33,000 at the time, because she earned over $25,000 we weren't eligible for drought assistance—none at all. I remember getting the letter saying that I wasn't eligible. I got it and I nailed it to the shearing shed wall and said, 'I'll show you who's viable!' Anyway, we made a go of it. But I think that time of entry is incredibly important because, if you're going to support farmers through a difficult time, what you want at the other end of it, when the rains start falling again, is young farmers to be able to kick off and go, because they're the ones who are going to drive our productivity gains, they're the ones who are going to take up the new technology and they're the ones who are going to drive the exports for the nation. So, whatever we do, we have to think about time of entry for drought assistance.


The other thing that I think is working is the seasonal insurance model. This requires better forecasting. It requires a good network of Doppler weather radar. Essentially, what we're seeing across my farming sector now is that people will work out: what is the input cost of growing a crop? I'll just go on a per-acre basis, to put it in layman's terms—even though we talk in hectares, a lot of the country in my area is laid out in mile-square blocks, which are 640 acres. It essentially costs you about $30 or $40, up to $50, an acre to put in a crop by the time you write out your cheques for your fertiliser, write out your cheques for your chemicals and write out cheques for your fuel, your scarifier points and all those sorts of things. We are able now to access insurance products that will cover the costs of your inputs if you have a year that's a complete wipe-out. Say for example that, to put in 2,000 acres of crop, you would have needed $200,000 worth of inputs. You're able to insure those products at less than $10 an acre—so it's reasonably competitive—so that, if you get a lack of growing-season rainfall between June and September, you'll get a payout for that.


I just want to point out why this is important. If you as a farmer start to develop a drought package in your own business, you'll say, 'I'm going to take this insurance product so that, if it doesn't rain, at least I've got enough money to put the crop in next year.' That's tick one. You'll also try to get your farm management deposit to equal what the interest component is on your loan. If you talk to any bank, most banks will roll you over another year as long as you've got the capacity to cover your interest. If you set up your business so you've got your interest component covered through your farm management deposit and you take out the insurance product so that you've got the input costs, it means that, okay, in a drought year you've made nothing, but you haven't gone backwards. You couple that with farm household support, so you've still got food on the kitchen table, and I think you start to look at a package that fundamentally works.


Those are the things that I think we need to perhaps create greater incentives. Also, we need to be mindful that farmers will look, in their own farming system, at ways of developing a drought assistance package. That might be that they'll be putting in additional storage, so they'll put two years of grain aside so they've always got seed to plant. They might put a feedlot on to value-add. I think we need to be very cognisant of and open to accelerated depreciation packages when a farmer is saying, 'I'm doing this part of my business so that I can drive some productivity.'


Ultimately, I would like to see the government having a good discussion with some of the big insurers. I'll just run through this because this is something that I looked at as a farm business at one stage. At one stage I looked at leasing 6,000 acres in Saskatchewan, in Canada, and farming over there. People ask, 'Why would you do that?' The logical answer was: because you get the northern hemispherical risk with the southern hemispherical risk in your grain growing. Not many farmers can look at how they can do that productively in their own business. However, what we're seeing now with companies such as QBE and big insurance companies is that, if you look at like-for-like countries—and the clear ones would be Canada and Australia—you could develop an insurance product that is local but also has a reinsurance component by a company such as QBE, and you could actually get a global insurance company. Their input in that would bring the premium prices down quite substantially. There is some really quite practical stuff that we can be doing in insurance products, in assistance to farmers and in assistance through drought.


Can I touch on one of the other things that were substantially beneficial for me as a farmer throughout the drought of 2002 and the drought of 2006, 2007 and 2008—the hat-trick drought, as I call it. I remember my father, who had farmed all his life, said: 'You only ever get in our area one drought in a row; you never get two. Always the second year is a good year.' That theory was blown in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It's very humbling to have worked as hard as you can physically work and at the end of three years realise that if you'd done nothing for three years you would have actually had a better life and made more money.


The one thing that has helped us has been the opening up of markets. I think this is something we need to be very careful about, and it is something this place actually can benefit from. I'll give an example of that. In 2002, even though we had fairly skinny sheep, we were still able to sell those sheep for up to $100 a head. In 1992 we were shooting sheep. You couldn't give them away. People say, 'What is the difference?' The difference is this: in 1992 Australia was exporting sheepmeat to 12 countries, and in 2002 we were exporting sheepmeat to 96 countries. So opening up market opportunities is perhaps one of the most important things this place can do to build resilience in our farming sector. Ultimately, the greater utilisation of that carcass—with hearts and livers and bits and pieces out of the carcasses being airlifted across to the Middle East—put an underlying floor in the prices that farmers could get. If you looked to the mixed farming area that I was in, the one thing that sustained them through the drought years was that at least one part of their commodity was getting very good prices. We talk about farm household assistance; we talk about insurance products; we talk about accelerated depreciation for infrastructure on farm; and we talk about things that can be done in the way of loans and those sorts of things, but that factor of opening up markets must always be well stated.


The other thing that we've substantially done—and it has been the role of government to assist this—has been building major water pipeline infrastructure projects. In my patch is the largest pipeline system in the world. People may not be aware of that. The Wimmera Mallee Pipeline was from a combination of the Victorian Labor government and the federal government. You can actually go to nearly every paddock across a third of the state of Victoria, and every paddock's got a tap on it and you can turn the water on. We've got two more projects we want to get funded: the East Grampians pipeline and the Mitiamo pipeline. We're funding the Loddon pipeline at the moment, with $20 million from the federal government and a contribution of $40 million from the Victorian Labor government. Those things have been very interesting because, call it climate change or call it what you will, we are seeing that areas that used to run a lot of livestock and that rely on catchment dams—where, essentially, it would rain and the water would wash into the dams—have had dam evaporation rates higher than they have had and less ability to hold water than they have had. So the ability to run poly pipe for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres has revolutionised the farming systems. It's opened up opportunities for BASF, formally Bayer, with a research facility in Horsham, which is the only canola genetics research facility in the Southern Hemisphere. It's opened up intensive animal husbandry such as Luv-a-Duck, which is processing 90,000 ducks a day. It's opened up opportunities for feedlotting lambs. It has been a substantial thing.


If you want to look at policies that can address drought communities, they are a combination of water infrastructure, trade policies and getting the settings right around loans, farm management deposits and insurance products. I just want to touch on one other issue that's also very relevant to this policy, and it's something that worked reasonably well in 2002 and in 2006, 2007 and 2008, and that has been assistance with rates. One of the things we've always found when it is dry is that the capacity for a farmer to pay their rates has been substantially diminished. Farmers pay a large burden of the rates in our country shires. Some of those rates can be $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000. There have been rate subsidies of 50 per cent which have also been a significant help. Those rates subsidies not only helped the farmers but also helped the rural community, because they meant that the shire had money coming in. If there's one thing we have learnt when it comes to dealing with drought, it is that you also have to remember that there's a rural community that has to have money stimulating it.


There's much to be done in the drought space. There's more leadership to be had. There are many good ideas out there that we can learn from other parts of the world. But this is something that we must tackle, because if there's one thing we know about Australia it is that it is raining sometimes and it is dry sometimes and it will always be that way.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (18:00):  Have you heard the news today—news of the continued fighting in the Turnbull government's cabinet over the National Energy Guarantee; news that the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, will cross the floor on this issue if he doesn't get his way; news about the Turnbull government's incessant campaign to lock in massive corporate tax cuts for business? We could wind back the calendar a day, a week or a month and revisit the headlines and see this pattern ad nauseam, a pattern where an out-of-touch government puts its political priorities ahead of the interests of ordinary Australians, a pattern where the government is increasingly paralysed by party room dysfunction, a pattern where the Prime Minister's grasp on the leadership becomes more tenuous with each and every Newspoll.


Meanwhile, the people of Australia couldn't really give a toss about most of it. To be frank, they're fed up. They are fed up with the government's obsession with itself, at the expense of all Australians, and fed up with a government that seems to want to serve the top end of town while the rest of us hang out and hang on, desperate to try to pay for clothes and shoes for our children and desperate to try to pay the ever-increasing energy bills. They really just want some leadership and policies.


Nothing could be closer to this than this bill on farm household support. I'm glad that the government has decided to support our farming families and extend the farm household allowance by one year, from three to a maximum of four cumulative years. But I ask why this has taken so long. I spoke in the chamber yesterday about my anger that it has taken Prime Ministers Turnbull and Abbott and agriculture ministers Joyce and Littleproud an unacceptable and indeed unforgiveable amount of time to act on this. I spoke about the great hardships that have been experienced by farming families in my electorate of Paterson for many months. Vegetable farmers were unable to grow crops due to hot and arid conditions, tanks were bone dry and salinity levels in the depleted rivers made irrigation impossible. Beef farmers were forced to handfeed and spend exorbitant amounts of time and money on water cartage to prevent stock deaths due to dehydration. The livelihood of our milk producers in my electorate was further threatened by the unavailability of water, which made sanitation of their dairies almost impossible and really incredibly difficult. Carefully crafted bloodlines of really prized animals were unceremoniously sent to market or to the slaughterhouse because it was financially impossible for farmers to keep them alive.


I remind the honourable members opposite that this situation did not suddenly spring up at the beginning of the month when the Prime Minister decided to conduct the whistlestop selfie tour of the big dry. We have properties and communities in New South Wales and Queensland that have been paralysed by drought for the last seven years. So, while my colleagues and I on this side of the House do not decline to give the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 a second reading, there are some points that really do need to be made and called out on.


I support the member for Hunter's call for an amendment to the motion that notes the Turnbull government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farming families and, more broadly, the agricultural sector, because this faffing around is nothing new from this Prime Minister and the cohort he has around him. The Turnbull government has a penchant for selectively pursuing legislation that promotes its political agenda at the expense of everything else. Time and time again, the people of Australia are left waiting for this government to govern.


In my electorate of Paterson, where the community of Williamtown is ground zero in Australia's PFAS contamination nightmare, my constituents have been pleading for nigh on three years for this Prime Minister and the members of his cabinet to do something—to publish their anticipated report, to honour their avowed commitments to release their promised policy and to offer a pathway out of the living nightmare my constituents have been trapped inside since 4 September 2015. Yes, there are critical matters that this government could turn its attention towards. But no; far too much energy is spent pandering to the bloke who's going to throw his toys out of the pram if he doesn't get his way or pandering to the pork-barrelling former minister feathering his own electorate nest. This government has had years to put in place a structure that would have helped these farmers, right now, to make a living. It could have provided advice and support for those who aim to droughtproof their operations over the long term. It could have helped farming families make that difficult call about whether they can or cannot make a quid out of farming, given the changed market conditions and ever more volatile climatic extremes, and it could have offered pathways and retraining for people who choose to leave the land. The government could have used the SCoPI process to put these supports in place. It could have done this some time ago and it did not, and that is a disgrace. And now our farming families are meant to rejoice that the government has seen fit to extend household assistance for a further 12 months. Yes, it is something but, as I said yesterday, it's nowhere near enough. It's a small sticking plaster on a gaping wound.


Our farming families are an important part of Australia's agricultural landscape and the fabric of our nation. Elsewhere in our agricultural sector we have primary producers and those who rely on them stuck in limbo waiting for the government to act. My electorate of Paterson is home to beef farmers, dairy farmers, fishers, prawners and oyster growers. They work incredibly hard, and times have been tough. I've spoken before in the House to share the plight of my constituents, who suffered through the driest season in 80 years—stock farmers who were forced to sell or face exorbitant hand-feeding costs. Even water came at a premium in terms of both time and cartage, and, if the tanks weren't dry, as I mentioned earlier, the salinity levels in the river were as high as some farmers had ever seen them. Vegetable farmers just watched entire crops fail.


In the face of the uncontrollable challenges of climate and weather, we owe it to our farming families to appropriately support their industry and, in turn, their livelihoods. We should be turning our brightest agricultural minds to this and saying, 'How can we make this better for those people who work so hard every day and who really have been the best in the world?' It is completely unacceptable that the Turnbull government continues to fail Australian farmers and agricultural industries through legislative delays. Right now, Prime Minister Turnbull and the members opposite have amassed quite a stockpile of outstanding bills while they attempt to ram home their own agenda. This is patently not good enough. The people of Australia are looking to Prime Minister Turnbull and his government to do precisely that: govern in the interests of those who saw fit to elect them. Instead they wait and they wait and they wait some more. I might just add that I find it particularly disappointing that members of the National Party always talk about being agrarian socialists, say that they just want to do the best by the bush, and say that they want to support the agricultural sectors—well, I think that they've put their hands up and stood on the wrong side of the House in many votes and particularly—




Mr Katter:
  They are not agrarian socialists. They are definitely not. I am!




Ms SWANSON:
  I will take that interjection: perhaps you are, but we could do with some more of those. The Turnbull government has made a considered choice to prioritise parliamentary business ahead of our farmers and agricultural industries. It seems to find all the time and press releases and media opportunities in the world to promote the corporate tax cuts for big business, yet this parliament is headed for a six-week-long break at the end of this sitting, and critical legislation will need to wait until August to be even considered—such as the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill, also known as agvet chemicals legislation.


This innocuous-sounding piece of legislation is actually tied up with the infamous APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, where we saw the member for New England relocate a government authority to his own electorate in a case of blatant pork-barrelling. The agvet bill involves minor amendments, mostly technical, that should assist with streamlining APVMA operations. But it should be no surprise that, after the debacle of its forced relocation, APVMA is now on life support—its current financial position is reportedly untenable, as is its technological infrastructure. So not only are industry stakeholders waiting to have the agvet bill passed; the Prime Minister has decided that APVMA is in need of a governance board, which, of course, will require an amendment to the bill in the Senate. What does that mean for our constituents? It actually means more waiting, because a former minister of the Turnbull government put his own interests ahead of the country's. 


There are a number of other examples of this government prioritising its political game-playing ahead of our farmers and the agricultural industry. There was the decision to pull the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill, and the Export Control Bill has been lost in transit since it was briefly debated in the Senate earlier this year. And, in a matter very much in the interests of my constituents in Paterson, there is the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018. 


I first met Sue and Rob Hamilton when their family prawning operation was shut down in 2015 when the RAAF Base Williamtown PFAS scandal broke out. That's right: we had professional prawners whose businesses were closed. The Hamiltons and other commercial fishers working Tilligerry Creek and Fullerton Cove were stripped of their livelihoods when it was discovered that firefighting chemicals PFOS and PFOA had leeched from the base into the waterways of our community. This is an absolute reality. Fishing bans lasted 12 months. This took a toll on many families like the Hamiltons and other fishers in Paterson. The Hamiltons battled through, however, and returned to the water and their industry. 


Sue contacted me again in October last year to raise her concerns about the prevalence of white spot syndrome, a virus that is imported in green prawns. Importation of the prawns had been suspended following an outbreak of the virus in commercial prawn farms in Queensland and then around the wild prawns in Logan River and Moreton Bay. It had spread. Sue reached out to me after the then Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, lifted the suspension on the importation of green prawns into Australia. Sue was concerned because white spot is a massive deal. It leads to a highly lethal and contagious viral infection. Outbreaks have been known to wipe out the entire populations of prawn farms in days. The virus is not dangerous to humans and it is killed when the prawn is cooked, but the Aussie tradition of putting a green prawn on a hook and throwing a line in puts our waterways and our seafood industry at risk. Sue and her husband, Rob, still reeling from the year-long PFAS shutdown of their family business, were incensed by the biosecurity issues that remained in play even after the importation ban was lifted. And it's no wonder: the situation was and is nonsensical. 


As a matter of fact, the failings highlighted by Sue and Rob were exposed in 2016, two years ago, and legislation to shore up those biosecurity failings and breaches is still yet to pass this parliament. We have a precedent where imported prawns infected Australian wild prawns and prawn farms. The Australian wild prawning areas and prawn farms were slapped with a ban. Meanwhile, the ban on the very source of white spot, the imported green prawns, was lifted. In what universe does that make sense? 


We must have a system that is able to respond quickly to biosecurity failings and breaches. This is why the government must prioritise legislation that will strengthen our biosecurity system. This bill was introduced into the House in March this year and received Labor's support. That was three months ago, and that's a lot of water under the bridge—metaphorically and literally. 


Three months, however, pales in comparison to the length of time our farming families have waited for the government to take any meaningful action towards long-term drought reform. More than four years ago, Labor supported the government's Farm Household Support Bill. This was the product of a 2013 Standing Committee on Primary Industries—otherwise known as SCoPI—meeting which continued to commit to the previous Labor government's commitment to provide a new, nationally agreed approach to drought. It's now 2018. The intergovernmental agreement on drought reform, of which farm household support is part, will expire on 1 July this year. That is literally days away, yet our farming families wait for a plan that is fit for the future. The Prime Minister and his colleagues must park their self-interests and put the ordinary folk of Australia ahead of the select few at the top end of town. We must insist that this government that seems increasingly out of touch put the interests of ordinary Australians front and centre.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (18:15):  It's always fun to follow on from Labor when they're talking about agriculture and water issues. We're talking about drought through New South Wales and Queensland. It's a very serious issue. If Labor had their way, they'd have a man-made drought. They'd follow the Greens down the path of handing all the water in the Murray-Darling Basin back to the environment. They'd have a water crisis in the Goulburn Valley. They'd have a water crisis throughout the Murrumbidgee. They'd have a water crisis down throughout the lower reaches of the Murray River. They'd have a water crisis made by politicians. They'd have a water crisis that's fake. They would inflict that pain gladly on the people down the Murray-Darling Basin just by carrying out their policies—their policies that they are very proud of when they come into this House. In relation to looking after our farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley, we spend most of our time fighting Labor and their ridiculous stance on water policy. So it's a bit tough when we have the Labor Party come in and want to lecture us about how we should be doing more for our farmers when their own policies would see many of our farmers unable to carry on the farming practices that they have done for two, three or four generations—ever since we've had irrigation throughout the Goulburn Valley and the Goulburn region.


This support package, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, is critically important. I was able to see firsthand how important this sort of assistance package is during the milk crisis that took place in the early months of 2016, when Murray Goulburn announced that it was going to drastically cut the price of milk. It was quickly followed by Fonterra and many of the other processors. Not only did they cut their prices for milk into the future but they then requested this ridiculous clawback where they wanted the money that farmers had, in their opinion, been overpaid. They wanted tens of thousands and, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars repaid to the processors. This put so many of the dairy farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley and Victoria in an incredibly tough position. With the little that they were being paid for milk in those months, it was virtually impossible for them to process milk for the cost that they were able to sell the milk. This put them in a ridiculously tough position. Many of them were forced to park their cattle in different locations where they didn't have to rely on irrigation water. They had to take the charity of hay that was brought down from other parts of the nation to assist them with their feed. More than anything, they simply had to plough on. They had to get out of bed at 4.30 or five o'clock in the morning, milk the cows in the morning and milk them again in the evening, knowing that they were financially going backwards all the time to the tune of many thousands of dollars per week.


I must acknowledge the previous Leader of the Nationals Barnaby Joyce on his role during that milk crisis. He went immediately down to the Goulburn Valley to talk to and meet with the dairy farmers, the milk producers and the processors. He was there to immediately offer this support with the farm household allowance and to immediately offer low-interest loans, which were picked up. Yes, there were problems with the extent of the forms that needed to be filled out. But, when you think about the many hundreds of thousands of dollars of commercial loans that the government was effectively taking over, offering security for those properties was a very complex issue. We were able to act and to try to put in some assistance for many of these farmers during these very stressful times.


It's an issue that gets lost often when we're talking about these times of drought and the milk crisis, where production costs rise above the farm gate milk prices. The traditional farmer in that situation is under an enormous amount of stress and financial pressure, and mental health becomes a very important issue that needs to be dealt with very carefully. This is where, again, the counsellors from rural finance come in—mediation counsellors and people who are able to help with the financial restructuring and to help the farmers fill out many of these applications.


The big message that we were telling our farmers was: 'Do not self-assess. Make sure you get the help that you need so that you can have independent people come in and look at your books and your business and, in relation to other pieces of off-farm income that may have been coming into the household, see whether or not you are able to access part or all of the just under $2,000 per couple per month at the maximum.' Effectively, just in the area of the farm household support, that is putting about $23,000 to $24,000 per year on the table for those families. When you read that in conjunction with access to a low-interest loan—again, the former minister was able to make these low-interest loans available for up to half of your loan—we found that many people were taking advantage of that as well, and the combined saving was somewhere in the vicinity of $50,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for government to help those farming businesses that have the capacity to see their way through this to a fruitful future in the following years, and that's the way it has been.


The dairy industry now has improved markedly. There are still many farmers out there that are really doing it tough, and there is no set model of a dairy farmer at the moment. If someone were to ask you, 'How's dairy going at the moment?' you can't really answer that question, because the models within the dairy farming structures are so diverse and so different. If a farmer in the Goulburn Valley owns their own water, that's an enormous benefit, an enormous plus. Obviously the debt profile of the various farmers makes a huge difference. Their ability to produce their own hay and feed also makes a very big difference to the economic viability of our farmers. All of these factors swirling around together will somehow or other give you a profile as to how our dairy farmers are going. As I said, they are just so diverse and so different. It is very difficult.


But this bill is now going to show the benefits of this farmer support package. The benefits to these households are going to be extended for another 12 months, and it's a fantastic thing that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, has been able to push through. As I said just recently, the right thing to do for the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Mark Coulton, along with the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, was to tour those outback regions of New South Wales and Queensland to make sure that they see firsthand what seven years of below-average rainfall has meant for those areas from northern Victoria up into Queensland.


I have been speaking to quite a few farmers about farm household support and farm household allowance recently, and I just want to quote one farmer who spoke to me just recently and said:


As a farmer directly impacted by the Murray Goulburn Milk price drop in April 2016, the effects have been long lasting. The impacts on cash flow have been long and unrelenting.


Being able to access the Farm Household Allowance during this time has provided some breathing space and peace of mind knowing that assistance with reduced cash flows; you can put food on the table each week and provide the essentials for your family, while you attempt to rebuild your business.


Our assigned case manager has been very supportive through the process over the past 2 years in assessing our situation, providing guidance and developing a plan for the future.


This is the part that often gets left behind. Yes, we are helping initially with farm household support by putting some cash on the table to help pay for groceries, for school fees and the essential bills. We are helping out in the medium to longer term also with the low-interest loans that can be worked into a business to take up to 50 per cent of outstanding loans. The case managers from Rural Finance are put in the business as well to give them the support they need with counselling. They have that financial acumen introduced into the farming business as well to see where their future lies. In the message I received that was hugely appreciated.


It is great when you come into this place and see these genuine benefits. We're helping these people and making a real difference. This is a practical situation. We are making a difference to these people who are in a very tough position at the moment. They needed this support. Some of these three-year periods of drought are coming to an end. Now it's going to be extended for a further 12 months. This, along with farm management deposits, gives us an opportunity to help people get themselves through really tough times. 


This is something we in the National Party are really supportive of. It's fantastic that many people have seen the worst of the dairy crisis and are now working through it and can see a bright future. There are still many others who, with their water costs and debt profile, are in a very precarious situation. It would be a good thing if they could produce milk at a price below what they are paid for it. Certainly the 830-odd farmers who were assisted through the dairy crisis have been very appreciative. Hopefully, this is something that they will look back on and say: 'Thank goodness the government of the day understood what was needed and were able to move quickly and give us the assistance they gave us so that we got through the very toughest of times. They put counselling around us so that we could in a calm and measured way assess our future and either exit the industry with assets intact or push ahead and create a more promising future.'


I commend this bill to the House. I certainly hope that these measures are there for the next crisis, because we know that when you live in Australia you are always going to have crises when it comes to farming practices.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (18:28):  At the beginning of my remarks on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 I want to correct the record on something that the member for Murray said in relation to Labor's approach to the Murray-Darling Basin and our history on reaching a bipartisan approach to the management of the Murray-Darling. It was a former Labor government that ended the water wars, the dispute between the states, and that brought the states together and actually implemented the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. You can tell that the member for Murray didn't actually live in the electorate of Murray during the water wars and the crisis, because he would have remembered that the Murray was actually dry. Farmers didn't actually have access to the water he stood up and said that Labor stole from his farmers. We all accept that he was involved in football and was off playing or coaching AFL, but he shouldn't stand up here and mislead the House and say that it was Labor who stole the water off the farmers during that millennium drought when there was no water. The Murray was dry. It was that crisis that triggered Labor to work with the states to reach a bipartisan position to end the water wars and restore the health of the Murray.


The health of the Murray is critical to farmers. We know that. We understand that. Labor continue to work with agricultural industries and communities on ensuring that: the next generation of farmers, and the generation after, have access to water for agriculture over the long term; our environment has the water it needs to regenerate; all states have their fair share; and, most importantly, the Murray-Darling system is healthy.


That's not the only area where the government is failing agriculture and our farmers. They've become known as the government that likes to talk, to meet and to tinker around the edges. They're also a government that likes to smash things and blow things up in some ways, and we've seen that countless times from this government in agriculture. In the area of labour this government is failing to ensure farmers have not just a seasonal workforce but a skilled workforce, ready to plant and harvest crops in the regions, so that the agricultural industry continues to be viable.


Labour is one of the big issues raised with me by farm organisations throughout this country. Only this afternoon I met with Voice of Horticulture, who are furious and frustrated with this government for its failure to crack down on migrant worker exploitation and, more importantly, close existing tax loopholes that allow these dodgy firms to thrive. We talked about the need to restrict access to ABNs. This is part of Labor Party policy. If we stopped international students and backpackers from accessing ABNs then they would be less likely to be exploited or to start a labour-hire business and exploit other people here on temporary arrangements. It's becoming less rare that Voice of Horticulture stand side by side with Labor on a policy announcement, yet nobody in the government says that is possible to do or believes there is a need to do it.


When it comes to labour, the government is also failing to ensure our TAFEs in the regions have courses that meet the needs of farmers and the agricultural industry. TAFEs throughout the regions have been gutted. That has been driven by the massive funding cuts state and federal Liberal governments have imposed on the vocational education and training sector. That has left a skills gap in the regions, and more and more farmers in our agricultural industry are looking to 457 visa holders and backpackers to fill those gaps. They say to me on a regular basis that, if a local were available, they would hire a local. They want people to live and work in the regions, but local workers simply don't have the skills to do so. That is such a shame when we look at the youth unemployment rate, which is at 19 or 20 per cent in some of these regional areas. We have the young people; we just need to give them the skills and the opportunities and to match them to existing farming and agricultural jobs.


This government is also failing to support farmers and the agricultural sector when it comes to innovation. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with strawberry farmers in South-East Queensland who, off their own bat, have decided to introduce tabletop strawberry farming, where it's off the ground. They're among the first to do this in Australia. That means they're using fewer chemicals to keep pests off their crops. It also means that, because they are now off the ground, they are more water efficient and have higher yields.


If you're in Coles and see Taste 'N See strawberries, pick them up, because they are an example of innovation within the strawberry industry. This government did nothing to support them in doing that. These growers, knowing that there would be a change in the chemicals that they could use, got in front. They wanted to increase their yield, but they knew that the quality of their soil was such that it would really start to diminish the returns on their crops. They had to go to the banks and argue for finance to introduce this new capital, this new farming technology—and they're glad they did so. They're hoping to get a return on that capital. They're also employers. As farmers, they directly employ all of their staff. That's another reason why you should buy their strawberries. They are not alone when it comes to saying that too often this government is looking backwards, sticking on bandaids, only moving a few steps forward, being reactionary and not out there driving the innovation, the productivity and the investment in our agricultural industries.


When it comes to exports, this government is failing. For all of its championing of the free trade agreement—oops, it forgot about the non-tariff barriers, which are killing our agricultural industries when it comes to exports. It doesn't matter whether it's wine, which is a big part of my world, or it's our horticultural produce or it's our red-meat exports, non-tariff barriers are blocking our ability to expand export markets and therefore expand farm gate prices.


This government is also failing farmers and agricultural industries when it comes to climate change. Our farmers recognise that our climate is changing. You hear every day and you learn every day about the amazing innovative projects that our farmers are embracing in a whole range of areas to improve their productivity and water efficiency to adapt to climate change. Whether it be greater use of the NBN and mobile technology or it be improving their cropping and crop rotations, our farmers get that the climate is changing. They want to continue to be productive and profitable on the land, and so they want to see innovation, partnership, coordination and leadership from the government in this space.


The reason why I mention climate change is that it is linked to drought. This is where we get to talk about how this government has spectacularly failed on drought mitigation and drought reform. Under Labor, there was an approach through COAG where we brought the states together to say that we need to start investing and delivering long-term drought policy. We said: 'Let's actually do the research. Let's actually look at what we are farming. How can we farm better? How can we droughtproof our industries going forward? How can we mitigate the effects of drought?' When this government came into office, it did a classic thing and abolished that entire approach. It has not been picked up since Labor was last in government. It is not being dealt with. In fact, the government has just shelved it. People in the government don't even believe in climate change, let alone believe in tackling the effects that climate change is having on drought.


When it comes to the farm household assistance legislation before us, the government is, as with so many approaches that it takes, literally just tinkering at the edges. I remember when this legislation was first introduced. We used to have a rural financial counselling service in my electorate of Bendigo—before this government abolished it and sacked all of those people—and, shortly after this legislation was introduced, they came to me and said: 'We're meeting with farmers, and they're really frustrated because they're not meeting the criteria. The criteria are too rigid, and they're struggling to get the paperwork forms approved by Centrelink in the period of time before they would have to start the paperwork all over again.' It took many of them almost 12 months to get access to the loans. All of us might remember how the minister at the time had to come in here and correct his answer, and then he corrected the Hansard, because of comments that he had made in relation to this. It is an issue where the government has really dropped the ball. Yes, I'm sure farmers will welcome an extra year when it comes to the farm household support; however, it's not enough. It's not a long-term solution. It's not an ongoing solution. It doesn't really work with people to resolve the broader problems and challenges that we're facing in horticulture, in agriculture and in our farming industries.


The previous speaker and other members have spoken about concessional loans. I've never met a farmer yet who wants to take on more debt if they're drowning in debt. Most of them are saying, 'We've got to do better than this.' Farmers who are doing well, who innovate, might be willing to risk extra debt because they can see light at the end of the tunnel. But, if you're already drowning under a mountain of debt and if you've already got the banks coming after you, more debt is not what you're interested in. While we're talking about debt, we also need to remind the House about the disaster which is the government's newest creation: the Regional Investment Corporation, which we think will be in Bathurst; they don't quite have an office yet. Media reports are that they were meeting on a park bench to talk about their organisation starting. I'm not quite sure we want financial decisions from an investment corporation meeting in a park or on a park bench, particularly given that we have Rural Finance based in Victoria now managed by the Bendigo Bank, a sound financial institution that has been doing this kind of work for many years here in Australia. This is who the government wants to take work away from—the Bendigo Bank and Rural Finance—and give it to the Regional Investment Corporation, which at the moment doesn't have an office and which is meeting on a park bench. This is another example of just how hopeless this government is when it comes to the agricultural industry. Whether it be farm household assistance loans, whether it be in relation to financing, whether it be policy around labour hire, whether it be policy and implementation on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, whether it be around innovation and embracing innovation in our farm industries or whether it be about abolishing or working to abolish non-tariff barriers or about climate change, this government is really failing to support Australian farmers in our agricultural industries.


The amendment that has been moved by the member for Hunter allows people on this side to call the government out for its rhetoric. The government has to do more than just extend a welfare payment from three years to four years. Our farmers want to be innovative. They want to exist into the future. They need a government that will work with them and provide leadership, not just more tinkering at the edges.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (18:43):  I'm pleased to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. In listening to speakers on both sides of the House, I cannot help but observe the political nature of this debate, even though there's broad acceptance that it's not a particularly political issue—it's not. Farmers who may be tuned into the proceedings—and I'm sure most of mine would not be—would probably be pretty scathing in their assessment of the way that many members of this place have approached this debate. If I consider a man in my electorate who was awarded at the recent Queen's Birthday honours, Brendan Farrell, he has physically and mentally exhausted himself, as have many of the people around him, in order to transport hay from our region to western Queensland. He's very critical of politicians. He acknowledged that the government has recently increased some drought relief measures, but called for further assistance, mainly relating to hefty freight costs. Brendan heard about a farmer in the New South Wales town of Bourke struggling with drought, and that galvanised him into action. He has now completed more than 11 hay runs to help the drought-affected farmers across New South Wales and Queensland. He has noted that it's an emotional rollercoaster: 'One minute you're laughing, the next minute you're bawling your eyes out. You can be standing there with people and their kids, just talking about how much it will take to get better.' Brendan Farrell has been doing this for 4½ years, assisting struggling farmers around the country. He was driven by a desire to simply lend a hand. I'm sure he treats his Queen's Birthday honour with the larrikin disrespect that we would expect from an Australian of his stature.


I want to bring something of his spirit and his attitude to this debate this evening because this is not a political issue and, unfortunately, so many people in this place treat drought and legislation as something that's—I won't say going wrong in our farming communities, because drought is part of a way of life and a farming way of life. They think there's something that must be done; it's all about what we do in here. Do we tinker around the edges, as the previous speaker said? Do we add more money, as we did during the millennium drought, in huge quantities that we no longer have? Do we put more personnel on the ground? Of course, we do many of these things, and so we should, particularly around mental health and support, but governments can't always make it better, and it's very important to recognise that.


Certainly climate change is biting in rural Australia. Certainly it is in rural New South Wales and in my electorate of Farrer. I can remember people who talked about water flows in the Darling River, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee—I represent substantial parts of those three great river systems—reflecting on how much less water there is. When we talk about the environment and irrigators, we also have to factor climate change in. The extremes of temperature are more noticeable. If you talk to the old timers, you certainly get a long and pretty consistent narrative. I remember the late Peter Cullen, who was a hero in environmental water circles. I clashed with him on many occasions, being very much on the side of the irrigators. I remember him saying Australia has more than 40 years of wetter-than-average temperatures followed by 40 years of drier-than-average temperatures. Clearly that pattern is persisting, but within those broad blocks of years the extremes are getting greater. We are going to be confronted with drought and we are going to be confronted with the necessity to support our farmers.


I'm very pleased that I believe this government has a strong and supportive drought assistance policy. We must work more closely with state governments, of course, because farmers don't notice the difference. The No. 1 thing they are calling for in my electorate is freight subsidies. I talked about Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, and that's what they do—they pick up hay and they transport it north from farmers who donate it. Members of the community donate the money to allow that to happen. Freight subsidies are vital because that's what you're doing—you're moving fodder to animals and keeping your breeding stock going because, if you lose your breeding stock, you lose a lot of heart.


I've been a farmer myself for 17 years, through some of the worst droughts and the worst times on the land. There were some highs in there as well, although sometimes, looking back, I find it harder and harder to find them. I remember reading a Time international article talking about the Australian drought, when it didn't often talk about Australia at all. There was a quote on the back page from somebody in rural Australia saying, 'You can't send a man out day after day to shoot his stock.' I cut that page out and pinned it on the wall of the office. I looked at it every day because the last thing I wanted was to go out and shoot stock. Eventually, with the price crash for sheep, that's exactly what happened, but it wasn't necessarily in the context of a drought.


I represented western New South Wales during 10 years of the hardest drought we have ever seen, with dust storms and heartache. I can remember visiting properties where people had destocked. You would think that once you had destocked, you could then put everything in a holding pattern because you didn't have to worry about your stock dying and you didn't have to worry about transporting them away or transporting feed in. But, interestingly enough, what actually happened to farmers when they destocked and lost their stock was that they suddenly felt completely irrelevant; they'd lost the reason to get up in the morning. It had an extraordinarily negative affect.


We had some amazing rural financial counsellors in my electorate during that time. I want to mention Brian Dodson, who was one of them. He's still well known. You're only supposed to deal with the finances, but he was there for every single member of a farming family. They didn't want to talk to someone they didn't know about personal problems—it gets very personal—so they talked to him. I'm sure he crossed the line a few times when it came to the engagement that he was supposed to have. But he was there when he was needed, because when you have to make the tough decisions—and we talk about the tough decisions—they are extraordinarily difficult to make.


We, as a government, probably spent a billion dollars in interest rate subsidies for exceptional circumstances interest rate relief and household support during that drought. That was an extraordinary transfer of funds from taxpayers to farmers. If you look back on what happened to that money and where it went, an awful lot went to the banks. I would regularly challenge them with, 'What are you going to do about it, because you're getting your payments made where, in different circumstances, you would be writing them off?' A lot went to the banks. A lot went to farmers who subsequently didn't make it.


The difficult thing with farming is that, when you're well set up and you've worked hard to give yourself a buffer, it's not just about hard work. A lot of it is luck. If you don't have a huge amount of debt and you're not a young farmer, then clearly you're going to be better prepared for a drought. A lot of it was: 'I've done all of the things that I'm supposed to do, and I don't qualify for any drought support because my partner works off-farm and I've got too many assets.' There was genuine annoyance from some of the farmers when they saw others who, in their view, might not have prepared so well or might not have run their properties so well, or whose farm programs were effectively getting quite a lot of government support. It did create divides in rural communities, and that was unfortunate.


If our objective, as a government, is to sustain the rural sector, then there isn't any point in large transfers of funds to people who ultimately don't stay in the rural sector, whose properties get bought out. But there certainly is a point in supporting those families from a human perspective, making sure that they have time to adjust, to properly exit their properties and to do so with dignity and move on to another stage of their lives. Certainly, the drought support did that. I would run into those individuals in the towns of Western New South Wales and North-Western Victoria quite regularly and realise that they'd left their farms behind. Sometimes they had been fourth- or fifth-generation farmers, and they were fine. It always surprised me a little. I'm not saying that all of them were fine. There were two things that made them fine. One was that they actually had sold their properties for good money. No matter how tough it got, the value of land didn't go down—we don't expect that, and it's very difficult to see that that could happen in the current situation. They sold and they got paid a good sum of money, and the next thing they did actually validated their purpose in life—they had something to get up in the morning and do. Often it was working at an engineering shop or working for a rural services industry that supported farms, so their extraordinary knowledge about farming and the rural sector was put to really good use. It is the sort of knowledge that they used every day but never realised had a value.


So there is always light at the end of the tunnel, but the task for government is to make sure that we put the supports in place. Whether that be rural financial counselling—we've expanded the service and we have good rural financial counsellors in my electorate. I just want to talk about the local situation. Griffith and Hay have had no rainfall this month and very little for the previous three months, so it is critical that the government assists farmers and rural communities during these times of hardship. The Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme, the farm household allowance, the Managing Farm Risk Program, the Rural Financial Counselling Service and so on support the effects for farmers and managing—it might be pest animals; it might be weeds in drought-affected areas; and it might be financial preparedness.


The farm household allowance, which is the subject of this bill, was launched in July 2014, and it has helped more than 7,900 people, which is pretty good. It's essentially an adjustment payment that comes with free financial counselling, through the Rural Financial Counselling Service, to help farmers restructure their businesses. The amendments that we are moving today include an extension from three to four years of the time that these services are available, which is a more appropriate time frame to assist farmers when they might need to transition to get back on their feet. It has been pretty scary for some of them. Many, I have to say, who have been the recipients of government support year after year after year have recently been told by their financial counsellors: 'Actually, that's it. There isn't anything left.' So this extra year is very valuable. I want to give a shout out to those rural financial counsellors: Darren Macartney at Hay, Graham Christie at Coleambally, Murray Freshwater at Deniliquin, Haidee Laycock, who looks after Griffith and Leeton, Linda McLean at Hillston and Graeme Witte, who's the counsellor at Wentworth.


You think of drought in Australia as being about the wide plains, with dust and no grass growing, and of course it is, but it's also about irrigation water, because, when a drought bites, the requirements for water for irrigated agriculture increase considerably, the reason being that you don't have any prewatering of your pasture. The other tension that enters the equation is that your water allocations—which next month, I suspect, will start off at zero—stay pretty low, so you really have to be concerned about your farm program. If you're an irrigated farmer, you've invested a lot more money, it's a much more intensive operation and you often need activity, which means you need to run a farm program.


With the drought in about 2003, I remember taking the then Prime Minister, John Howard, to Finley. No other Australian Prime Minister had visited Finley before or has done so since. He was incredibly impressed by the people who serviced the rural sector there and the fact that irrigation was different. What we then did was change the rules for the exceptional circumstances program to assist irrigators, recognising that the normal parameters of that program meant they didn't qualify—but they then did. We also added small businesses because John Howard met an incredible woman called Robyn Mott in an accounting service in Finley. She did so many things for the community for nothing, and she made an amazing sponge cake which I'm sure he's never forgotten. He came back and said to Sharman Stone, the then member for Murray, and me, 'We need to find a way to extend this to small businesses as well.'


I use those examples because I know that the government now stands ready to do exactly those things—or not exactly those things but to act in a similar way: to watch closely to see how bad this drought gets. It's creeping from northern New South Wales down into my electorate. You don't say things are bad or worse; it hasn't gone on as long as what we saw in 2003. But, if it does, I know that this government and this parliament will stand ready to assist and take the necessary next steps.


Coming back to Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, he does it without government—he doesn't particularly like politicians—and he does it with the community. The community is always ready to help. So wherever you are in Australia, if you can help and there's an opportunity for you to do that, I encourage you to. I know that so many will step up and support our rural sector.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (18:57):  I would like to acknowledge the contributions from the member for Mallee and the member for Farrer in this debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. There were a lot of important ideas and also observations from their experiences. I think all of us in this chamber who represent farming communities and communities that have lived through these intense drought experiences that we've been seeing multiply and amplify in recent years would really identify with and feel an emotional attachment with a lot of the issues that have been raised and discussed.


But I would say that I am disappointed. I am particularly disappointed in the leadership of the Nationals in these last five years. As soon as a drought passes, it's almost like, 'Rightio, that's over and done with—no need to worry about proper planning for the future anymore.' It takes me back to the old Army golden rule that you always hope for the best but you plan and prepare for the worst.


I don't think any sentient human being now can deny the threat that is being presented to our rural and regional communities by climate change. These circumstances of drought are definitely intensifying, deepening and becoming more variable, with fewer predictable situations. I've often said my region of Eden-Monaro is like the canary in the coalmine in many ways. If you look at, for example, our ski industry in the high country and you go and talk to the Snowy Hydro people, you will see their data is unequivocally showing that the ski seasons are crimping in at both ends, and the snow levels are going higher. We are at risk of losing a $2 billion industry that's half the economy of the Monaro. On top of that, our farmers—including the fruitgrowers over in the Batlow area, the famous Batlow apple growers—really depend on a very predictable weather pattern situation. That has been completely distorted and difficult to do in recent years, and of course the drought affected the high country. It's affecting it right now and putting our farmers in the high country under severe stress. On the coast we have this increasing risk of salination and the like and also changes in rain patterns.


So there's been a lot of intense distress. I'm pleased to say that at least, out of that last big millennial drought, the farmers in the high country formed Monaro Farming Systems and for the first time aggregated. That enabled them to look after each other a bit better and swap more ideas. But, most particularly, it allowed them to work more closely with the CSIRO, who helped develop a modelling tool, called GrassGro, to give them the ability to plan ahead for their properties over a 50-year cycle. It enabled them to do their paddock and beast management and it gave them something to latch onto, which was really important for their mental health.


But what disturbs me is that, when we were in government, we were right on the trailing edges of that millennium drought—2008 and 2009 were particularly bad final years—and we did look at the exceptional circumstances regime. I think everybody would accept that it wasn't satisfactory. In my region, I had some people who were on one side of the boundary of the exceptional circumstances regime experiencing the same weather situation as the people over the other side of the harsh line drawn on the map but not getting exceptional circumstances relief. Again, I had a lot of farmers complaining to me that exceptional circumstances didn't distinguish between successful farmers—good farmers—and farmers who were in trouble not because of drought but because they weren't particularly good farmers. The farmers were raising these issues with me.


As a consequence, we sent this issue to the Productivity Commission, which I think was a good way to look at it. We wanted to really get down to the nitty-gritty of how we were going to handle these droughts at the same time as we were addressing climate change policy. The review that was done by the Productivity Commission also led us to form the intergovernmental agreement using the COAG process, trying to address these issues on a national level, because we couldn't accept the patchiness of the state-by-state approach for a national issue. That led us to form the Standing Committee for Primary Industries and Resources and the Standing Council on Primary Industries—very important mechanisms that were working their way forward. They of course produced the review, which included the Intergovernmental Agreement on the National Drought Program Reform. It made some particularly important findings and comments, including an economic assessment of drought support measures and an assessment of social impacts of drought on farm families and rural communities, using an expert panel and a climatic assessment by the Bureau of Meteorology, and it conducted pilot studies. There was a focus on the relief that's needed and the mechanisms—and we're talking here about the farm household support arrangements as part of what they were reviewing—but more particularly they were looking at the key objectives:


… assist farm families and primary producers adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability—


and—


… encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage their business risks


This is really the key. Most farmers and farming families will tell you that they want to find ways to deal with the challenges they're facing that don't involve just a draw on the taxpayer to get them through these situations; they want to get ahead of the curve.


Added to the situation of trashing those arrangements that we put in place through COAG, which pointed the way of having to develop policy to address that longer-term issue and the management issue of these farms, we've seen more recently, in these last five years, the damage that's been done to the APVMA by the decentralisation policy. We've lost 30 per cent of the scientists in of that organisation. Evidence that we've heard says that the organisation has been set back seven years, and really it's the APVMA that helps design research and implement science into the management of these changed circumstances—how we can deal with managing the different types of pest situations that come from drought conditions. As an example of that, further down in the high country in my region we had a plague of wingless grasshoppers, and the science told us that was largely caused by the dieback situation. The parasitic nematodes that used to keep the numbers of the wingless grasshoppers down were not there because of the loss of forestation in our region, and it led to the plague of wingless grasshoppers that completely devastated farming land in that area. 


All of these are things that the APVMA helps with, and what we've done is cripple it through this decentralisation process. Also, of course, we saw other issues like getting rid of the inspector-general in relation to live exports. We know that is a really serious issue; it's put us back to square one and we're facing revisiting these issues with live exports. Every time we have one of these incidents and those videos, meat consumption goes down. The butchers tell me they can't sell the meat anymore. So there are a whole range of flow-on effects from not getting to grips with these issues, and getting rid of the inspector-general mechanism was a really retrograde step. 


On top of that, we saw the issues that emerged around the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It seems that those growers and the allegations of mishandling and corruption et cetera in the northern edges of the Murray-Darling Basin were more of a priority than those farmers who were living downstream—the farmers all the way through southern New South Wales and South Australia. It didn't seem to matter what was happening to them, whereas, when we were in government, we put a lot of effort into water efficiency measures as a long-term solution to some of these issues. That included the need for farmers to pick up new techniques in irrigation—lining irrigation channels and covering them using pipes et cetera. We heard the member for Mallee talk about that as a step forward in his area. With the issue of drip irrigation, I was in the border portfolio with Senator Wong and we travelled all over the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember visiting an almond grower who had a perfect situation for drip irrigation with permanent plantings, and he said he didn't trust those lines, because he was worried about them getting clogged. Well, Israel—and the rest of the world that has faced these kinds of arid, water management situations—has been very productive and very efficient and has shown good results from adopting those types of techniques. 


Along with what we invested in government in water efficiency measures, there were also a lot of other benefits. We have to make sure that farmers can diversify and insulate themselves against these conditions but also adopt better methods to get through drier times and keep their soils healthy. One of the measures that assisted them that we introduced was the Carbon Farming Initiative. That allowed farmers to get involved with methodologies that would help sequester carbon while at the same time introduce better health to their soils by getting carbon back into their soils. There was a lot of opportunity for them to diversify their income through adopting measures under the Carbon Farming Initiative. One of the things that I was looking at in particular was getting our farmers to aggregate in, perhaps, a forestry co-op where they could have portions of their properties dedicated to re-forestation and have a broker who could organise the whole arrangement of the methodology and approval and give them another stream of income on their property. There were so many possibilities in that Carbon Farming Initiative and in sequestration. 


Now we are seeing good, smart farmers like Charles Massy, a farmer near Cooma in my electorate, who has a PhD and is a very progressive and innovative farmer. We had a great meeting in Yass just a few weeks ago. A lot of farmers from the region turned up to hear about his regenerative farming techniques. We've heard a bit before about natural sequence farming. There's been a bit of controversy about that, but some of it is quite sound in terms of how we rehydrate the soil or maintain or slow down water through the landscape. But, certainly, what Charles Massy has been doing through his regenerative farming techniques is very important. 


It's about government really getting behind the science, the experience and the knowledge and arming farmers with the ability to survive, to prosper and to be able to conduct and plan models for their properties over a long period of time. One of the things that I mentioned last night was the no-till and stubble management approach. All of these things could be included and passed on. I'm fortunate that my family, who have all been dairy farmers for 170 years now down in the Bega Valley, are part of an aggregated farming group in the Bega Cheese co-op, which is now no longer a co-op but still operates like it is. Through that, they formed the Bega environmental management system. They were able to apply Commonwealth funding to develop and improve the management of their environment and to restore health to the soil as well. It also enabled those farmers to communicate with each other and pass on science and ideas. Bega Cheese also helps make sure that that happens through the benefits of its commercial operation and spreading that benefit to farmers.


We saw this so-called listening tour happen just recently, and it didn't go down too well. Obviously they were coming to talk to farmers about issues like farm household support. I welcome the fact that it's been extended by a year, but that still doesn't deliver certainty to these farmers. It seemed from the reports that came back that farmers were singularly unimpressed by what was going on. People like Harry and Jack, who greeted the travelling circus, and John and Joy Haycock at Trangie, for example, were very unimpressed by the visit. I talked about this idea of hoping for the best but planning for the worst. We've seen the reverse of that in some of the approaches taken by this travelling circus. Mr Haycock said he couldn't understand why that leadership group was there if they didn't have anything to announce. He said: 


On Sunday night we had hope, now we know they're going to do nothing, when you take hope away people get desperate, they'd have been better off not coming.


…   …   …


I've voted Nationals all my life at state level, never again.


I think that's one of the reasons why, when I was standing at the Gundagai booth at the Cootamundra by-election, there was a 43 per cent swing away. It was 43 per cent. You can see the erosion. If the Nationals are going to ignore what's going on out there, they will get more of what happened in Orange and more situations like Tumbarumba. Tumbarumba absolutely went red-hot in support of me in the last campaign because of this issue. The Nationals are ignoring what their farmers are saying. In the last big survey of farmers—1,300 farmers in a Farmer Climate Survey—nine in 10 farmers surveyed said they were concerned about damage to the climate and about climate change and 88 per cent of them said they wanted their politicians to do more about it. They really are upset about this. There'll be some argument about what causes climate change and all those sorts of issues, but this is the result of a farmer survey—88 per cent say their politicians should be doing more. They accept that there is climate change and that there should be something done about it.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (19:12):  I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. As the member for Eden-Monaro leaves, I'll say his was quite a thoughtful response until the last three minutes. It's a shame he wrecked it. This bill is in response to the tour that the Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the local government minister, the regional telecommunications minister, the regional health minister and I had through western New South Wales and Queensland a couple of weeks ago. The sad reality is that this drought is really biting. In some places, people have used the household support for the three years that was part of the original requirement for this. This extension will certainly help those people out.


This farm household support is more than just the financial support that helps pay those vital bills, that puts food on the table, that puts tyres on the family car, that pays for the phone and the like. With this support comes assistance from the Rural Financial Counselling Service to help those farms that are in that difficult circumstance come up with a management plan post-drought, whatever that may be, whether it's exiting the industry or restructuring their finances to enable them to continue on. The reports that I'm getting back from the people who have been on this household support—and I think it's now about 7,000 around Australia—have been quite positive. So this extension is a good thing; it is unfortunate that we've got a drought of this magnitude where we needed to do this.


It is interesting that the member for Hunter has some ridiculous amendment attached to this very important piece of legislation. It was his party in government that removed the word 'drought' from the language of government. They were so obsessed with their discussions around climate change and emissions-trading schemes that they changed the word 'drought' to 'dryness' and said, 'This is how Australia's going to be for now and evermore; we just need to get used to it.'


I want to comment on some of the policies that the government has that are really helping people to get through this drought. I understand that many people are in serious financial difficulties, but many aren't—because of the policies that were in the white paper. I'll go through them, and I'll start with the farm management deposits, now $800,000 per farm partner to be put away: they're very useful in helping with the vagaries of the climate. To use the Walgett region as an example: they've had one good year out of four. That good year was a very good year in a cropping region, with very high income for that year through the farm management deposits. They were able to even that income out to help them through the difficult times that they're having at the moment. Another one is the accelerated depreciation for grain storages—hay sheds and silos. That has been very, very popular throughout my electorate, and as I'm driving around I see many new silo complexes and hay sheds where farmers have taken that tax advantage and invested, managing to prepare themselves for the dry times.


The other one is the accelerated depreciation for water and fencing. Particularly in the grazing areas, more in the west of my electorate, those water schemes have enabled a better use of pasture, and farmers have managed to retain their pasture longer into this drought because they've had the water points in more strategic places, rather than central watering points through large dams and whatnot. Another policy that has been of benefit in some areas is the money that has gone into cluster fencing. Late last year, I was at the opening of a 220-kilometre long fence at Gilgunyah, north-west of Condobolin. There are, I think, 10 properties inside the fence that have now been able to manage a lot of the pest animals that were really impacting on their pasture management and also on their animal health, with wild dogs and pigs having an effect on lambing percentages and the like. These are good, practical measures that we have put into place.


The previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro, was talking about the innovation and the good work that farmers are doing, and that's true. When we get into a dry period like this, one of the disappointments is that it looks like farmers are not managing their situation, whereas the clear majority of them are. With the farming techniques that are being used, farmers are growing crops in a climate that their parents and grandparents would not have been able to grow in. The work that's being done with zero-till, and the advances in machinery with disc planters and GPS control—all of those things have enabled farmers to deal with the drier seasonal conditions. As I said, many of the farmers in my area are managing through this.


There were some comments in the previous speeches about the Prime Minister's visit to my electorate in particular. I really think those negative comments don't relate to what I saw on the ground. The farmers were very pleased to see their Prime Minister and a large number of cabinet ministers there. If the Prime Minister had come to my electorate and made an announcement without consulting with anyone, the justifiable criticism would have been: 'No-one came and asked what we wanted. We're getting governed from Canberra.' In the Prime Minister's defence, in my 10 years—and we've had a variety of prime ministers over that period of time—I've never seen a Prime Minister put three days in regional Australia, listening to farmers, not being distracted, taking notes and being completely focused on the serious issue at hand.




Mr Dick:
  What did Tony Abbott do?




Mr COULTON:
  I say what I said—in 10 years I've never seen a Prime Minister do that. I've had other prime ministers from both sides of the House visit my electorate, but not one that was so focused on the issue at hand. That was very well received.


I think that we will look at other issues apart from the farm household support. I think the work around mental health is good. That sometimes is just creating activities as a distraction to get off the farm. I remember the 1990s, when we were going through a particularly dry time. I come to this place with some experience as a farmer dealing with drought. I was a farmer for 33 years before I came here, so I've got some idea what I'm talking about. I remember that in the 1990s in a particularly severe drought a group of my colleagues undertook a beef management course. That was as much about getting together once a week, having a chat and having a few beers afterwards. It was about meeting with each other and talking through our issues and how we were dealing with things. Quite often these mental health programs in the bush are just a way for people to get together as a group and have a yarn. In Warialda a group of men are now doing yoga, believe it or not. Some of my friends would be horrified that I'm letting their secret out. They probably undo at the pub afterwards all the good they do at yoga in becoming more flexible, but it is an outlet for them to get together and work through the issues, because it is a very stressful time.


I do support this important bill. I treat the addition from the member for Hunter with the contempt that it deserves. This is sensible legislation that's needed. I think there's probably more to come as we work our way through this drought. I think there's more work we can do in the fencing space. Those things will keep people busy and improve the management possibilities in those areas. I commend this bill to the House.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (19:23):  I rise to support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. Our farmers make an extraordinary contribution to our national economy and prosperity. In fact, agriculture has been the stand-out sector for the Australian economy in recent times. Our farmers don't have the tariff protections or subsidies that farmers in other countries enjoy. They deal with comparatively high power prices and labour prices, sometimes a high Australian dollar and sometimes low commodity prices. They are extraordinarily resilient, but they are not indestructible. That's why we have to support them through this latest trial—drought.


The drought is certainly biting very hard in central western New South Wales. The paddocks in many areas have turned to dust. It's so bad that parts of the Calare electorate look like a moonscape. The ground is so parched and dry that sometimes it seems like it's literally crying out. Feed is scarce, increasingly expensive and also increasingly expensive to transport to the properties in need, if you can find it.


We can't take our farmers for granted. If we want them here, creating wealth for our nation, we need to be supporting them at the time when they need it most. There are heartbreaking stories in country Australia at the moment. I've heard them as I've met with farmers around the region, from Lithgow to Mudgee, Gulgong, Oberon, Bathurst, Orange, Cumnock, Yeoval and Wellington. The stories are real and they're stories of Australians, our fellow Australians, battling to get through. It's not just the drudgery of feeding every day and checking troughs and dams; there is an immense toll from the uncertainty with respect to what will happen. What's going to happen in the future? What will happen to breeding stock? How will they be fed? The financial uncertainty weighs heavily, as does the uncertainty as to how it will be possible to rebuild once the drought passes.


All over central western New South Wales, as in other parts of Australia, communities are coming together to support each other, but they need a hand. Good intentions are one thing, but our farmers need support on the ground. The outlook, I have to say, is very worrying. If good rain doesn't come, a very bad and grim situation is going to get a whole lot worse in the very near future. The worsening outlook is why we need to be ramping up drought support as the season worsens and the conditions deteriorate. That's why I was very pleased to see the farm household allowance extended. The announcement followed the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources' visit to the central west, where we met with local farmers. It also followed the Prime Minister's tour with the minister to drought-affected areas. In fact, when the minister visited the central west, we stood in a paddock where a crop we were looking at had achieved only a 30 per cent germination rate, and that was one of the good paddocks in the region.


The farm household allowance is an important drought assistance measure which aims at putting food on the table and diesel in the ute when farmers simply don't have enough money for the necessities. It was launched in 2004, and since then almost 8,000 people have been assisted, at a cost of $230 million. In terms of the amount of the assistance itself, you're looking at around $530 to $580 per fortnight for singles and just under $1,000 per fortnight for couples. It helps get farmers through, and it comes with counselling as well, so it is an important assistance measure. It provides the recipients with the opportunity to take steps to improve their circumstances and self-reliance through a farm financial assessment, financial improvement agreement and additional activity supplements of up to $4,000. The program is uncapped and demand driven, so no-one who is eligible will miss out. The fact that it's been extended from three to four years is, I think, a really important move, and it will be widely welcomed in farming communities across the nation.


It is important to note that farmers should not self-assess when thinking about the farm household allowance and how they can apply for it. There are many stories of farmers self-assessing, only to discover later that they are in fact eligible. So I would encourage any farmers out there to reach out to the Department of Human Services via their hotline—I will give it now; it is 1800686175 or 132316—to find out how they can get more assistance.


The federal government is also supporting farmers through the Rural Financial Counselling Service. This is a very important service, and $70 million has been allocated to it from 2016 to 2020 and, indeed, a further $20 million funding boost has just been announced. It helps around 4,500 people every year and it has about 3,000 clients at any given time, with about 130 counsellors around Australia. As I've said, this drought is taking a financial toll, but it is also taking a huge emotional toll. To many farmers with such a grim outlook, it just seems like things are never going to get better. The Rural Financial Counselling Service is there to help, and it does a great job.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (17:14):  I begin my contribution this afternoon by acknowledging the severity of the drought our country currently faces, which is experienced by not only our farmers and their families but also the rural communities that rely so heavily on the health of the farming sector. When our farming income is down then the local economy is also down. If ever there were an issue in the parliament on which we should be taking a bipartisan approach, this is it. I'm not suggesting that this speech will be particularly bipartisan, because we seem to be somewhat beyond that, but with the departure of the member for New England I believe there is still an opportunity for us to regroup and approach drought on a bipartisan basis.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  That's very good to hear, Member for Hunter.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  It is all right to extend sympathy to our farming families, which I do tonight on behalf of the opposition, but they need much more than sympathy; they need a parliament and a government working for them, making the real and meaningful responses to drought that can take us well and truly into the future in a way that offers them confidence. Whatever those policies look like, they need to be underpinned by the basic acceptance that drought in our country should no longer be treated as abnormal event, something which will come along occasionally and which, hopefully, won't last too long, and that, rather, our climate is changing—and neither this evening nor the course of this policy debate is the time to argue about what is causing the change; that is for another day—in a way which is making it far more difficult for our farming communities. We need to recognise that is unlikely to change; it's the new normal. We need to accept that protracted drought will be with us again and again, part of our climate on a permanent basis, and approach the policy with those fundamentals in mind.


I am still not sure why the Prime Minister recently had a drought tour. I would've thought that, after five years in government and at least seven years of drought, he might've understood the drought and what we as a parliament should be doing about it. More surprisingly, he didn't come back from the drought tour with a policy announcement. I accept that prime ministers look for a photo opportunity when parts of our community are facing natural disasters, but they usually do that ahead of a policy announcement, and on the Prime Minister's return, disappointingly, he offered no such thing.


The fact that we are debating this Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 this evening poses four key questions for me. First of all, what has happened in drought policy over the last 10 years? I think that's worth sharing with the House. Second, why are we debating this bill before the House now in June 2018? Third, what does the future hold for drought policy in this country? That's something I've already touched on. Fourth, what are the government's policy priorities, and how do the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors rate in the government's considerations?


Ten years ago now, back in 2008, Commonwealth and state governments started to reflect upon the history of drought policy in this country and its failings. In 2013 something quite historic took place: the Commonwealth and each of the states and territories agreed to a whole new approach to drought policy and entered into an intergovernmental agreement which will have lasted five years, coming to an end 1 July this year, only days away. A number of principles were embraced within that agreement. I should say that agreement had the support of key farm leadership groups like the National Farmers' Federation, and within this parliament it had bipartisan support. It was agreed, with the helping hand and guidance of a Productivity Commission report, that the way we were doing drought policy in this place was failing our farmers, our economy, our communities and indeed, of course, the budget. We were spending a billion dollars a year on a number of initiatives which usually fall under the umbrella of exceptional circumstances. They were costing us a billion dollars a year. A considerable proportion of farming families, as the Productivity Commission indicated, have been on the welfare payment for many, many years—too many years. Of course, the Productivity Commission identified the fact that many of our farm businesses hadn't made a profit for many years, and it was clear that the drought policies that were in place were not working and were failing our farmers, our communities and our economies.


So the states and the Commonwealth said, 'Let's try a new approach,' and the agreement was underpinned by a number of principles. I want to share them with the House. There are five of them. The first was to assist farm families and primary producers to adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability. The second was to encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage business risks. The third was to ensure families in hardship have access to a support payment that recognises the special circumstances of a farmer, and that's the principle which is leading us to this debate tonight. The fifth was to provide a framework for jurisdictions' responses during periods of drought. I missed the fourth; I'm sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was to ensure that social support services are accessible to farm families. So they are the principles that underpin the intergovernmental agreement which comes to an end on 1 July this year.


Of course, the governments—plural, because it commenced under the former Labor government—moved pretty quickly to establish farm household allowance as one of those key principles. Farm household allowance, for those who don't know this area well, is basically an unemployment benefit for farmers. It comes with a more generous or liberal assets test, because obviously farmers can be very cash poor in times of hardship—not necessarily just drought—but still be quite asset rich and unable, of course, to readily pass off those assets. So we need a welfare payment. I think the welfare payment is an important part of the equation, and farm household allowance represents that welfare payment.


Importantly, the COAG discussion included an embrace of the idea that the welfare payment should not be ongoing ad infinitum. The concept is really that farmers should get income support for a period of time—three years was chosen—and in that time they should be expected, with some government support and guidance, to make themselves more resilient and more adaptable, to embrace new business models, maybe to get other off-farm income or maybe to leave the land, if that's absolutely necessary and they conclude that that's the only option available to them.


What brings us to the debate tonight is the fact that a couple of thousand farming families have now reached the end of their three-year entitlement to farm household allowance, and the government is now seeking to extend it by one year for those who are already on it or have just left farm household allowance because their time has expired—and, indeed, for those who are coming onto it. I need to make clear to the House that, for new entrants on the farm household allowance, the period will now be four years, not three—thus the considerable impact on the budget bottom line. It's not just existing farmers; there will be future farmers as well.


The problem with all of that is that the work simply hasn't been done along the way. We've lost five years, basically. The first act of the member for New England when he became the minister was actually to abolish the COAG process. The whole concept of the IGA relied upon the idea of greater collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states. It's true that, as the mainland managers, under our Constitution the states have to be part of the equation; they have to be part of the solution. There was an entity called the Standing Council on Primary Industries, which dealt with these matters under the umbrella of COAG. SCoPI, the Standing Council on Primary Industries, was not only the ministers meeting but also the committee on which the secretaries were represented. It was the role of that COAG committee to continue to progress the next stages of that drought reform plan.


That was then pulled away. Under pressure, it was eventually replaced with a thing called AGMIN—that is, the ag ministers group—which didn't have anything like the construction, secretarial support or resourcing that the Standing Council on Primary Industries had. I'll never understand why SCoPI was abolished, but it was a great mistake by this government. It was a decision authorised by no less than the Prime Minister of the day. It is something the current Prime Minister hasn't sought to turn around; he should turn it around. If we're going to have any hope of producing real and meaningful drought policy in this place, we need a COAG process and we need it very quickly. We've seen other areas of government policy where we've been let down by the diminution of the COAG process.


What we have had over the last five years is an increasing reliance on concessional loans. It was a former Labor government that first went down the path of concessional loans for our farmers. At that time, it was not because of drought but because of high indebtedness. That was the major issue of the day. I still believe that, in the higher interest rate environment at that time, there was a role for concessional loans, but this government has fallen into the trap of offering concessional loans for just about any hill any business ever faces: Northern Australia infrastructure loans, concessional loans to farmers—and the list goes on and on. But, as a drought response, the reality is that more debt or switching debt is simply not a solution or an option for many farmers. It entails challenging your relationship with the bank. We've learnt time and time again in this place that it means going through a terrible number of hoops in terms of paperwork during the application process. It is very, very difficult.


We've had this over-reliance on concessional loans, and of course the concessional loans have allowed the government to spruik the capital value of the land. We read in the Agricultural competitiveness white paper the government's $4 billion investment. It is a failed document; I think there's a general consensus in the sector on that now. It's $4 billion because that would be the total capital value of all the loans if they were all lent out. Of course, that's not the cost to the budget bottom line. The cost of the budget bottom line is the cost of administering the loans and any bad debts. We need to look at the difference between the government's bond-borrowing rate and the interest rate of the loans. The cost to government is not great. The government has become very fond of these loans because it doesn't cost the budget bottom line and it allows them to spruik that larger amounts of money are going to our farmers. It's a sleight of hand, it's not an approach which is conducive to bipartisanship in this place and it's certainly not a way of helping our farmers.


By way of completeness, I acknowledge that the government has improved the farm management deposit scheme in recent years. That's a good thing. It's a very wise policy to allow people to put money away in good times for use in bad times and to use the taxation system to make that attractive. We should continue to make that a key centrepiece of drought policy. The government has also done a little bit of work around capital depreciation—that is, accelerated depreciation for certain infrastructure projects on-farm, whether it be water or otherwise. The problem is that accelerated depreciation is no good to someone who's not making a profit. You have to spend the money in the first place but if you're suffering a very bad drought then you're not likely to have the money to invest.


That takes me to the Regional Investment Corporation. The government is so fond of these loans that it's now going to establish the so-called Regional Investment Corporation in Orange. Why Orange? I think you know the answer to that: because that's where the Nationals lost a state seat for the first time in 69 years, and the best way to grab it back from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party might be to run a little boondoggle or pork-barrelling exercise out to Orange. The problem with the Regional Investment Corporation—



Mr Broad interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I acknowledge that the member for Mallee would have liked to have had the Regional Investment Corporation, but I will put his mind at rest by saying, 'Don't worry; I don't think the Regional Investment Corporation will ever eventuate.' I don't think we're going to have a regional investment corporation. I've already mentioned 1 July, which is supposed to be day that the Regional Investment Corporation opens its doors and starts making farmers right around the country happy and gives a huge boost to our national economy. Everywhere Mr Littleproud goes, no matter what the problem in the agricultural sector, he says, 'Don't worry; you're going to have the Regional Investment Corporation.'


Well, that isn't happening. There won't be any doors opening in Orange on 1 July—at the end of this week or whenever that is—because the Regional Investment Corporation has no real objective, no CEO and no staff. It doesn't even have a location, let alone a building. In fact, the board turned up in Orange I think for the first time last week. There is a board. The minister has appointed a board, and they met in a park. We had the APVMA team, small as it is, meeting at Macca's in Armidale, in the electorate of New England.



Mr Broad interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I'll pick up the member for Mallee's interjections—no reflection on Macca's; it's a good choice. Their coffee's not too bad. But we have the APVMA CEO holding her business in Macca's in Armidale and now we have the RIC board meeting on a park bench in Orange. This is a disgrace. It should stop and it should stop now. The new minister should walk away from the antics of the former minister and just say: 'This is enough. This is not working. This is $28 million of money which could go to drought-affected farmers tomorrow.' That would be a better use of the money.


What is the RIC going to do if ever it opens, unlikely as that is? It's going to do the same thing the states are already doing through their rural adjustment authorities: it's going to administer concessional loans to farmers, but only new loans. We'll have a situation where the states will continue to administer old loans for up to 10 years and the Regional Investment Corporation will administer new loans. This is just silly. It's a duplication and an unnecessary one. The minister will say, 'The states weren't doing a very good job of it.' Well, I challenge that, but a good minister would work with the states, bring them in and say: 'I'm not completely happy with the way these loans are being administered. Let's do it better.' That's what a minister showing leadership would do, but it's certainly not what this minister is doing. I should say that the RIC is allegedly also going to administer some water infrastructure loans. We shall see.


While I think of it, I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Turnbull Government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farmers and agricultural industries"".


I'm sure the member for Griffith will be happy to second that for me.




Ms Butler:
  Quite right!




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  The APVMA is a shocking pork-barrelling exercise that threatens our farming community. It's already destroying productivity in the farming community. The Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is a critical part of our farm economy and makes sure not only that farmers get their crop sprays and other chemicals and veterinary medicines that they need but also that they get them in a timely way—when new products are offered to the market, they get to the market very quickly. This forced relocation to Armidale is destroying the joint. Staff have left in a mass exodus, and it's impacting on the entity's capacity to do its job. I'll make a bet now: in the not-too-distant future the new minister, finally, will be making big changes. He will be revisiting the general policy order and saying, 'We are going to extend the time available to the APVMA to make this work,' but, more importantly, they will be changing it in a way that will allow more people to stay here in Canberra to work. In the not-too-distant future this government will be admitting that the APVMA relocation has been a failure. They will be left with no choice but to pretend they're having a relocation to Armidale, but in fact a large number of staff will be working here in Canberra, because they cannot find the personnel—the expert lawyers and the regulatory scientists—they need to do that work.


I challenge Minister Littleproud: he should just run up the white flag now and differentiate himself from the former minister and say: 'We're not going to waste $50 million or more on this relocation to Armidale. We're not going to undermine the productivity of our farmers. We're not going to threaten consumer health, because we eat the stuff that those sprays are used on and we want to make sure the regulator is up to the job. And we're not going to undermine our exports, because the APVMA plays a role in that regulatory regime, as well. We're not going to do that. We're going to gut this idea, forget the pork barrel and bring the APVMA back to Canberra, where it absolutely belongs.'


In posing my question—why are we debating this bill now?—I've touched on the history. People have already gone off the farm household allowance. They have exhausted their entitlement and here we are, in the last sitting fortnight, rushing a bill through the parliament to create this extension. We are still very unclear about what hoops people will have to go through who have already come off the farm household allowance. I invite the minister to explain that further to us when he makes his closing remarks. Is it going to be as hard as it was for people when they first went on the farm household allowance? Remember the member for New England saying: 'Oh, they don't have to apply or wait; they just get it.' That is the statement that led to the doctoring of his Hansard and subsequently the dismissal of his departmental secretary—one of the darkest periods of our history in this place. Why are we debating a bill that needs to be given effect basically from 1 July—this week? The government couldn't work out a month, two months or six months ago that in the absence of any other policy work in the last five years they're going to have to extend the farm household allowance? They had to wait until now? This is just incredible. Was it the drought tour that convinced the Prime Minister that he needed to extend the farm household allowance by a year? Surely not. I hope not, because that was just obvious to all and sundry.


What does the future hold for drought policy in this country? This is an interesting question. Something very curious happened in the Federation Chamber last night. I welcome the fact that during the week of the Prime Minister's infamous drought tour the relatively new Minister for Agriculture and Water started talking about climate, recognising the things I was saying earlier about accepting drought as not an abnormal event. He talked about resilience, he talked about adaptation and he talked about the challenge for some people in some parts of the country that were capable of being farmed 100 years ago and are not so capable of being farmed today. He was using all the right language. But the member for Calare had a motion on drought last night in which he mentioned none of those things. Interestingly, the member for New England contributed to that debate and, again, mentioned none of those things. I'm glad the member for Mallee is here, because he did. He understands this subject pretty well, in my view, and I'll give credit where credit is due. But who's in charge? Is the former member for New England still in charge of drought policy? He's still in denial, still wanting to roll out the boondoggles and defend his legacy. Or is the new minister in charge, backed by people like the member for Mallee? I hope it's the new minister, and I wish the member for Mallee the best in that regard, because we do need to get this job done. We need to embrace the intergovernmental agreement review. We need to rebuild the SCoPI process and construction, because that's the first step.


The other question I posed was on government priorities. Remember when agriculture was one of this government's five pillars of the economy? They hardly talk about the agriculture sector anymore. The member for New England was very fond of claiming credit when commodity prices were high and everything was good, but, now we have a crisis in all sorts of places, including the dairy industry, no-one wants to talk about agriculture anymore.


Let's have a look at the legislative agenda. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017 was introduced into this House on 25 October last year. This bill enjoys bipartisan support. It has disappeared. The Export Control Bill 2017, a very important bill, was introduced into the Senate on 7 December last year. It hasn't been prioritised and has disappeared. It's an important bill which enjoys bipartisan support. The Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, another very important bill, was introduced into the House on 28 March last year. It is still in the House. It was introduced and has disappeared. The penalties for breaches of animal welfare standards in the live export trade were introduced on 24 May, never to be seen again. We know the reason for the last one: I foreshadowed an amendment, and the government won't bring the bill back, because it's fearful of people crossing the floor and of losing the vote.


How does this reflect on the government's priorities for agriculture? They won't even bring bipartisan bills into the House for debate and to be voted upon. They won't even put these bills on the legislative agenda. I don't have time to go through them tonight, but these are important bills. The department of agriculture is spending a very large slice of its time and resources trying to work out how to make the APVMA work in Armidale and the Regional Investment Corporation work in Orange, when it should be focusing on these very important and meaningful matters that affect our agricultural sector.


When the former minister was here, we heard about dams which were unproven, uneconomic and will never come to reality, and silly stunts around carp eradication. I said so many times that he was the worst agriculture minister in the history of Federation. That's in the past. I want the new minister to step forward and demonstrate that he's prepared to take the agriculture portfolio seriously. It's not just agriculture; they wiped fisheries and forestry out of the portfolio title—another silly mistake. We don't hear the new minister talk about fisheries or forestry. I know Senator Ruston does work in that area, but people want to hear their lead minister talk about these issues.


For five years a crisis has been looming in forestry because of our failure to grow the plantation estate, and what have we had in response? We've had an issues paper, which was eventually turned into a discussion paper and, last year, by no less than the Prime Minister himself, turned into a plan to have a plan—and we're still waiting for the plan. For five years we've known about the problem and have had nothing but discussion papers, the formation of committees et cetera. It's not good enough.


The opposition will be supporting this bill because, in the absence of any real progress on national drought reform for five years, we've no choice now but to further help farmers who haven't made that transition and haven't been given appropriate guidance or support by the government. Farmers will need another year, but what happens after that? Surely we'll be back here next year asking ourselves the same question if this government is not prepared to get serious about rebuilding the COAG process and about real collaboration with the states. Mr Littleproud has said it, but we want to see him walk the talk. They need to be serious about embracing the concept that the climate is changing and the change is here to stay. It has to be about resilience and adaptation. We have to help people find new business models, retrain and, sadly for some, acknowledge that they might not have an ongoing concern, because of a severely changing climate.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  Is the amendment seconded?




Ms Butler:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form 'that the amendment be agreed to'. The question is now that the amendment be agreed to.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:45):  In rising to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, can I respectfully ask that the member for Hunter hang around for a few minutes—hopefully, he does. I sat here and listened for half an hour and, like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he did his best to dismantle the federal government's position on what it's going to do. But, also like a good opposition spokesman for agriculture, he forgot to talk about what he was going to do.


The extension of farm household support is less than 12 months; I was hoping for a little more. Member for Hunter, it wasn't until 24 minutes into your contribution on the bill that you actually started to mention what you might do, and I thought: 'I'm excited. There's going to be an alternate position—finally.' I actually believe that the member for Hunter can do it. He's probably the first Labor member that I've seen who genuinely has a real passion for the portfolio, and that's really welcome. He's got a genuine interest. I hope he hangs around, because I'm going to talk a little less about the politics and a little more about drought policy.


In my maiden speech, I gave a recognition that successive parliaments over many, many years hadn't developed a good drought policy—and we probably still haven't, if we're honest with ourselves. The fact is that we live in a country that is going to experience significant rainfall at times; it is also going to experience significant dry times. It is right for the member for Hunter to talk about climate, because there is no doubt that we're having more challenging climatic conditions around our agricultural sector. If you're a believer in climate change—some of my farmers are and some of my farmers aren't—you will at least adhere to the concept that rainfall seems to be more sporadic and that, when rain does come, the downpours are heavier, which means that we need greater intervention, particularly around water catchments. There is a good argument for dams as a result of climate change.


I want to talk about a number of things that have been good and then touch on some things that would be significant improvements. I think farm household support is a basic. It's not rocket science. If we have a family that is not working and is living in a poor suburb in one of our towns, we make sure that they've got groceries on the table. If you've got a farming business that might have a large amount of assets but then, even though they're having a go, because of the seasonal conditions they are in difficulty, it's only fair that they also have groceries on the table. It is nice that drought support is being extended for a fourth year. I wonder whether it should even be indefinite. What we simply want to say is that, if you're having a dip, we're going to ensure that you're able to feed your children and that you're able to put shoes on their feet and uniforms on their backs so that they can go to school. So it does surprise me that this support even had a three-year cut-off.


Of course, what we want is farm businesses to be profitable, sound and not to have to rely on farm household support—and many of them are. The farm management deposit has been a good system. I point out that we have legislated so that a farm management deposit can be used against an existing loan. That has been taken up by Rural Bank. It's the only bank in Australia that has taken it up. That would be a very simple way of at least making those farm managements more attractive and more competitive in the interest rate component.


I think we also need to be very mindful of time of entry. That's something we haven't got our head around. I bought my first farm when I was 22 years old. In the drought of 2002, when I harvested my crop—and, for those who are interested in grain growing, when you sow wheat, you sow it at about two bushels an acre, so about 60 kilograms an acre—my harvest was 30 kilograms an acre. I got less than half back. I remember that, when I was a young farmer, my wife was working, and, even though she was only earning $33,000 at the time, because she earned over $25,000 we weren't eligible for drought assistance—none at all. I remember getting the letter saying that I wasn't eligible. I got it and I nailed it to the shearing shed wall and said, 'I'll show you who's viable!' Anyway, we made a go of it. But I think that time of entry is incredibly important because, if you're going to support farmers through a difficult time, what you want at the other end of it, when the rains start falling again, is young farmers to be able to kick off and go, because they're the ones who are going to drive our productivity gains, they're the ones who are going to take up the new technology and they're the ones who are going to drive the exports for the nation. So, whatever we do, we have to think about time of entry for drought assistance.


The other thing that I think is working is the seasonal insurance model. This requires better forecasting. It requires a good network of Doppler weather radar. Essentially, what we're seeing across my farming sector now is that people will work out: what is the input cost of growing a crop? I'll just go on a per-acre basis, to put it in layman's terms—even though we talk in hectares, a lot of the country in my area is laid out in mile-square blocks, which are 640 acres. It essentially costs you about $30 or $40, up to $50, an acre to put in a crop by the time you write out your cheques for your fertiliser, write out your cheques for your chemicals and write out cheques for your fuel, your scarifier points and all those sorts of things. We are able now to access insurance products that will cover the costs of your inputs if you have a year that's a complete wipe-out. Say for example that, to put in 2,000 acres of crop, you would have needed $200,000 worth of inputs. You're able to insure those products at less than $10 an acre—so it's reasonably competitive—so that, if you get a lack of growing-season rainfall between June and September, you'll get a payout for that.


I just want to point out why this is important. If you as a farmer start to develop a drought package in your own business, you'll say, 'I'm going to take this insurance product so that, if it doesn't rain, at least I've got enough money to put the crop in next year.' That's tick one. You'll also try to get your farm management deposit to equal what the interest component is on your loan. If you talk to any bank, most banks will roll you over another year as long as you've got the capacity to cover your interest. If you set up your business so you've got your interest component covered through your farm management deposit and you take out the insurance product so that you've got the input costs, it means that, okay, in a drought year you've made nothing, but you haven't gone backwards. You couple that with farm household support, so you've still got food on the kitchen table, and I think you start to look at a package that fundamentally works.


Those are the things that I think we need to perhaps create greater incentives. Also, we need to be mindful that farmers will look, in their own farming system, at ways of developing a drought assistance package. That might be that they'll be putting in additional storage, so they'll put two years of grain aside so they've always got seed to plant. They might put a feedlot on to value-add. I think we need to be very cognisant of and open to accelerated depreciation packages when a farmer is saying, 'I'm doing this part of my business so that I can drive some productivity.'


Ultimately, I would like to see the government having a good discussion with some of the big insurers. I'll just run through this because this is something that I looked at as a farm business at one stage. At one stage I looked at leasing 6,000 acres in Saskatchewan, in Canada, and farming over there. People ask, 'Why would you do that?' The logical answer was: because you get the northern hemispherical risk with the southern hemispherical risk in your grain growing. Not many farmers can look at how they can do that productively in their own business. However, what we're seeing now with companies such as QBE and big insurance companies is that, if you look at like-for-like countries—and the clear ones would be Canada and Australia—you could develop an insurance product that is local but also has a reinsurance component by a company such as QBE, and you could actually get a global insurance company. Their input in that would bring the premium prices down quite substantially. There is some really quite practical stuff that we can be doing in insurance products, in assistance to farmers and in assistance through drought.


Can I touch on one of the other things that were substantially beneficial for me as a farmer throughout the drought of 2002 and the drought of 2006, 2007 and 2008—the hat-trick drought, as I call it. I remember my father, who had farmed all his life, said: 'You only ever get in our area one drought in a row; you never get two. Always the second year is a good year.' That theory was blown in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It's very humbling to have worked as hard as you can physically work and at the end of three years realise that if you'd done nothing for three years you would have actually had a better life and made more money.


The one thing that has helped us has been the opening up of markets. I think this is something we need to be very careful about, and it is something this place actually can benefit from. I'll give an example of that. In 2002, even though we had fairly skinny sheep, we were still able to sell those sheep for up to $100 a head. In 1992 we were shooting sheep. You couldn't give them away. People say, 'What is the difference?' The difference is this: in 1992 Australia was exporting sheepmeat to 12 countries, and in 2002 we were exporting sheepmeat to 96 countries. So opening up market opportunities is perhaps one of the most important things this place can do to build resilience in our farming sector. Ultimately, the greater utilisation of that carcass—with hearts and livers and bits and pieces out of the carcasses being airlifted across to the Middle East—put an underlying floor in the prices that farmers could get. If you looked to the mixed farming area that I was in, the one thing that sustained them through the drought years was that at least one part of their commodity was getting very good prices. We talk about farm household assistance; we talk about insurance products; we talk about accelerated depreciation for infrastructure on farm; and we talk about things that can be done in the way of loans and those sorts of things, but that factor of opening up markets must always be well stated.


The other thing that we've substantially done—and it has been the role of government to assist this—has been building major water pipeline infrastructure projects. In my patch is the largest pipeline system in the world. People may not be aware of that. The Wimmera Mallee Pipeline was from a combination of the Victorian Labor government and the federal government. You can actually go to nearly every paddock across a third of the state of Victoria, and every paddock's got a tap on it and you can turn the water on. We've got two more projects we want to get funded: the East Grampians pipeline and the Mitiamo pipeline. We're funding the Loddon pipeline at the moment, with $20 million from the federal government and a contribution of $40 million from the Victorian Labor government. Those things have been very interesting because, call it climate change or call it what you will, we are seeing that areas that used to run a lot of livestock and that rely on catchment dams—where, essentially, it would rain and the water would wash into the dams—have had dam evaporation rates higher than they have had and less ability to hold water than they have had. So the ability to run poly pipe for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres has revolutionised the farming systems. It's opened up opportunities for BASF, formally Bayer, with a research facility in Horsham, which is the only canola genetics research facility in the Southern Hemisphere. It's opened up intensive animal husbandry such as Luv-a-Duck, which is processing 90,000 ducks a day. It's opened up opportunities for feedlotting lambs. It has been a substantial thing.


If you want to look at policies that can address drought communities, they are a combination of water infrastructure, trade policies and getting the settings right around loans, farm management deposits and insurance products. I just want to touch on one other issue that's also very relevant to this policy, and it's something that worked reasonably well in 2002 and in 2006, 2007 and 2008, and that has been assistance with rates. One of the things we've always found when it is dry is that the capacity for a farmer to pay their rates has been substantially diminished. Farmers pay a large burden of the rates in our country shires. Some of those rates can be $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000. There have been rate subsidies of 50 per cent which have also been a significant help. Those rates subsidies not only helped the farmers but also helped the rural community, because they meant that the shire had money coming in. If there's one thing we have learnt when it comes to dealing with drought, it is that you also have to remember that there's a rural community that has to have money stimulating it.


There's much to be done in the drought space. There's more leadership to be had. There are many good ideas out there that we can learn from other parts of the world. But this is something that we must tackle, because if there's one thing we know about Australia it is that it is raining sometimes and it is dry sometimes and it will always be that way.

"Swanson, Meryl, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (18:00):  Have you heard the news today—news of the continued fighting in the Turnbull government's cabinet over the National Energy Guarantee; news that the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, will cross the floor on this issue if he doesn't get his way; news about the Turnbull government's incessant campaign to lock in massive corporate tax cuts for business? We could wind back the calendar a day, a week or a month and revisit the headlines and see this pattern ad nauseam, a pattern where an out-of-touch government puts its political priorities ahead of the interests of ordinary Australians, a pattern where the government is increasingly paralysed by party room dysfunction, a pattern where the Prime Minister's grasp on the leadership becomes more tenuous with each and every Newspoll.


Meanwhile, the people of Australia couldn't really give a toss about most of it. To be frank, they're fed up. They are fed up with the government's obsession with itself, at the expense of all Australians, and fed up with a government that seems to want to serve the top end of town while the rest of us hang out and hang on, desperate to try to pay for clothes and shoes for our children and desperate to try to pay the ever-increasing energy bills. They really just want some leadership and policies.


Nothing could be closer to this than this bill on farm household support. I'm glad that the government has decided to support our farming families and extend the farm household allowance by one year, from three to a maximum of four cumulative years. But I ask why this has taken so long. I spoke in the chamber yesterday about my anger that it has taken Prime Ministers Turnbull and Abbott and agriculture ministers Joyce and Littleproud an unacceptable and indeed unforgiveable amount of time to act on this. I spoke about the great hardships that have been experienced by farming families in my electorate of Paterson for many months. Vegetable farmers were unable to grow crops due to hot and arid conditions, tanks were bone dry and salinity levels in the depleted rivers made irrigation impossible. Beef farmers were forced to handfeed and spend exorbitant amounts of time and money on water cartage to prevent stock deaths due to dehydration. The livelihood of our milk producers in my electorate was further threatened by the unavailability of water, which made sanitation of their dairies almost impossible and really incredibly difficult. Carefully crafted bloodlines of really prized animals were unceremoniously sent to market or to the slaughterhouse because it was financially impossible for farmers to keep them alive.


I remind the honourable members opposite that this situation did not suddenly spring up at the beginning of the month when the Prime Minister decided to conduct the whistlestop selfie tour of the big dry. We have properties and communities in New South Wales and Queensland that have been paralysed by drought for the last seven years. So, while my colleagues and I on this side of the House do not decline to give the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 a second reading, there are some points that really do need to be made and called out on.


I support the member for Hunter's call for an amendment to the motion that notes the Turnbull government's failure to provide timely and effective legislative amendments to support Australia's farming families and, more broadly, the agricultural sector, because this faffing around is nothing new from this Prime Minister and the cohort he has around him. The Turnbull government has a penchant for selectively pursuing legislation that promotes its political agenda at the expense of everything else. Time and time again, the people of Australia are left waiting for this government to govern.


In my electorate of Paterson, where the community of Williamtown is ground zero in Australia's PFAS contamination nightmare, my constituents have been pleading for nigh on three years for this Prime Minister and the members of his cabinet to do something—to publish their anticipated report, to honour their avowed commitments to release their promised policy and to offer a pathway out of the living nightmare my constituents have been trapped inside since 4 September 2015. Yes, there are critical matters that this government could turn its attention towards. But no; far too much energy is spent pandering to the bloke who's going to throw his toys out of the pram if he doesn't get his way or pandering to the pork-barrelling former minister feathering his own electorate nest. This government has had years to put in place a structure that would have helped these farmers, right now, to make a living. It could have provided advice and support for those who aim to droughtproof their operations over the long term. It could have helped farming families make that difficult call about whether they can or cannot make a quid out of farming, given the changed market conditions and ever more volatile climatic extremes, and it could have offered pathways and retraining for people who choose to leave the land. The government could have used the SCoPI process to put these supports in place. It could have done this some time ago and it did not, and that is a disgrace. And now our farming families are meant to rejoice that the government has seen fit to extend household assistance for a further 12 months. Yes, it is something but, as I said yesterday, it's nowhere near enough. It's a small sticking plaster on a gaping wound.


Our farming families are an important part of Australia's agricultural landscape and the fabric of our nation. Elsewhere in our agricultural sector we have primary producers and those who rely on them stuck in limbo waiting for the government to act. My electorate of Paterson is home to beef farmers, dairy farmers, fishers, prawners and oyster growers. They work incredibly hard, and times have been tough. I've spoken before in the House to share the plight of my constituents, who suffered through the driest season in 80 years—stock farmers who were forced to sell or face exorbitant hand-feeding costs. Even water came at a premium in terms of both time and cartage, and, if the tanks weren't dry, as I mentioned earlier, the salinity levels in the river were as high as some farmers had ever seen them. Vegetable farmers just watched entire crops fail.


In the face of the uncontrollable challenges of climate and weather, we owe it to our farming families to appropriately support their industry and, in turn, their livelihoods. We should be turning our brightest agricultural minds to this and saying, 'How can we make this better for those people who work so hard every day and who really have been the best in the world?' It is completely unacceptable that the Turnbull government continues to fail Australian farmers and agricultural industries through legislative delays. Right now, Prime Minister Turnbull and the members opposite have amassed quite a stockpile of outstanding bills while they attempt to ram home their own agenda. This is patently not good enough. The people of Australia are looking to Prime Minister Turnbull and his government to do precisely that: govern in the interests of those who saw fit to elect them. Instead they wait and they wait and they wait some more. I might just add that I find it particularly disappointing that members of the National Party always talk about being agrarian socialists, say that they just want to do the best by the bush, and say that they want to support the agricultural sectors—well, I think that they've put their hands up and stood on the wrong side of the House in many votes and particularly—




Mr Katter:
  They are not agrarian socialists. They are definitely not. I am!




Ms SWANSON:
  I will take that interjection: perhaps you are, but we could do with some more of those. The Turnbull government has made a considered choice to prioritise parliamentary business ahead of our farmers and agricultural industries. It seems to find all the time and press releases and media opportunities in the world to promote the corporate tax cuts for big business, yet this parliament is headed for a six-week-long break at the end of this sitting, and critical legislation will need to wait until August to be even considered—such as the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill, also known as agvet chemicals legislation.


This innocuous-sounding piece of legislation is actually tied up with the infamous APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, where we saw the member for New England relocate a government authority to his own electorate in a case of blatant pork-barrelling. The agvet bill involves minor amendments, mostly technical, that should assist with streamlining APVMA operations. But it should be no surprise that, after the debacle of its forced relocation, APVMA is now on life support—its current financial position is reportedly untenable, as is its technological infrastructure. So not only are industry stakeholders waiting to have the agvet bill passed; the Prime Minister has decided that APVMA is in need of a governance board, which, of course, will require an amendment to the bill in the Senate. What does that mean for our constituents? It actually means more waiting, because a former minister of the Turnbull government put his own interests ahead of the country's. 


There are a number of other examples of this government prioritising its political game-playing ahead of our farmers and the agricultural industry. There was the decision to pull the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill, and the Export Control Bill has been lost in transit since it was briefly debated in the Senate earlier this year. And, in a matter very much in the interests of my constituents in Paterson, there is the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018. 


I first met Sue and Rob Hamilton when their family prawning operation was shut down in 2015 when the RAAF Base Williamtown PFAS scandal broke out. That's right: we had professional prawners whose businesses were closed. The Hamiltons and other commercial fishers working Tilligerry Creek and Fullerton Cove were stripped of their livelihoods when it was discovered that firefighting chemicals PFOS and PFOA had leeched from the base into the waterways of our community. This is an absolute reality. Fishing bans lasted 12 months. This took a toll on many families like the Hamiltons and other fishers in Paterson. The Hamiltons battled through, however, and returned to the water and their industry. 


Sue contacted me again in October last year to raise her concerns about the prevalence of white spot syndrome, a virus that is imported in green prawns. Importation of the prawns had been suspended following an outbreak of the virus in commercial prawn farms in Queensland and then around the wild prawns in Logan River and Moreton Bay. It had spread. Sue reached out to me after the then Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, lifted the suspension on the importation of green prawns into Australia. Sue was concerned because white spot is a massive deal. It leads to a highly lethal and contagious viral infection. Outbreaks have been known to wipe out the entire populations of prawn farms in days. The virus is not dangerous to humans and it is killed when the prawn is cooked, but the Aussie tradition of putting a green prawn on a hook and throwing a line in puts our waterways and our seafood industry at risk. Sue and her husband, Rob, still reeling from the year-long PFAS shutdown of their family business, were incensed by the biosecurity issues that remained in play even after the importation ban was lifted. And it's no wonder: the situation was and is nonsensical. 


As a matter of fact, the failings highlighted by Sue and Rob were exposed in 2016, two years ago, and legislation to shore up those biosecurity failings and breaches is still yet to pass this parliament. We have a precedent where imported prawns infected Australian wild prawns and prawn farms. The Australian wild prawning areas and prawn farms were slapped with a ban. Meanwhile, the ban on the very source of white spot, the imported green prawns, was lifted. In what universe does that make sense? 


We must have a system that is able to respond quickly to biosecurity failings and breaches. This is why the government must prioritise legislation that will strengthen our biosecurity system. This bill was introduced into the House in March this year and received Labor's support. That was three months ago, and that's a lot of water under the bridge—metaphorically and literally. 


Three months, however, pales in comparison to the length of time our farming families have waited for the government to take any meaningful action towards long-term drought reform. More than four years ago, Labor supported the government's Farm Household Support Bill. This was the product of a 2013 Standing Committee on Primary Industries—otherwise known as SCoPI—meeting which continued to commit to the previous Labor government's commitment to provide a new, nationally agreed approach to drought. It's now 2018. The intergovernmental agreement on drought reform, of which farm household support is part, will expire on 1 July this year. That is literally days away, yet our farming families wait for a plan that is fit for the future. The Prime Minister and his colleagues must park their self-interests and put the ordinary folk of Australia ahead of the select few at the top end of town. We must insist that this government that seems increasingly out of touch put the interests of ordinary Australians front and centre.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (18:15):  It's always fun to follow on from Labor when they're talking about agriculture and water issues. We're talking about drought through New South Wales and Queensland. It's a very serious issue. If Labor had their way, they'd have a man-made drought. They'd follow the Greens down the path of handing all the water in the Murray-Darling Basin back to the environment. They'd have a water crisis in the Goulburn Valley. They'd have a water crisis throughout the Murrumbidgee. They'd have a water crisis down throughout the lower reaches of the Murray River. They'd have a water crisis made by politicians. They'd have a water crisis that's fake. They would inflict that pain gladly on the people down the Murray-Darling Basin just by carrying out their policies—their policies that they are very proud of when they come into this House. In relation to looking after our farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley, we spend most of our time fighting Labor and their ridiculous stance on water policy. So it's a bit tough when we have the Labor Party come in and want to lecture us about how we should be doing more for our farmers when their own policies would see many of our farmers unable to carry on the farming practices that they have done for two, three or four generations—ever since we've had irrigation throughout the Goulburn Valley and the Goulburn region.


This support package, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018, is critically important. I was able to see firsthand how important this sort of assistance package is during the milk crisis that took place in the early months of 2016, when Murray Goulburn announced that it was going to drastically cut the price of milk. It was quickly followed by Fonterra and many of the other processors. Not only did they cut their prices for milk into the future but they then requested this ridiculous clawback where they wanted the money that farmers had, in their opinion, been overpaid. They wanted tens of thousands and, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars repaid to the processors. This put so many of the dairy farmers throughout the Goulburn Valley and Victoria in an incredibly tough position. With the little that they were being paid for milk in those months, it was virtually impossible for them to process milk for the cost that they were able to sell the milk. This put them in a ridiculously tough position. Many of them were forced to park their cattle in different locations where they didn't have to rely on irrigation water. They had to take the charity of hay that was brought down from other parts of the nation to assist them with their feed. More than anything, they simply had to plough on. They had to get out of bed at 4.30 or five o'clock in the morning, milk the cows in the morning and milk them again in the evening, knowing that they were financially going backwards all the time to the tune of many thousands of dollars per week.


I must acknowledge the previous Leader of the Nationals Barnaby Joyce on his role during that milk crisis. He went immediately down to the Goulburn Valley to talk to and meet with the dairy farmers, the milk producers and the processors. He was there to immediately offer this support with the farm household allowance and to immediately offer low-interest loans, which were picked up. Yes, there were problems with the extent of the forms that needed to be filled out. But, when you think about the many hundreds of thousands of dollars of commercial loans that the government was effectively taking over, offering security for those properties was a very complex issue. We were able to act and to try to put in some assistance for many of these farmers during these very stressful times.


It's an issue that gets lost often when we're talking about these times of drought and the milk crisis, where production costs rise above the farm gate milk prices. The traditional farmer in that situation is under an enormous amount of stress and financial pressure, and mental health becomes a very important issue that needs to be dealt with very carefully. This is where, again, the counsellors from rural finance come in—mediation counsellors and people who are able to help with the financial restructuring and to help the farmers fill out many of these applications.


The big message that we were telling our farmers was: 'Do not self-assess. Make sure you get the help that you need so that you can have independent people come in and look at your books and your business and, in relation to other pieces of off-farm income that may have been coming into the household, see whether or not you are able to access part or all of the just under $2,000 per couple per month at the maximum.' Effectively, just in the area of the farm household support, that is putting about $23,000 to $24,000 per year on the table for those families. When you read that in conjunction with access to a low-interest loan—again, the former minister was able to make these low-interest loans available for up to half of your loan—we found that many people were taking advantage of that as well, and the combined saving was somewhere in the vicinity of $50,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for government to help those farming businesses that have the capacity to see their way through this to a fruitful future in the following years, and that's the way it has been.


The dairy industry now has improved markedly. There are still many farmers out there that are really doing it tough, and there is no set model of a dairy farmer at the moment. If someone were to ask you, 'How's dairy going at the moment?' you can't really answer that question, because the models within the dairy farming structures are so diverse and so different. If a farmer in the Goulburn Valley owns their own water, that's an enormous benefit, an enormous plus. Obviously the debt profile of the various farmers makes a huge difference. Their ability to produce their own hay and feed also makes a very big difference to the economic viability of our farmers. All of these factors swirling around together will somehow or other give you a profile as to how our dairy farmers are going. As I said, they are just so diverse and so different. It is very difficult.


But this bill is now going to show the benefits of this farmer support package. The benefits to these households are going to be extended for another 12 months, and it's a fantastic thing that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, has been able to push through. As I said just recently, the right thing to do for the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Mark Coulton, along with the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud, was to tour those outback regions of New South Wales and Queensland to make sure that they see firsthand what seven years of below-average rainfall has meant for those areas from northern Victoria up into Queensland.


I have been speaking to quite a few farmers about farm household support and farm household allowance recently, and I just want to quote one farmer who spoke to me just recently and said:


As a farmer directly impacted by the Murray Goulburn Milk price drop in April 2016, the effects have been long lasting. The impacts on cash flow have been long and unrelenting.


Being able to access the Farm Household Allowance during this time has provided some breathing space and peace of mind knowing that assistance with reduced cash flows; you can put food on the table each week and provide the essentials for your family, while you attempt to rebuild your business.


Our assigned case manager has been very supportive through the process over the past 2 years in assessing our situation, providing guidance and developing a plan for the future.


This is the part that often gets left behind. Yes, we are helping initially with farm household support by putting some cash on the table to help pay for groceries, for school fees and the essential bills. We are helping out in the medium to longer term also with the low-interest loans that can be worked into a business to take up to 50 per cent of outstanding loans. The case managers from Rural Finance are put in the business as well to give them the support they need with counselling. They have that financial acumen introduced into the farming business as well to see where their future lies. In the message I received that was hugely appreciated.


It is great when you come into this place and see these genuine benefits. We're helping these people and making a real difference. This is a practical situation. We are making a difference to these people who are in a very tough position at the moment. They needed this support. Some of these three-year periods of drought are coming to an end. Now it's going to be extended for a further 12 months. This, along with farm management deposits, gives us an opportunity to help people get themselves through really tough times. 


This is something we in the National Party are really supportive of. It's fantastic that many people have seen the worst of the dairy crisis and are now working through it and can see a bright future. There are still many others who, with their water costs and debt profile, are in a very precarious situation. It would be a good thing if they could produce milk at a price below what they are paid for it. Certainly the 830-odd farmers who were assisted through the dairy crisis have been very appreciative. Hopefully, this is something that they will look back on and say: 'Thank goodness the government of the day understood what was needed and were able to move quickly and give us the assistance they gave us so that we got through the very toughest of times. They put counselling around us so that we could in a calm and measured way assess our future and either exit the industry with assets intact or push ahead and create a more promising future.'


I commend this bill to the House. I certainly hope that these measures are there for the next crisis, because we know that when you live in Australia you are always going to have crises when it comes to farming practices.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (18:28):  At the beginning of my remarks on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 I want to correct the record on something that the member for Murray said in relation to Labor's approach to the Murray-Darling Basin and our history on reaching a bipartisan approach to the management of the Murray-Darling. It was a former Labor government that ended the water wars, the dispute between the states, and that brought the states together and actually implemented the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. You can tell that the member for Murray didn't actually live in the electorate of Murray during the water wars and the crisis, because he would have remembered that the Murray was actually dry. Farmers didn't actually have access to the water he stood up and said that Labor stole from his farmers. We all accept that he was involved in football and was off playing or coaching AFL, but he shouldn't stand up here and mislead the House and say that it was Labor who stole the water off the farmers during that millennium drought when there was no water. The Murray was dry. It was that crisis that triggered Labor to work with the states to reach a bipartisan position to end the water wars and restore the health of the Murray.


The health of the Murray is critical to farmers. We know that. We understand that. Labor continue to work with agricultural industries and communities on ensuring that: the next generation of farmers, and the generation after, have access to water for agriculture over the long term; our environment has the water it needs to regenerate; all states have their fair share; and, most importantly, the Murray-Darling system is healthy.


That's not the only area where the government is failing agriculture and our farmers. They've become known as the government that likes to talk, to meet and to tinker around the edges. They're also a government that likes to smash things and blow things up in some ways, and we've seen that countless times from this government in agriculture. In the area of labour this government is failing to ensure farmers have not just a seasonal workforce but a skilled workforce, ready to plant and harvest crops in the regions, so that the agricultural industry continues to be viable.


Labour is one of the big issues raised with me by farm organisations throughout this country. Only this afternoon I met with Voice of Horticulture, who are furious and frustrated with this government for its failure to crack down on migrant worker exploitation and, more importantly, close existing tax loopholes that allow these dodgy firms to thrive. We talked about the need to restrict access to ABNs. This is part of Labor Party policy. If we stopped international students and backpackers from accessing ABNs then they would be less likely to be exploited or to start a labour-hire business and exploit other people here on temporary arrangements. It's becoming less rare that Voice of Horticulture stand side by side with Labor on a policy announcement, yet nobody in the government says that is possible to do or believes there is a need to do it.


When it comes to labour, the government is also failing to ensure our TAFEs in the regions have courses that meet the needs of farmers and the agricultural industry. TAFEs throughout the regions have been gutted. That has been driven by the massive funding cuts state and federal Liberal governments have imposed on the vocational education and training sector. That has left a skills gap in the regions, and more and more farmers in our agricultural industry are looking to 457 visa holders and backpackers to fill those gaps. They say to me on a regular basis that, if a local were available, they would hire a local. They want people to live and work in the regions, but local workers simply don't have the skills to do so. That is such a shame when we look at the youth unemployment rate, which is at 19 or 20 per cent in some of these regional areas. We have the young people; we just need to give them the skills and the opportunities and to match them to existing farming and agricultural jobs.


This government is also failing to support farmers and the agricultural sector when it comes to innovation. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with strawberry farmers in South-East Queensland who, off their own bat, have decided to introduce tabletop strawberry farming, where it's off the ground. They're among the first to do this in Australia. That means they're using fewer chemicals to keep pests off their crops. It also means that, because they are now off the ground, they are more water efficient and have higher yields.


If you're in Coles and see Taste 'N See strawberries, pick them up, because they are an example of innovation within the strawberry industry. This government did nothing to support them in doing that. These growers, knowing that there would be a change in the chemicals that they could use, got in front. They wanted to increase their yield, but they knew that the quality of their soil was such that it would really start to diminish the returns on their crops. They had to go to the banks and argue for finance to introduce this new capital, this new farming technology—and they're glad they did so. They're hoping to get a return on that capital. They're also employers. As farmers, they directly employ all of their staff. That's another reason why you should buy their strawberries. They are not alone when it comes to saying that too often this government is looking backwards, sticking on bandaids, only moving a few steps forward, being reactionary and not out there driving the innovation, the productivity and the investment in our agricultural industries.


When it comes to exports, this government is failing. For all of its championing of the free trade agreement—oops, it forgot about the non-tariff barriers, which are killing our agricultural industries when it comes to exports. It doesn't matter whether it's wine, which is a big part of my world, or it's our horticultural produce or it's our red-meat exports, non-tariff barriers are blocking our ability to expand export markets and therefore expand farm gate prices.


This government is also failing farmers and agricultural industries when it comes to climate change. Our farmers recognise that our climate is changing. You hear every day and you learn every day about the amazing innovative projects that our farmers are embracing in a whole range of areas to improve their productivity and water efficiency to adapt to climate change. Whether it be greater use of the NBN and mobile technology or it be improving their cropping and crop rotations, our farmers get that the climate is changing. They want to continue to be productive and profitable on the land, and so they want to see innovation, partnership, coordination and leadership from the government in this space.


The reason why I mention climate change is that it is linked to drought. This is where we get to talk about how this government has spectacularly failed on drought mitigation and drought reform. Under Labor, there was an approach through COAG where we brought the states together to say that we need to start investing and delivering long-term drought policy. We said: 'Let's actually do the research. Let's actually look at what we are farming. How can we farm better? How can we droughtproof our industries going forward? How can we mitigate the effects of drought?' When this government came into office, it did a classic thing and abolished that entire approach. It has not been picked up since Labor was last in government. It is not being dealt with. In fact, the government has just shelved it. People in the government don't even believe in climate change, let alone believe in tackling the effects that climate change is having on drought.


When it comes to the farm household assistance legislation before us, the government is, as with so many approaches that it takes, literally just tinkering at the edges. I remember when this legislation was first introduced. We used to have a rural financial counselling service in my electorate of Bendigo—before this government abolished it and sacked all of those people—and, shortly after this legislation was introduced, they came to me and said: 'We're meeting with farmers, and they're really frustrated because they're not meeting the criteria. The criteria are too rigid, and they're struggling to get the paperwork forms approved by Centrelink in the period of time before they would have to start the paperwork all over again.' It took many of them almost 12 months to get access to the loans. All of us might remember how the minister at the time had to come in here and correct his answer, and then he corrected the Hansard, because of comments that he had made in relation to this. It is an issue where the government has really dropped the ball. Yes, I'm sure farmers will welcome an extra year when it comes to the farm household support; however, it's not enough. It's not a long-term solution. It's not an ongoing solution. It doesn't really work with people to resolve the broader problems and challenges that we're facing in horticulture, in agriculture and in our farming industries.


The previous speaker and other members have spoken about concessional loans. I've never met a farmer yet who wants to take on more debt if they're drowning in debt. Most of them are saying, 'We've got to do better than this.' Farmers who are doing well, who innovate, might be willing to risk extra debt because they can see light at the end of the tunnel. But, if you're already drowning under a mountain of debt and if you've already got the banks coming after you, more debt is not what you're interested in. While we're talking about debt, we also need to remind the House about the disaster which is the government's newest creation: the Regional Investment Corporation, which we think will be in Bathurst; they don't quite have an office yet. Media reports are that they were meeting on a park bench to talk about their organisation starting. I'm not quite sure we want financial decisions from an investment corporation meeting in a park or on a park bench, particularly given that we have Rural Finance based in Victoria now managed by the Bendigo Bank, a sound financial institution that has been doing this kind of work for many years here in Australia. This is who the government wants to take work away from—the Bendigo Bank and Rural Finance—and give it to the Regional Investment Corporation, which at the moment doesn't have an office and which is meeting on a park bench. This is another example of just how hopeless this government is when it comes to the agricultural industry. Whether it be farm household assistance loans, whether it be in relation to financing, whether it be policy around labour hire, whether it be policy and implementation on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, whether it be around innovation and embracing innovation in our farm industries or whether it be about abolishing or working to abolish non-tariff barriers or about climate change, this government is really failing to support Australian farmers in our agricultural industries.


The amendment that has been moved by the member for Hunter allows people on this side to call the government out for its rhetoric. The government has to do more than just extend a welfare payment from three years to four years. Our farmers want to be innovative. They want to exist into the future. They need a government that will work with them and provide leadership, not just more tinkering at the edges.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (18:43):  I'm pleased to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. In listening to speakers on both sides of the House, I cannot help but observe the political nature of this debate, even though there's broad acceptance that it's not a particularly political issue—it's not. Farmers who may be tuned into the proceedings—and I'm sure most of mine would not be—would probably be pretty scathing in their assessment of the way that many members of this place have approached this debate. If I consider a man in my electorate who was awarded at the recent Queen's Birthday honours, Brendan Farrell, he has physically and mentally exhausted himself, as have many of the people around him, in order to transport hay from our region to western Queensland. He's very critical of politicians. He acknowledged that the government has recently increased some drought relief measures, but called for further assistance, mainly relating to hefty freight costs. Brendan heard about a farmer in the New South Wales town of Bourke struggling with drought, and that galvanised him into action. He has now completed more than 11 hay runs to help the drought-affected farmers across New South Wales and Queensland. He has noted that it's an emotional rollercoaster: 'One minute you're laughing, the next minute you're bawling your eyes out. You can be standing there with people and their kids, just talking about how much it will take to get better.' Brendan Farrell has been doing this for 4½ years, assisting struggling farmers around the country. He was driven by a desire to simply lend a hand. I'm sure he treats his Queen's Birthday honour with the larrikin disrespect that we would expect from an Australian of his stature.


I want to bring something of his spirit and his attitude to this debate this evening because this is not a political issue and, unfortunately, so many people in this place treat drought and legislation as something that's—I won't say going wrong in our farming communities, because drought is part of a way of life and a farming way of life. They think there's something that must be done; it's all about what we do in here. Do we tinker around the edges, as the previous speaker said? Do we add more money, as we did during the millennium drought, in huge quantities that we no longer have? Do we put more personnel on the ground? Of course, we do many of these things, and so we should, particularly around mental health and support, but governments can't always make it better, and it's very important to recognise that.


Certainly climate change is biting in rural Australia. Certainly it is in rural New South Wales and in my electorate of Farrer. I can remember people who talked about water flows in the Darling River, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee—I represent substantial parts of those three great river systems—reflecting on how much less water there is. When we talk about the environment and irrigators, we also have to factor climate change in. The extremes of temperature are more noticeable. If you talk to the old timers, you certainly get a long and pretty consistent narrative. I remember the late Peter Cullen, who was a hero in environmental water circles. I clashed with him on many occasions, being very much on the side of the irrigators. I remember him saying Australia has more than 40 years of wetter-than-average temperatures followed by 40 years of drier-than-average temperatures. Clearly that pattern is persisting, but within those broad blocks of years the extremes are getting greater. We are going to be confronted with drought and we are going to be confronted with the necessity to support our farmers.


I'm very pleased that I believe this government has a strong and supportive drought assistance policy. We must work more closely with state governments, of course, because farmers don't notice the difference. The No. 1 thing they are calling for in my electorate is freight subsidies. I talked about Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, and that's what they do—they pick up hay and they transport it north from farmers who donate it. Members of the community donate the money to allow that to happen. Freight subsidies are vital because that's what you're doing—you're moving fodder to animals and keeping your breeding stock going because, if you lose your breeding stock, you lose a lot of heart.


I've been a farmer myself for 17 years, through some of the worst droughts and the worst times on the land. There were some highs in there as well, although sometimes, looking back, I find it harder and harder to find them. I remember reading a Time international article talking about the Australian drought, when it didn't often talk about Australia at all. There was a quote on the back page from somebody in rural Australia saying, 'You can't send a man out day after day to shoot his stock.' I cut that page out and pinned it on the wall of the office. I looked at it every day because the last thing I wanted was to go out and shoot stock. Eventually, with the price crash for sheep, that's exactly what happened, but it wasn't necessarily in the context of a drought.


I represented western New South Wales during 10 years of the hardest drought we have ever seen, with dust storms and heartache. I can remember visiting properties where people had destocked. You would think that once you had destocked, you could then put everything in a holding pattern because you didn't have to worry about your stock dying and you didn't have to worry about transporting them away or transporting feed in. But, interestingly enough, what actually happened to farmers when they destocked and lost their stock was that they suddenly felt completely irrelevant; they'd lost the reason to get up in the morning. It had an extraordinarily negative affect.


We had some amazing rural financial counsellors in my electorate during that time. I want to mention Brian Dodson, who was one of them. He's still well known. You're only supposed to deal with the finances, but he was there for every single member of a farming family. They didn't want to talk to someone they didn't know about personal problems—it gets very personal—so they talked to him. I'm sure he crossed the line a few times when it came to the engagement that he was supposed to have. But he was there when he was needed, because when you have to make the tough decisions—and we talk about the tough decisions—they are extraordinarily difficult to make.


We, as a government, probably spent a billion dollars in interest rate subsidies for exceptional circumstances interest rate relief and household support during that drought. That was an extraordinary transfer of funds from taxpayers to farmers. If you look back on what happened to that money and where it went, an awful lot went to the banks. I would regularly challenge them with, 'What are you going to do about it, because you're getting your payments made where, in different circumstances, you would be writing them off?' A lot went to the banks. A lot went to farmers who subsequently didn't make it.


The difficult thing with farming is that, when you're well set up and you've worked hard to give yourself a buffer, it's not just about hard work. A lot of it is luck. If you don't have a huge amount of debt and you're not a young farmer, then clearly you're going to be better prepared for a drought. A lot of it was: 'I've done all of the things that I'm supposed to do, and I don't qualify for any drought support because my partner works off-farm and I've got too many assets.' There was genuine annoyance from some of the farmers when they saw others who, in their view, might not have prepared so well or might not have run their properties so well, or whose farm programs were effectively getting quite a lot of government support. It did create divides in rural communities, and that was unfortunate.


If our objective, as a government, is to sustain the rural sector, then there isn't any point in large transfers of funds to people who ultimately don't stay in the rural sector, whose properties get bought out. But there certainly is a point in supporting those families from a human perspective, making sure that they have time to adjust, to properly exit their properties and to do so with dignity and move on to another stage of their lives. Certainly, the drought support did that. I would run into those individuals in the towns of Western New South Wales and North-Western Victoria quite regularly and realise that they'd left their farms behind. Sometimes they had been fourth- or fifth-generation farmers, and they were fine. It always surprised me a little. I'm not saying that all of them were fine. There were two things that made them fine. One was that they actually had sold their properties for good money. No matter how tough it got, the value of land didn't go down—we don't expect that, and it's very difficult to see that that could happen in the current situation. They sold and they got paid a good sum of money, and the next thing they did actually validated their purpose in life—they had something to get up in the morning and do. Often it was working at an engineering shop or working for a rural services industry that supported farms, so their extraordinary knowledge about farming and the rural sector was put to really good use. It is the sort of knowledge that they used every day but never realised had a value.


So there is always light at the end of the tunnel, but the task for government is to make sure that we put the supports in place. Whether that be rural financial counselling—we've expanded the service and we have good rural financial counsellors in my electorate. I just want to talk about the local situation. Griffith and Hay have had no rainfall this month and very little for the previous three months, so it is critical that the government assists farmers and rural communities during these times of hardship. The Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme, the farm household allowance, the Managing Farm Risk Program, the Rural Financial Counselling Service and so on support the effects for farmers and managing—it might be pest animals; it might be weeds in drought-affected areas; and it might be financial preparedness.


The farm household allowance, which is the subject of this bill, was launched in July 2014, and it has helped more than 7,900 people, which is pretty good. It's essentially an adjustment payment that comes with free financial counselling, through the Rural Financial Counselling Service, to help farmers restructure their businesses. The amendments that we are moving today include an extension from three to four years of the time that these services are available, which is a more appropriate time frame to assist farmers when they might need to transition to get back on their feet. It has been pretty scary for some of them. Many, I have to say, who have been the recipients of government support year after year after year have recently been told by their financial counsellors: 'Actually, that's it. There isn't anything left.' So this extra year is very valuable. I want to give a shout out to those rural financial counsellors: Darren Macartney at Hay, Graham Christie at Coleambally, Murray Freshwater at Deniliquin, Haidee Laycock, who looks after Griffith and Leeton, Linda McLean at Hillston and Graeme Witte, who's the counsellor at Wentworth.


You think of drought in Australia as being about the wide plains, with dust and no grass growing, and of course it is, but it's also about irrigation water, because, when a drought bites, the requirements for water for irrigated agriculture increase considerably, the reason being that you don't have any prewatering of your pasture. The other tension that enters the equation is that your water allocations—which next month, I suspect, will start off at zero—stay pretty low, so you really have to be concerned about your farm program. If you're an irrigated farmer, you've invested a lot more money, it's a much more intensive operation and you often need activity, which means you need to run a farm program.


With the drought in about 2003, I remember taking the then Prime Minister, John Howard, to Finley. No other Australian Prime Minister had visited Finley before or has done so since. He was incredibly impressed by the people who serviced the rural sector there and the fact that irrigation was different. What we then did was change the rules for the exceptional circumstances program to assist irrigators, recognising that the normal parameters of that program meant they didn't qualify—but they then did. We also added small businesses because John Howard met an incredible woman called Robyn Mott in an accounting service in Finley. She did so many things for the community for nothing, and she made an amazing sponge cake which I'm sure he's never forgotten. He came back and said to Sharman Stone, the then member for Murray, and me, 'We need to find a way to extend this to small businesses as well.'


I use those examples because I know that the government now stands ready to do exactly those things—or not exactly those things but to act in a similar way: to watch closely to see how bad this drought gets. It's creeping from northern New South Wales down into my electorate. You don't say things are bad or worse; it hasn't gone on as long as what we saw in 2003. But, if it does, I know that this government and this parliament will stand ready to assist and take the necessary next steps.


Coming back to Brendan Farrell and his hay runners, he does it without government—he doesn't particularly like politicians—and he does it with the community. The community is always ready to help. So wherever you are in Australia, if you can help and there's an opportunity for you to do that, I encourage you to. I know that so many will step up and support our rural sector.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-06-26,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (18:57):  I would like to acknowledge the contributions from the member for Mallee and the member for Farrer in this debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. There were a lot of important ideas and also observations from their experiences. I think all of us in this chamber who represent farming communities and communities that have lived through these intense drought experiences that we've been seeing multiply and amplify in recent years would really identify with and feel an emotional attachment with a lot of the issues that have been raised and discussed.


But I would say that I am disappointed. I am particularly disappointed in the leadership of the Nationals in these last five years. As soon as a drought passes, it's almost like, 'Rightio, that's over and done with—no need to worry about proper planning for the future anymore.' It takes me back to the old Army golden rule that you always hope for the best but you plan and prepare for the worst.


I don't think any sentient human being now can deny the threat that is being presented to our rural and regional communities by climate change. These circumstances of drought are definitely intensifying, deepening and becoming more variable, with fewer predictable situations. I've often said my region of Eden-Monaro is like the canary in the coalmine in many ways. If you look at, for example, our ski industry in the high country and you go and talk to the Snowy Hydro people, you will see their data is unequivocally showing that the ski seasons are crimping in at both ends, and the snow levels are going higher. We are at risk of losing a $2 billion industry that's half the economy of the Monaro. On top of that, our farmers—including the fruitgrowers over in the Batlow area, the famous Batlow apple growers—really depend on a very predictable weather pattern situation. That has been completely distorted and difficult to do in recent years, and of course the drought affected the high country. It's affecting it right now and putting our farmers in the high country under severe stress. On the coast we have this increasing risk of salination and the like and also changes in rain patterns.


So there's been a lot of intense distress. I'm pleased to say that at least, out of that last big millennial drought, the farmers in the high country formed Monaro Farming Systems and for the first time aggregated. That enabled them to look after each other a bit better and swap more ideas. But, most particularly, it allowed them to work more closely with the CSIRO, who helped develop a modelling tool, called GrassGro, to give them the ability to plan ahead for their properties over a 50-year cycle. It enabled them to do their paddock and beast management and it gave them something to latch onto, which was really important for their mental health.


But what disturbs me is that, when we were in government, we were right on the trailing edges of that millennium drought—2008 and 2009 were particularly bad final years—and we did look at the exceptional circumstances regime. I think everybody would accept that it wasn't satisfactory. In my region, I had some people who were on one side of the boundary of the exceptional circumstances regime experiencing the same weather situation as the people over the other side of the harsh line drawn on the map but not getting exceptional circumstances relief. Again, I had a lot of farmers complaining to me that exceptional circumstances didn't distinguish between successful farmers—good farmers—and farmers who were in trouble not because of drought but because they weren't particularly good farmers. The farmers were raising these issues with me.


As a consequence, we sent this issue to the Productivity Commission, which I think was a good way to look at it. We wanted to really get down to the nitty-gritty of how we were going to handle these droughts at the same time as we were addressing climate change policy. The review that was done by the Productivity Commission also led us to form the intergovernmental agreement using the COAG process, trying to address these issues on a national level, because we couldn't accept the patchiness of the state-by-state approach for a national issue. That led us to form the Standing Committee for Primary Industries and Resources and the Standing Council on Primary Industries—very important mechanisms that were working their way forward. They of course produced the review, which included the Intergovernmental Agreement on the National Drought Program Reform. It made some particularly important findings and comments, including an economic assessment of drought support measures and an assessment of social impacts of drought on farm families and rural communities, using an expert panel and a climatic assessment by the Bureau of Meteorology, and it conducted pilot studies. There was a focus on the relief that's needed and the mechanisms—and we're talking here about the farm household support arrangements as part of what they were reviewing—but more particularly they were looking at the key objectives:


… assist farm families and primary producers adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability—


and—


… encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage their business risks


This is really the key. Most farmers and farming families will tell you that they want to find ways to deal with the challenges they're facing that don't involve just a draw on the taxpayer to get them through these situations; they want to get ahead of the curve.


Added to the situation of trashing those arrangements that we put in place through COAG, which pointed the way of having to develop policy to address that longer-term issue and the management issue of these farms, we've seen more recently, in these last five years, the damage that's been done to the APVMA by the decentralisation policy. We've lost 30 per cent of the scientists in of that organisation. Evidence that we've heard says that the organisation has been set back seven years, and really it's the APVMA that helps design research and implement science into the management of these changed circumstances—how we can deal with managing the different types of pest situations that come from drought conditions. As an example of that, further down in the high country in my region we had a plague of wingless grasshoppers, and the science told us that was largely caused by the dieback situation. The parasitic nematodes that used to keep the numbers of the wingless grasshoppers down were not there because of the loss of forestation in our region, and it led to the plague of wingless grasshoppers that completely devastated farming land in that area. 


All of these are things that the APVMA helps with, and what we've done is cripple it through this decentralisation process. Also, of course, we saw other issues like getting rid of the inspector-general in relation to live exports. We know that is a really serious issue; it's put us back to square one and we're facing revisiting these issues with live exports. Every time we have one of these incidents and those videos, meat consumption goes down. The butchers tell me they can't sell the meat anymore. So there are a whole range of flow-on effects from not getting to grips with these issues, and getting rid of the inspector-general mechanism was a really retrograde step. 


On top of that, we saw the issues that emerged around the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It seems that those growers and the allegations of mishandling and corruption et cetera in the northern edges of the Murray-Darling Basin were more of a priority than those farmers who were living downstream—the farmers all the way through southern New South Wales and South Australia. It didn't seem to matter what was happening to them, whereas, when we were in government, we put a lot of effort into water efficiency measures as a long-term solution to some of these issues. That included the need for farmers to pick up new techniques in irrigation—lining irrigation channels and covering them using pipes et cetera. We heard the member for Mallee talk about that as a step forward in his area. With the issue of drip irrigation, I was in the border portfolio with Senator Wong and we travelled all over the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember visiting an almond grower who had a perfect situation for drip irrigation with permanent plantings, and he said he didn't trust those lines, because he was worried about them getting clogged. Well, Israel—and the rest of the world that has faced these kinds of arid, water management situations—has been very productive and very efficient and has shown good results from adopting those types of techniques. 


Along with what we invested in government in water efficiency measures, there were also a lot of other benefits. We have to make sure that farmers can diversify and insulate themselves against these conditions but also adopt better methods to get through drier times and keep their soils healthy. One of the measures that assisted them that we introduced was the Carbon Farming Initiative. That allowed farmers to get involved with methodologies that would help sequester carbon while at the same time introduce better health to their soils by getting carbon back into their soils. There was a lot of opportunity for them to diversify their income through adopting measures under the Carbon Farming Initiative. One of the things that I was looking at in particular was getting our farmers to aggregate in, perhaps, a forestry co-op where they could have portions of their properties dedicated to re-forestation and have a broker who could organise the whole arrangement of the methodology and approval and give them another stream of income on their property. There were so many possibilities in that Carbon Farming Initiative and in sequestration. 


Now we are seeing good, smart farmers like Charles Massy, a farmer near Cooma in my electorate, who has a PhD and is a very progressive and innovative farmer. We had a great meeting in Yass just a few weeks ago. A lot of farmers from the region turned up to hear about his regenerative farming techniques. We've heard a bit before about natural sequence farming. There's been a bit of controversy about that, but some of it is quite sound in terms of how we rehydrate the soil or maintain or slow down water through the landscape. But, certainly, what Charles Massy has been doing through his regenerative farming techniques is very important. 


It's about government really getting behind the science, the experience and the knowledge and arming farmers with the ability to survive, to prosper and to be able to conduct and plan models for their properties over a long period of time. One of the things that I mentioned last night was the no-till and stubble management approach. All of these things could be included and passed on. I'm fortunate that my family, who have all been dairy farmers for 170 years now down in the Bega Valley, are part of an aggregated farming group in the Bega Cheese co-op, which is now no longer a co-op but still operates like it is. Through that, they formed the Bega environmental management system. They were able to apply Commonwealth funding to develop and improve the management of their environment and to restore health to the soil as well. It also enabled those farmers to communicate with each other and pass on science and ideas. Bega Cheese also helps make sure that that happens through the benefits of its commercial operation and spreading that benefit to farmers.


We saw this so-called listening tour happen just recently, and it didn't go down too well. Obviously they were coming to talk to farmers about issues like farm household support. I welcome the fact that it's been extended by a year, but that still doesn't deliver certainty to these farmers. It seemed from the reports that came back that farmers were singularly unimpressed by what was going on. People like Harry and Jack, who greeted the travelling circus, and John and Joy Haycock at Trangie, for example, were very unimpressed by the visit. I talked about this idea of hoping for the best but planning for the worst. We've seen the reverse of that in some of the approaches taken by this travelling circus. Mr Haycock said he couldn't understand why that leadership group was there if they didn't have anything to announce. He said: 


On Sunday night we had hope, now we know they're going to do nothing, when you take hope away people get desperate, they'd have been better off not coming.

I've voted Nationals all my life at state level, never again.


I think that's one of the reasons why, when I was standing at the Gundagai booth at the Cootamundra by-election, there was a 43 per cent swing away. It was 43 per cent. You can see the erosion. If the Nationals are going to ignore what's going on out there, they will get more of what happened in Orange and more situations like Tumbarumba. Tumbarumba absolutely went red-hot in support of me in the last campaign because of this issue. The Nationals are ignoring what their farmers are saying. In the last big survey of farmers—1,300 farmers in a Farmer Climate Survey—nine in 10 farmers surveyed said they were concerned about damage to the climate and about climate change and 88 per cent of them said they wanted their politicians to do more about it. They really are upset about this. There'll be some argument about what causes climate change and all those sorts of issues, but this is the result of a farmer survey—88 per cent say their politicians should be doing more. They accept that there is climate change and that there should be something done about it.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (19:12):  I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. As the member for Eden-Monaro leaves, I'll say his was quite a thoughtful response until the last three minutes. It's a shame he wrecked it. This bill is in response to the tour that the Prime Minister, the agriculture minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the local government minister, the regional telecommunications minister, the regional health minister and I had through western New South Wales and Queensland a couple of weeks ago. The sad reality is that this drought is really biting. In some places, people have used the household support for the three years that was part of the original requirement for this. This extension will certainly help those people out.


This farm household support is more than just the financial support that helps pay those vital bills, that puts food on the table, that puts tyres on the family car, that pays for the phone and the like. With this support comes assistance from the Rural Financial Counselling Service to help those farms that are in that difficult circumstance come up with a management plan post-drought, whatever that may be, whether it's exiting the industry or restructuring their finances to enable them to continue on. The reports that I'm getting back from the people who have been on this household support—and I think it's now about 7,000 around Australia—have been quite positive. So this extension is a good thing; it is unfortunate that we've got a drought of this magnitude where we needed to do this.


It is interesting that the member for Hunter has some ridiculous amendment attached to this very important piece of legislation. It was his party in government that removed the word 'drought' from the language of government. They were so obsessed with their discussions around climate change and emissions-trading schemes that they changed the word 'drought' to 'dryness' and said, 'This is how Australia's going to be for now and evermore; we just need to get used to it.'


I want to comment on some of the policies that the government has that are really helping people to get through this drought. I understand that many people are in serious financial difficulties, but many aren't—because of the policies that were in the white paper. I'll go through them, and I'll start with the farm management deposits, now $800,000 per farm partner to be put away: they're very useful in helping with the vagaries of the climate. To use the Walgett region as an example: they've had one good year out of four. That good year was a very good year in a cropping region, with very high income for that year through the farm management deposits. They were able to even that income out to help them through the difficult times that they're having at the moment. Another one is the accelerated depreciation for grain storages—hay sheds and silos. That has been very, very popular throughout my electorate, and as I'm driving around I see many new silo complexes and hay sheds where farmers have taken that tax advantage and invested, managing to prepare themselves for the dry times.


The other one is the accelerated depreciation for water and fencing. Particularly in the grazing areas, more in the west of my electorate, those water schemes have enabled a better use of pasture, and farmers have managed to retain their pasture longer into this drought because they've had the water points in more strategic places, rather than central watering points through large dams and whatnot. Another policy that has been of benefit in some areas is the money that has gone into cluster fencing. Late last year, I was at the opening of a 220-kilometre long fence at Gilgunyah, north-west of Condobolin. There are, I think, 10 properties inside the fence that have now been able to manage a lot of the pest animals that were really impacting on their pasture management and also on their animal health, with wild dogs and pigs having an effect on lambing percentages and the like. These are good, practical measures that we have put into place.


The previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro, was talking about the innovation and the good work that farmers are doing, and that's true. When we get into a dry period like this, one of the disappointments is that it looks like farmers are not managing their situation, whereas the clear majority of them are. With the farming techniques that are being used, farmers are growing crops in a climate that their parents and grandparents would not have been able to grow in. The work that's being done with zero-till, and the advances in machinery with disc planters and GPS control—all of those things have enabled farmers to deal with the drier seasonal conditions. As I said, many of the farmers in my area are managing through this.


There were some comments in the previous speeches about the Prime Minister's visit to my electorate in particular. I really think those negative comments don't relate to what I saw on the ground. The farmers were very pleased to see their Prime Minister and a large number of cabinet ministers there. If the Prime Minister had come to my electorate and made an announcement without consulting with anyone, the justifiable criticism would have been: 'No-one came and asked what we wanted. We're getting governed from Canberra.' In the Prime Minister's defence, in my 10 years—and we've had a variety of prime ministers over that period of time—I've never seen a Prime Minister put three days in regional Australia, listening to farmers, not being distracted, taking notes and being completely focused on the serious issue at hand.




Mr Dick:
  What did Tony Abbott do?




Mr COULTON:
  I say what I said—in 10 years I've never seen a Prime Minister do that. I've had other prime ministers from both sides of the House visit my electorate, but not one that was so focused on the issue at hand. That was very well received.


I think that we will look at other issues apart from the farm household support. I think the work around mental health is good. That sometimes is just creating activities as a distraction to get off the farm. I remember the 1990s, when we were going through a particularly dry time. I come to this place with some experience as a farmer dealing with drought. I was a farmer for 33 years before I came here, so I've got some idea what I'm talking about. I remember that in the 1990s in a particularly severe drought a group of my colleagues undertook a beef management course. That was as much about getting together once a week, having a chat and having a few beers afterwards. It was about meeting with each other and talking through our issues and how we were dealing with things. Quite often these mental health programs in the bush are just a way for people to get together as a group and have a yarn. In Warialda a group of men are now doing yoga, believe it or not. Some of my friends would be horrified that I'm letting their secret out. They probably undo at the pub afterwards all the good they do at yoga in becoming more flexible, but it is an outlet for them to get together and work through the issues, because it is a very stressful time.


I do support this important bill. I treat the addition from the member for Hunter with the contempt that it deserves. This is sensible legislation that's needed. I think there's probably more to come as we work our way through this drought. I think there's more work we can do in the fencing space. Those things will keep people busy and improve the management possibilities in those areas. I commend this bill to the House.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-06-26,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (19:23):  I rise to support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018. Our farmers make an extraordinary contribution to our national economy and prosperity. In fact, agriculture has been the stand-out sector for the Australian economy in recent times. Our farmers don't have the tariff protections or subsidies that farmers in other countries enjoy. They deal with comparatively high power prices and labour prices, sometimes a high Australian dollar and sometimes low commodity prices. They are extraordinarily resilient, but they are not indestructible. That's why we have to support them through this latest trial—drought.


The drought is certainly biting very hard in central western New South Wales. The paddocks in many areas have turned to dust. It's so bad that parts of the Calare electorate look like a moonscape. The ground is so parched and dry that sometimes it seems like it's literally crying out. Feed is scarce, increasingly expensive and also increasingly expensive to transport to the properties in need, if you can find it.


We can't take our farmers for granted. If we want them here, creating wealth for our nation, we need to be supporting them at the time when they need it most. There are heartbreaking stories in country Australia at the moment. I've heard them as I've met with farmers around the region, from Lithgow to Mudgee, Gulgong, Oberon, Bathurst, Orange, Cumnock, Yeoval and Wellington. The stories are real and they're stories of Australians, our fellow Australians, battling to get through. It's not just the drudgery of feeding every day and checking troughs and dams; there is an immense toll from the uncertainty with respect to what will happen. What's going to happen in the future? What will happen to breeding stock? How will they be fed? The financial uncertainty weighs heavily, as does the uncertainty as to how it will be possible to rebuild once the drought passes.


All over central western New South Wales, as in other parts of Australia, communities are coming together to support each other, but they need a hand. Good intentions are one thing, but our farmers need support on the ground. The outlook, I have to say, is very worrying. If good rain doesn't come, a very bad and grim situation is going to get a whole lot worse in the very near future. The worsening outlook is why we need to be ramping up drought support as the season worsens and the conditions deteriorate. That's why I was very pleased to see the farm household allowance extended. The announcement followed the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources' visit to the central west, where we met with local farmers. It also followed the Prime Minister's tour with the minister to drought-affected areas. In fact, when the minister visited the central west, we stood in a paddock where a crop we were looking at had achieved only a 30 per cent germination rate, and that was one of the good paddocks in the region.


The farm household allowance is an important drought assistance measure which aims at putting food on the table and diesel in the ute when farmers simply don't have enough money for the necessities. It was launched in 2004, and since then almost 8,000 people have been assisted, at a cost of $230 million. In terms of the amount of the assistance itself, you're looking at around $530 to $580 per fortnight for singles and just under $1,000 per fortnight for couples. It helps get farmers through, and it comes with counselling as well, so it is an important assistance measure. It provides the recipients with the opportunity to take steps to improve their circumstances and self-reliance through a farm financial assessment, financial improvement agreement and additional activity supplements of up to $4,000. The program is uncapped and demand driven, so no-one who is eligible will miss out. The fact that it's been extended from three to four years is, I think, a really important move, and it will be widely welcomed in farming communities across the nation.


It is important to note that farmers should not self-assess when thinking about the farm household allowance and how they can apply for it. There are many stories of farmers self-assessing, only to discover later that they are in fact eligible. So I would encourage any farmers out there to reach out to the Department of Human Services via their hotline—I will give it now; it is 1800686175 or 132316—to find out how they can get more assistance.


The federal government is also supporting farmers through the Rural Financial Counselling Service. This is a very important service, and $70 million has been allocated to it from 2016 to 2020 and, indeed, a further $20 million funding boost has just been announced. It helps around 4,500 people every year and it has about 3,000 clients at any given time, with about 130 counsellors around Australia. As I've said, this drought is taking a financial toll, but it is also taking a huge emotional toll. To many farmers with such a grim outlook, it just seems like things are never going to get better. The Rural Financial Counselling Service is there to help, and it does a great job.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (19:30):  Earlier this month I visited the Kakuma UNHCR refugee camp near the border of Kenya and South Sudan. It's a part of the modern international refugee challenge that is little discussed in the Australian political debate. Kakuma is 30 years old, and around 185,000 refugees are currently seeking temporary refuge in this camp. Many residents of Melbourne's west have called it home on their journey to humanitarian resettlement in Australia. Most spent around a decade in this camp before coming to our country. Australian aid and refugee resettlement policies have had a life-changing impact on thousands of people who have been forced to seek refuge at Kakuma. Kakuma exists only because of the goodwill of the Kenyan government and the support of the international community for the UN and non-government organisations operating in the camp. I saw firsthand the role that Australian aid plays in helping both UNHCR and the World Food Programme support refugees living in this camp while they wait for a durable solution that will let them restart their lives. It's literally a life-saving investment.


I also took the opportunity while I was there to make a delivery of a football kit with boots, keeping gloves, balls and jerseys from Barefoot to Boots, an Aussie NGO founded by two Australian brothers and former South Sudanese refugees—professional footballer Awer Mabil and 'Lost Boy' Awer Bul—and supported by Australian businessman Ian Smith. The mission of Barefoot to Boots is to provide the resources necessary to make refugee camps like Kakuma more sustainable, stimulating and accommodating for their residents. The soccer kit, donated by Altona City Soccer Club and Sunshine Heights Soccer Club and Their Beautiful Game—from my electorate—was the latest addition to more than 2,000 kilograms of football equipment delivered by Barefoot to Boots to refugees around the world. I was thrilled to see the Altona City Soccer Club kit worn by FC Talanta in the Kakuma Divas women's league opening round match last week. In addition to the sporting equipment, Barefoot to Boots also provides educational materials, medical supplies and sanitary products, as well as art and musical equipment, to the camps. I saw firsthand how Barefoot's delivery of ultrasound and incubator equipment to the medical facility at Kakuma, which delivers 400 babies a month, has been a literal lifesaver.


Kakuma—and the work of groups like the UNHCR, WFP and Barefoot to Boots—highlights the nature of the international refugee situation today. Last week the UNHCR marked Refugee Week by releasing its annual Global trends report. This report found that the number of displaced people around the world exceeded 68 million in 2017 and that refugees who had fled their countries to escape conflict and persecution now numbered 25.4 million—a 2.9 million person increase on the number of refugees in 2016, the biggest single-year increase UNHCR has seen. UNHCR highlighted that 85 per cent of refugees live in developing countries, and four out of five refugees live in countries adjoining their own—that is, living in places like Kakuma.


The UNHCR also used the release of its Global trends report to reiterate its call for a new global compact on refugees. The areas of focus for this global compact tell the story of the modern refugee situation. The compact's four objectives are to (1) ease the pressures on host countries, (2) enhance refugee self-reliance, (3) expand access to third-country solutions and (4) support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity. These objectives are designed to enable the international community to respond to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations. They are also objectives that Australia can play a leadership role in achieving.


Australian aid plays a key role in easing pressure on host countries by supporting the provision of essential services to refugees in these camps: food, shelter, sanitation, health care and—crucially for prolonged situations—education. This topic was directly raised with me by Kenyan members of parliament in meetings during my visit. Australian aid and diplomacy can also play an important role in resolving conflict and stabilising regions to enable the safe return of refugees to their homes.


Finally, our humanitarian resettlement program is critical, too, for delivering on these objectives, particularly in light of the 40 per cent fall in the number of refugees resettled in 2017—a record increase in the number of refugees but a 40 per cent fall in the number resettled. New pathways like resettlement and like community or private sponsorship of refugees should play an important role in rising to this challenge. The Australian debate on asylum seekers and refugees is passionate and involves many people of goodwill but is also too narrow— (Time expired)

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:00):  Last  week I attended a briefing on alleged human rights violations in Vietnam. The allegations came as a surprise to me. I have always seen Vietnam as a country on the rise, making great economic progress, of independent thinking and of balanced, stable government. However, it appears that, particularly in recent times, and since the election of a new government in 2016, there has been widespread persecution, including arrests, imprisonment and physical violence, in response to criticism of or protest against government. There are allegations of religious freedom also being restricted by authorities, with both Christian and Buddhist followers, in particular, being targeted, religious property being destroyed and religious leaders being prevented from travelling. Labour unions are also banned, and labour activists are being surveilled and harassed.


Australia is home to some 295,000 Vietnamese people or people with Vietnamese ancestry, and I have no doubt that reports of what is occurring in Vietnam would be of grave concern to them. They would hold real fears for the safety and wellbeing of their family members and friends still living in Vietnam. Their fears would also relate to any return travel to Vietnam that they may have planned. Vietnam is a near neighbour to Australia and a growing trade partner. Vietnam is a party to the TPP, which Australia has an interest in. I therefore call on the Turnbull government, and, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, who have regular contact with international countries, to use whatever influence they have to, firstly, raise questions about human rights abuse with the Vietnamese government; secondly, call for the release of prisoners of conscience detained by Vietnamese authorities; and, thirdly, lift travel bans imposed on Vietnamese civic leaders.


I started my address by talking about allegations of human rights abuse. I don't know if those allegations are true or not, but I can only take them on face value, based on the reports that have been presented to members of parliament and that I have read in the paper. Whether Australia can, indeed, influence the Vietnamese government I don't know, but the best hope for the people in Vietnam who are having their freedoms, allegedly, restricted is for the international community, including Australia, to take an interest in and a stand over the growing allegations of human rights abuse in Vietnam.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (16:45):  I'm proud to be an Australian farmer and I'm equally proud of all our Australian farmers, who work so hard, day in, day out, in this country. We often farm in harsher and more challenging farming and market conditions than any other producers in the world. Just consider the drought conditions being experienced right across Australia and in my electorate in the south-western part of Western Australia. 


From what we've heard in this debate, it's obviously easy for some members to make the decision to shut down an industry when it doesn't materially affect their farmers or their state. It's obviously easy for some members to strip away a third or a half of farmers' incomes when it doesn't materially affect their farmers, their small businesses, their small regional towns and communities or their state. But it is going to materially affect my state, my family farmers, my small communities and the hundreds of small businesses that service the industry in Western Australia, where 85 per cent of the live export sheep come from. It's an industry that's worth $250 million in Western Australia. A report shows that the cost of shutting it down will be between $80 million and $150 million at least. What is certain is that closure of the industry will give farmers only one option: to sell to a meat processor. They will become, effectively, a captive supplier of a product for a meat processor. Make no mistake about it; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given. It doesn't matter what that price is.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from

Ms MARINO:
  Make no mistake; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given or get out of production. Just consider those who would be affected. Let's look at the human cost of shutting down the industry and the effect that cutting off the millions of dollars from the industry will have on individual small businesses and small regional communities, primarily our farmers but also farming contractors; shearers; livestock transporters; feedlots, those who grow, supply and process feed for the live shippers; pellet manufacturers and staff; those loading the livestock on the wharves; tyre dealers; mechanics; welders; fuel distributors; fencing contractors; and the countless other small businesses and their workers in rural towns and communities that rely on local farming incomes coming into their businesses.


We know that we are already seeing lower prices, with the state Labor agriculture minister's determination to shut the industry down. Unlike the members supporting this legislation, I did not come into this parliament to put farmers out of business. I did not come into this parliament to put countless small businesses that rely on those farmers out of business or out of work either. I certainly didn't come into this parliament to rip millions of dollars out of small rural and regional communities and towns.


Talk of transition and new chilled-meat markets is just a cop-out. It's an easy throwaway line, like throwing fish to a seal. The practical effect will be entirely different. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources was told during a visit to the Gulf States, if these states are forced to look elsewhere for live animals, they'll look elsewhere for chilled meat also. So the practical impact will be that, if we phase out live trade, the chilled trade will likely shrink, and Australian farmers would lose both markets. It's a lose-lose situation. And these countries will continue to import live sheep, but they will just come from other countries, countries that don't have the animal welfare standards or ESCAS regulations that we have.


I have no doubt that, in spite of some of the comments we've heard, this puts an absolute risk back into live cattle exports. The risk is real. We know that Labor will shut our industry down. The shadow minister for agriculture has said so. I find it extraordinary that a shadow minister for agriculture is actively working to put sheep farmers out of business. It is just extraordinary. I've lived through the deregulation of the dairy industry and I've seen what happens in a small community—to the farmers, the businesses, the small towns—when you take multimillions of dollars out of an industry and out of farmers' pockets. It is direct, it is real and we lose really good people. There is a human cost to what is being proposed here, an absolute human cost that is being ignored by those who are supporting this.


As I said earlier, I am proud to be an Australian farmer. I might be a dairy farmer but I am very proud to be an Australian farmer and I am exceptionally proud of the work our farmers do in providing some of the most amazing food and product, for markets not just here in Australia but right around the world. I will stand up for our farmers every single day of the week.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (17:02):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this private member's bill brought forward by the member for Farrer, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, and to acknowledge that this is not a partisan debate. In fact, there are people from both sides of the House who support this bill. I understand why. In my area, I have had over 1,600 individual constituents email me with their great distress and concern about what is happening in this industry. I'm sure many of my colleagues around the chamber have had similar levels of contact. In fact, I've never seen that level of engagement on any issue during the time that I've been here. In total, I have had over 4,800 emails on this subject, so some people have emailed me on more than one occasion, generally speaking first when they've seen a round of reports in the media, and images that have caused them distress, and then again when they see that repeated. I think that's what's taken its toll on people's patience with this particular aspect of the industry. I want to acknowledge each and every one of those individuals, many of whom took the time to write quite extensive personal comments in their emails about why they felt that this live sheep long-haul export trade, particularly in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, has to stop. I don't know that anybody could have seen the vision that was reported, including, I know, many in the farming industry, without feeling it was a completely unacceptable reflection of what we as a modern nation should see as an acceptable part of the industry sector. 


I'm sure the member for Farrer thought long and hard about bringing this. She's a country-based member herself, and I acknowledge that. I have no doubt that it wasn't lightly that she brought this private member's bill before this parliament. It certainly has my support, as it has Labor's support. It would be good if we could actually bring this bill to a vote, in keeping with the expressed clear wishes of our community—certainly my community. I think it would be the view of all of those people—over 1,600 of them who emailed me from my electorate—that we actually have a vote on this and address the issue. But, of course, we require an absolute majority to bring the vote forward and we would require government members to cross the floor to enable that process to happen. To date, there hasn't been an indication that that would be supported, but I do think it is the will of many communities, and most certainly mine, that we get on with voting on these issues. 


A particular round of the emails that I got came in after the McCarthy review was completed and reported. There's a lot of frustration in what people feel is the science that was laid out in that and the recommendations that were made. The Prime Minister did say he wanted to take a science-based approach to this very difficult issue, but he's actually ignored the advice of the Australian Veterinary Association and the RSPCA, and we haven't seen the response that the community expects to the McCarthy review. That's certainly the feedback I've had very, very strongly. It is Labor's view that we need to have a plan in place to transition the industry, not just to stop the transport of the sheep in these conditions, but also to support and transition the industry into a more viable method of production. That includes our strategic red meat industry plan to help farmers make that transition to sustained profitability and viability, but to recognise that this industry has lost the support of the Australian community. They do not see the component of that that involves sheep being treated in the way that we've seen as being in any way acceptable. They have my support.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (17:07):  I support the live sheep export industry, but not on any terms, not in any case and not if sheep are going to die like flies on the journey. I support it on the premise that this trade can be undertaken safely, because it has been before. It can be done. As the member for Grey, I represent the farming region in Australia that would be most impacted after Western Australia. Through the last couple of months I, like all members in the place, have had a large number of emails and contacts. However, while some growers have contacted me seeking a cessation of the trade, the predominant sentiment from them by far is a sense of disappointment and concern that this crisis has occurred, no patience for those who have transgressed, but also an underlying commitment to the trade and the importance to the farms and associated industries. 


Current estimates are that the trade is running at $20 to $40 a head premium to the market, but the unknown and unsettling factor is what that extra stock would do if it came onto the market in a short space of time. If we learned anything from the knee-jerk reactions when the trade was banned in 2011, it was that the effect of the ban went far further and deeper and lasted far longer than anyone had imagined. It left animals on properties longer than they should have been. They grew too large and were prohibited from the trade after the ban was lifted. We offended our trading partners and they radically reduced their quotas. The designated livestock was pushed onto domestic markets and depressed the domestic markets, and all producers suffered. It was a rolled gold rolling disaster. 


We should not underestimate the knock-on effect to associated industries in country towns. Take Johnson's, for instance. Johnson's is a stockfeed manufacturer at Kapunda and has recently installed $18 million worth of pelleting equipment primarily for the trade. Denis Johnson said:


Johnsons purchase over 100,000 tonnes of grain, green screenings, hay, straw and damaged hay from farmers throughout the Mid North, Barossa, Yorke Peninsula, Eyre Peninsula, Murraylands and South East of the state providing an important source of income to farming operations. This income flows back into local communities.


Farmers buy machinery from local dealerships, have their trucks repaired by the local mechanic, purchase on-farm supplies from their local rural merchandiser. They use the local doctor, hairdresser, supermarkets, kindergartens, schools and hospitals—the list goes on to include all business and services with whom farming families have dealings.


Without this money spent in rural towns, these services are lost.


As someone who spent the best part of the last 35 years raising and caring for livestock, I am, like the member for Forrest, a proud farmer. I am one of the first to condemn mishandling of stock and one of the first to say that whenever our livestock are heading off farm, they simply must be treated with humanity, care and concern. But there are two underlying premises in the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018 that is before us. One is the premise that the industry can be slowly turned off, rather than ceasing immediately and, thus, saleyard impacts avoided. This simply flies in the face of reality. Livestock transporters are required to invest in their ships and infrastructure, and that requirement is ramping up quickly as a result of the latest regulations, and rightly so. But who would invest millions of dollars in their business if they were given a closure date at the same time? There is a very strong case that, unless the operators are given a long-term future, they will not invest and they will withdraw, with the fall-out that would cause.


The second premise is that Australian sales will not suffer because our markets will switch product—to chilled and frozen product—rather than switch suppliers. The member for O'Connor provided some figures on this matter only a few weeks ago in this place, and they bear reiteration. Australia provides less than 10 per cent of the world's live sheep trade—1.6 to 1.8 million tonnes per annum out of a total trade of 10 million tonnes. The trade is growing, and global food services company GIRA is forecasting 2½ per cent growth over the next four years.


The member for O'Connor reminded us that Saudi Arabia used to be a major customer and took the bulk of our live sheep from Australia. They have chosen not to comply with ESCAS—that is their choice—and have not converted to other product. They have simply found other suppliers. When our trade with Bahrain became unprofitable and ceased, the beneficiaries were certainly not our chilled and frozen meat suppliers. In fact, the crash in our chilled meat supplies to the market underlines the value and impact of trade relations across the board. Our chilled meat trade with Bahrain has shrunk from 12,000 tonnes per annum to 7,500 tonnes. That's because we're out of the game. All kinds of figures abound that support this premise, and I urge a commitment to continuing the trade.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (16:45):  I'm proud to be an Australian farmer and I'm equally proud of all our Australian farmers, who work so hard, day in, day out, in this country. We often farm in harsher and more challenging farming and market conditions than any other producers in the world. Just consider the drought conditions being experienced right across Australia and in my electorate in the south-western part of Western Australia. 


From what we've heard in this debate, it's obviously easy for some members to make the decision to shut down an industry when it doesn't materially affect their farmers or their state. It's obviously easy for some members to strip away a third or a half of farmers' incomes when it doesn't materially affect their farmers, their small businesses, their small regional towns and communities or their state. But it is going to materially affect my state, my family farmers, my small communities and the hundreds of small businesses that service the industry in Western Australia, where 85 per cent of the live export sheep come from. It's an industry that's worth $250 million in Western Australia. A report shows that the cost of shutting it down will be between $80 million and $150 million at least. What is certain is that closure of the industry will give farmers only one option: to sell to a meat processor. They will become, effectively, a captive supplier of a product for a meat processor. Make no mistake about it; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given. It doesn't matter what that price is.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 
16:47
 to 16:59





Ms MARINO:
  Make no mistake; farmers will have no option but to take the price they're given or get out of production. Just consider those who would be affected. Let's look at the human cost of shutting down the industry and the effect that cutting off the millions of dollars from the industry will have on individual small businesses and small regional communities, primarily our farmers but also farming contractors; shearers; livestock transporters; feedlots, those who grow, supply and process feed for the live shippers; pellet manufacturers and staff; those loading the livestock on the wharves; tyre dealers; mechanics; welders; fuel distributors; fencing contractors; and the countless other small businesses and their workers in rural towns and communities that rely on local farming incomes coming into their businesses.


We know that we are already seeing lower prices, with the state Labor agriculture minister's determination to shut the industry down. Unlike the members supporting this legislation, I did not come into this parliament to put farmers out of business. I did not come into this parliament to put countless small businesses that rely on those farmers out of business or out of work either. I certainly didn't come into this parliament to rip millions of dollars out of small rural and regional communities and towns.


Talk of transition and new chilled-meat markets is just a cop-out. It's an easy throwaway line, like throwing fish to a seal. The practical effect will be entirely different. As the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources was told during a visit to the Gulf States, if these states are forced to look elsewhere for live animals, they'll look elsewhere for chilled meat also. So the practical impact will be that, if we phase out live trade, the chilled trade will likely shrink, and Australian farmers would lose both markets. It's a lose-lose situation. And these countries will continue to import live sheep, but they will just come from other countries, countries that don't have the animal welfare standards or ESCAS regulations that we have.


I have no doubt that, in spite of some of the comments we've heard, this puts an absolute risk back into live cattle exports. The risk is real. We know that Labor will shut our industry down. The shadow minister for agriculture has said so. I find it extraordinary that a shadow minister for agriculture is actively working to put sheep farmers out of business. It is just extraordinary. I've lived through the deregulation of the dairy industry and I've seen what happens in a small community—to the farmers, the businesses, the small towns—when you take multimillions of dollars out of an industry and out of farmers' pockets. It is direct, it is real and we lose really good people. There is a human cost to what is being proposed here, an absolute human cost that is being ignored by those who are supporting this.


As I said earlier, I am proud to be an Australian farmer. I might be a dairy farmer but I am very proud to be an Australian farmer and I am exceptionally proud of the work our farmers do in providing some of the most amazing food and product, for markets not just here in Australia but right around the world. I will stand up for our farmers every single day of the week.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (17:02):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this private member's bill brought forward by the member for Farrer, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, and to acknowledge that this is not a partisan debate. In fact, there are people from both sides of the House who support this bill. I understand why. In my area, I have had over 1,600 individual constituents email me with their great distress and concern about what is happening in this industry. I'm sure many of my colleagues around the chamber have had similar levels of contact. In fact, I've never seen that level of engagement on any issue during the time that I've been here. In total, I have had over 4,800 emails on this subject, so some people have emailed me on more than one occasion, generally speaking first when they've seen a round of reports in the media, and images that have caused them distress, and then again when they see that repeated. I think that's what's taken its toll on people's patience with this particular aspect of the industry. I want to acknowledge each and every one of those individuals, many of whom took the time to write quite extensive personal comments in their emails about why they felt that this live sheep long-haul export trade, particularly in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, has to stop. I don't know that anybody could have seen the vision that was reported, including, I know, many in the farming industry, without feeling it was a completely unacceptable reflection of what we as a modern nation should see as an acceptable part of the industry sector. 


I'm sure the member for Farrer thought long and hard about bringing this. She's a country-based member herself, and I acknowledge that. I have no doubt that it wasn't lightly that she brought this private member's bill before this parliament. It certainly has my support, as it has Labor's support. It would be good if we could actually bring this bill to a vote, in keeping with the expressed clear wishes of our community—certainly my community. I think it would be the view of all of those people—over 1,600 of them who emailed me from my electorate—that we actually have a vote on this and address the issue. But, of course, we require an absolute majority to bring the vote forward and we would require government members to cross the floor to enable that process to happen. To date, there hasn't been an indication that that would be supported, but I do think it is the will of many communities, and most certainly mine, that we get on with voting on these issues. 


A particular round of the emails that I got came in after the McCarthy review was completed and reported. There's a lot of frustration in what people feel is the science that was laid out in that and the recommendations that were made. The Prime Minister did say he wanted to take a science-based approach to this very difficult issue, but he's actually ignored the advice of the Australian Veterinary Association and the RSPCA, and we haven't seen the response that the community expects to the McCarthy review. That's certainly the feedback I've had very, very strongly. It is Labor's view that we need to have a plan in place to transition the industry, not just to stop the transport of the sheep in these conditions, but also to support and transition the industry into a more viable method of production. That includes our strategic red meat industry plan to help farmers make that transition to sustained profitability and viability, but to recognise that this industry has lost the support of the Australian community. They do not see the component of that that involves sheep being treated in the way that we've seen as being in any way acceptable. They have my support.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (17:07):  I support the live sheep export industry, but not on any terms, not in any case and not if sheep are going to die like flies on the journey. I support it on the premise that this trade can be undertaken safely, because it has been before. It can be done. As the member for Grey, I represent the farming region in Australia that would be most impacted after Western Australia. Through the last couple of months I, like all members in the place, have had a large number of emails and contacts. However, while some growers have contacted me seeking a cessation of the trade, the predominant sentiment from them by far is a sense of disappointment and concern that this crisis has occurred, no patience for those who have transgressed, but also an underlying commitment to the trade and the importance to the farms and associated industries. 


Current estimates are that the trade is running at $20 to $40 a head premium to the market, but the unknown and unsettling factor is what that extra stock would do if it came onto the market in a short space of time. If we learned anything from the knee-jerk reactions when the trade was banned in 2011, it was that the effect of the ban went far further and deeper and lasted far longer than anyone had imagined. It left animals on properties longer than they should have been. They grew too large and were prohibited from the trade after the ban was lifted. We offended our trading partners and they radically reduced their quotas. The designated livestock was pushed onto domestic markets and depressed the domestic markets, and all producers suffered. It was a rolled gold rolling disaster. 


We should not underestimate the knock-on effect to associated industries in country towns. Take Johnson's, for instance. Johnson's is a stockfeed manufacturer at Kapunda and has recently installed $18 million worth of pelleting equipment primarily for the trade. Denis Johnson said:


Johnsons purchase over 100,000 tonnes of grain, green screenings, hay, straw and damaged hay from farmers throughout the Mid North, Barossa, Yorke Peninsula, Eyre Peninsula, Murraylands and South East of the state providing an important source of income to farming operations. This income flows back into local communities.


Farmers buy machinery from local dealerships, have their trucks repaired by the local mechanic, purchase on-farm supplies from their local rural merchandiser. They use the local doctor, hairdresser, supermarkets, kindergartens, schools and hospitals—the list goes on to include all business and services with whom farming families have dealings.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:13):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises the positive effect of the Government's measures to ensure that it lives within its means, in particular by:


(a) legislating tough measures against multinational tax avoidance;


(b) delivering disciplined financial management, including through a tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent and the lowest rate of spending growth of any government in more than 50 years; and


(c) maintaining the integrity of the welfare system so that support goes to those who need it most; and


(2) notes with deep concern that the Opposition:


(a) opposed our multinational anti-avoidance legislation in Parliament;


(b) refuses to commit to spending restraint or a tax cap so that the economy is not burdened with higher taxes; and


(c) has no plan to support Australians to get off welfare and into work.


Today I rise to move a motion that talks about what the government is getting right, but I do so with sadness. Frankly, it disappoints me that this motion needs to be moved in this parliament. The Turnbull coalition government is not just meeting the expectations and challenges of the Australian people; it is seeking to lead the nation in dealing with the economic challenges and headwinds that are before us. This Turnbull coalition government understands acutely the challenges Australia faces economically and, critically, understands what needs to be done to help us manage the change that is occurring in our economy. The government is addressing the international factors that drive and influence matters like tax and tax contributions but is also making sure that we're a competitive nation in the international marketplace, by making sure there is a limit to how much of a tax burden the government places on the nation and, critically, in the process, making sure we get people into positions of employment so that they can stand on their own two feet and support themselves, their families and their communities, so that they are not dependent on other taxpayers.


The reason I said I moved this motion with sadness, despite the incredible record of this government, is that at every point that agenda has been obstructed by the opposition. At every point, they claim and hark about the idea that they want to crack down on the top end of town, but in practice they vote against multinational tax avoidance. It's the most absurd situation anybody could put before this parliament to claim you're against the top end of town and you want to demonise businesses that are successful in employing Australians and contributing to our nation. But where there's avoidance and where there are multinationals who are not contributing their fair share, the appropriate thing to do according to Bill Shorten—the Leader of the Opposition, I should say more correctly—and the opposition is to oppose the government's agenda to crack down on tax avoidance.


But that isn't the only thing that they've voted against. They've opposed the government's sensible tax cap limiting the amount of money that is taken out of the hip pockets of average Australians to contribute to the overall welfare of the nation, to say and understand that their money is theirs first. Yes, everybody has a responsibility to carry and contribute to the balance sheet of this nation—everyone. But a critical part of that is that there has to be a limit so that people have an ambition, an interest in being able to earn more money and that they're able to go on and make choices and decisions for their lives. In this federal budget we put in a tax cap of 23.9 per cent of tax to GDP. That is a simple and measured response in order to make sure that government does not become bloated any more than is necessary and also that we are not hitting people's hip pockets any more than is necessary.


But, most critically, we are focusing on what we need to do to get people from welfare into work. Everybody in the place, I would hope, understands the pride and dignity that come with people standing on their own two feet, the pride and dignity that come with having a job, the pride and dignity that come with being able to support not just yourself but your family and to be able to help others who are less well off.


The record of this government is quite clear. Since it was elected there are 140,000 fewer people on welfare. That is a huge reversal from the legacy of the previous government, which led to a growth of nearly a quarter of a million Australians living on some sort of welfare. But, most critically, when we take people off welfare—when we take 140,000 people off—it isn't just that they stand on their own two feet. They cease to be consumers of the tax system and become contributors to it. I've always said that one of the critical things for any person to do is take care of themselves, not out of selfishness but because when you are not taking care of yourself you are dependent on somebody else, and, more critically, it denies your capacity to help others. If we want a civil society, if we want a society that's just and fair, then people who can stand on their own two feet must have the chance to do so. But, more critically, we should look at the policy of the opposition, at the fact that they voted against the efforts of this government to crack down on tax avoidance. Since this government has been elected and since the tax avoidance task force and the Australian taxation commission have been introduced we have raised over $5.2 billion income tax liabilities against large public groups and multinationals, and the ATO has collected a further $3 billion in cash, with $2.4 billion coming from multinational enterprises. This government, at every point, is making sure that everyone pays their fair share but also is able to stand on their own two feet.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:18):  This is a motion based on a lie. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. Let me say that again for the benefit of the member for Goldstein, who moved the motion. This is a motion based on a lie, a falsehood. The member is misleading the House. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. I know this—




Mr Tim Wilson:
  Did you support it?




Dr LEIGH:
  Yes, Labor did support it, remember? I will take that interjection from the member for Goldstein. I refer the member to the Senate Hansard, 9 November 2015. Senator Dastyari said:


Labor's position is that we support this bill.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  What about the House?




Dr LEIGH:
  The member for Goldstein asks about the House. I will come to the House, Member for Goldstein. There's not a moment in which Labor did not support the bill.



Mr Tim Wilson interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  The problem with the member for Goldstein is he thinks that if a lie is repeated often enough it becomes the truth. He thinks, because he's sat in the House—



Government members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Members will be quiet, please.




Dr LEIGH:
  and he's heard the talking point from the Treasurer and the minister for revenue, that somehow it's okay to continue to mislead the House. But the fact is, as I've said, on 9 November 2015 in the Senate, Senator Dastyari said: 


Labor's position is that we support this bill.


The motion was then amended—



Mr Tim Wilson interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein is warned.




Dr LEIGH:
  and it was amended in such a way as to improve tax transparency. The amendments for tax transparency were agreed to by the Senate on 11 November 2015. Labor then, in the House, on 12 November 2015, voted to keep those Senate amendments to improve tax transparency. Then, back in the Senate, on 3 December 2015, we saw Labor voting against the watered-down Greens-Liberal deal, which saw less tax transparency; two-thirds of private firms were moved out of the tax transparency net. Senator Conroy, referring to an agreement made by Senator Di Natale, said it was 'the filthy deal he did with the government'. The amended bill was agreed to on the voices. Back in the House, the amendments to improve tax transparency were considered, with the House voting against both amendments, and in both cases Labor stood again for tax transparency. At no moment did Labor vote against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. To say that we did is purely and simply a lie. 


This is a critical issue today, because we have just seen in the House the government shut down debate over tax transparency. You don't get much more ironic than that. Right now in the House, moments ago, we had members opposite voting to shut down the debate over tax transparency—and not just any debate. A bill was coming back from the Senate that would have brought the disclosure threshold for tax payable down from $200 million for private firms and $100 million for public firms to $50 million for all firms. The shadow Attorney-General was on his feet attempting to that have considered immediately and he was shut down. 


The fact is that Labor in 2013 put in place laws to improve tax transparency—measures that the Australian Taxation Office said at the time would 'discourage large corporate entities from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance practices'. But, after coming to office, the coalition waged a guerrilla war against transparency. The member for Kooyong told the coalition party room there was a real concern that wealthy businesspeople would be kidnapped as a result of tax transparency, something that University of New South Wales accounting lecturer Jeffrey Knapp called 'the stupidest excuse for nondisclosure I've ever heard'. When we asked whether the government had evidence, some security advice to verify a kidnap risk, it turned out no advice had been provided by the Australian Federal Police, the Attorney-General's Department or the tax office. No representations were made in favour of a wind-back in tax transparency. 


In the Senate, only a single submission was received in favour of winding back tax transparency, from an organisation called the Family Office Institute Australia, which purports to be representative but was in fact an 'astroturfing' organisation. Labor stood in favour of tax transparency. In the case of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, we wanted to amend it to strengthen tax transparency. We never voted against it. We voted for tax transparency, and the government right now, moments ago in the House, has again voted against tax transparency.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-06-26,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (17:23):  Effectively managing Australia's economy can seem complicated for some people. It has clearly always been beyond the understanding of the Leader of the Opposition, for example. The shadow Treasurer obviously struggles with the idea daily. And the Deputy Leader of the Opposition finds even aspiration mystifying, so I fear she is a long way off. Only one side of the House understands how to effectively manage the economy, because only one side of the House understands and appreciates business. 


Managing a prosperous economy is a lot like running a successful business. Unlike those members opposite, most Australians living in the real world recognise the commonsense principles you need to follow if you want to do either. In business, just like a household budget, if you spend more than you earn then you're going to come unstuck. One of the first and hardest lessons in life for most Australians is: if you can't afford it, don't buy it. 


It's a lesson that business owners and working Australians remember every day, but sadly it is a lesson this Labor Party forgot long ago. The Turnbull government has applied that principle rigorously, recording the lowest rate of spending growth of any government in more than 50 years and delivering a tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent. It's why, for six successive forecast updates, we've been able to project that the budget's underlying cash balance will reach a surplus in 2020-21. It's also why we can already say that the Turnbull government is the first government in a decade that is not borrowing to pay for everyday expenses. If we can't afford it, we're not buying it. 


The Labor Party, in stark contrast, are irredeemably and genetically addicted to spending money they don't have. They refuse to commit to any spending restraint because they don't intend to show any. At the last election they promised higher taxes on housing and income, and yet they still would have created a deficit of $16.5 billion—that's billion with a 'b'—higher than us. They're spending that same money again, and then some. Their track record is clear. Under the last federal Labor government, spending was rising by four per cent in real terms, above inflation, on average, while debt was rising by a staggering 30 per cent every year. This is after being handed $50 billion in credit by the Howard government. 


Our hardworking constituents also know that, if you charge your customers so much for the services you provide that they can no longer afford to pay for them, your business will fail. If you charge them so much they can't pay their bills and they have nothing left over to grow their prosperity, then your income will soon disappear. The Turnbull government wants to see all Australians prosper, get ahead and keep more of their own money. We don't want to charge Australians any more for their government than we absolutely have to. That's why we've delivered historic tax relief for every working Australian, and ensured that 94 per cent of working Australians will never have to pay a marginal tax rate above 32½c in the dollar. It's also why we have reduced the company tax rate for all businesses with a turnover of $50 million and are working to expand that tax relief. We know that prosperous businesses deliver more jobs, stronger growth and more sustainable tax revenue to pay for the services that Australians rely on. 


The price the Labor Party charge taxpayers for their government can never be high enough. No amount of tax is too much for the Labor Party. They fought to stop our tax cuts for working Australians, voting to take $70 billion more out of Australians' pockets. They proposed more than $200 billion in other additional taxes, including extra taxes on housing, electricity, small business, investment income and even pensions—yes, even pensions. In total, they want to take $8,000 more away from every single Australian through higher taxes. 


Labor cannot be trusted with our nation's economy. They can't help themselves. Labor always want to spend money they don't have and, when the time comes, it's always Australians that have to pick up the bill.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:28):  I'm pleased to rise to support the motion from my good friend the member for—'Goldsteen' or 'Goldstine'? I'm sure it has changed a lot.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  No, it has not.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I'll start by picking up on a few points made by the member for Fenner. He said, 'If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.' Talk about pot-kettle-black. Here we have a member of the opposition that ran the 'Mediscare' line, the greatest deception in an election in Australia's history. That lie was repeated over and over again, so much so that it will go down in folklore. In fact, thankfully, this parliament has passed legislation, agreed to by the opposition, such that, should they engage in such deceptive conduct again—impersonating a federal government agency—it would be illegal. We wait with bated breath on this side of the House to see what campaign our opponents will come up with at the next election, what story they will tell, and repeat over and over and over again—an untruth to try to again con the Australian public. But I think this time the Australian public will be awake.


When it comes to the issue of corporate tax, one of the most stunning revelations this week was when one of the members of the opposition asked a question in question time about the reduction in the corporate tax rate and asked, 'Where will the money come from?' This is a question we often ask on this side of the House when Labor have their big spending plans. But this was in relation to a reduction in the corporate tax rate. It shows the fundamental difference between the ideologies on this side of the House and on that side of the House. 


On this side of the chamber, we understand that the size of the economic pie of our nation, the wealth that we have, is not fixed. The wealth that we have can shrink or it can grow, depending on the incentives that we put in the system. It depends on the hard work of those Australians who vote for us. How big that economic pie grows depends on their risk-taking and their entrepreneurial efforts. The opposition think that the size of that economic pie is fixed and it's just a matter of cutting it up. They don't understand that the very reason that we are reducing the corporate rate of tax in this nation is to grow the size of the economic pie.


This is not just a theory. This has happened every single time in our nation's history when we have reduced that corporate rate of tax. When Peter Costello was the Treasurer, he reduced the corporate rate of tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. According to the opposition's ideology, or what they say now, that should have cost the Treasury money. But exactly the opposite happened. The reduction in the corporate tax rate actually resulted in the Treasury getting more revenue in, not only in gross terms but as a percentage of GDP. So we grew the pie and we even made the corporate tax slice of that pie bigger, at a smaller rate. It wasn't only under Peter Costello. Exactly the same thing happened when Paul Keating was the Treasurer. Again, Paul Keating understood. He reduced the corporate rate of tax in this nation and—surprise, surprise!—what happened? The actual number of dollars flowing to the Treasury increased, the economy grew and job creation grew. 


This is what we understand on this side of the House. It amazes me that we have members of the opposition wanting to simply run class warfare rhetoric to try to argue against corporate tax cuts. Almost every OECD nation this century has understood this and has lowered the corporate rate of tax, with a few exceptions, including Australia. Even though we have had a magnificent performance from this coalition government, with more than a million new jobs created, we face a future, going forward, where we must get that rate of corporate tax down to be internationally competitive.

Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (18:16):  The Turnbull government's relentless drive to reduce the size of the Public Service is adversely impacting on Centrelink service and therefore Centrelink customers. Government statistics show that older Australians, carers and students are waiting longer to have their payments approved by Centrelink. The median processing time for the age pension payment has dramatically increased from 36 days last year to 49 days in March this year. That is a 40 per cent increase in waiting times. This means that Australians who have worked all their lives are being made to wait for two months on average just to have their age pension approved. Median average times don't take into account instances where Centrelink requests further information and then stops the clock on the process, further delaying the approval.


We've heard horror stories about how Centrelink, under-resourced and understaffed, is requiring older Australians to wait many months for their payments, all the while living on the edge of their bank accounts. The Turnbull government will tell you that, if someone's application is successful, their pension payment is backdated to the time they lodged their application. Let me share with this place two case studies that have been submitted to my office. A Tasmanian grandmother, Helen Willis-Smith, was forced to dig into her superannuation and increase her daughter's credit card limit to find the money she needed to live and pay her bills while she waited four months for her age pension to be processed. Also in Tasmania, another person waited for up to 12 months to receive their carer payment—12 months for their carer payment and allowance! And Centrelink needed to backdate the owed payment by as much as $23,000, and that was for a carer. It's absolutely shameful. How precarious and stressful it must be to live just on your savings while you wait for Centrelink to tell you if your application is successful, never knowing if or when the first payment will come. And, of course, many people don't have savings. They have to borrow from family, borrow from banks or do whatever they can to survive.


The Turnbull government is telling Australians to use myGov to apply for Centrelink services online if they want to fast-track their applications. But we know that using this online interface is not easy, and that is discouraging its use. In April this year, iTnews reported that for more than a week Australians were again wrestling with accessing government services using myGov. Many are finding Centrelink's online platform incredibly difficult to navigate. We know that older Australians are struggling with this online interface, because the number of busy signals on the age pension phone line is projected to increase from 800,000 to 1.2 million—up by 50 per cent. 


Average call wait times have blown out for most Centrelink customers, but for older Australians they've jumped by 20 per cent. For older Australians, average call wait times have increased from 18 minutes and 59 seconds to 23 minutes and one second. For students, average call wait times have increased from 31 minutes and 15 seconds to 35 minutes. For Australians phoning the family-and-parenting line—incredibly important at the moment—average call wait times have increased from 16 minutes and 19 seconds to 21 minutes and 12 seconds. But this is just the average. The reality is we've heard stories of people waiting hours to speak to a Centrelink officer—absolutely hours.


In May this year, the ABC reported that some Launceston residents were waiting almost three hours to get assistance. Sensibly, older Australians are attempting to circumvent the phone lines by attending Centrelink in person. But, of course, this isn't working because instead of assistance they are finding an underresourced Centrelink office and staff directing them to online and call-up facilities. This lack of service is matched by an increase in average wait times in service centres by almost 15 minutes. No wonder older Australians are not getting the assistance they need. It's a vicious cycle of vulnerable Australians being forced to the edge of their bank accounts while they wait for the payments—or simply don't receive them at all. Labor welcomes the transition to service online, so long as it remains accessible for vulnerable Australians. But it shouldn't mean that we neglect in-person and phone services. We should also provide vulnerable Australians with the support necessary to learn to navigate the online system.


Yesterday, the ABC reported the story of Michelle Piefke. Michelle was given a number of documents after visiting a Centrelink office in Boronia in Melbourne. The documents contained highly sensitive information: bank details, residential addresses and signatures—for somebody else. It is equally concerning that the Centrelink client whose form was misplaced may not have received their payment. As I've just outlined, it can be difficult speaking to someone or seeing someone at Centrelink to resolve issues, especially issues such as this, and it can take months for someone to receive their payment, if they are lucky. So it begs the question, what happens to this person's payment? Have they received their payment? How long has their payment been delayed? This, of course, is the person I referred to earlier. And how prevalent are leaks of this kind? I think we have to say to the minister, 'You have a responsibility to come and explain how many mistakes like this are made, and how they are dealt with.'


The fact is that Centrelink is in crisis under the Turnbull government. Centrelink is underresourced and understaffed, and these stories tell of that underresourcing and understaffing. And there is not one single member of this place that can dispute what I've said, because you have all had these people in your offices, and through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard these stories yourself. It's also why it is so important that Centrelink has permanent full-time staff who are supported, familiar and skilled to manage the often complex issues facing Australians who rely on income support.


What's the Turnbull government going to do to fix deteriorating Centrelink services and reduce stress and anxiety in the community? Last year, the Turnbull government cut over 1,100 jobs from Centrelink and, in this year's budget, the Turnbull government reduced Centrelink funding by $300 million and cut another 1,280 staff. This is a total reduction of 2,500 permanent full-time staff over the past two budgets, and how can that be when there is such a crisis of confidence in this place. In their place, the Turnbull government has outsourced 1,250 positions to labour hire companies. Call centre workers are on contracts with insecure work. They are privatising the public sector by stealth. No wonder the morale at Centrelink is at an all-time low. What we are witnessing is a steady sell-off of Centrelink jobs and the growing casualisation of its workforce. This is privatisation by stealth. Everyone knows that this government isn't genuinely interested in strengthening the integrity and the sustainability of our nation's social safety net, and it needs protecting. This government is more interested in placing the burden of balancing its budget on income support recipients.


While this government is so preoccupied with its $80 billion tax cut for big business, and this includes $17 billion to the big four banks, it is actively making Centrelink so difficult, so confusing and so frightening for people that they might just give up. Every member of this House knows that I am speaking the truth, because they are getting these constituents into their offices—I know they are—giving them a sense of comfort. Please, take up their issues. It should not matter the side of the House you sit. I've had people say to me, 'I've gone to my local member and he or she won't do anything about that.' That is completely unacceptable. These people deserve our support. They are older Australians, they are people who cannot find work, they are people caring for unwell relatives, and they are students. Every single category I'm speaking about needs the support of everyone in this place, and it is incumbent on us—it's our responsibility, as members of parliament—to take up their issues, to pursue their issues and to help them get it sorted out.
