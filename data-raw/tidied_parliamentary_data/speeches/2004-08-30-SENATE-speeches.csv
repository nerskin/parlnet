"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-08-30,"—by leave—I present the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee entitled Forgotten Australians: a report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a notice of motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the second report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on its inquiry into children in institutional care be presented by the last sitting day in December 2004.
I now seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
At the outset I thank the Senate for allowing the committee to table this significant report at this time in today's program. The request of the committee was in response to the many care leavers who travelled here today who would not be able to witness the tabling if it were at the regular time later, as they wish to return to their homes this evening. I am very pleased that we have been able to welcome these care leavers and their families into Parliament House to be part of this milestone in the history of the provision of care in Australia.
When we began this inquiry I was, to say the least, very concerned about what we were embarking upon. My concerns were that we were not going to be able to do any good for the people whose lives we were looking into, that we would open wounds that we would not be able to heal and that we were not counsellors, we were policy makers, and we would leave people more damaged than they were at the outset. I was very wrong. For many care leavers this inquiry has brought a sense of healing that has not been evident in their dealings with government, the churches and institutions to date. It has provided the opportunity to share their experience, to be given recognition of the pain that they have experienced and to put some of the past behind. But for many, though, this inquiry has not brought closure. It is hard to see how for some any process would, as the hurt is so great.
I am proud to have presented this report on behalf of the committee. I want to place on record my thanks to all members of the committee for their compassion and diligence throughout the hearings and through the compilation of the report and recommendations. I also wish to thank Senator Hutchins for his work as the chair of the committee prior to March. This report is an example of how the Senate works at its best. We came to the inquiry as individuals and left our party affiliations at the door. Our recommendations are the result of our personal thinking and it is our hope that they will make real changes to the lives of care leavers into the future. The report has deviated from the usual Senate style of writing a report. We have tried to give voice to those who gave us the evidence rather than interpret their words. The report, therefore, uses many quotes from the Hansard and from the submissions.
The committee received 614 submissions, of which 174 are confidential given the nature of their content. Overwhelmingly, they make tragic and distressing reading. They tell of neglect, of shocking abuse, of predatory behaviour from so-called carers and of criminal activity. The evidence is also there that authorities in the church and in governments either knew or should have known that much of this horrific activity was occurring. The committee thank those who made submissions and gave evidence for allowing us into their lives. We hope we have done justice to their stories. A recurring message in the submissions is that the person making the submission was doing it not for himself or herself but for those who could not—for those who could not because the pain in reliving their experience was too great, because the hurt they have lived has manifested into mental illness that renders them incapable of participation or because they have passed on through illness, age or, even more tragically, suicide. This report is a tribute to all who have made submissions and to those who could not. 
It is also important to note that all experiences reported were not negative. A few submissions told of pleasant times, of outings and of thoughtful and caring adults. It also should be noted that institutions varied in their treatment of people over time. The personnel who provided the care directly influenced the experience of the children there. But, even for those whose experiences did not include neglect or abuse, the lack of love is a constant. How that can be overcome is a challenge but one that must be dealt with in planning future care arrangements for children. 
Today should be seen as a significant milestone in the history of the approximately 500,000 people who have been placed in care in institutions, including orphanages, group cottage homes, homes for children with disabilities and juvenile detention centres, and in foster care in Australia since colonisation. It is an opportunity to place on record a summary of the experiences of care leavers, which goes some way to telling the true history of what has occurred. More needs to be done to continue to tell these stories, and there are recommendations in the report that are directed to that end.
But looking to the future, the report is hopefully a blueprint for governments and non-government institutions to deal with the legacy of poorly provided care. There are 39 recommendations in the report, most of which are unanimous recommendations of the committee members. We have recommended that the federal government issue an apology acknowledging the hurt and distress suffered by many children in institutional care, and that those states and territories, churches and other authorities that have not done so should do the same.
We have recommended that the federal government establish a fund with contributions from the states and territories, churches and other organisations involved in the provision of care. This fund should provide an alternative method for accessing redress which will not require applicants to meet legal proof requirements, and a claim that can be supported by a reasonable likelihood that the abuse occurred should be dealt with. We have recommended that a process for reviewing complaints about care experiences should be established, and that it should be independent of governments or churches.
We have called on the churches and other care providing organisations to open their books and allow care leavers all the information which has been collected about them so that any legal proceedings that should be progressed are progressed. We have said that if this does not occur then the only course of action is for the federal government to implement a royal commission so that justice can be done. Committee members were mindful of the costs and the varying benefits associated with the establishment of a royal commission, and there are different views in the committee about the appropriateness of this course of action. But it is my view that it might be the only way that justice can be done. There are other recommendations in the report that I commend to governments, churches, other care providing organisations and the broader community. 
Finally, I need to offer some thanks. I want to thank an organisation called CLAN. CLAN is a nationally established organisation that provides support to care leavers. They are represented by a fabulous woman, Leonie Sheedy, whom all care leavers will join with me in thanking for the leadership, compassion and enormous understanding that she provides to care leavers and their families. There is a range of other support services and I also commend them on the work they do. They are funded varyingly across the nation, and our recommendation suggests that more needs to be done by state, territory and federal governments to support that work. As a result of today's tabling of this report, we expect there will be many care leavers in the community who did not know about the process that we embarked upon and who will wish to receive support. I encourage any journalist writing about the tabling of the report today to publish, wherever possible, the phone numbers of support organisations so that people can access services immediately.
I also want to thank the counsellors we employed during the process of the inquiry who came to all of our hearings and assisted not only care leavers but also all of us in talking through the experiences that we heard about. Thank you to all of you. Thank you for the work that you continue to do and the special talents that you have in working with care leavers in our society. I want to thank Hansard and the people from sound and vision who shared the harrowing stories with us during the hearings. Finally and most importantly, I need to thank the secretariat of the Community Affairs References Committee. They are a fantastic group of people who have gone well beyond their roles as staff of the Senate. They have worked late nights and they have worked weekends for months, and their careful consideration of all the issues has provided—with the support of the senators who gave their time to this committee—what I think is an excellent report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-08-30,"—As Senator McLucas has said, today is a very special day because of the tabling of the report entitled Forgotten Australians: a report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children. I would also like to start by thanking all those who gave of their lives—those very people in the gallery today. Good luck to you all. This has been a very tough inquiry for each and every one of us. Their heart-rending stories, their cruel stories and sometimes their funny stories are something that we can all cherish.
I would also like to thank the secretariat in Elton Humphrey and his team. As Senator McLucas said, they are probably the most outstanding secretariat you could wish for. I have had the pleasure of working with them for many years and they just give and give—but this is a different sort of giving. This, as Senator Murray and I know, is the second time they have given. The report on child migrants was a very tough report; this one has been no easier. It has been no easier on any of us, but it certainly has not been easy on the secretariat for the way in which they have tackled it. To Senator McLucas and all the members of the committee, I would like to say thank you. Senator Murray, good on you for bringing it to the chamber again, because that too is important. 
There are some privileges one gets in this job that outsiders would never contemplate as a privilege. This is one of them. These are reports about people, childhoods, teenage lives, relationships, marriages, successes, failures, adulthood, sickness and health—the list goes on. For the people who have shared all those experiences with us in the hope that we may be able to very belatedly help right some of the wrongs, it is a weight we were prepared to try and lift. I hope that we can meet some of those expectations.
When one looks at why children were placed in institutions one sees that the list of reasons is almost endless. Family poverty, being orphaned, being born to a single mother, family dislocation, domestic violence, divorce, mental illness, a parent's inability to cope with children, or child sex abuse by a parent or step-parent are only part of the story. Any one of those reasons would be difficult enough for a child. But for a child to be placed into care, separated from their parent or parents and often from siblings, and then have to face all types of abuse, child slavery, cruelty, hunger, a lack of education, a lack of warm clothing and, probably worst of all, the total absence of love and nurturing is just profoundly sad.
Those of us who have never experienced that do not know what these people have gone through. As someone who has experienced love from their parents and from their entire family, it is incredibly difficult to look these people in the eye. They are brave, they are tough, they fight and they do not ever stop. Those of us who have had that love and care can only say, `We love you; we cherish you.' There are so many sad stories to focus on but to me one of the saddest realities is that some care leavers have discovered more recently that while they were suffering there had in fact been offers from extended family members to provide a home for them to prevent them from going into or being in care, yet these offers were usually ignored or denied by the department or agency. One can only wonder how different the outcome would have been for those so lucky.
There are so many who suffered such sadness, believing that no-one cared about them, only to find decades later that parents, siblings and extended family members had written letters or had sought to visit. None of this information was ever made known at the time nor was it made known that the letters they had written to family members had never been sent. What cruelty is that? That children were placed in institutions for care yet did not even receive the basics of what any reasonable person would consider care is beyond belief. To have taken from them on arrival everything that was in any way special—a teddy, a doll, clothes, jewellery, shoes or other treasures—was further demeaning and demoralising. All this, I might add, was often done after being strip searched. For many, not receiving an education meant being permanently consigned to life skill difficulties. One quote says it all:
I now know why my education was lost, because of a night time I was bashed, raped and molested, then stay awake all night wondering if they were going to come back. Then be bashed by the nuns at school for falling asleep in class, so I guess that's why I can't spell today.
The use of experimental medications, examinations and drugs appeared rife. Who in their right mind would force children to take mind-altering drugs, subject them to brain scans and various other neurological tests under the guise of intelligence tests, or subject young girls to enforced, painful gynaecological examinations? One may well ask why such cruel practices were never detected by the authorities, why operators of institutions were not deregistered or why the perpetrators of the violence and sex abuse were never prosecuted. It all comes down to the fact that there was a total lack of state government regulation. Either the inspections by welfare officers were carefully stage-managed or the officers studiously ignored what they saw—both of which, in my language, are reprehensible behaviour. 
What is almost worse in this situation is that, when perpetrators of abuse and assault were identified, they were allowed to resign before formal action was taken against them. Apart from the appalling treatment of children, the parents of some of the children who sought to maintain contact were deceived and threatened and were too frightened to lay any complaint about the signs of abuse they saw for fear that the children would suffer further. What a position for those parents to be placed in. I wish to quote a section of the report about the often heard statement that standards were different then. The report states:
The response that times were different and that standards and people's thinking and understanding of children's needs have changed, fails to explain or recognise the severity of the documented behaviours. Corporal punishment may no longer be in vogue. But when do a few whacks with a ruler become assault? When do the oft documented beltings and floggings become criminal assault? When did the `standards of the time' change that condoned the perpetration of neglect, cruelty, psychological abuse, sadism, rape and sodomy?
I submit that what is criminal today was criminal yesterday in this regard. To listen to the legacies of such treatment—legacies such as low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, fear, distrust, anger, shame, guilt, obsessiveness, social anxieties, phobias, recurring nightmares, tension, migraines and speech difficulties—is beyond comprehension. Many cannot read or write, many have had lifelong alcohol and drug problems or have ended up in the mental health or prison systems, many cannot form or maintain trust in relationships and many have contemplated or taken the ultimate step of suicide. One witness said:
I don't know how to show my family, especially my own children how I feel about them. I can't put my arms around them and tell them I love them ... and most of my married life I can't stand being touched. 
Many lack parenting skills due to the total absence of role models. Some have been successful; others have not. One witness stated:
Then at the age of 36, I met my wife. We married in 1982 and had two baby girls within two years. As I was unemployed for 5 years after we married, and although it was tough, I was able to spend a lot of time with my daughters. I was determined they weren't going to miss out like I did. I spoilt them rotten. Dorothy and the girls have been the making of me. For the first time I experienced happiness. Without them I think I would be dead now, either through alcoholism or a successful suicide. 
I do not have much time left but I have to say that I hope that state, territory and Commonwealth governments, the churches and the agencies look very closely at the recommendations that we have made. It is about time the wrongs were righted. It is about time everyone decided that what was illegal then is illegal today, and vice versa. It disturbs me that some of the state governments do not believe that things are going on today when in fact they still are. I conclude my comments by commending the report to the Senate. May I extend to the care leavers and their loved ones a wish that from hereon their lives will take a fresh turn for the best.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-30,"—Let me begin by acknowledging and welcoming all those in the public gallery who have journeyed to Canberra today to witness this historic tabling of this groundbreaking report, suitably titled Forgotten Australians. This report means so much to so many—not just the half a million plus directly affected but the millions of Australians indirectly affected. 
Three years ago, in August 2001, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's child migrant report, Lost innocents: righting the record, was tabled in the Senate. That inquiry had an intensely personal dimension for me because of my own background. When I rose to speak to the report, I just could not; so Senator Sue Knowles delivered my speech for me. There is a message in that in itself, because these painful inquiries draw all senators together in a shared sense of outrage, compassion and a need to find remedies. We are forever bonded and affected by the pain we have witnessed. This report into children in institutional care is the third in the trilogy—the first being the 1997 Bringing them home report on the fate of the Aboriginal stolen generation and the second the 2001 report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into child migration.
The day I encountered Norman Johnston and his band of protestors outside the parliament, pleading for a child migrant inquiry, is probably the birthplace of both these reports. Norman and Margaret Humphries personify the campaigners for the first report, and Leonie Sheedy and Joanna Penglase personify the campaigners for the second report. We owe them all a great debt of gratitude.
But it is to the witnesses I dedicate this tabling speech. To every care leaver who submitted their intensely personal story to this inquiry, I thank you and honour your courage in doing so. Often these stories were being told for the very first time. I saw wives, husbands and friends listening in amazement as they heard such personal, intimate stories put down on the public record. There were so many tears: from the witnesses, the audiences, the senators, Hansard and our secretariat. For many witnesses, a measure of healing was gained through being able to finally tell their stories, knowing that they were believed at last. I also wish to honour the many thousands who were unable to or could not relive their experiences through writing or making a submission.
With me on this committee has been Senator Steve Hutchins—the first chair—who helped me negotiate the terms of reference for this inquiry with Labor. I and we owe him a great deal, and he has done himself and his party proud. Senator Jan McLucas followed Senator Hutchins as chair, and she has been outstanding in her determination to do right by those who have been in care. Senator Sue Knowles is, as I am, a veteran of both inquiries. As deputy chair she has again shown her compassion and determination that justice be done and remedies be found. In Senators Gary Humphries and Claire Moore we have fortunately found people of great heart and great strength. My Senate colleagues: I salute your efforts and am deeply grateful for them. Your humanity and compassion honour you.
There was also Hansard, who had the painful task of recording it all. We have all experienced what the psychologists refer to as `referred pain'—none more so than the bruised, supportive secretariat to this harrowing inquiry. To Elton, Ingrid, Geraldine, Christine, Leonie and Peter, I extend my grateful thanks. It would be difficult to find a more hardworking group of people than these. Their commitment deserves the highest praise.
Then there is Dr Marilyn Rock, my electorate officer and senior adviser, who has dedicated five hard years to this cause of getting recognition, help and remedies to all those who have suffered in institutions and care. Quite simply, I could not have put in the effort that I have without her valuable professional and humane support. All over Australia, people turn to her for help.  
This quote from a submission captured a fundamental truth:
While I have survived extreme deprivation I am left with deep emotional scars. I have a sense of abandonment, exploitation and not belonging ... I feel it impossible to fully recover from my experiences.
Understanding this truth is set to alter public policy towards children forever. What is that truth? If you badly harm a child you will have decades of a badly harmed adult to cope with. It does not end there. The effects of the harm are often transferred to the victim's children, creating generational social problems. Although there are good stories, the sheer scale of damaged people is staggering.
That so many endured a childhood deprived of love and security of their own families is certainly sad. That so many were subject to abuse and neglect, including criminal sexual and physical assaults, is unforgivable. That so many are scarred and live on the margins of society as adults without programs to assist them is scandalous. My hope is that this report, in conjunction with the two earlier reports, will mean that bureaucrats, policy makers and politicians will at last be able to comprehend the importance of the issues affecting the survivors of childhood abuse. The message is getting out that the abuse, neglect and assault of children can no longer be tolerated, not only because it is wrong but because of the long-term social and economic effects.
There is now an extensive body of research that clearly shows that if you hurt and break the spirit of a child you end up with a hurt and broken adult, with all of those consequences. Even the well-adjusted struggle. A 70-year-old wrote of the lasting effects:
Every now and then a door opens in the memory bank and the ghosts escape to make us lonely children again.
There were those who had good outcomes, in places run by good people. But too many have led and are leading lonely, marginal lives from which there appears no escape. They also live with the pain of lost family members and of lost identities. For too many, their childhood remains a private hell stained with memories of beatings, sexual assault and molestation, and exploitation as child labour. Sadly, because of the planted guilt, blame and shame, most have learnt not to rebel against injustice, not to speak out. They have remained silent. It is those who failed their duty of care that should carry the burden of guilt, blame and shame; not the survivors.
This powerful report records acts of at times unbelievable violence against vulnerable children in care. It records fear, neglect and the longing for love. It records siblings being torn and kept apart. It records the withholding of letters to and from loved ones. It records being stripped of all personal belongings and dignity. It records being deprived of sufficient nourishment and of education and basic health. The argument that this was how it was done back then holds little sway. Denial is shorthand for the abdication of responsibility. The report records adult lives plagued with mental health problems, alcoholism, drug dependence, homelessness, welfare dependency, failed relationships, prison terms, premature deaths due to suicide and the longing and searching for identities and family members. The report also bears witness to positive stories of overcoming adversity and of those who through the love and support of others have found their own healing.
Politicians and policy makers have to understand the scale and effects of child abuse. Professor Fiona Stanley, the 2003 Australian of the Year, is reported in the West Australian of 9 November 2002 as stating that Australia faced a looming social crisis and a lifetime of costly government expenditure if a national program for children's welfare was not established. It is not a question of isolated individual incidents that are sad or repugnant. It is a question of a widespread social problem with huge social and economic costs. With the knowledge we now have, the cycle of abuse that is often passed on to the next generation must become a priority for those in a position to make a difference. Here I look to the Liberal and Labor parties. A resolution is needed. Only by the Commonwealth and state governments having the political will to commit money and resources to bringing the recommendations alive will some justice be restored for these people. Not only is it time; they deserve nothing less.

Family poverty, being orphaned, being born to a single mother, family dislocation, domestic violence, divorce, mental illness, a parent's inability to cope with children, or child sex abuse by a parent or step-parent are only part of the story. Any one of those reasons would be difficult enough for a child. But for a child to be placed into care, separated from their parent or parents and often from siblings, and then have to face all types of abuse, child slavery, cruelty, hunger, a lack of education, a lack of warm clothing and, probably worst of all, the total absence of love and nurturing is just profoundly sad.
Those of us who have never experienced that do not know what these people have gone through. As someone who has experienced love from their parents and from their entire family, it is incredibly difficult to look these people in the eye. They are brave, they are tough, they fight and they do not ever stop. Those of us who have had that love and care can only say, `We love you; we cherish you.' There are so many sad stories to focus on but to me one of the saddest realities is that some care leavers have discovered more recently that while they were suffering there had in fact been offers from extended family members to provide a home for them to prevent them from going into or being in care, yet these offers were usually ignored or denied by the department or agency. One can only wonder how different the outcome would have been for those so lucky.
There are so many who suffered such sadness, believing that no-one cared about them, only to find decades later that parents, siblings and extended family members had written letters or had sought to visit. None of this information was ever made known at the time nor was it made known that the letters they had written to family members had never been sent. What cruelty is that? That children were placed in institutions for care yet did not even receive the basics of what any reasonable person would consider care is beyond belief. To have taken from them on arrival everything that was in any way special—a teddy, a doll, clothes, jewellery, shoes or other treasures—was further demeaning and demoralising. All this, I might add, was often done after being strip searched. For many, not receiving an education meant being permanently consigned to life skill difficulties. One quote says it all:
I now know why my education was lost, because of a night time I was bashed, raped and molested, then stay awake all night wondering if they were going to come back. Then be bashed by the nuns at school for falling asleep in class, so I guess that's why I can't spell today.
The use of experimental medications, examinations and drugs appeared rife. Who in their right mind would force children to take mind-altering drugs, subject them to brain scans and various other neurological tests under the guise of intelligence tests, or subject young girls to enforced, painful gynaecological examinations? One may well ask why such cruel practices were never detected by the authorities, why operators of institutions were not deregistered or why the perpetrators of the violence and sex abuse were never prosecuted. It all comes down to the fact that there was a total lack of state government regulation. Either the inspections by welfare officers were carefully stage-managed or the officers studiously ignored what they saw—both of which, in my language, are reprehensible behaviour. 
What is almost worse in this situation is that, when perpetrators of abuse and assault were identified, they were allowed to resign before formal action was taken against them. Apart from the appalling treatment of children, the parents of some of the children who sought to maintain contact were deceived and threatened and were too frightened to lay any complaint about the signs of abuse they saw for fear that the children would suffer further. What a position for those parents to be placed in. I wish to quote a section of the report about the often heard statement that standards were different then. The report states:
The response that times were different and that standards and people's thinking and understanding of children's needs have changed, fails to explain or recognise the severity of the documented behaviours. Corporal punishment may no longer be in vogue. But when do a few whacks with a ruler become assault? When do the oft documented beltings and floggings become criminal assault? When did the `standards of the time' change that condoned the perpetration of neglect, cruelty, psychological abuse, sadism, rape and sodomy?
I submit that what is criminal today was criminal yesterday in this regard. To listen to the legacies of such treatment—legacies such as low self-esteem, lack of confidence, depression, fear, distrust, anger, shame, guilt, obsessiveness, social anxieties, phobias, recurring nightmares, tension, migraines and speech difficulties—is beyond comprehension. Many cannot read or write, many have had lifelong alcohol and drug problems or have ended up in the mental health or prison systems, many cannot form or maintain trust in relationships and many have contemplated or taken the ultimate step of suicide. One witness said:
I don't know how to show my family, especially my own children how I feel about them. I can't put my arms around them and tell them I love them ... and most of my married life I can't stand being touched. 
Many lack parenting skills due to the total absence of role models. Some have been successful; others have not. One witness stated:
Then at the age of 36, I met my wife. We married in 1982 and had two baby girls within two years. As I was unemployed for 5 years after we married, and although it was tough, I was able to spend a lot of time with my daughters. I was determined they weren't going to miss out like I did. I spoilt them rotten. Dorothy and the girls have been the making of me. For the first time I experienced happiness. Without them I think I would be dead now, either through alcoholism or a successful suicide. 
I do not have much time left but I have to say that I hope that state, territory and Commonwealth governments, the churches and the agencies look very closely at the recommendations that we have made. It is about time the wrongs were righted. It is about time everyone decided that what was illegal then is illegal today, and vice versa. It disturbs me that some of the state governments do not believe that things are going on today when in fact they still are. I conclude my comments by commending the report to the Senate. May I extend to the care leavers and their loved ones a wish that from hereon their lives will take a fresh turn for the best.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,0,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-30,"—Let me begin by acknowledging and welcoming all those in the public gallery who have journeyed to Canberra today to witness this historic tabling of this groundbreaking report, suitably titled Forgotten Australians. This report means so much to so many—not just the half a million plus directly affected but the millions of Australians indirectly affected. 
Three years ago, in August 2001, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's child migrant report, Lost innocents: righting the record, was tabled in the Senate. That inquiry had an intensely personal dimension for me because of my own background. When I rose to speak to the report, I just could not; so Senator Sue Knowles delivered my speech for me. There is a message in that in itself, because these painful inquiries draw all senators together in a shared sense of outrage, compassion and a need to find remedies. We are forever bonded and affected by the pain we have witnessed. This report into children in institutional care is the third in the trilogy—the first being the 1997 Bringing them home report on the fate of the Aboriginal stolen generation and the second the 2001 report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into child migration.
The day I encountered Norman Johnston and his band of protestors outside the parliament, pleading for a child migrant inquiry, is probably the birthplace of both these reports. Norman and Margaret Humphries personify the campaigners for the first report, and Leonie Sheedy and Joanna Penglase personify the campaigners for the second report. We owe them all a great debt of gratitude.
But it is to the witnesses I dedicate this tabling speech. To every care leaver who submitted their intensely personal story to this inquiry, I thank you and honour your courage in doing so. Often these stories were being told for the very first time. I saw wives, husbands and friends listening in amazement as they heard such personal, intimate stories put down on the public record. There were so many tears: from the witnesses, the audiences, the senators, Hansard and our secretariat. For many witnesses, a measure of healing was gained through being able to finally tell their stories, knowing that they were believed at last. I also wish to honour the many thousands who were unable to or could not relive their experiences through writing or making a submission.
With me on this committee has been Senator Steve Hutchins—the first chair—who helped me negotiate the terms of reference for this inquiry with Labor. I and we owe him a great deal, and he has done himself and his party proud. Senator Jan McLucas followed Senator Hutchins as chair, and she has been outstanding in her determination to do right by those who have been in care. Senator Sue Knowles is, as I am, a veteran of both inquiries. As deputy chair she has again shown her compassion and determination that justice be done and remedies be found. In Senators Gary Humphries and Claire Moore we have fortunately found people of great heart and great strength. My Senate colleagues: I salute your efforts and am deeply grateful for them. Your humanity and compassion honour you.
There was also Hansard, who had the painful task of recording it all. We have all experienced what the psychologists refer to as `referred pain'—none more so than the bruised, supportive secretariat to this harrowing inquiry. To Elton, Ingrid, Geraldine, Christine, Leonie and Peter, I extend my grateful thanks. It would be difficult to find a more hardworking group of people than these. Their commitment deserves the highest praise.
Then there is Dr Marilyn Rock, my electorate officer and senior adviser, who has dedicated five hard years to this cause of getting recognition, help and remedies to all those who have suffered in institutions and care. Quite simply, I could not have put in the effort that I have without her valuable professional and humane support. All over Australia, people turn to her for help.  
This quote from a submission captured a fundamental truth:
While I have survived extreme deprivation I am left with deep emotional scars. I have a sense of abandonment, exploitation and not belonging ... I feel it impossible to fully recover from my experiences.
Understanding this truth is set to alter public policy towards children forever. What is that truth? If you badly harm a child you will have decades of a badly harmed adult to cope with. It does not end there. The effects of the harm are often transferred to the victim's children, creating generational social problems. Although there are good stories, the sheer scale of damaged people is staggering.
That so many endured a childhood deprived of love and security of their own families is certainly sad. That so many were subject to abuse and neglect, including criminal sexual and physical assaults, is unforgivable. That so many are scarred and live on the margins of society as adults without programs to assist them is scandalous. My hope is that this report, in conjunction with the two earlier reports, will mean that bureaucrats, policy makers and politicians will at last be able to comprehend the importance of the issues affecting the survivors of childhood abuse. The message is getting out that the abuse, neglect and assault of children can no longer be tolerated, not only because it is wrong but because of the long-term social and economic effects.
There is now an extensive body of research that clearly shows that if you hurt and break the spirit of a child you end up with a hurt and broken adult, with all of those consequences. Even the well-adjusted struggle. A 70-year-old wrote of the lasting effects:
Every now and then a door opens in the memory bank and the ghosts escape to make us lonely children again.
There were those who had good outcomes, in places run by good people. But too many have led and are leading lonely, marginal lives from which there appears no escape. They also live with the pain of lost family members and of lost identities. For too many, their childhood remains a private hell stained with memories of beatings, sexual assault and molestation, and exploitation as child labour. Sadly, because of the planted guilt, blame and shame, most have learnt not to rebel against injustice, not to speak out. They have remained silent. It is those who failed their duty of care that should carry the burden of guilt, blame and shame; not the survivors.
This powerful report records acts of at times unbelievable violence against vulnerable children in care. It records fear, neglect and the longing for love. It records siblings being torn and kept apart. It records the withholding of letters to and from loved ones. It records being stripped of all personal belongings and dignity. It records being deprived of sufficient nourishment and of education and basic health. The argument that this was how it was done back then holds little sway. Denial is shorthand for the abdication of responsibility. The report records adult lives plagued with mental health problems, alcoholism, drug dependence, homelessness, welfare dependency, failed relationships, prison terms, premature deaths due to suicide and the longing and searching for identities and family members. The report also bears witness to positive stories of overcoming adversity and of those who through the love and support of others have found their own healing.
Politicians and policy makers have to understand the scale and effects of child abuse. Professor Fiona Stanley, the 2003 Australian of the Year, is reported in the West Australian of 9 November 2002 as stating that Australia faced a looming social crisis and a lifetime of costly government expenditure if a national program for children's welfare was not established. It is not a question of isolated individual incidents that are sad or repugnant. It is a question of a widespread social problem with huge social and economic costs. With the knowledge we now have, the cycle of abuse that is often passed on to the next generation must become a priority for those in a position to make a difference. Here I look to the Liberal and Labor parties. A resolution is needed. Only by the Commonwealth and state governments having the political will to commit money and resources to bringing the recommendations alive will some justice be restored for these people. Not only is it time; they deserve nothing less. 
Senator McLUCAS (Queensland) (1.01 p.m.)—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,0,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-30,"—I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004. It is an omnibus bill which updates a number of offences originally enacted in 1989 relating to misuse of telecommunications services and moves them from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code. The bill also creates a number of new offences on a range of topics. Those topics include offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to access, transmit or publish child pornography or child abuse material and of procuring or grooming a person under 16 years of age for sexual activity. These complement existing offences in place at the state and territory level. Also included are offences of using a carriage service, including the Internet, to make threats to kill or cause serious harm, to perpetrate a hoax relating to explosive or dangerous substances or to engage in menacing, harassing or offensive behaviour.
The bill also includes offences to prevent the rebirthing of stolen mobile phones and the copying of mobile phone SIM cards. It also deals with offences of making hoax or vexatious calls to emergency service numbers. It includes offences of contaminating goods, threatening to contaminate goods or perpetrating a contamination hoax. There are also offences of dishonestly obtaining or dealing in personal financial information, which are targeted at credit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. These implement model legislation developed jointly by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. Clearly, it is an omnibus bill which covers a range of issues and will provide a move to the Criminal Code. The bill also makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to criminal law statutes, dealing with matters including alternative verdicts, knowledge of criminal law, proof of narcotics offences and international assistance in criminal matters.
It is worth touching on a couple of background issues in relation to this bill. As was noted in the House of Representatives, the bill appears to have had a long period of gestation within this government if the public statements of numerous ministers, past and present, are anything to go by. On 4 April 2003—almost a year and a half ago—the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, issued a media release titled `New offences to clamp down on Internet child pornography'. That release made mention of the offences covering child pornography and material that incites suicide. Then on 20 August 2003—just over a year ago—Senator Ellison and the then minister for communications, Senator Alston, issued a joint media release titled `Using internet for offensive and menacing purposes to be outlawed'. This release mentioned offences dealing with offensive, menacing or harassing Internet content. It also reannounced the child pornography offences and mentioned the offences dealing with the rebirthing of stolen mobile phones. 
Then there was silence for quite a while. But on 14 March 2004 Senator Ellison and the then minister for communications, Mr Daryl Williams, issued a joint media release titled `Tough laws to target Internet child sex crime', reannouncing the legislation and releasing an exposure draft. On 19 March 2004 Senator Ellison issued a media release titled `Agreement reached on new national laws to outlaw credit card skimming', which announced the offences concerning fraudulent dealings with personal financial information. What we have is a start date of almost a year and a half ago and a collection and a reissuing of matters in the announcements by the minister, an old minister and a newer one. It finally culminated on 25 June 2004, when Senator Ellison and Mr Williams, the then communications minister, issued another media release, `Internet child sex abuse offences Bill tabled', to coincide with the introduction of an earlier bill in the Senate which bears the same name as the current bill—minus the words `No. 2'—and which we understand the government will no longer be proceeding with. All of these announcements have culminated in the current bill, which was introduced into the House on 4 August.
The bill was referred to the Senate committee following the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquired into the bill. The time allotted for the inquiry was only short—a total of six days—but nevertheless the committee had an opportunity to put a number of issues raised in a submission from Electronic Frontiers and a Bills Digest prepared by the Parliamentary Library to the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Federal Police for response. In considering the bill, the committee was mindful of the fact that it incorporated changes made in response to submissions received on an exposure draft released earlier in the year.
It is worth mentioning two issues that were discussed by the committee, namely offensive use of a carriage service and defences in respect of child pornography and abuse material. I mention those particular issues because they are the subject of proposed amendments by the Democrats. In relation to the first matter—offensive use of a carriage service—the committee noted that the indicative criteria of offensiveness are drawn from the national classification scheme and would be for a jury to apply based on a criminal standard of proof.
The opposition has carefully examined this amendment and weighed a number of factors. The amendment updates the existing offence in section 85ZE of the Crimes Act. The existing offence applies an objective standard of offensiveness to the use of all carriage services except the Internet, to which a subjective standard applies. An objective standard, under section 471.1.2 of the Criminal Code, also applies to the use of postal and similar services. The origin of this distinction is the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999. Its rationale is not entirely clear from the parliamentary debates, but it seems to have been designed to emphasise that offensive Internet content would be dealt with primarily by the online content scheme rather than the Crimes Act. While the case for applying a different standard of regulation to the Internet understandably commanded more support when the Internet was younger, the community is now more conscious of the dangers posed by some Internet content and has a legitimate expectation of an equivalent degree of protection to that applying to other communications media. On that basis, and considering that a criminal standard of proof applies, the opposition is prepared to support this aspect of the bill and will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment, which maintains the status quo. 
In relation to the second matter—defences in respect of child pornography and child abuse material—the committee heard evidence from the Attorney-General's Department about the drafting of this aspect of the bill. The department told the committee it had attempted to craft a general defence relating to research into paedophilia and child abuse but received public feedback on the exposure draft which suggested that the general defence would be susceptible to misuse. The department also gave evidence that it consulted with the Australian Institute of Criminology on the prevalence of genuine research of this kind and determined that a mechanism involving approval by the minister was workable. The department also drew the committee's attention to comparable approval processes in other legislation for research into prohibited drugs. On the basis of the explanation provided to the committee, the opposition is now satisfied that the proposed approval mechanism is not inappropriate. Therefore, the opposition will not support the Democrat amendment.
In conclusion, the opposition provides its support for the passage of this bill. The overwhelming majority of this bill is not controversial, although it did have quite a substantive gestation period, and it makes improvements to the criminal law. With that explanation on those two more controversial issues in relation to the two Democrat amendments, the opposition supports the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-30,"—The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004 introduces a range of new offences relating to the use of a telecommunications network or carriage service, including interfering with a telecommunications service or using a telecommunications service in a range of areas, including with an intention to: commit a serious offence; make a threat or a hoax threat; menace, harass or cause offence; access, transmit, make available, publish or distribute child pornography or child abuse material; and procure or `groom' a person under the age of 16 years for sexual purposes. In addition to the telecommunications offences, the bill creates new offences relating to the contamination of goods, credit card skimming and child prostitution on Australian aircraft.
It also makes changes to the criminal justice process. For example, it codifies the maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse by providing that a person is to be held criminally liable even if he or she is ignorant of, or mistaken about, the law creating an offence. In addition, a jury will be able to find a person guilty of a crime if the jury is satisfied that the person was responsible for the crime regardless of whether the person actually carried out the crime themselves. The bill further amends the Customs Act so that it would not be necessary to prove that a person charged with importing narcotics intentionally brought the prohibited substance into Australia. Finally, amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act will make it easier for foreign countries to obtain evidence from Australia in criminal prosecutions. 
The Democrats moved to refer the original Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2004 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry. That bill also contained a number of contentious provisions relating to the use of a carriage service to disseminate information inciting suicide, which the Democrats believe could potentially stifle debate on the issue of euthanasia. However, we are pleased that the government has chosen to deal with those provisions in a separate bill, which is now before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—although I understand the hearings on that are being delayed by the prorogation of parliament. However, our concerns in relation to the original bill were not confined to the suicide provisions, and we were therefore pleased that the government also referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for further consideration.
Unfortunately, the committee's inquiry was incredibly rushed. The bill was referred to the committee on 5 August this year. A public hearing was held four days later and the committee reported to the Senate on 11 August. Only five submissions were received. I understand that a number of groups contacted the committee secretariat and indicated that the short time frame of the inquiry made it impossible for them to participate. It is disappointing and it illustrates how the incredibly valuable role of Senate committees in properly scrutinising legislation can be emasculated by the demands of government. 
However, despite the extremely short time frame of this inquiry and the small number of submissions, the inquiry was nonetheless helpful in considering the provisions of the bill. One point that emerged from the committee inquiry was that the government appears to have undertaken fairly widespread consultation on the bill prior to its introduction. Electronic Frontiers Australia—EFA—indicated that many of the issues and concerns which they had expressed in April had been addressed and resolved to their satisfaction by the Attorney-General's Department prior to the introduction of the bill in June. We Democrats take this opportunity to acknowledge and commend the government on engaging in a proper and good process of consultation. We note that this level of consultation does not always occur, yet the benefits of it have been made clear, at least in this instance. 
However, we Democrats do note and are disappointed by the fact that a number of the provisions of the bill do pre-empt the completion of the government's review—which was announced in July this year—into illegal or offensive content on mobile telephones and other mobile devices. I think one has to question the value of such a review when its outcome is being pre-empted by the legislative change just one month after the announcement of the review. 
Although many of the Democrats' concerns about this bill have been allayed as a result of the committee inquiry, we do have a number of outstanding concerns. The first of those relates to the offence of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. The offence occurs if a person uses a carriage service and does so in a way that reasonable persons could regard as being menacing, harassing or offensive in all the circumstances. Our particular concern in relation to this offence is that there is no requirement for the person to have intended to menace, harass or offend another person, nor that any person was actually menaced, harassed or offended. As a consequence, concerns have been raised about the potential impact of this offence on those who use the Internet or email to advance or elicit support for a particular cause—for example, to organise a peace rally. There are some fears that these provisions could stifle genuine political debate on the basis that using a carriage service to advance a particular cause could be seen by some as menacing, harassing or offensive. 
We Democrats accept the point made by the Attorney-General's Department during the committee inquiry that it would be very difficult to successfully prosecute a person who uses a carriage service to express a genuinely held opinion, particularly in the context of political debate. However, we do not believe that serious concerns about the elements of an offence should remain unaddressed simply because the offence will be difficult to prosecute. That is simply not good law making. We should be addressing any concerns in the text of the legislation, not in the way in which it is applied within the community.
Another concern which we Democrats have relates to child pornography offences. The bill provides that it will be a defence to child pornography offences if the defendant can demonstrate that their conduct was of public benefit. The bill contains a very strict definition of what is considered to be `of public benefit' in these circumstances, including the undertaking of research `approved by the minister in writing'. While the Democrats certainly welcome the provisions relating to the new child pornography offences contained in this bill, and the fact that there are only a very limited range of defences, we are concerned by any provision which requires genuine, independent research to be vetted by the minister.
We have discussed this concern with the Attorney-General's office and we understand that the government takes a view. However, it has clearly been a difficult issue for the government. In his evidence to the committee, Mr Geoff McDonald from the Attorney-General's Department said:
... I suppose one of the most difficult issues that we did face was the whole issue of research into paedophilia and making sure that we had an appropriate mechanism for dealing with that. We had a general test, which related to research, and some of the feedback we got was that this had actually been misused by people in the past. Consequently we tightened up the provisions in relation to research. We spoke to the Australian Institute of Criminology about just how prevalent this research was, and the information we received was that it was not very prevalent. To make sure that there was certainty with the provisions, we decided that where it was specific research into paedophilia we would have an approval process from the minister for justice. We were concerned that it was difficult to get a good general formula.
We Democrats accept that this has been a genuinely difficult issue for the Attorney-General's Department and we acknowledge that there may be some scope for a general defence of public interest research to be abused. However, we do not believe that this warrants a system in which independent research ought to be vetted by a minister. In our view, it would be much more appropriate for a court, rather than a minister, to determine whether particular research is of public benefit, otherwise a political perspective may well be brought into that determination. We Democrats will be seeking to address that issue further during the committee stage.
Finally, I want to take this opportunity to make some brief comments about the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, which is addressed in the bill. In particular, I would like to highlight some observations that I recently provided to the Alternative Law Journal regarding legal education. I argued:
Our daily lives are governed by thousands of Acts, Regulations and common law precedents. Yet, as the Bill before us reinforces, if we breach any of these laws, ignorance is no excuse and we will find ourselves criminally liable. 
This leaves us with the anomaly that we are all presumed to know a vast array of laws, which no judge, lawyer or law-maker could possibly be completely familiar with, and there may be many serious criminal consequences if we make a mistake. However, one way in which to overcome this anomaly is to ensure that the law corresponds to community standards. In other words, we can endeavour to create the kind of legal system which ensures that, if you live your life in a way that roughly accords with community standards, you can be pretty confident that you are not breaking the law.
For this reason, it is vitally important that the law reflects community standards. To ensure that this is the case, those of us who make laws should be held accountable through the democratic process, while judicial accountability arises from the provision of reasons for decisions. But whether we are talking about new laws or the judicial development of existing law, it is vital for the community to have a basic understanding of the democratic process and the law for these accountability mechanisms to work effectively.
Unfortunately, there is evidence to show that many Australians do not possess a basic understanding of the law. The Civics Expert Group report of 1994 found that only 18 per cent of Australians showed some degree of understanding of the Constitution and only 41 per cent knew how the Constitution can be changed, despite the vast majority having voted in referenda. Only 40 per cent of Australians could correctly recall the names of both houses of parliament and only 50 per cent knew that the High Court is the highest court of appeal. The Civics Expert Group report argued:
When lack of knowledge on how government institutions work and an uncertainty of what the civic ethos means is coupled with a mistrust of politics, a danger arises. Our system of government relies for its efficiency and legitimacy on an informed citizenry; without active, knowledgeable citizens the forms of democratic representation remain empty; without vigilant informed citizens there is no check on potential tyranny.
We Democrats believe that civics and legal education have an important role to play in making our system work effectively, and there is a real need for a more comprehensive approach to civics education in this nation. A greater understanding of our legal and democratic systems is needed within the Australian community to ensure that the `ignorance of the law is no excuse' rule does not result in grave injustices and the conviction of individuals who never intended to commit a crime. This is particularly crucial at a time when, increasingly, the government is moving towards the creation of strict and absolute liability offences. I take this opportunity, in the dawn of an election campaign period, to challenge the government on the issue of civics education and to ask what it is doing on this front to address the issues that were so clearly identified by the Civics Expert Group some 10 years ago.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-08-30,"—The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004 by and large deserves support. There are some aspects of the bill, however, that are disconcerting. Major issues have not been addressed by this legislation. The legislation deals with the issue of abuse and the definition of child abuse material. The legislation defines child abuse material as:
(a)	material that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who:
(i)	is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; and 
(ii)	is, or appears to be, a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse;
and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive ...
Let me deal with the matter of offensiveness. One child expert, Professor Freda Briggs, has described certain types of child pornography as offensive. The words she used were `child abuse'. That material is currently available, freely, on the Net and without any proper regulation. This is very disconcerting to many parents. The legislation is meant to deal with the use of the Internet to facilitate or exploit the sexual abuse of children through child pornography. Of course, I support that aspect of it, but I want to ask why we are not dealing with the use of the Internet to facilitate or exploit the sexual abuse of children through children's accessing pornography on the Internet, because exposing children to pornography on the Internet is child abuse too. Why isn't that dealt with by this legislation?
Parents whose children use the Internet are advised to take a number of precautions, including the installation of Internet filters and ensuring their children are supervised, but many children are still falling prey to Internet pornography. The current regulations are dealing in an unreal world, because many children are unsupervised and fall prey to Internet pornographers. Last year the Australia Institute found that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls aged 16 to 17 years of age have had accidental exposure to Internet sex sites. The Institute reported that this included images of bestiality and violent scenes of women being raped, and that studies showed a `relationship between pornography and sexually aggressive attitudes and behaviour'.
I was very pleased when the Australian Labor Party was going to adopt a more restrictive approach to the online regulatory scheme, because that scheme is totally inadequate at the present moment and is largely influenced by the force of the Internet Industry Association's rejection of a requirement for compulsory filtering on an opt-out basis. However, I was very disappointed when the federal opposition eventually decided, by way of an internal policy change, not to accept the Australia Institute's proposal to protect children from pornography on the Internet. The Australia Institute proposed that there be mandatory filtering of the Internet to block pornography, with adults having the option to opt out of the system.
Parents across Australia want some help so that they can allow their children to access the benefits of the Internet without the constant danger of their being confronted with Internet pornography. The government and the opposition should bite the bullet and provide families with real solutions to fix this problem. It is a vast problem out there, and one which I believe will become significant in the next few months. To protect children and to assist parents, Internet service providers should provide compulsory filtering of Internet content on an opt-out basis. Many parents do not know the importance of installing filters and of supervising their children's Internet use. Those adults who do not want Internet content filtered can elect to opt out of the system.
The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts commissioned and published a report from IT consulting company Ovum, which provides a fully costed proposal for a system of Internet filtering. Ovum estimated that set-up costs for ISPs would be $45 million, with recurring annual costs of $33 million. These costs could be covered by the government and they represent a very small amount when it comes to protecting our children. The friends of the pornographers have argued for years that any proposed action to protect children will not work and that community education is the only answer. The evidence is in that community education has had only a limited effect. If we want to protect children from damaging pornography, we cannot continue to sit back and do nothing. 
The Internet Industry Association, as I indicated, have fought a rearguard action to thwart attempts to protect children from Internet pornography. I will deal shortly with the new third generation material. The Internet Industry Association have demonstrated their total lack of interest in helping parents to protect their children from Internet pornography. Following their `family friendly ISP' branding scheme, which merely requires ISPs to comply with the IIA codes of practice, just 11 of their 563 ISP members have signed up. That is how much control they have over this. They have signed up only 11 of their 563 members—just under two per cent of ISPs—following their much heralded Internet content plan.
If the government or the opposition want to find a way to help parents, they should remember that the Internet Industry Association is part of the problem, not part of the solution. Children should be protected from pornography—Professor Briggs called it child abuse—and it is not dealt with in this legislation. Almost everyone agrees that children should be protected from pornography, but not enough has been done to protect children from damaging images accessed on the Internet or by devices like 3G mobile phones.
How can we address this appalling situation so that children can enjoy the great benefits of the Internet and mobile telephones, without the pitfalls? Also bear in mind that the kids that I am talking about are, from a very early age, computer savvy and mobile phone savvy. As I mentioned, one way would be through compulsory Internet filtering. The Australia Institute found that 93 per cent of parents `would support a system that automatically filtered out Internet pornography going into homes unless adult users asked otherwise'. With this safeguard, those children with parents who do not know about filters or who face work or other pressures and are unable to supervise their children's Internet use will at least have some limited protection.
The online content co-regulatory scheme was set up to protect Australians from unwanted pornography and to take down illegal sites. The evidence collected by the Australia Institute shows that the current regulatory arrangements to protect children have failed. New third generation mobile phones are proving a further challenge to the protection of children. We should be worried about the potential for damage to children from their mobile phone use. A 2003 forum co-hosted by Childnet International and the Japanese Internet Association heard that children can be put in danger by what they might see or by whom they might meet online.
The government has referred the issue of how to handle pornography on 3G mobile phones for further review. There are over 14 million mobile phone accounts operating in Australia. Roy Morgan Research says that one in six teenagers own a mobile phone. More than 20,000 mobile phones are linked to the new 3G, or third generation, network. These new phones and similar mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, can allow access to pictures, video streaming and Internet content. To date, 3G coverage is limited to Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.
Mobile phones are virtually impossible for parents to supervise. There are no filtering devices available for Internet enabled mobile telephones, but carriers should install filters on their networks. At least one of Australia's 3G carriers already offers so-called adult content. It uses a PIN as a way of restricting access to minors, but the Australian Communications Authority has described PINs as `nearly useless'—that is the view of the Australian Communications Authority—for preventing children viewing content, as they change hands easily. This will be an unwelcome surprise to many parents who see mobile phones as a way of maintaining easy contact with their children and ensuring their safety, not as technology which might threaten their wellbeing. While parents might buy a mobile phone for their children's security, children are more likely to see it as an expression of their growing independence. Children have the skill and competence to use the technology, but they do not always have the maturity to decide what they should or should not see or do. 
In May the government issued directions to the Australian Communications Authority to put in controls over SMS and multimedia messaging services, or MMS, so that children will not be able to see MA or R-rated content—X-rated content is not permitted—but it is very difficult for telecommunications companies to distinguish between a mobile phone used by an adult and one bought by an adult for their child. These safeguards need to be put in place before a new device or technology is put onto the market, not after. We need to protect our children; whether children are using computers or mobile phones, we have to ensure that they are safe. We have wasted enough time on this legislation. It ought to go through, but it ought to go through with the recognition that child abuse is as described by Professor Briggs.
Very young people have had access to some of this material, including R-rated material and X-rated material. I have had quite a number of distraught parents writing to me and telling me stories about their children—very young children; I am talking about three or four years of age—who have seen this material on the screen. These parents have appealed for me to do something. Of course they are emotionally disturbed and upset. I can recall one particular case where a seven-year-old had seen so-called sexually explicit material and then tried the actions out on a younger sibling who was two years of age. We have got this potential because we are not doing anything about it.
I would like to know if the original bill has been amended, as Senator Greig said, by the Attorney-General's Department on the request of the EFA—Electronic Frontiers Australia. I would like to find out in the committee stage precisely what was required, what was requested and what amendments were made on behalf of the EFA.
I will leave the matter there. I do not suggest we hold this bill up at the present moment; if there is an amendment, as I understand it, then it has got to go back to the House of Representatives and if it is unamended it can go into law. That is as I understand it. This matter has really got to be looked into at some stage and looked at very seriously. If one of the major parties came out with a policy on this particular matter, then there would be millions of parents around the place who would be very pleased that such a decision could be arrived at which would truly protect their children.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-08-30,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this bill, which is a very important one and by its very description indicates the broad area that it relates to. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004 incorporates a number of provisions touching on areas which the average Australian would come into contact with on a daily basis. Of course, the provisions dealing with telecommunications are perhaps the ones which have been the most controversial. Significantly it contains reference to child pornography and its relationship to telecommunications, particularly the Internet. That one is by far the most significant aspect of this bill, one which is perhaps the easiest to deal with. 
The history of this bill has of course involved a great deal of consultation, as Senator Greig has pointed out, because it not only deals with child pornography on the Internet or transmitting it by telecommunications but also deals with the question of harassing a person, menacing that person or treating them in an offensive way on the Internet or using telecommunications for that purpose. It also deals with the improper use of an emergency call service, threats and hoaxes made using a telecommunication service and modification of the international mobile equipment identity number of a mobile phone. There is also a provision which deals with credit card skimming, which is becoming more important in the daily lives of Australians who have a credit card. In addition, there is the question of contaminating goods and interfering with trade. This situation has arisen recently. There is a particular case which I will not refer to as the matter is ongoing, but internationally this issue has presented itself.
For those reasons this bill is broad in its nature. I will deal first with the most significant provision of this bill, that dealing with child pornography. We need to ensure that our children, who are more technically adept than any generation before them, are protected from those who would use the Internet, and now mobile phones, for predatory and abusive purposes. I might just touch on what Senator Harradine has mentioned. It is of great concern that children can access pornography on the Internet, or any undesirable content. This bill was not designed to address that issue. This bill was designed to crack down on those people who use the Internet for the purposes of disseminating child pornography, accessing it and downloading it, and on those who use the means of telecommunication for the purposes of child pornography.
Authorities tell us that today 80 per cent of child pornography is transmitted by, or as a result of, the Internet. That is a disturbing feature. The question that Senator Harradine raises as to filtering and the regulation, if you like, of the access of children to the Internet is a very important issue and one which we will have to confront. This bill brings into law new offences which deal with the use of the Internet to access, transmit or make available child pornography and child abuse material. Other offences involve the use of the Internet to groom or procure children with the intent of engaging in sexual activity with them. Unfortunately, this activity has been on the rise recently. These offences will ensure that paedophiles who use the Internet to access and disseminate child pornography, which not only depicts the use of young children but fuels future child abuse, could face periods of up to 10 years in jail.
Perhaps more importantly, the grooming and procuring offences will enable the Australian Federal Police to interact with and arrest Internet predators before they abuse more children that they have, or intend to have, contact with through Internet chat rooms and the like. These offenders will face even longer jail terms, of up to 15 years. What we are about here is preventative action in relation to those paedophiles, those perverts, who want to use the Internet to groom children to make contact with unsuspecting children so that they can have their evil way with them. 
These offences demonstrate the commitment by the Australian government to child protection, and our zero tolerance of child sexual abuse. I appreciate the support that has been given to this bill in the Senate chamber today. As Senator Harradine has indicated, should this bill be amended, then it will not be able to pass into law—it would have to go back to the House of Representatives, and we know that is not possible.
The fact that there is a lack of controversy about this bill, which has such wide application, is indicative of the history of the bill and the consultation which has taken place. I would say, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Harradine that this bill did not originally contain provisions for filters, or the sorts of provisions which Senator Harradine has spoken of. They would find their place in separate legislation. It is not as if we have had representations about those provisions and taken them out of the bill. But we can address his concerns during the committee stage.
Other measures I have referred to concern offences dealing with the improper use of an emergency call service, the use of a telecommunications service in a menacing, harassing or offensive way, threats and hoaxes made using a telecommunications service and modification of the international mobile equipment identity number of a mobile phone.
What we have found increasingly in this day and age is the use of hoax calls. That makes it commonsense that we should have offences relating to those sorts of calls. Our authorities—those people who deal with emergency services, law enforcement and the like—have a tough enough job as it is without having to put up with hoax calls, particularly in the present security environment. It is important that we send a very clear message to the community that we will not tolerate our emergency service numbers being abused in this fashion. Unfortunately, the Internet has been used to make attacks on individuals. We have seen the Internet being used to menace and harass people. This is something which we will not tolerate in any other medium in our daily lives, and it should not be tolerated in a telecommunications service.
There are also comprehensive new contamination of goods offences. These offences reflect the economic loss and public alarm that can arise from the actual contamination of goods as well as from someone threatening to contaminate goods or falsely claiming that particular goods have been contaminated. These offences will be an important addition to the federal Criminal Code. They will complement existing state and territory offences as well as extending to threats made to contaminate Australian goods from outside Australia. This is an extremely important provision. Whilst we firmly believe, as Australians, that we should have freedom of speech, we do not believe that a protest should take the form of contamination of goods—a sabotaging, if you like, of our trading with other nations. If someone has an objection to our trading with a country or to a particular trade, then the contamination of those goods is not the way to express that opinion. This is behaviour that could cause Australia great damage economically. It could also be used to damage or harm a particular business. It is a behaviour which should be outlawed, and which will be comprehensively outlawed, by this bill.
I mentioned credit card skimming. Increasingly we are finding that credit card fraud is affecting average Australians. Out of the $1.1 billion a year worth of identity fraud, $200 million is caused by credit card fraud. In particular, we estimate that $50 million per year is caused by the use of credit card skimmers. We are seeing increasingly sophisticated attempts at ATMs and at retail outlets to skim credit cards and to transpose the details onto blank credit cards with a new identity, and we then find that an individual has been robbed of his or her credit or money accordingly; the victims are average Australians. Credit card fraud is on the rise and the Australian Federal Police are doing a great job in fighting it through their Australian High Tech Crime Centre. I have set up a group that includes representatives from banks and other financial institutions to address this very issue. There is an education program being embarked upon in relation to that. This demonstrates yet again the broad nature of this bill and the very important provisions that we have in it to protect the average Australian. 
These offences not only cover credit card skimming offences but also target dishonest dealing in personal financial information without the consent of the person to whom that information relates. The possession and importation of credit card skimming devices will also be caught by new offences, with penalties of up to five years imprisonment to apply to those instances. At the borders great work is being done by Customs in the seizure of blank credit cards from organised gangs who have tried to import them into Australia. That has resulted in stopping harm that could have been perpetrated within Australia on unsuspecting small businesses in particular and also on individuals.
This bill contains provisions that are critical to law enforcement in this country, particularly in relation to the protection of children by way of the provisions that deal with child pornography. The violation of children is perhaps one of the most ghastly offences that we can contemplate. Certainly, as has been said before, it is a crime that screams out to heaven for vengeance because of the damage it can cause a child for the rest of his or her life. We heard a debate earlier in the Senate today in relation to a Senate report in which mention was made of just that, in another context.
These are very important provisions. I commend them to the Senate and urge the speedy passage of this bill. In closing I add that the Democrats have two amendments which the government has looked at carefully. The government is unable to support those amendments and I will go into the government's position in more detail in the committee stage of the bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-08-30,"—My question is to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister. I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to Mr Mike Scrafton's letter to the Australian on 16 August 2004 and the sworn statutory declaration he made on 17 August on the same matter. Is the minister aware that Mr Scrafton has stated that he told the Prime Minister on 7 November 2001 that the Office of National Assessments' report No. 226 of 2001 and dated 9 October 2001, which mentioned children being thrown overboard, was to his understanding `based on the minister for immigration's public statements and not on intelligence reporting' and he suggested the Prime Minister `take the issue up with Kim Jones, the Director-General of the Office of National Assessments'? Did the Prime Minister take Mr Scrafton's advice and ring Kim Jones about the ONA report, which was based on ministerial statements, before he released it to the media at the National Press Club on 8 November 2001? If not, why not?

Minister, didn't ONA Director-General, Kim Jones, when faxing ONA report No. 226 of 2001 to the Prime Minister's office on the evening of 7 November 2001 also include a cover sheet warning the Prime Minister not to rely on the report because it was probably based on ministerial statements?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-30,"—I suspect that this reflects the Labor Party campaign for this election. This is the alternative that they are putting to the Australian people. After nearly nine years in opposition, this is the best that they can come up with—no policies, no alternative vision for Australia. Where is their tax policy—the tax policy that we were going to get before the budget, that we were then going to get in the response on the Thursday night after the budget and that we were then going to get before the election was announced?
—Order! Senator Conroy, you have asked your question.
—I was making the point that this reflects Labor's vision. This is the start of an election campaign. There are six weeks for the Labor Party to set out its alternative vision for Australia, what it is going to offer Australia in terms of economic policy. What about interest rates? We remember that when Labor was last in government housing interest rates were 17 per cent.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. What about the question?
—Senator, you know there is no point of order. The minister has almost three minutes to answer the question.
—This sets the scene. This is what the Labor Party is putting down as the foundation of its campaign and what we, the Australian people, are going to hear about for the next six weeks—an attempt to personally denigrate the Prime Minister. Wasn't it Mr Latham who said he was going to bring a new standard to Australian politics?
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! I remind senators that today's proceedings are being broadcast and televised. There is an election coming up in a few weeks time and that will give the Australian people an opportunity to reflect on the behaviour of people in this place.
—It was Mr Latham who said he was going to take the personalities out of Australian politics—he was above all that. He wanted debate on policies. He wanted the Australian people to make a choice on alternative policies that are presented to them. Here we are at the start of a six-week election campaign—the first chance since the election was announced for the Labor Party to present its alternative—and what is this all about? It is back in the gutter, trying to attack Mr Howard personally, trying to further attack his credibility. 
Look at what is going to happen in the Senate this afternoon. They are going to set up a committee of inquiry into Mr Howard. They—the Labor Party and the Greens—are going to pass an order that they will have a majority and they will order that the report be brought down by 7 October. What happens on 7 October? They will predetermine the guilt of Mr Howard, as is the prejudice within this question that is asked today. We have to go through this whole political farce. The Australian people want better. They want better from Mr Latham. After nearly nine years they want better from the Australian Labor Party. They deserve an alternative set of policies upon which to make a judgment.  
Senator Conroy knows as well as anyone else in this place that what he puts to me is not Mr Howard's recollection, nor that of his staff, nor that of other persons who were with him. But that does not matter, because the Labor Party are not interested in the truth. What the Labor Party are wanting is a personalised, in the gutter campaign against the credibility of Mr Howard. It is all they can come up with after nearly nine years in opposition. What a sad state of affairs. Senator Conroy, you at least were advocating higher taxes a few months ago. Why don't you have the courage to stand up and do that today? Let us have a debate before the Australian people rather than starting off this question time by going back into personalised politics—
—Really?
—Well, that is what you are doing, isn't it? This is your chance. Why don't we have a debate on a new national payroll tax for Australia? That would be a good way to start this question time.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-30,"—On 30 January this year Mr Latham said:
I'm absolutely convinced that most Australians want to move beyond the old politics, the fear mongering, the negativity, the needless division and deceit ...
But of course a leopard cannot change his spots. Mr Latham is a hater.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I specifically asked about a cover sheet on an ONA document, and the minister is deliberately avoiding the question. I ask you to draw him to the question and make him answer it.
—I cannot direct a minister how to answer questions but I would remind the minister that he has 37 seconds left, and I would remind him of the terms of the question.
—I was making the point that this is not surprising because Mr Latham is a hater. He says he is a hater. On 26 June he said: `I am a hater. I want to see more haters.' He also said:

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today.
We are in a bizarre situation in the Senate, with the House of Representatives effectively dissolved as of yesterday but parliament not prorogued until tomorrow. This is an unprecedented move where the Prime Minister is trying, and is succeeding, to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. It is a desperate ploy by the Prime Minister to avoid accountability in question time. It just goes to show the contempt that John Howard has for the institutions of our democracy. We have seen that again and again during his tenure as Prime Minister. Ministers' conflicts of interest have been ignored. They are able to sashay on to cushy post-parliamentary career jobs where they can parlay their inside knowledge and contacts for six-figure salaries. Under John Howard, ministerial responsibility has degenerated into dodging the blame and passing the buck.
What a pity we have a Prime Minister in this country who cannot be trusted. What a pity we have a government in this country that cannot be trusted. Mr Howard said yesterday that this election will be about trust. I hope the election is about trust—because, if it is, I am sure the Liberal Party will not win a single seat. If this election is about trust, then Mr Howard would have no objection at all to a Senate inquiry into the Scrafton evidence. Mr Howard said that this election is about trust. What does he have to hide? Why did Senator Hill, in a very bizarre performance, rave as he did in question time today and refuse to answer reasonable questions, important questions, about the Prime Minister's role in the Scrafton affair? 
If the Australian people are to have any trust in their government, they have to know exactly what went on in this sorry chapter of Australian politics of children overboard. If Mr Howard believes in trust and wants trust in government, he would be happy to face the scrutiny of parliament. But calling the election to pre-empt the parliamentary sitting does not look like a man who is willing to face the music. Mr Howard said that a Senate committee would find him guilty. That is not the case. A Senate committee would only ever find a person guilty if they were. What Senate committees ought to do is weigh the evidence, hear the facts. They want to get to the truth. Surely that is reasonable. 
—Senator Hill, don't you talk about the truth. We already have a lot of reasons not to trust Mr Howard and his government. You could not trust him when he guaranteed that there would be no $100,000 university degrees—now there are 16. You could not trust him when he said in 1996 that bulk-billing was a fundamental underpinning of Medicare. Bulk-billing has fallen from 80 per cent to 70 per cent under this government. You could not trust him when he said that there would never, ever be a GST. You could not trust him when he said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction—and so it goes on.
You cannot trust John Howard to take responsibility when things go wrong. He never faces the truth; he never takes the blame. It is always a staffer's fault or another minister's fault or a public servant's fault or an adviser's fault—it is the fault of anybody but Mr Howard himself. He always blame shifts. You cannot trust him to listen to advice, you cannot trust him to put the country's interests before his own, and you cannot trust him to be Prime Minister of Australia and front up and take responsibility for his own actions. You cannot trust Mr Howard to tell the truth. What a sorry situation that is in Australian politics.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2004-08-30,"—The issue of trust has arisen because Mr Scrafton has changed his mind. On 7 November 2001 Mr Scrafton and the Prime Minister had a conversation. Mr Scrafton was asked about that on 14 December 2001 by Jennifer Bryant. Ms Bryant said this about Mr Scrafton's evidence:
Mr Scrafton stated that he continued to be marginally involved in events around the incident until the week before the election and never had a sense that the original advice—
that is, that children had been thrown overboard—
was not correct.
Again, Mr Scrafton `never had a sense that the original advice was not correct'. That is exactly the approach Mr Howard adopted in the House of Representatives on 19 February 2002. So what we have got is Mr Scrafton changing his mind. When he was interviewed a few weeks after his conversation with the Prime Minister, he reported the conversation to Ms Bryant exactly as I have just dictated. But then, three years later, Mr Scrafton decided to change his mind. I do not know why he did, but he did. That is the state of the evidence.
It is funny, you know. Politicians do sometimes have different recollections from those of senior public servants. Who recalls Mr Latham trying to justify that pathetic decision to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq by Christmas? All of a sudden he said, `I've had detailed briefings with all these intelligence organisations.' Remember that? Then, all of a sudden, he could not find anyone who had had those conversations with him, because he had a different recollection. Poor old Mr Bonighton was hammered and hammered and hammered by the Labor Party, and finally—in a very embarrassing fiasco—Mr Latham had to say, `I thought there was sufficient evidence to justify troop withdrawal.' It was pathetic.
Senator Faulkner talks about trust. Who here trusts the Labor Party to keep interest rates down so Australians can afford to buy their homes? Does anyone in Australia trust the Labor Party to create jobs? No-one does. Does anyone trust the Labor Party to keep inflation under control so the money Australians earn is actually worth something? No-one trusts the Australian Labor Party to do that. Does anyone trust the Australian Labor Party to keep control over government debt? No, no-one does. Does anyone trust the Labor Party to keep real wages up? No, because under the last Labor government real wages dropped. Under the Labor Party, who says it actually stands for the Australian worker, real wages dropped. Does anyone trust Mr Crean to balance the budget? No. Does anyone trust Mr Martin Ferguson to keep the unions in line? No. Does anyone trust Mr Garrett to tell farmers about how they should look after their farms? No-one does. But do you know what? I think the Australian people do trust the Labor Party on the reintroduction of the federal payroll tax. 
—Yes, we trust them there.
—We trust the Labor Party to do its bit on reintroducing a Commonwealth payroll tax—for the first time since 1971. That is what the Labor Party is going to do. I think we can also trust it to take away the private health rebate. It will do that as well; we can probably trust it to do that.
If we do not want to talk about trust, then I want to talk about character for a second. If the Labor Party wants to talk about character, then I want to talk about Mr Latham's record of civility, Mr Latham's record of inciting hatred. I say bring the debate on. If the Labor Party wants to introduce character and trust as the main themes in this election campaign, bring the matter on. Bring the election on and let the Australian people decide.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-08-30,"—Yesterday we saw John Howard stand up and ask Australians to trust his 10-year vision. But he did not have the good grace to say the one simple thing that they needed to believe about the 10-year vision: `Trust me, Australia; I'm staying for three years. Trust me, Australia; Peter Costello won't be Prime Minister in 18 months time.' That is all he had to say because he knows as well as every Australian that they do not trust him to stay the full three years. `Trust me, I'm staying three years. Trust me, you will not be voting for me and getting Peter Costello.' That is all he had to say yesterday. The Prime Minister had to call a press conference today and make Peter Costello stand next to him to try and get around this fib they are telling. This morning Peter Costello would not rule out a challenge to the Prime Minister. Why? Because the Prime Minister would not stand up and say: `Trust me, I'll be here in three years' time.' It is quite amazing: he would not commit to the full three years. Why should Australians trust him to tell the truth? He wanted to talk about trust, but yesterday he did not want to talk about the truth. And the truth is that he will not be staying three years. Australians cannot trust him to stay three years.
We have a government that prides itself on its capacity to mislead Australians and get away with it. Its favourite line is, `No-one told me.' The Senate inquiry into `kids overboard' established that 32 public servants knew the truth about `kids overboard' and that Minister Reith knew the truth about `kids overboard', but the government persisted to the bitter end in trying to convince Australians that kids were thrown overboard. The American government pointed the finger directly at the heart of the election issue in this country. They would not allow the key Australian official in Abu Ghraib, the prison in Iraq, to testify. They would not allow him to go before their inquiries. They would not allow him to speak to them. They only wanted him to give them written answers—written answers that arrived, unfortunately, too late to be of any use in the inquiry. 
Trust is a key issue here. This Prime Minister is like one of the characters in Hogan's Heroes. You may ask which one, or you may immediately assume when we are talking about the Prime Minister that we are talking about Colonel Klink. No, it is not Colonel Klink. You may assume it is Corporal Newkirk. No, it is not Corporal Newkirk. You may think is General Burkhalter. No—absolutely not. It is actually Sergeant Schultz—`I know nothing.' `I know nothing' is his favourite statement. `Nobody told me. I know nothing.' The Prime Minister did not know about Abu Ghraib. He did not know about `kids overboard'. He does not know the GST is a federal tax. Each year this government produces a budget that is qualified by the Auditor-General. Why? It is because this government chooses to pretend to Australians that the GST is a state tax. I spoke for about five hours on the GST in this very chamber, because the GST is a federal tax. It passed though the federal parliament. Yet this government brings down a budget every year qualified by the Australian Auditor-General because it chooses to pretend that the GST is a state tax and not a Commonwealth tax.
John Howard promised there would never, ever be a GST. There would be no new taxes, the government promised us. Then we got the superannuation surcharge. They said, `It's a surcharge; it's not really a tax.' That was their line six or seven years ago. Before the last election we had no $100,000 university fees—16 of them now exist in this country, and the government are responsible for it. The government knew nothing about the secret training of waterfront crews by Patrick's a couple of years ago, even though the people who were involved in organising it said that the government had encouraged them, that they had had regular meetings with Peter Reith and his team. It was no surprise to find that Peter Reith—one of the Prime Minister's favourite ministers—was involved. This Prime Minister hates Medicare. He has said so consistently for 20 years. He wants to see an end to Medicare.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-08-30,"—The opposition, in raising the question of trust in Australian political life, has somewhat misunderstood what is happening at the moment. It does not understand that during an election campaign it is not just truth in government that Australians expect. During an election campaign Australians expect truth in opposition as well. Australians expect to see the opposition, as an alternative government—it retains that title at whatever stage it is in an election campaign—present to the Australian people its vision, its policies and its fiscal plan before they go to an election and make a decision about whether to retain or reject the sitting government. Therefore, we not just need to talk today about what the government has said, and what its record is, on the question of truth in government but also need to know what the opposition will do if it is chosen on 9 October to be the next government of Australia.
There has not been truth, there has not been honesty, on the part of this opposition with respect to the Australian community. To be truly honest, to be truly trustworthy, this opposition—this Labor Party alternative government—should spell out in detail what its plans are for the Australian community and how it will pay for those plans. It has failed to do so. That is the test of political honesty, or dishonesty, on which the Australian community will judge the opposition come 9 October. Where is the honesty in the opposition not telling people how it intends to pay for its promises? Where is the truth in the opposition not explaining how it is going to tax people and pay for its plans well before the people have a chance to vote on those plans? 
In my political memory, the greatest exposition of political honesty, of political trustworthiness, in this country happened in 1998, when Prime Minister John Howard put on the table a comprehensive plan for a new tax system. The new taxation program taxed most of the goods and services that Australians consume at the rate of 10 per cent. He said, `Here is my plan to put a new tax on Australians, and I now ask you whether you will approve of that plan by re-electing my government'—which, of course, the Australian people did. In my political experience that was the most breathtaking example of truth in government, of political honesty, that I have ever seen. That was the same Prime Minister who, today, those in opposition attempt to impugn.
Contrast that approach—of being trustworthy, of being truthful—with the approach of the Labor Party in 1987, which went to the Australian people saying: `Yes, we believe in free education. Don't worry. Under us, a free education at tertiary level is still guaranteed.' Australian students and their families discovered just a year or so later that the Labor government was going to impose a charge for the right to obtain a university education.
We know that the Labor Party have made many promises in this campaign, and we can trust them to do a number of things to pay for those promises. We know they will reduce the diesel fuel rebate by $467 million. We know they will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate and take away protection for Australians negotiating better wage outcomes. We know they will abolish extra industrial relations commissioners. We know they will abolish Invest Australia, which attracts people and investment into this country to support the retention and growth of the Australian economy. We know they will scrap the National Office for the Information Economy and the Australian Government Information Management Office. We know all those things but we do not know where the unspecified $852 million, and counting, in savings will come from. Until Labor spell out that and explain what jobs will be lost, particularly in the Australian Public Service, as a result of those decisions that have not yet been shared with the Australian community, they have no right to come into this place and raise the question of truth in government.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-08-30,"—In this debate to take note of answers to questions asked of Senator Hill today, I think it is important to focus on the question of trust because the minister in answering questions today was very keen to move on and to say that the Australian public are not interested in these issues. I disagree: I think people are interested in these issues. They are interested in the question of whether the Prime Minister lied to them and I think they regard that as fundamentally important, and I share that view.
What has happened is that Mike Scrafton, a former senior Defence official, has effectively exposed the Prime Minister as having lied to the Australian public. His evidence has bought this issue to the head of Australian public life. Mike Scrafton has made it clear that John Howard, the Prime Minister, knew that no children had been thrown overboard and that the Prime Minister had continued to misrepresent that position to the Australian public. The question of the truthfulness of the Prime Minister is central to the political and public debate in this country. What Mike Scrafton did in clearing his conscience, if you like, is tell the truth and to make it clear that, in his view, the Prime Minister knew. The PM was a bit unsettled by all that. He has looked a bit off balance for the last few months but he was very unsettled by those comments. He responded to them, knowing that it was biting in the Australian public, despite what the minister has said, and that there was concern in the Australian community. The Australian public do not like being lied to, they were unsettled and concerned by the suggestion that the PM had lied to them and their doubts were confirmed, if you like, by Mike Scrafton's evidence. 
What did the PM do? He sent a couple of people around without any public announcement to see a couple of the Defence Force people who had done the report into the `children overboard' affair to see what they had to say. It was the first time that the Prime Minister had genuinely sought answers to key questions in this area, but again he got the answers he did not want, the answers that he had been keen to conceal for three years. When Major General Powell and Commander Michael Noonan were interviewed, they backed Mike Scrafton. They said that yes he had told the Prime Minister. They supported his version of events. So suddenly the Prime Minister is sitting in his office confronted with the fact that he had gone out and sought the information for the first time, while being off balance and unsettled, he had gone to the Defence Force major general and the commander and asked their views, and they backed Mr Scrafton. They said that the Prime Minister was told and that he did know that what he was telling the Australian public was not true.
So then the Prime Minister had this problem: he had the information that destroyed his case, but what to do with it. So the next day he raced around and got four of his staff to sign documents saying that they backed his version of events, that he had told them that he had not been told. They were not directly involved of course but they backed their boss. Funny that: they backed their boss. Then he had to get it all out because he knew that this was like a cancer eating at the core of the government. If this came out during the election campaign he knew he would be dead in the water so he released it and set about the campaign of denigrating Mr Scrafton. What we have seen again is that the truth will out: when the Defence officials were asked the proper questions they backed Mike Scrafton. This is Mr Scrafton who worked for the Liberal government. This is not some Labor hack; this is a person who was employed by the Liberal Party in a ministerial office who came out and told his story. When the Australian Defence Force personnel were asked their version, were finally asked to tell their side of the story, they backed Mr Scrafton not the Prime Minister. The general and the commander both backed Mr Scrafton. They have no political interest in this, but they were prepared to tell the truth.
It reminds me of Air Marshal Houston: when he was finally asked during the Senate committee process whether children had been thrown overboard, Air Marshal Houston was honest. That destroyed the government's case then. This is a government determined to hide the truth, to continue with the big lies, to prevent the evidence about `children overboard', about Abu Ghraib and about Iraqi intelligence coming out. This is a government that has misused the Defence Force terribly over the last few years for their political ends and refused to allow them to act in a professional and impartial manner. They have used them to their political advantage and caused a great deal of distress inside Defence at the way they have been politicised. Ever since former Minister Reith, but continued under this minister, Defence has felt politicised and used. But when asked the right questions, when allowed to tell the truth, they have always honestly and openly told the truth, and that has destroyed the government's case. It has destroyed John Howard's case and proven that he lied to the Australian public. This will out: the Prime Minister is now exposed. Just like the 43 senior diplomats and former Defence officials, people want truth in government. 
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! Senator Evans, during your contribution you indicated that the Prime Minister had lied. I ask you to withdraw that comment.
—Yes, I did indicate that, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I am happy to take your formal advice about how one rephrases that.
—Don't rephrase it; just withdraw it.
—Senator Ferguson, I do not require your assistance in this matter.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-30,"—In debating the motion to take note of answers, or non-answers, to questions asked in question time today, we have in many respects an encapsulation of what we will get in the election campaign from both Labor and Liberal: lots of accusations backwards and forwards, and both parties avoiding the real issues that actually affect the Australian people. We have seen already in the first 24 hours of the election campaign, including question time today, Mr Latham saying that the Prime Minister has lied and deceived and been dishonest. We had Mr Howard this morning saying that Mr Latham has lied. The Democrats believe that neither Labor nor Liberal can be trusted, and certainly not trusted and given the absolute power that rests in the hands of a Prime Minister without the protection of an independent Senate to control and prevent that abuse of power.
It has already come down to accusation versus accusation. I do not know if people remember the old cartoon Spy v. Spy. It is a bit of a liar versus liar campaign already. When Mr Howard starts talking about the `l' word, we know he is not talking about the `l' word that he is trying to ban from Playschool; he is talking about the accusations against Mr Latham and of course the accusations coming back at the Prime Minister. We need to do better than a liar versus liar campaign. We need to do better than a liar versus liar form of political debate and mechanism for determining decision making in government in this country. That is why having an independent Senate that can examine the truth is so important and why the role of the two larger parties, such as in the Senate in question time today, really exposed what a lack of any substance to debate we get from them on the issues that affect people. We had a simple question today—it could not get more simple—to the Minister representing the Treasurer here: do you still believe the Senate should have the power to block supply?
—It was an out of order question.
—It was not out of order and it was not ruled out of order to ask: does the representative of the Treasurer believe that it is economically responsible for the Senate to block supply? This government is already going on about how it is economically responsible. The Democrats agree that being economically responsible is important. That is why we have taken that approach in the Senate on a whole range of economic legislation. We agree that you need to get those foundations of prosperity and those foundations of a solid economy in place to more effectively address other issues of importance like more protection of the environment and assisting people in need with social services and all the other aspects of society. We can make the economy work better—we can certainly make it work fairer—but we do need to be economically responsible.  
How laughable is it for them to emphasise economic responsibility but then refuse to rule out the simple action of blocking supply? Nothing could be more economically irresponsible and disruptive to this economy than preventing the passage of legislation that allows the ordinary annual services of government to occur, yet this Liberal Party would not rule it out. We all know—and it is quite clear—there is a possibility, even if the Labor Party moves into government, that the coalition could well have a blocking majority—38 out of 76 seats. They on their own could block anything passing. Certainly, as has been demonstrated by vote in this Senate, the Greens quite openly say they also believe the Senate should retain the power to block supply. The Democrats disagree with them on that, as do the Labor Party. 
There is clearly a prospect of Labor being in government but a majority in the Senate being willing to block supply. You do not get much more economically irresponsible than that from a government that likes to preach it, yet here it is slithering all around the place, dodging straightforward, black-and-white simple questions. It is no wonder people cannot trust the Prime Minister when he talks about economic responsibility and it is no wonder they are not confident that they can trust Mr Latham to perform responsibly, to tell the truth and to not backtrack on core promises, because we have already seen that even in the short time he has been opposition leader. That is why you need a strong Senate, independent of whoever is in government. I urge everyone listening to remember that they have two decisions to make on polling day—not just whom they put in the Lodge but whom they put in the Senate to watch over them. The stronger the Senate is, the more freedoms are protected and the more responsible our system of government will be.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2004-08-30,"—I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for 13 sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004 made under subsection 115(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee's correspondence concerning this instrument.
Leave granted.

Dear Minister
I refer to Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004, made under subsection 115(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The Committee notes two matters of concern with this notice. 
First, the list in Schedule 1 (which applies until 31 December 2005) does not refer to the 2004 Olympic Games. The Committee notes that future Olympic Games do appear in the second list in Schedule 2. Secondly, the Explanatory Statement indicates that the list in Schedule 2 (which applies from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010) removes Australian Football League State of Origin matches from the anti-siphoning list. In fact, these matches are included in the list. The item which appears to have been removed from the list of Rugby League Football events is “Any other match involving the senior Australian representative team selected by the Australian Rugby League, whether played in Australia or overseas”. 
The Committee would appreciate your advice on these issues as soon as possible, but before 6 August 2004, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Tchen
Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No 1) 2004
Thank you for your letter of 17 June 2004 to the previous Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP, concerning the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004 (the Notice).
As you are aware, the previous Minister made the Notice on 11 May 2004 under section 115(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The Notice revokes and re-makes the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice No. 1 of 1994. The new instrument continues to prevent pay TV licensees from acquiring a right to a listed event until it has first been acquired by a commercial free-to-air broadcaster reaching more than 50 per cent of the Australian population, by a national broadcaster, or the right has not been purchased by a free-to-air broadcaster and is de-listed.
The new instrument separates protected events into two separate anti-siphoning lists. Schedule 1 re-makes and clarifies the original anti-siphoning instrument and therefore protects sporting events taking place up to 31 December 2005. Schedule 2 protects a revised list of events which will take place between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.
The Explanatory Statement for the new instrument notes that “in substance, the events listed in Schedule 1 are the same as the events listed in the previous anti-siphoning list. The previous list has been updated to include correct names for certain sporting bodies and competitions, and to remove out-of-date references.”
As part of the reforms to the anti-siphoning list announced on 7 April 2004, the Government decided to include on the anti-siphoning list the Olympic and Commonwealth Games to ensure that these important events continue to be available to viewers on free-to-air television. The Committee has noted that the list at Schedule 1 does not include the 2004 Olympic Games. This event has not been added to Schedule 1 because, as noted above, no events that take place before 31 December 2005 have been added to the original list which is now replicated in Schedule 1. In addition, as the rights to the 2004 Olympic Games have already been acquired by a free-to-air broadcaster, there would be no practical purpose served by their addition to Schedule 1.
The Committee has also noted that the Explanatory Statement for the new anti-siphoning instrument indicates that Schedule 2 of the list does not include Australian Football League (AFL) State of Origin matches, whereas you suggest that these matches are in fact included on the list.
In fact AFL State of Origin matches are only included in Schedule 1 (at sub-item 2.2 of that Schedule) because they were included in the original instrument. Item 4 of Schedule 2, which relates to Australian Rules Football, does not mention AFL State of Origin matches. Events of this kind that take place before 31 December 2005 are therefore protected by the anti-siphoning scheme, while events that take place after that point are not. (I note that AFL State of Origin matches have not taken place for a number of years.) 
You also note that an item relating to Rugby League matches that appears in the list at Schedule 1 does not appear in the list at Schedule 2, ie “Any other match involving the senior Australian representative team selected by the Australian Rugby League, whether played in Australia or overseas”, (sub-item 3.4). The Explanatory Statement fails to note that these Rugby League matches have not been included on the list at Schedule 2 of the new instrument. While this is an oversight in the Explanatory Statement, the non-inclusion of this item is a direct decision by the Government which is unrelated to the issue of AFL State of Origin matches.
I hope that this information is of assistance.
Yours sincerely

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-08-30,"—I need to conclude my remarks in relation to the government's position on the Democrat amendment as I was outlining previously the government's rationale for not agreeing to the Democrat amendment. I had reached the part of my remarks where I stated that, in order for a prosecution to succeed, the offender must be aware of a substantial risk that their conduct would be considered by a reasonable person as either menacing, harassing or offensive and that, knowing this to be the case, they unjustifiably continued with their conduct. 
As I stated earlier, any consideration by the arbiter of fact, which is usually a jury, of what the reasonable person would think, given all the circumstances in which the conduct occurred, would include some consideration of issues such as whom a particular communication was targeted at and whether it could be accessed by just one person or many. This, nonetheless, does not justify the argument for making a prosecution of the proposed offence entirely dependent on whether a particular individual—thick-skinned or the complete opposite—feels menaced, harassed or offended by the offending conduct. The question of a reasonable person using that as a yardstick is, as I say, nothing unusual in the law. We believe that to depart from that would be to depart from principles behind the offences in the Criminal Code.

I signalled during that time that the opposition have carefully examined this amendment, have weighed a number of factors and have not found we are able to support it. We think the period where the subjective standard applied—the status quo which I understand the Democrats seek to maintain—was when the Internet was a little younger than it is now, and a wider community understanding of the dangers that might be associated with the Internet now exists. Paraphrasing what I said during my second reading debate speech, on the basis that a criminal standard of proof still applies and that it brings it in line with all other media content, it is something that we should move to rather than maintain the status quo. Therefore we will not be supporting the Democrat amendment which, in fact, does maintain the status quo.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-30,"—I move Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 4386:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 30 (lines 15 to 17), omit “that has been approved by the Minister in writing for the purposes of this section”.
The amendment relates to the public benefit defence that applies with respect to child pornography offences and in particular the part of that defence which relates to genuine research. As I said in my second reading contribution, we Democrats acknowledge that this has been a difficult issue for the Attorney-General's office and we do understand that the government's intention in requiring ministerial approval of research is to prevent an abuse of this defence and a plethora of people suddenly claiming that they are conducting research into child pornography.
However, we Democrats do maintain our real concern that independent research should never be subject to ministerial vetting. We are concerned that the minister, whoever they may be now or in future, may have a tendency to approve research conducted by some organisations but might be reluctant to do so if it is conducted by other organisations. The bill contains no specific criteria that the minister is to take into account in determining whether or not to approve proposed research other than, presumably, whether or not that research will be of public benefit. The Democrats consider it is much more appropriate for a court to determine whether research is genuine and of public benefit than to leave that decision to a minister, which perhaps brings with it the tainting of political influence and interference. The amendment goes to the heart of that and removes the requirement for research to be approved by the minister. Rather, it places it in the hands of courts, where we feel it is better located.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-08-30,"—The government opposes this amendment. We believe that it seeks to remove an important safeguard. We believe that if you did not have this you could have the general public benefit defence available, but that would be uncertain and of benefit to no-one. It would certainly be open to abuse. Again, it would depend on the courts as to how they interpreted that. The proposed defence for approved research would remove that uncertainty which researchers may have concerning their ability to lawfully access certain material. For those who might think that it would be impossible to have a lawful or sound reason for accessing this sort of material, certainly law enforcement and criminologists and the like might well need to access material in order not only to gain intelligence but to do research on the issue. That is why we have this provision which allows for the minister to approve scientific, medical or educational research. 
By having ministerial control over it we believe that it does bring certainty. The minister is accountable and can be questioned in the parliament. This is something which would have to be exercised very carefully by any minister. But to leave it open and to say that you can have the public benefit defence could, we believe, really leave the position unclear and be of no benefit to anyone, and the interpretation of the courts for that might vary over time. Leaving it to someone who is subject to public scrutiny, the scrutiny of parliament, we believe is more appropriate. I would envisage that it would be a discretion which would be exercised in circumstances which would be in accordance with what we are spelling out here. It could only be allowed for the purposes of scientific, educational or medical research and you could have psychologists or psychiatrists who might need to access this for legitimate reasons. I say again that we do not want to see this sort of material see the light of day. But there are situations—I know from my own experience practising in the law—where in studying criminal behaviour you do need to have that necessary research in relation to deviant behaviour. This could well assist in that research, but only in strictly limited situations, as we have spelled out. For that reason we believe that this provides a check, and not to have that check would be bad public policy.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech

It was a matter that was examined in detail during the relatively short Senate inquiry. The Attorney-General's Department gave evidence, you might recall, about the drafting of this aspect of the bill because it similarly demonstrated to us that there might be a potential for a problem to exist. If you looked at drafting this aspect of the bill to craft a general defence related to research into paedophilia and child abuse, the difficulty would be that you could end up having it misused as a general defence, which would really run counter to the whole idea of what the bill aimed to do because it would provide the ability for a defence based on more general grounds to be used.
The short answer then was that the Attorney-General's Department gave evidence that it was an issue that also came up during the exposure draft. They had consulted with the Australian Institute of Criminology on the prevalence of genuine research of this kind because, firstly, it begs the question whether there is genuine research into this area. It was determined that a mechanism involving approval of the minister was workable in those rare cases where it is demonstrated that genuine research is being sought to be done in this area. Just saying it is usually workable is not always enough, at least from our perspective. But the department also drew the committee's attention to comparable approval processes in other legislation for research into prohibited drugs. Although not comparable in a sense it is still a prohibited substance that you would want tight or at least very restrictive controls on regarding the sort of research done. On that basis the explanation by the Attorney-General's Department was sufficient to satisfy the opposition that the approval mechanism is not inappropriate in this circumstance for this limited purpose. Therefore we will not be supporting the Democrat amendment. We think the alternative would leave it too open to abuse. 
Question negatived.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-08-30,"—The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004 implements two key 2004 budget measures in the Family and Community Services portfolio. Schedule 1 amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt the fee waived and fee paying scholarships for the income test for income support payments. Schedule 2 amends the Social Security Act 1991 to expand the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance by allowing a new group of carers to qualify for carer allowance if they provide certain care for an adult with a disability even if they do not live with that adult. Labor will support this bill as it is largely beneficial in nature. However, I would encourage carers and students to be wary of this government should it be re-elected. It always has an agenda to find some way to claw back the benefits.
This is certainly the case with the carers measure in this bill. Carers need only to look at the debacle last year where the Howard government set out to remove 35,000 families from carer allowance—a disgraceful act. And earlier this year, before the budget, Labor obtained leaked budget cuts to carers outlined in a 62-page cabinet-in-confidence letter from the minister to the Prime Minister. Page 7 of the letter said:
The proposals in the package are linked and most require changes to legislation. The fourth proposal is a savings proposal which would reduce the period for backdating payment of carer allowance to 12 weeks for both adults and children from the current 26 weeks for adults and 52 weeks for children and would substantially offset over four years the cost of the additional assistance proposal.
It is clear that the minister had a plan to pay for the measure we are debating today by cutting payments to those who apply for carer allowance in the future. This cold-hearted measure proposed cutting $30 million from the carer allowance by restricting backdating provisions. Families waiting for the diagnosis of serious conditions would no longer be allowed to backdate claims to when loved ones first fell ill. Despite the minister's efforts to disown her own measure we can only conclude that it is still sitting in the bottom drawer should the coalition be returned for another term. The simple fact of the matter is that you cannot trust this government. Before the last election John Howard promised not to cut anyone's social security benefits, but then after the election we saw the proposal to cut $70 a fortnight from disability pensioners and the cuts to 35,000 carer allowance recipients. These were cuts to social security benefits that the Prime Minister had promised us we would not see.
The small carer allowance initiative in this bill is an initiative well overdue. The Social Security Act currently requires a carer to live with the person for whom they are providing care to qualify for the carer allowance. This co-residency requirement departed from the practice under the former domiciliary nursing care benefit, which the carer allowance replaced from July 1999 under this government. The old benefit allowed some discretion for the payment in situations where there was no co-residence. So this measure rectifies that problem. The measure today includes a new requirement that care must be provided for at least 20 hours per week. There has been some concern about the operation of this measure and the requirement for at least 20 hours of care. Labor do have concerns about this new test, but are more or less satisfied with the government's explanation of how it will be administered and that it will be essentially the current eligibility for co-resident carers. Labor will monitor the operation of the 20-hour test and, if it is found to be deficient, we will pursue measures to ensure that it operates more fairly. This matter goes to one of the Democrat amendments. Whilst Labor share similar concerns, we are not inclined to support the amendment today as it will hold up the implementation of the measures in this bill. If the House were sitting and the bill could be dealt with in that place subsequent to the amendment it might be a different story but, for now, it is important that the bill pass the Senate. 
The other measure in this bill deals with student scholarships. Currently they are required to be taken into account as income unless specifically exempted from the income test for income support payments. As announced in the 2004 budget all fee waived and fee paying scholarships will no longer be included as income under the social security test for income support payments under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The exemptions will apply to scholarships offered in the secondary, vocational education and training and higher education sectors. The government has estimated that the exemption will benefit approximately 1,550 students at the present time, increasing to 2,220 students. This, of course, is a drop in the ocean when it comes to the burden presently placed on students. This government has ratcheted up HECS fees to unbearable levels. Students are now leaving their education with debts that put them behind the eight ball when it comes to buying a home and starting a family.
We also have the full fee-paying places—the $100,000 degrees that the Prime Minister promised us would not occur but which we now find have occurred. In the last 12 months we have also seen the government axe the financial supplement loan scheme, which, whilst not perfect, provided much needed help to students struggling to afford their education, particularly disabled students. The measures today are pretty meagre compared to this government's record in heaping financial burdens on students.
This brings me to the other Democrat amendment today, which seeks to broaden the scholarship exemption to those that provide direct financial assistance. Labor is not disposed to agree to this amendment, as it will treat income received from scholarships differently from income received from employment. Labor does not support treating income earned by students less favourably than that of those receiving a university scholarship. The amendment would result in students who sacrifice study time to work three or four nights a week receiving less youth allowance than students who receive the same money from cash scholarships. This is not a fair approach to address the financial pressures on students. Labor believes that a fair approach is to strengthen Commonwealth income support and to take off the long-term pressure in relation to HECS fees. Labor has already outlined reducing the age of independence for youth allowance and extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients, two desperately overdue policies which would have significant impact. There is more to be done, and it will take some time, but quick fixes that will treat students of similar means differently, whether they are receiving a scholarship or working, is not the fair approach. 
To sum up, I would urge carers and students to be very sceptical about this government and these measures. The government promises one thing before an election only to claw it back afterwards. Labor will be supporting this bill today, but carers and students can be assured that the measures will be clawed back if the coalition is re-elected.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-30,"—I also rise to speak to the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004. The bill makes two unrelated changes to family and community services legislation, as announced in the recent budget. It extends the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by removing the requirement that the carer live with the person for whom they are providing care. Carers provide by far the major proportion of both health and community care for people with special needs. Most do so willingly, as members of the family or friends, for love or duty at substantial sacrifice to their own lives. Governments do have an obligation to recognise the care that a carer is providing, to listen to the views of the carer in deciding what their requirements are and not to take the carer's contribution for granted.
It is a fact that carers do not always live with the person for whom they provide care. Indeed, for many people requiring care, their ability to live in their own home represents a degree of independence they do not want compromised. However, it does not diminish the amount of care required. This change recognises the rights of people with disabilities to preserve their independence and, hopefully, stay out of residential care for longer. It has been a long time coming, and the Democrats have called for it for many years. It is again typical of the government's abuse of the Senate process that they should seek to hurriedly deal with this bill, less than three weeks prior to its implementation. We do not want to hold up the beneficial elements for carers, but it does not offer sufficient time for full consideration or even amendment to further improve the lot of carers.
The changes in this bill are not overly complex and could easily have been introduced in the last sitting. Ironically, it was only about eight weeks ago that the government decided to overlook the needs of elderly carers by similarly rushing through the carer bonus legislation, effectively failing to ensure that many carers would receive the full carer bonus. For too long now, carers of elderly Australians or those with disabilities have been often overlooked. Carers are known as the silent army. There are some 2.5 million carers in Australia, and governments do have an obligation to try and meet their unique needs. We Democrats know that it is no exaggeration to say that carers are the backbone of our whole community care system—we simply could not manage without the vital and voluntary care they give.
There was, however, a glaring and extraordinary oversight in the payment of the $1,000 up-front bonus to carers that was quickly pushed through by the government in May this year. This is because there are many carers who have a primary entitlement to another social security income support—such as the age pension or the disability support pension—or who are parenting payment singles, who are providing the same level of care as any other person on carer payment. Because the carer payment is paid at the same rate and has the same income test, there has been no advantage to them in swapping to the carer payment, and Centrelink have advised people of that. To make it even worse, social security income support recipients who were on carer payments were automatically transferred over to the age pension when they reached the age of 65. Because the bonus of $1,000 is only paid to people on carer payments, not other pensions, notwithstanding that they may be providing equal amounts of care, many carers have missed out. 
The Australia Democrats did warn the government that they had created an anomaly in that the many carers who receive income support payments other than the carer payment from Centrelink will miss out on the $1,000 bonus. They may have identical caring responsibilities but, because Centrelink moved them from carer payment to the age pension, they have a child and therefore receive parenting payment or they have a disability and receive a disability support pension, they will not receive the $1,000 bonus. The carers who miss out on the bonus of $1,000 are the ones who we would argue can least afford not to receive it. We Democrats attempted to redress the situation by amending the one-off payment bill. However, disappointingly, we were not supported on that by either the government or the opposition. However, the minister cannot hide behind the legislation to avoid responsibility for denying carers the full bonus.
We would have liked to use this legislation before us today to again make our amendments but, given that the government has decided to bring it on in this way, and given the way in which it announced its implementation, we certainly do not want to delay any assistance for carers. Provision exists for the minister to make special payments. Again, we call on the minister to use these provisions to pay the full $1,000 bonus to carers who were not on carer payments at the time. They will not be double-dipping and will not receive two payments, but they will rightly qualify for the bonus. Recognition for carers, and the government's responsibility towards them, does not end with the extension of eligibility criteria for carer allowance or indeed the payment of a bonus. For many carers the lack of respite care available to them means they will struggle to find the time to spend it. Carer allowance of $90 a fortnight is fairly paltry in terms of the dedication of carers. We call on the government to address the ongoing social, economic, health, education and employment problems and needs experienced by carers.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-08-30,"—The subject of the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004 has already been addressed by my colleague Senator Collins, and so Labor's position needs no repetition. It is largely a technical bill, implementing two minor budget measures. It is opportune, however, in the dying days of this parliament to record the appalling record of the Howard government in respect of veterans affairs—the subject matter of this bill. In coming months, we will be engaged on the hustings with veterans' issues, which will be important to a large number of people. It is important to note, though, that for veterans this is no ordinary election. Many veterans are very angry indeed at the way they have been so contemptuously treated. That is the prime motive for the formation of the Ex-service, Service and Veterans Party.
In my political memory I cannot recall circumstances where the veterans community have been so prompted to organise politically to take this step to form their own political organisation. It is unprecedented. It is even more dramatic when it is considered that this is generally thought to be an area of government removed from the political ruck or contest. It is generally accepted that veterans affairs are non-political, and certainly that has been our approach in the Australian Labor Party. It is also instructive to note that the new Ex-service, Service and Veterans Party has chosen as its first target the minister's seat of Hughes in New South Wales. Next it has chosen every government marginal seat in which to field a candidate. This is therefore deliberately focused on the Howard government. This is, I think it fair to say, a voice of protest. It is a protest organised in recognition of the fact that in every electorate around Australia there are at least 2,000 veterans. Add to that ex-service people, their own families and their extended families and this is indeed a sizeable constituency. 
The intent of the ESVP may be dressed up as an attack on the whole political process, but the facts are otherwise. This is a direct reaction to the policies and attitudes of the Howard government. Let us look at the reasons for this. On the surface it is very simple: veterans and war widows believe they have been treated with contempt by the Howard government. This is remarkable given that the ex-service community is generally conservative by nature and has been more likely than other communities to support a conservative government. I think it is fair to say that that is no longer true. Perhaps the Howard government is just too conservative. Perhaps it is because dishonesty and deceit are not conservative values. I suggest, though, that it is more to do with being perceived as a little bit disingenuous—a little bit mean and tricky—and that is certainly the Howard government's record in veterans affairs.
Veterans and war widows believe that they have been duped. Their hopes and aspirations for a better deal have been held out like a carrot since the last election. The last time around the Howard government promised a total review of all of the issues on which veterans have been writing and lobbying for many decades. That promise was honoured: a review by Justice Clarke was commissioned. Three thousand veterans and war widows made submissions to that lengthy inquiry. Public hearings were held all over the country as Justice Clarke and his colleagues addressed the very wide terms of reference. The report was released in February 2002 and then the real stalling began. The Clarke review was portrayed as a democratic hearing of everybody's concerns, but of course it turned out to be nothing of the kind. As the months dragged by it became clear that there was never the slightest intention to deal with veterans' concerns.
In fact, 14 months passed and it became obvious that any government response would be kept until the eve of the next scheduled election. But when it did come it was rejected out of hand by the government's own backbench. Their expectations had been built up as well. After all, their excuse for the government's total inactivity was that the Clarke report would answer everybody's prayers. It was too late, though. Most veterans were disappointed and many remain disappointed. Given that the majority of submissions to the Clarke review were about extending gold card eligibility, this, of course, was inevitable.
The other key theme concerning the restructuring of the TPI special rate was dismissed by the veterans community and hence by the government as well. That left very little, and now Clarke has been consigned to history. Veterans know they were conned. The government could have made any of the decisions it made at any time in the previous seven years—in the time since it was first elected to office in 1996. That probably does sum up the Howard government's record in this area. Yet we can expect that in the coming campaign the government will run on its record. But the only record it keeps is the number of dollars spent. Again, though, veterans should not be duped. Let me say this plainly: most of the increase in veterans funding has come from indexation of pensions and through the massive growth in health costs. Health cost increases, driven by increasing demands of age and through rapidly increasing health care costs in general, are currently running at around 15 per cent per year. In fact, it is now clear that the financial choke is being applied. The cuts most noticeable are to the Homecare program and to allied health care services. 
Homecare this year has been cut by $4 million already. That is despite the program's justification, which is that the money is saved by keeping people at home, out of institutional care. That is humbug, and it will happen again because the Homecare budget is linked to the number of cardholders, which, in an ageing population, is falling. For allied health care, the calls and letters of complaint are rolling in, about cuts to hydrotherapy, aids and appliances and new provisions for transport. Can we forget the cruel attempt to limit amputees' access to artificial limbs? What help are those living in remote areas getting with respect to transport costs?
Then, of course, there is the saga of the gold card. Having inconvenienced thousands of veterans and widows in 2002-03 by failing to retain GPs accepting the gold card, the government chose to procrastinate for 12 months. The problem of accessing medical specialists remains. The solution was deferred until January of next year, just to save some money. That saving is at the cost of veterans and there is no guarantee that the higher fees will make the slightest bit of difference. In fact, I understand that in Tasmania there are almost no specialists who will accept the gold card, and they are unlikely to in the future. This is a serious and fundamental breach of our undertaking as a community to fully care for those who were injured as a result of their service. From the very first days of World War I, we as a nation have had an obligation to provide health care and compensation for those who suffered from war caused disability. We still do, but it is much harder. It is particularly hard where a veteran, especially in a rural area, finds that their long-term treating specialist will no longer see them. Specialists say they respect the veteran but that they should not be expected to subsidise the government by providing treatment at low cost or below cost. The bottom line is the same: veterans are not receiving the care they were promised.
Lo and behold, in more recent days the problem of GPs is back. It seems that their deal was not as good as the bulk-billing deal for Medicare, so they want more. Preferably, they want the $7.50 available under Medicare to GPs in rural Australia, but $5 would probably do. An AMA survey of GPs in Australia has revealed that 60 per cent of GPs believe that the gold card fee is not sustainable and henceforth they may well abandon the gold card again. We assume they will take the Medicare card only as it pays better. This is a problem of the Howard government's making. Once a status symbol recognising veterans' contributions, the gold card is now just another card in the wallet. Sadly, veterans and war widows are again being used as hostages to lever a better commercial outcome. This is an untenable set of circumstances; were it not for the political opportunism being displayed, veterans would be calling the government to account.
Moving on through this litany, comment must also be made on the cheap and shallow exploitation of veterans for the political promotion of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. These people have no shame when it comes to photo opportunities. Under the cover of new memorials, farewelling troops and welcoming them on their return, these people bask without shame in the reflected glory of veterans. Veterans are nothing but stage props for this massive public relations exercise. Veterans are sick of this tawdry, exploitative self-promotion. They will not be bought off with certificates and weasel words. This litany of mismanagement and neglect goes on. 
I also mention in this context the denial of the military compensation scheme practice of hiring large legal firms. At the cost of millions of dollars, these firms are employed to defeat the compensation claims of ex-service people struggling to get their compensation claims properly assessed. It is grossly unfair, but is typical of the combative attitude of the MCRS. Ex-service people deserve better than this, but the minister is impervious to any approaches. The minister prefers to blindly accept the advice of her department, which rarely—if ever—confesses to errors, yet is in the top 10 in the Commonwealth when it comes to defective administrative payouts.
There is the notorious case of Mrs Palmer in Brisbane who was falsely denied a war widow's pension year after year because of what can only be described as negligence. After the confession it still took over 12 months to settle the case. I have never come across a more deserving case or one so badly handled. Yet every week in my office, complaints are received of equally dismissive behaviour where the traditional focus of client service fails to penetrate the MCRS. Why is it that, so many years after the event, those now suffering severe health problems from their employment to deseal and reseal the tanks of F111s, so little has been done? I could go on.
There is of course some credit to be allocated. The Department of Veterans' Affairs in general has an outstanding record of service to veterans. The fault does not rest there entirely. It rests with its masters, the Howard government. The best example, as I have said, rests with the commissioning of the Clarke report. But then we had legislation to implement it. We have also had very complex legislation to introduce the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme. Throughout that legislative process we were caught between additional benefits and poor policy. Inevitably, poor policy prevailed. The prime instance of this is the payment of the Defence Force income support allowance for those ex-service people receiving benefits from Centrelink. Our criticism of this disaster is already in Hansard. I will not repeat it except to say that it entails the complete waste of $18 million being paid to DVA and Centrelink to administer the allowance. This was totally unnecessary as the effects of the policy could have been achieved with a one-line amendment to the Social Security Act. Once again, this was money wasted which could have been better directed to veterans and their families who remain in need. In anybody's language, $18 million is a lot of money.
I daresay that during the next few weeks or months we will see more phoney posturing by the Howard government on its largesse to veterans. Veterans know it is not true, and I hope this evening that this brief record and litany of mistakes will remind them. As outlined by Senator Collins, the Labor Party supports the bill.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-08-30,"—I want to respond to a couple of statements made by various speakers. I will not respond at all to Senator Bishop. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will obviously be interested to read what he said but veterans know that they have been supported enormously by the Howard government. It is not just the issues that Senator Bishop raised but the support veterans get through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and a range of other measures that are relevant. 
I want to attend to an issue that Senator Collins raised. It is an issue that the shadow minister keeps raising. I want to put it on the public record, as I have done before. It regards carer allowance for parents caring for children with a disability. We reviewed the cases of 67,000 parents who were receiving the carer allowance because it was believed their children had a disability. That review meant that about 37,000 people retained their carer allowance. The cases of about 30,000 parents who had a child with a disability were reviewed. I will enunciate the figures clearly and put them on the public record. I want Senator Collins to listen to this, because we are talking about truth and honesty in government. If you want truth and honesty in opposition let us put these facts on the record. The opposition keep saying that 30,000 people were stripped of their carer allowance.
—That's true.
—Senator Collins says, `That's true.' Let me tell Senator Collins, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that, of those 30,000 carers, 6,465 people contacted Centrelink and requested that they cease the allowance because they were not eligible. Did you hear me, Senator Collins? There were 6,465 people who said that they were not eligible and 8,305 people—
—Senator Collins has had an opportunity to speak on this. There were three attempts on the part of Centrelink—two letters and a phone call—to ask people to return their forms and 8,305 people did not return their forms. Under Labor many people were getting onto a carer allowance because their children had asthma and they wanted a health care card. Senator Newman went out and talked to people in Centrelink, which was something that Labor had never done with the old DSS. I was with her one day when she asked an officer behind the counter, `What would you do if you could change things?' The officer said, `Senator, there are people getting a carer allowance basically to get a health care card because their children have asthma, and the costs of their puffers and other medications are high. I would change that because these children don't have a disability that requires a carer allowance.' And what happened? Of the 30,000 people in the review I think about 7,000 retained their health care cards.
We had 7,000 people who kept their health care cards, 8,305 who did not respond and 6,465 people who said they were not eligible. But Labor keeps going on about 30,000 people having been stripped of this. They want to talk about truth and honesty. If they want to talk about facts let us put the facts on the table. The shadow minister, Mr Swan, runs around—as does Senator Collins—going on and on and misrepresenting the public.
—Senator Collins says no, but those are the facts. Senator Greig talked about carers. He said that people missed out on the carer bonus. They only got a carer bonus because we ran the economy efficiently. We actually saved money; we have a surplus. We have paid back $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion of debt, which we inherited. Labor racked up, in their last year of government, $10 billion of debt. There are kids in the gallery—who Senator Bishop was performing to—whose money we were borrowing. We were borrowing money from the next generation. The Labor government borrowed $10 billion in their last year of government. They left us with $96 billion of debt that those young people in the gallery tonight would have had to pay back. We were living off the future to pay for our needs. 
The government said we should run our budgets in surplus. Because we have done that and because we have paid back $70 billion of debt, we are saving nearly $6 billion in interest. So we can give the backbone of our community, the carers, a bonus. Most people on carer payment would otherwise be in employment. There are about 2,500 who did not transfer to the age pension, but people were advised to transfer to the age pension before anybody knew about a carer bonus because those people do not have to have a review every two years of the case of the person for whom they care. Many people would find that review onerous. The age pension is more portable for those people who come from overseas and might want to go back to Calathumpia—I will not use the name of a country, because I do not want to discriminate. If people want to go back to their home country for a period of time their age pension is portable. There is always a cut-off point and we believed that we could give a bonus to those people on a carer payment who would otherwise probably have had the opportunity to work. Many people on the age pension who get carer allowance got a $600 bonus. This is something that was never, ever achieved under Labor because they never ran surplus budgets. They were always spending more than they received in revenue and borrowing from the next generation.
It is always difficult when you have these sorts of payments because you do have to have cut-off points regarding when a payment starts and who gets it. When Senator Greig talked about the carers, he failed to mention that within the last budget I was able to achieve half a billion dollars for carers. This very bill is part of that, to extend carer allowance. Of course, it does not pay on an hourly basis for the enormous amount of work that carers do in our community. Every day in this portfolio I go out and see parents caring for children with a disability. I see older people who have been caring for their children for 30, 40, 50 and 60 years—80-year-olds with people they have been caring for. I have been to the disability ministers' meeting and said to them that we need to do something about succession planning for these people. I could not get them to agree, in the first instance, to an advisory committee. They had to have a committee of bureaucrats to discuss it first before I could engage carers, but I thought I may as well take the first step with the eight Labor state and territory ministers. I think I have got a reasonable reputation for working with my colleagues from the opposite side at the state level in health, in this area and for women.
We have agreed that we will look at issues that affect people, including older carers. For example, as I said, an 82-year-old may look after a 60-year-old son or daughter with down syndrome who has grand mal seizures. They are the people we should be concerned about. I have instigated a committee of all state and territory ministers to engage in a discussion about how together we can provide for these people: how we can look at accommodation and how we can assist them in making plans as they get older and for when they die. The thing that concerns them most is: when they die who will look after their children? That most probably was not an issue 30 years ago. When I was at university doing child development and human development, it was not the case that a person with down syndrome lived to 70. A member of my family has a sister with down syndrome who is 70. It was not heard of 30 years ago. 
We have to move—as we talk about the ageing of the population—on the ageing of our population with disability and the effect on their parents. I have moved some way with the ministers, though not as fast as I would have liked, and I have indicated that we will address some of the issues of succession planning for them. We gave $72½ million to get the states to do what they should have been doing: providing accommodation and respite for older people who care for people with a disability. We took up a 1981 agreement from when Labor was in government federally that the states would look after accommodation and respite care and the Commonwealth would look after employment in what were once called sheltered workshops but what we now call business services—supported employment. We agreed that we would address those issues. We have seen increased spending in disability services. There was $99 million in the last budget to address the issue of assisting business services to be more viable and to make sure that nobody in a business service loses their job. But the states need to come on board and carry out their responsibility. They have got increased GST to provide accommodation and respite for people who have sons and daughters with disabilities. We have given them an additional $72½ million to assist them in giving respite to people over 70. Senator Greig can come in here and talk about issues to do with carers but let me say that in the last budget I managed to achieve half a billion dollars for carers.
Another issue for me is young carers. Last week at the first young carers summit, which the Commonwealth government funded, I met young carers. The youngest there was 13 years of age. There were carers of 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 caring for a parent with a disability—sometimes a mental illness, sometimes a degenerative disease—and often looking after a sibling—sometimes one with a disability. In this last budget we have given them five hours respite a week during term time and two weeks respite a year to enable them to continue with their education. This was particularly for young people at risk who have no extended family to assist them. You only had to sit with those young carers, as I did last week when we opened their conference and then again in the evening, to find out about the challenges they face. There was half a billion dollars for carers in this budget alone. It is all very well for the Democrats to come in here and say what they would do; they never have to be fiscally responsible. But to give credit where credit is due is appropriate. In the last budget we had a program for young carers, who have never featured on the landscape before and who are high in my priorities. I have some other ideas that I think could assist them. For older carers I am pushing the states into discussing a feasible approach for giving them some hope and some security about what might happen to their sons or daughters, if they are under 65, in terms of accommodation and, if they are over 65, in terms of accommodation and the Commonwealth's responsibility.
They are important issues that I believe need to be pursued. I am very pleased I have been able to start those discussions with the states and territories. This bill is not about paying people for caring; this bill is about recognising that there is an army of people out there caring for loved ones, for people for whom they have a responsibility out of friendship—whether it be a neighbour or an in-law—and for people who do not live with the person for whom they care. It is an issue which has been raised and to which we have responded. It has huge budgetary implications but I think it is appropriate in recognition of the work that the army of carers does out there. We can never, ever pay them in monetary terms. It is about recognising the army of people who care either for people in their homes and for those with whom they do not live. I commend the bill to the house.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-30,"—Before we move to the committee stage of this bill, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the speech of my colleague Senator Natasha Stott Despoja on the second reading.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Is leave granted?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, the normal procedure is to see such a speech before granting leave. Had I seen it, I most probably would have granted leave. I see opposition senators shaking their heads. Obviously they have not seen this speech either. Subject to seeing it, I would approve its incorporation, but we cannot just accept such an incorporation at face value.
Leave not granted.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-30,"—The Greens support the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. It will help smaller producers. It introduces a wine producer rebate to offset the wine equalisation tax up to a maximum of $290,000. However, it does not yet bring in a tax which is based on the volume, rather than the selling price, of wine. That is something that we would like to see the government move to. This legislation will be a benefit in general to smaller wine producers in Tasmania and, I am sure, other parts of the country and therefore has to be welcomed, but we will be pursuing further improvements to make the taxation system fairer for small producers producing high-quality wines as against those that are producing large volumes. Many people would not know, for example, that cask wines are not produced in Tasmania. Its production is all high-quality bottled wines. While this legislation is a good move, one that will help many wine producers, we would like to see it go further.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-30,"—I understand—and the chamber can advise me if this is incorrect—that there is an agreement tonight that speeches can be incorporated. I am willing to do so on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 if that is all right.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I understand the practice is that the whips on both sides of the house should concur on it being incorporated, Senator Murray. I am sure that if you have sought their permission there will be no problem. 
—I have not sought their permission. That is why I am seeking to do so on the chamber floor.
—Is leave granted for Senator Murray to incorporate his speech?
Government senators interjecting—
—I take that, Senator Murray, to be a negative and that leave is not granted.
—If the whips and leaders have agreed that is how it should be, I am more than happy to take up the Senate's time.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: we have recently discussed this matter with Senator Ian Campbell, who is the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. He says that certainly there is an agreement to incorporate speeches, but it is always subject to those speeches being read by the whip or a representative of each party. That is how the system works.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: Senator McGauran, the whip, has been telling me that we asked some time ago for Senator Stott Despoja's speech. We have been waiting for it. I did not grant leave because I had not seen it. We—and I do not know where Senator McGauran is now—had been advised it was on its way at about five o'clock. I have a personal view about incorporating speeches, and I have had my say on that. I still have not had time to look through this speech. I think that was the agreement. The Labor Party shook their heads because they had not seen it either.
—That is not right.
—I am sorry, let me speak on this point of order. When I said I had not seen it, the people on the opposition side—whoever was in the chamber at the time—shook their heads as well. If the whip had seen it, that would have been a different matter. But we had not seen it—I have checked with our whip. I am reading through it now. If we are going to have speeches incorporated, they need to be here in time for somebody to have a look at them.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I hope this might enlighten the Senate. I notice the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ian Campbell, is sitting behind the minister. We have in fact just had a joint meeting of leaders and whips, at which it was agreed that incorporations would proceed as per normal. It is not normal practice for speeches in the second reading debate to be authorised or otherwise. They are in their nature contentious in that they are speeches in the second reading debate. We had this difficulty towards the end of the last sitting of the Senate. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, people are entitled to say whatever they like in their speeches in the second reading debate—because they are speeches in the second reading debate. If the bills were not contentious, they would be listed under `non-controversial'. They are listed in the program; they are controversial. The Labor Party will be acceding to all requests for incorporation of speeches in the second reading debate.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: for the record, Senator Stott Despoja's speech was handed to the Government Whip prior to the end of the debate. I do not know how long the whip is suggesting that the speech needs to be available for reading before leave. I understand it is quite a short one. The spirit of our leaders' and whips' meeting earlier on was that it was an automatic matter; it was not a question of seeking approval and passing speeches around the chamber for everybody to read them in advance of thinking about whether or not they could be incorporated. 
—It's not an adjournment debate.
—It is not an adjournment debate; it is a speech in the second reading debate. I doubt very much that there is something in that speech that would need to be responded to on the part of the government. As Senator Mackay said, they are speeches on the second reading, which are of a fairly standard format in expressing the way in which each party will deal with the bill. I think the government is being unreasonable. We all want to finish this evening if it is possible, and incorporating speeches seems to be a fine way of doing that. I suggest that the government get its act together and agree to accept those speeches as they are handed over.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, further to the point of order: I would agree with that. I think there needs to be a good spirit tonight. I am very happy to accept that—
—A bit too much `spirit', perhaps!
—I also want to say that I quite admire you, Senator Mackay—I will put that on the record.
—If you wish to carry on a conversation with Senator Mackay, Senator Brown, you are more than welcome to do so, but perhaps it ought to be outside the chamber.
—I think we have now had time for the good senator's speech to be reviewed. I am sure it is acceptable and we can proceed.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, further to the point of order: there is actually an important point that Senator Patterson has made here. That is, although generally speaking Senator Mackay is right and speeches on the second reading should be incorporated—and we reached an arrangement last night to get things done quickly—Senator Patterson makes a very good point. It is quite possible to write something that is outside standing orders in a speech on the second reading. What we do here, as happens on the other side, is to give them a quick read over. Senator Patterson has done that, and we are very happy that the speech that was prepared be incorporated. As Senator Mackay knows, I am also reading over some tabling documents that Senator Harris is seeking to incorporate. I do have some concerns with those; I will read them slightly more cautiously. I thank all honourable senators for the agreement we have to finish three important bills this evening.
—How many days have you been in cabinet?
—Not long enough! I commend the bill to the Senate, and I also commend Senator Stott Despoja's speech on the second reading debate to the Senate.
—Because it is the convention of the Senate rather than a regulation of the Senate that these things be acceded to by leave, I am prepared to put the question again with respect to leave. Is leave granted to have the speech of Senator Murray on the second reading incorporated?
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 I wish to acknowledge the valuable alcohol industry data and material that I have accessed from websites and Senate committee submissions. 
This includes the pre-budget submissions from the wine, brewing and spirits industries; submissions to the 2002 Senate Economics Legislation Committee review of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1); and the Fosters Group website `Update on the Ready to Drink Market'.
The Bill provides for a $290,000 rebate of the value-added Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) per producer, effectively exempting the first $1m of domestic wine sales from any tax on its alcohol content.
The Bill also removes accelerated depreciation available for grapevines, and contains some minor technical amendments.
The rebate will cost around $338m over 4 years but this is partially offset by $36m of savings from the removal of accelerated depreciation.
One major shortcoming to this measure is that it also applies to large producers. They do not need and should not get this tax concession.
There are two dangers to the costs estimates. Under the CER agreement with New Zealand we may have to compensate New Zealand wine producers for this discriminatory tax concession.
Secondly, foreign wine producers may import wine in bulk to Australia, blend it with a small amount of Australian wine and bottle it for the domestic market, thereby becoming eligible for the wine producer rebate for wine manufactured in Australia.
This legislation is an economic subsidy measure that will assist mostly small wine producers in rural and regional Australia, who will receive around 85% of the rebate benefits.
This Bill is the consequence of a long intense campaign by the wine industry, particularly the Wine Federation, and reflects the importance of rural seats, to the Government, particularly in South Australia.
There is strong support for the Bill from all sectors of the wine industry.
Countering that is consistent and valid criticism by the agencies that deal with the misuse and harm caused by alcohol, that all alcohol should be taxed volumetrically as alcohol regardless of its type.
The Democrats have always supported the taxation of alcohol as a standard regulatory mechanism to prevent alcohol being cheaply available, and as a means of contributing to the public cost of harm arising from alcohol consumption.
The Democrats also support promoting the viability of rural and regional based enterprises, which this Bill does.
Despite the social need to tax all alcohol, it is our view that we have no option but to reluctantly support this tax concession on economic grounds, as it will relieve genuine financial pressure on regional small business in agriculture and tourism.
Quite properly, there is continuing concern at the costs of alcohol abuse, at binge drinking, and health problems arising from excessive consumption, but alcohol consumption in Australia needs to be put into perspective.
Australia's alcohol consumption has been continuously falling since it peaked in the mid-1970's, and it has fallen a dramatic 22% over the period 1980 to 2001. 
We are now below France, Spain, Germany, the UK, Greece, Italy and New Zealand.
Consumption has fallen from a high of approximately 11 litres of pure alcohol per adult per year in 1977-78, to around 9 litres of pure alcohol per adult per year in 2002-03.
The current alcohol tax system is a considerable improvement on the former regime, but the policy framework still lacks sufficient coherence. There is therefore a need for a comprehensive alcohol tax review.
Further improvements to the alcohol tax regime could make a significant contribution to improved health outcomes. In particular, the Government's low-alcohol policy is poor. It only focuses on beer, and fails to provide clear incentives to encourage low alcohol ready-to-drinks (RTDs) and wine.
There are significant continuing inequities and anomalies in alcohol taxation, including an unjustifiable preferential rate for brandy over other spirits. 
The `all-the-way-with-the-USA-FTA' requires the abolition of the 5 per cent ad valorem customs duty applicable to imported bourbon. So Scotch whisky and Russian vodka will now be taxed at a higher rate than American bourbon. This is untenable and inequitable alcohol policy.
The value-added WET is a failure in two respects. It has created a low-price cheap-alcohol cask market that is at the centre of alcohol abuse. Secondly, it continues to punish the premium bottled wine sector.
The Government is to be congratulated for its introduction of a broad conceptual framework for alcohol taxation policy in Australia.
The framework has three key compartments: products with less than 10% alcohol content; products with more than 10% alcohol content; and wine and cider.
The Government has recognised the merit of taxing most products under 10% alcohol content at similar taxation rates, regardless of the form of the alcohol.
This tax is levied volumetrically as excise or customs duty on the amount of the alcohol in the product.
The Government has also recognised the merits of taxing all products over 10% alcohol content at a higher rate. This too is sound policy.
However, a fatal policy flaw is that the taxation of wine and cider is still based on the value, not alcohol volume, of the product.
It is better tax policy to tax each alcohol product on its alcohol content rather than its value.
Alcohol is alcohol. If tax is applies to the amount of the alcohol in the product, then industry is encouraged to producer lower alcohol products. That is because the lower the alcohol content, the less tax that will be paid.
Secondly, industry is free to develop products from various alcohol sources, without the tax system providing incentives to choose one type of alcohol over another. This is good non-interventionist policy design.
In 1998 the New Tax System proposals announced a new approach to taxing RTDs, including cider, at a rate similar to beer. In 1999 the Government reversed its ANTS and pre-election policy and was successfully lobbied by cider interests to exclude traditional cider from the RTD taxation regime.
This was a classic failure by a re-elected Government to hold a sound policy line against a self-interested lobby. 
In April 2001 the Government was forced to accept Senate amendments to provide concessional excise rates for draught beer. Many argue that was not as good a policy as we thought at the time.
In June 2002 the Government and the Opposition refused to support my motion that the Senate Economic References Committee undertake a comprehensive alcohol tax inquiry, thereby failing to take that opportunity to further strengthen the alcohol tax framework.
In November 2002 the Government amended the Excise Tariff Act to replace State low-alcohol beer subsidies and to overcome an unintended consequence of poorly designed mid-strength packaged beer excise rates under the New Tax System.
However, the Government (and the Opposition) refused to support Democrat and Independent amendments to introduce tax incentives for low-alcohol and mid-strength RTDs.
The Democrats have consistently advocated a coherent alcohol policy framework comprising three key dimensions: the economic dimension, the social dimension, and policy integrity.
From an economic perspective, alcohol policy should encourage innovation, growth and diversity amongst Australian businesses. A coherently constructed alcohol policy should maximise business investment, employment and export opportunities in both metropolitan and regional Australia.
Australia has strong, globally-recognised beer, wine and spirits industries. These valuable industries create many jobs in our major cities and regions. Their products contribute to a great many enjoyable social occasions.
The Australian alcohol industry is an $11 billion industry, with one beer industry estimate of retail sales as follows: beer $5 b; wine $2.6b; spirits $1.7b; RTDs $1.7b; and cider $0.07b. 
The beer industry is a major employer in Australia, and is a high value adding industry, with value-add estimated at between 30% and 35%. The Australian beer industry has developed a world-class range of low-alcohol and mid-strength beer products.
These beer product innovations are most likely a key contributor to the falling levels of alcohol consumption in this country in recent decades.
The WFA estimates that employment in grape growing and winemaking has doubled from 15,000 to 30,000 between 1996 and 2001. Wine exports have been a stellar success story. However, there has been a clear downward trend in winery profits over recent years, according to the Deloitte 2002 Annual Benchmarking Survey.
Prior to this year's Budget announcement of the proposed wine producer rebates, Econtech had forecast that winery profitability will continue to decline over the 5 years to 2006-07. Econtech had also forecast that employment growth will suffer, and that employment may even decline due to exits from the industry.
The Democrats recognise the role that the wine producer rebates contained in this Bill will play in further encouraging growth and sustainability in small and medium sized regional Australian wineries.
Wine tourism is a vibrant and growing economic activity in many key regions. The Democrats support the vital role that wine tourism plays in strengthening regional economies.
The local spirits industry is growing. Despite being handicapped by the Coalition, which gives cognac and foreign brandy an excise tax advantage over our own rum products, Bundaberg Rum asserts they are now the biggest selling spirit in Australia. 
Most RTDs are manufactured in Australia.
Good social and health outcomes are a key objective of a coherent alcohol tax policy. This means that Australia's alcohol policy should regulate the price and availability of alcohol in a manner that minimises harm and encourages responsible consumption.
Drinking alcohol responsibly and moderately has health, social and economic benefits for individuals, communities, industry and governments, which collect over $4b in alcohol revenue. The abuse of alcohol has a huge cost however.
People who drink in moderation have better health and social outcomes than abstainers. Abstainers have better health outcomes than people drinking at risky or high-risk levels.
Alcohol abuse affects certain indigenous communities, and specific age groups, such as underage drinkers.
Good alcohol tax policy can make a positive contribution to beneficial social and health outcomes.
A balanced alcohol taxation regime requires policy integrity. Alcohol tax should ideally conform to the principles of simplicity, efficiency and equity. Equity in a tax system requires that `like be taxed as like'.
Alcohol taxation should not discriminate between different forms of alcohol on such arbitrary bases as how the alcohol was created, whether by fermentation, distillation or any other method. A standard drink is a standard drink. Alcohol taxation should reflect this truth.
A key feature of any alcohol policy should be the promotion of low-alcohol products. 
In concert with credible and authoritative health campaigners who are experts in the alcohol field, the Democrats have long campaigned for changes to alcohol excise to encourage the production and consumption of low-alcohol products, whatever their form.
All beer products currently enjoy an excise-free threshold of 1.15% alcohol content. This means that no excise duty is paid on the first 1.15% of the alcohol content in the beer product. The lower the alcohol content of the beer, the greater the value of this concession.
However, the failure to provide an excise free-threshold for RTDs means there is no incentive for producers to make lower-strength RTD products.
The Democrats have consistently recommended that low alcohol packaged RTD products be subject to the same tiered excise regime that has successfully encouraged the production and consumption of low-alcohol packaged beer. There is no revenue cost in doing this, and no plausible policy rationale for not doing it. 
Some believe that RTDs target young people and are the cause of a growing youth alcohol abuse problem. On this basis many claim that RTDs should be taxed at a higher rate in order to price them out of the youth market.
Competitors emphasise this argument in the hopes that it boosts their own products. The only way to deal with competing claims is to use credible genuinely independent empirically based research.
Data from the spirits industry indicates that two thirds of the RTD market is made up of dark-spirit based products, based on bourbon, scotch and dark rum. They argue that these RTDs compete in the same market to beer and are comparable in terms of alcohol strength.
The spirits industry argues that these products are neither overly sweet, nor colourful, and are in fact targeted at 18 to 30 year olds.
Spirits industry data shows that the share of the RTD market made up by white-spirit based RTDs is falling. Sales of white-spirit based RTDs fell approximately 8 per cent during 2003, compared with an increase in sales of over 25 per cent for dark-spirit based RTDs.
The NDS Household Survey commenced in 1985 and I am advised that it is arguably the most sophisticated national empirical data available relating to the use of alcohol (and other drugs) in Australia.
The findings of the AIHW after the 2001 NDS Household Survey indicated that RTDs are the most commonly consumed alcoholic beverages for 14 to 19 year old females drinking at low risk levels. (Although I would have thought anyone drinking at 14 is high risk.)
14 to 19 year old males drinking at low, risky and high risk levels all preferred regular strength beer, whilst risky and high risk females in that age group preferred bottled spirits and liqueurs.
A report in the West Australia Sunday Times recently (11 July) said that the Australian Secondary School Students Alcohol and Drug Survey shows a reduction in the number of underage school students consuming alcohol.
Importantly, the Survey found that excessive drinking among males aged 16 to 17 dropped from 29 per cent in 1999 to 19 per cent in 2002.
The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy has requested that a taskforce be established to prepare a report by November 2004 recommending interventions to reduce underage drinking.
That report will outline mechanisms to inform parents of the need to monitor alcohol consumption levels by their adolescents. This is a sound initiative.
Unlike wine, beer alcohol taxation now probably looks about right overall.
WET provides wine producers with an incentive to produce low-value wine. The low-priced alcohol cask market is at the recorded centre of alcohol abuse.
Research in the Northern Territory demonstrates that increasing the price of cask wine substantially reduced alcohol abuse. In my own state of Western Australia the green suitcase, cask wine, is notorious in street and parks drinking.
Contrary to the myth, wine is at the heart of alcohol abuse, not at its periphery.
This is one reason I maintain my campaign for the volumetric taxation of wine. 
Beyond increasing the price of cask wine, a volumetric wine tax would also lower the price of higher value wines, which are over-priced by virtue of the WET. This, in turn, would stimulate that sector of the industry, and create jobs.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-08-30,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
The Labor Party has been campaigning for relief for small winemakers from the wine equalisation tax since the WET was introduced by the Howard government as part of the GST package. 
That was 5 years ago.
Labor was the first to propose a rebate from the WET for cellar door sales.
It was proposed by Joel Fitzgibbon who, as both the Member for Hunter and Shadow Minister for Tourism, was concerned about the effect of the WET on tourism in wine regions.
At the time—1999—the wine industry was in uproar because they had been promised an `equalisation' tax but found that the tax burden on premium wines had been significantly increased.
What the government had actually promised was to equalise the effect of the new and old tax regimes at the value end of the market.
With ad valorem taxation that increased the burden on premium wines significantly.
Labor established a wine tax committee, to examine the problem and develop an appropriate response.
The other members of the committee were the Member for Kingston David Cox, the Member for Hunter Joel Fitzgibbon, the Member for Bass Michelle O'Byrne, and the Member for Cowan Graham Edwards.
We consulted widely, visiting small and medium size winemakers in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra Valleys and Margaret River.
From these consultations, what became clear was that the large wineries need to maintain ad valorem taxation for the overwhelming majority of the industry's sales—and this is critical to the irrigation areas that supply grapes for value wines—while a vocal group of small winemakers, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, wanted volumetric taxation because it would provide them with the tax relief that many desperately needed.
What was needed was an appropriate exemption from the WET that could resolve this dilemma for the wine industry.
Collectively the industry needed ad valorem taxation.
An exemption set at an appropriate level would remove the extra burden the WET placed on small premium wineries and they would therefore be able to survive within the existing ad valorem tax regime.
It would be preferable for a number of design reasons, that I will go into later, to determine the exemption as a WET free threshold set at an appropriate number of litres of production—not alcohol content.
That was the proposition the committee consulted on in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra Valleys, in Margaret River and with the major wine companies.
Over the year that we consulted, the wine industry adopted four different tax policy positions of its own.
These included cutting the WET rate and later only paying the GST.
Both of these options would have been expensive to the revenue and made value wines even cheaper—neither of which we were prepared to contemplate.
The Prime Minister eventually was forced to promise the Australian Democrats an exemption to get the GST through the Senate.
The Treasurer tried to ignore that commitment for many months and the Democrats—but not the Labor Party—had all but given up on it ever being delivered when the Treasurer was instructed by the Prime Minister to negotiate an arrangement.
The result, having been negotiated by a reluctant Treasurer and a pair of Democrats was an inconceivably complex beast.
The cost of the rebate was shared with the States and the Commonwealth's contribution phased out above a threshold.
That is a difficult arrangement in terms of tax administration and compliance.
The Labor Party never thought it was adequate and never gave up on providing something better.
When the wine industry was able to unite around a policy position that would see the WET rate of 29% maintained with an appropriate number of litres as a WET free threshold, it was clear that a solution was within reach.
They had originally wanted a one million litre exemption but had settled on 600,000 litres. 
At the 2001 federal election Labor offered an exemption from the WET for wineries producing up to 50,000 litres.
The industry would have preferred more.
However the government did not match it and instead offered a review.
After the election when the terms of reference for the review were released they did not include the issue of taxation—the industry had been led up the garden path.
David Trebbeck from ACIL Tasman conducted the review.
He found that all anybody in the industry wanted to do was talk about tax so he wrote a very good chapter on that but felt constrained by his terms of reference not to make any recommendations.
The industry continued to campaign for a 600,000 litre exemption. Two budgets went by with the government refusing to respond. Small wineries profitability continued to be low.
It was not until an election year budget, with nine marginal seats with significant wine industry interests spread on either side of the electoral pendulum that the Howard government reluctantly decided to act.
The only thing that has changed the government's mind is that Labor has made it an issue and some of the Coalition's regional seats are vulnerable.
The proposition that they have brought forward is for a rebate on the WET for the first $1 million of wholesale value.
At a 29% WET rate that has a value of up to $290,000 for each winery.
How that relates to the value of a WET exemption expressed in litres depends on the average value of a winery's production.
For small winemakers producing premium product that is the equivalent of a WET free threshold of less than 100,000 litres.
For large wineries producing a preponderance of value wines it is the equivalent of a WET free threshold of over 250,000 litres.
So the government has not delivered to the industry the industry's policy, either in terms of tax design or quantum.
The government's rebate provides an effective exemption for a majority of small wineries producing below the rebate limit.
For the major wineries the value of either an exemption threshold expressed in litres or a rebate expressed in dollars is insignificant to their overall tax position but they will view the concession relative to the cost of running their cellar door operations.
The value and design of the exemption or rebate is most sensitive for small and medium wineries whose production exceeds the threshold or rebate.
There are three good reasons for sticking to an exemption set as a litre threshold:
First, an exemption set as a litre threshold will not require indexation to maintain its value.
It must be remembered that the Howard government has given no commitment to index the rebate—so its value will be eroded over time.
Second, a WET free threshold set in litres allows small wineries to move their wines up in value either by improving the quality of their product or its marketing and so get more out of the exemption, which they couldn't once they reach the level of the rebate.
Third, for a given cost to revenue an exemption set in litres will give more value to small and medium sized wineries than it will give to the major wineries producing predominantly value wines.
It needs to be remembered that the exemption is primarily for small wineries.
The large wineries already receive their primary benefit—having an ad valorem tax regime.
For these reasons Labor will be sticking to its own policy of providing an exemption set at an appropriate number of litres.
However, because small wineries need WET relief now, Labor will not be opposing this bill.
We believe we can provide the wine industry with a better tax regime than this rebate.
Indeed it is not entirely clear why the Howard government has decided on a rebate.
We expect it is partly to do with wanting to differentiate itself from the Labor Party policy. 
It may also be because it is simpler for the ATO to deal with a value based rebate on a value based Business Activity Statement.
Unfortunately it means that the value of the rebate will be eroded significantly over time unless it is indexed periodically.
The rebate is intended to replace current Commonwealth and State rebate arrangements for the first $1 million of wholesale value.
The Treasurer has written to the States requesting that the value of the State rebates be returned to the Commonwealth to offset part of the net cost.
The States all agreed to do this when they wrote in support of the WFA's policy that would have provided the exemption for the first 600,000 litres of production.
While that 600,000 litre exemption has not been provided and detailed arrangements for return of the State rebates below the first $1 million of wholesale value have not been agreed I assume the States will be cooperative on this issue.
The wine industry position is that the State rebates should be retained in some form to ensure that no wineries are worse off under the new arrangements.
The Howard government has given no explicit or implicit acceptance of that principle.
The States are currently working cooperatively with the industry on developing arrangements to provide rebates above the Commonwealth arrangements and the South Australian Treasury is taking the lead in that process.
It will be a complex procedure because some wineries—or related entities—have cellar door operations in more than one state so the states will want to come up with some rules for allocating their rebates.
During the Senate Economics Legislation Committee Hearing on this Bill on Monday, Treasury officials were able to clarify a number of issues. The costing of this measure in the budget papers is the net figure, after the removal of the current Commonwealth rebate arrangement.
However, it does not represent the net cost after the removal of the state rebates—which should be returned to the Commonwealth.
Late amendments to the Bill extend the rebate to producers of cider, mead, perry and sake.
The bill also contains three integrity measures:
First, the bill provides associated entity rules to prevent wineries claiming multiple rebates or a winery splitting its operation when it reaches the limit of the rebate.
This is critical to containing the cost to the revenue of a rebate or exemption arrangement.
Second, the bill closes off a loophole in the present Act that would allow a winery to avoid the WET by exporting and then re-importing wine.
There is no evidence that this has occurred and indeed in most cases given Australia's geography relative to even our nearest neighbours this would be prohibitively expensive except for small quantities of very high value wine.
The third requires all packaging costs to be included in the WET cost base.
Obviously if the wholesale value of the wine is held down by excluding the packaging costs then the value of the rebate can be artificially extended to cover more product.
Labor supports these three integrity measures.
The bill also contains a measure to remove the concession of accelerated depreciation for vineyard plantings.
This concession has existed since 1993 when it was part of an agreement between the then Labor government and the industry on future tax arrangements.
There is a view in the industry that this concession has contributed to oversupply of wine grapes and there has been some consensus about getting rid of it.
Labor supports removal of this concession.
Question agreed to.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-08-30,"—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	The ACCC has examined its records of complaints and inquiries between 1993-94 until 2003-04. Over this 10 year period there were 14 complaints about escalating prices of grains, fodder and other livestock animal feed.
	Some of these complaints related to feed suppliers packaging feed in smaller quantities but continuing to charge the price previously charged for a larger quantity. 
	Other complaints were that feed suppliers were taking advantage of drought conditions to increase prices. In each instance, preliminary inquiries suggested that the pricing issue raised by each complainant was not related to any breach of the TPA.
In certain situations, such as during drought, severe shortages of grains, fodder and other livestock animal feed can arise and it would be expected that prices would increase as a result of restricted supply.
During the 10 year period examined by the ACCC, an additional 10 complaints or inquiries were received about the application of GST to feed supplies. 
	In each instance preliminary inquiries suggested that suppliers had not breached the price exploitation provisions of the TPA that had been introduced specifically for the period in which the GST was to be implemented.
More generally, during this 10 year period, 23 complaints and inquiries were received about feed suppliers. These were in relation to:
	GST exclusive advertising by feed suppliers;
	Refusal to supply by feed suppliers; and
	Suspected price-fixing between feed suppliers.
Preliminary inquiries by the ACCC found that these complaints and inquiries did not raise TPA concerns. 
(2)	It is not possible for the ACCC to prosecute any party that increases prices in the absence of evidence that a breach of the TPA has occurred. There have been no prosecutions of feed suppliers in relation to price or other issues during the 10 year period 1993-94 and 2003-04.
(3)	N/A. 
(4)	Making a profit is not unlawful. However, a breach of the provisions of the TPA prohibiting anti-competitive conduct can attract significant penalties, including penalties of up to $10 million for companies and $500,000 for individuals. It is also possible for a Court to order that damages be paid to affected parties.
A breach of the TPA provisions that prohibit unconscionable conduct can lead a Court to make orders that include recision, variation or specific performance of a contract. Damages could also be awarded if a feed supplier had acted unconscionably towards a farmer.
(5)	The penalties in relation to breaches of anti-competitive provisions of the TPA were increased in 1993 to provide penalties from $250,000 up to $10 million for corporations and from $50,000 up to $500,000 for individuals.
In 2001, the TPA was amended to allow a Court to issue probation orders, community service orders and corrective advertising orders for breaches of provisions that included unconscionable or anti-competitive conduct.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission: Profiteering</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,30,1,answer
