Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:32):  I will start off where I finished last night, talking about some of the concerns around the process being used to ram this legislation through. We saw the first result of the way this legislation has been dealt with when, the day after introducing the bill to the House, the government was forced to essentially rewrite the bill and move a number of amendments to fix a mistake. Only having been in the Senate for a year, I am not sure how standard the practice is to move amendments quite so quickly after a bill is introduced—that is, the next day—as the bill is being debated. From my understanding, it was that the government drafters must have read that ABC's Antony Green's blog where these errors were pointed out.


One of the amendments was to ensure that the votes were able to be counted. That is the result of the speed with which this electoral bill has been brought forward and the mistakes that have been made were clear on day one. The scrutiny of this bill has now been completed through the 4½-hour hearing this morning. I am not sure whether the committee is going to have the time to work through all of the submissions. I have seen a number that raise concerns and that identify other mistakes in this bill.


It seems incredible to me that we are in this situation where we are dealing with significant reform, the most major reform in 30 years, and the way the legislation was concocted. It was written with Senator Di Natale, Senator Xenophon and the Prime Minister sitting together, working out a deal that would in the long term be beneficial for all of them. The scrutiny allowed has been so limited.


We heard concerns from witnesses during the hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters this morning. I have not caught all of today's hearings but I did see a number of people come before the committee this morning and raise concerns. I did manage to hear some of Mr Malcolm Mackerras's evidence before the committee. He raised some substantial concerns. His language was very strong in the evidence that he gave. He had concerns that predated this bill but he also had concerns on this bill. I am not an expert so I do not understand whether there is any merit to Mr Mackerras's arguments but the whole point of having a committee process is to be able to draw those out, consider them, take advice from others and work out whether or not it will have the impact that Mr Mackerras is alleging it will.


I have two major concerns that I will cover off today. The first one is around the process and the urgency. What is it that the Greens political party get out of this in the longer term? It looks to me like the short-term result of this will be the potential loss of a couple of senators. Why the sham process? Who does that benefit? Is it going to benefit democracy in the long run?


Will it ensure that Australians who vote in the upcoming election—whether it be a double dissolution election or a general election—will actually have their vote counted? Or will it mean that there will be millions of Australians who cast a vote and are going to be disenfranchised by the system that is being put in place in this deal by the coalition and the Greens? Those are the two reasons I do not support the way that this electoral bill has been dealt with. It is why the Labor party will continue to argue against it as it proceeds through the Senate.


The legislation is worthy of much greater scrutiny; a longer time frame and extended reporting date; the ability for people who want to provide submissions to provide those submissions; and for individuals or other political parties that might want to contest the next election to be given the opportunity and the time to appear and give evidence on their positions to the joint standing committee. When that joint standing committee process has had a reasonable time to consider the bill, to consult and to consider their report, that report should then be tabled and again people will have time to respond. That is the normal process that we have in this place for dealing with bills. This bill is significant and it is worthy of that level of scrutiny.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. I am pleased to be able to follow Senator Gallagher, who was reminding us of several of the points that were raised last night in this debate. Of course, since that time we have also had the farcical meeting of the JSCEM committee. I will have an opportunity to reflect on some of those processes. I am pleased, Mr President, that you are in the chair at the moment and that Senator Cormann is representing the government in the chamber at the moment, because I have very serious concerns about how this legislation has progressed. That is not just as the senator representing the Special Minister of State in the Senate but also as an individual senator.




Senator Cormann:
  That would be Gary Gray, who actually agrees with this!



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Cormann likes to say that Mr Gray agrees with this.




Senator Cormann:
  He does!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  What we all agree with, Senator Cormann, is that this is a matter that needs to be addressed carefully and with due consideration. However, what is occurring here is a railroad. It is a railroad of a deal that has been done between—




Senator Cormann:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Collins is misleading the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  She is misleading the chamber, because Mr Gray actually said that the government should act now, without delay.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Cormann. Senator Collins has the call.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr President. You are right; there is no point of order. But, if Senator Cormann is getting excited about representations of Mr Gray, let him get excited about the nature of the hearings today. In 20 years in the Senate, I have never experienced a committee deliberation such as that which went before JSCEM today.


I hope that Senator Cormann is aware now that on several occasions senators have sought to have the relevant department appear and explain the decisions made in this bill. It is such a farce that, when we had the AEC this morning, they told us we needed to talk to the Department of Finance. The AEC told us, 'Senators need to talk to the Department of Finance.' But the committee that you control—the numbers that the government and the Greens control on the electoral matters committee—have now blocked that three times. Anyone listening to this debate needs to understand that this behaviour is unprecedented. Mr President, I am glad that you are here, because you can hear this. When a Senate committee looks at a matter, particularly a matter of legislation, the most routine element of any Senate inquiry is to have the department appear and explain to senators the thinking of the government on why it has proceeded in a particular way.


Given the very short time frame we had to look at submissions to this inquiry, I looked at roughly the first 16 that came in. A fair proportion of them said that the explanatory memorandum does not even explain why the government has taken the particular path it has taken. Let's understand what that path is, because Senator Cormann likes to misrepresent Mr Gray and others, and indeed the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. The government, the Greens and Senator Xenophon have chosen a path which is different to the path that was recommended by consensus by this committee. They have failed to explain that difference in the explanatory memorandum and they have blocked any attempt by senators to question the government on why they have chosen this particular path. It has been blocked three times now.


This is probably the best point in this discussion for me to highlight: I will move an amendment to this motion. That amendment is designed to ensure that we will have more time to deal with this matter more carefully. Any student of politics would understand that significant electoral reform—the most significant in 30 years—should involve appropriate scrutiny and consideration. That is what is not happening here.


Malcolm Turnbull might be keen to try to line up the ducks to rush to a double dissolution election, but that does not justify and it does not explain the lack of scrutiny—essentially, the violation of the rights of any senator in this chamber to look at a matter appropriately before we vote on it. As I said, in 20 years I have never seen a committee inquiry like this. Indeed, I understand that even when the Howard government had control in the Senate they did not deny a department providing evidence. This is the path that Senator Cormann does not understand. Maybe there is a bit of limitation in his experience as a senator when it comes to committee work in this place. For the government, through its numbers on this committee, to block the department from even appearing is farcical. It exposes what is really going on. Fortunately, Senator Cormann, either your stupidity or that of the chair of this committee or the other senators of this committee has exposed what is really happening here.


That is because the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill fails any sensible test of policymaking or indeed of parliamentary scrutiny. As you have seen already by Senator Cormann's conduct so far, the government likes to pretend that this legislation implements the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its interim report on the conduct of the 2013 federal election, which indeed focused on Senate voting. But this is not correct. Any cursory glance at the now more than 106 submissions in this matter highlights that this is not correct.


It also highlights my other point, which is that there has been no explanation for why this is so. The only thing that we can do here is surmise about what went on in the back room between the government, or the coalition, the Greens and Senator Xenophon. It is no wonder that a fair proportion—and I will come to this point if I have time later—of people watching this are asking: why have the Greens been so naive here? What is occurring with this bill with the complicity of the Greens is worse than anything that happened when John Howard had control of the Senate. Can they not see where this is taking us? It seems not.


The Liberal Party and fellow travellers such as Senator Xenophon and Senator Di Natale like to say that their deal implements the substance of the JSCEM recommendations. I have even heard them say that it implements 85 per cent of the recommendations.




Senator Cormann:
  Gary Gray said that.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Eighty-five per cent, he claims, are represented—and once again he is trying to hide behind Gary Gray. Now, you might try this sort of glib language, Senator Cormann, but it does not deny the facts. The facts are what we have had before us on this committee. The facts are that you will not even let the Department of Finance appear. It makes your arguments look ludicrous. The facts are that the most basic thing with a bill, which is its explanatory memorandum, does not explain why you have chosen not to fully implement those recommendations. Add to that that you also have commentators watching this debate and saying: 'We predict ultimately they will. We suspect that this was part of their original ambit, that the Greens naively just accepted it and that eventually the crossbenchers will force them to make those further concessions.' But on top of that the other witnesses today were saying, 'Oh, we just don't think they really know what they're doing here.'


Let me spend a few minutes highlighting some of the points that were made in today's hearing. I am sure we will get an opportunity to go back to them in the further debates on this matter. Let us have a look at what was highlighted in today's hearing in the very, very limited time available and, as I said, with the inability to even talk to the Department of Finance.


The AEC in their appearance confirmed that they require a minimum of three months to implement the changes. They need three months—and let me confirm this for every senator—after the bill passes, so a further three months. This is why the government were criticised, not by the AEC here but by other witnesses before the inquiry, for doing nothing for two years. They failed to act for two years. They were criticised for pushing through reform now in the way that they are currently proceeding. They were criticised for cherry picking recommendations which undermine their argument for urgently passing the legislation. They were criticised for not implementing the model that was recommended by JSCEM. Antony Green, for instance, confirmed that under this model the Greens would have lost a seat in South Australia at the last election and that the coalition winning a majority of seats would be more likely in a double dissolution.


Again, we are back to: why are we having this rush, and why is the Prime Minister being so reckless in proceeding this way? I know I have this debate from time to time with other senators about how reckless Mr Turnbull is, and I often like to remind senators of the experience we had with the Prime Minister when he was previously the Leader of the Opposition and his behaviour with Mr Godwin Grech. I had a fair mind at the start of his prime ministership to accept that he might have learnt through that process, but the way he is recklessly proceeding here highlights that he has not learnt. He has not learnt to allow appropriate scrutiny and to run his case for his policies. Instead, we see the government hiding.


We hear concerns that the legislation the government wants to put through this chamber will maximise the number of senators elected by the major parties, such as the Liberal Party, and established minor parties such as the Greens and the Nick Xenophon team. We hear that it will exhaust preferences early so Independents and so-called microparties are deprived of votes. Its object is to prevent new players from entering the Senate, thereby entrenching the electoral dominance of the existing players. The principal beneficiary of this new voting system will be the Liberal Party, which traditionally receives the highest primary vote, bolstered by its coalition partners, the Nationals.


The Greens need to think very carefully about what this means for the composition of the Senate, particularly over a couple of electoral cycles. The only reason the Liberal Party are pushing this bill is that they see it as the best chance of translating their high primary vote into lasting political dominance in the Senate and, over time, a Senate majority in their own right. Let me say that again to the Greens: think very carefully about what that will mean. We often hear from the Greens that they are concerned about gagging debate. I am pleased to see that the government has not been able to proceed this week in the way it originally highlighted, because it does give me an opportunity, again through the amendment I will move, to ensure that there is more time to carefully consider these matters.


As I indicated earlier, the last time the government had a Senate majority we ended up with Work Choices. Even back then the deals that were done about proper legislative scrutiny were more generous than what has happened with this electoral matters committee. Even the committee consideration of the Work Choices legislation—and we criticised that at the time—had the relevant department appear. We were critical about the amount of time involved for what was very complex, detailed and lengthy legislation but we at least had an opportunity to question the relevant department. 


On this occasion the committee has been nobbled in a way I have never seen before. Indeed, if my amendment today succeeds, we will have an opportunity to recall the committee, call the department before us and have the department explain to us the government's thinking behind the way it has chosen to proceed with this bill and to provide more information than what was put by the government in the explanatory memorandum, which left unexplained the important issues that people who made submissions to our inquiry have already highlighted.


It was impossible to establish an inquiry without the support of the coalition when the government had control of the Senate after the 2004 election. The government could pass draconian legislation and changes through regulation and the Senate had no ability to exercise its powers of disallowance. Do you want that? I say to Greens senators: do you want to go back to the budget before last, because that is what this legislation will deliver? It will deliver an environment where the Senate will have no control in the long term to be a brake on government excess and to ensure that draconian legislation does not simply get a quick tick—in this case, we are not even able to scrutinise the department—and measures, such as the budget before last, are allowed to succeed.


I would be surprised if that were really what the Greens want, but equally I have been surprised at their cooperation with the government on how this committee would proceed. I am glad Senator Rhiannon is here because I want to run through the detail of this. Mr President, perhaps the detail will assist your understanding here as well. When we made recommendations about having an inquiry the Labor Party, through the scrutiny of bills process, indicated that we should call the department. We were overruled. We then in the committee sought to ensure that we could call the department. The committee voted us down. 


The Greens were originally going to appear on today's program but then that changed, so I attended the next meeting when we were talking about the program. At that next meeting the chair was not even going to deal with the program. When I highlighted the point that the program was changing since now the Greens were not appearing and there would be more time so we could ask the department to appear, again I was simply ignored. Mr President, I know that you have worked in the role of Deputy President and Chairman of Committees and I know that you understand that this is not the way that committees should proceed, but this is how my rights as an individual senator and indeed as the opposition spokesperson on this matter have been dealt with on this occasion. I believe it is appalling. That is why I will be moving the amendment that has been circulated in my name to add at the end of the motion:


… ""but, may not be further proceeded with until 12 May 2016.""


In that motion I make the points I have already highlighted. There has not been proper consideration of this bill. We have the farcical example of the AEC saying to us, 'Senators, you would need to ask the department.' They came to us today unable to provide during this morning's hearing any detail about the government's rationale for proceeding the way they have with this bill. They were not able to apprise us as to why the explanatory memorandum did not explain the approach the government has taken in relation to below-the-line voting. They were not able to assist us to assess the submissions made to us by witnesses or people who provided submissions, highlighting that no-one can find that rationale. All they can find is glib statements by Senator Cormann—'This is what Gary Gray agreed to.' I am sorry, Senator Cormann, but the Labor Party have processes that determine what our party position is, and I represent that party position here. No glib references such as that can be used to apologise for your failure to make the policy case in relation to this legislation. This is, as was suggested before us today by one of the witnesses, a dirty deal. What we have before us is simply a dirty deal.


Let me see what else was said today. George Williams suggested that this is simply 'incoherent'. It is incoherent because the government are providing little information and no proper scrutiny. They should be ashamed of themselves. I move:


At the end of the motion, add, ""but, may not be further proceeded with until 12 May 2016.""

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2016-03-01,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:59):  I rise today to speak to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. In the public debate what has been put forward by the opposition—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Madigan, I point out that we are actually debating that this bill may now proceed without formalities—and you have used the correct title of the bill—and also now the amendment moved by Senator Collins to that motion. I am sure your subject material will be correct, but I want to make sure you are debating the right matter.




Senator MADIGAN:
  Following on, with the rhetoric, many of the points that Senator Collins made are quite pertinent to the subject. But last night, on the ABC's Q&A, the former Minister for Small Business in the government, Mr Billson, said: 'To see a person elected to the Australian Senate with 1,500 first preference votes that wouldn't even get you elected in a ward election in a local council, and then hold up the trajectory of the nation, make it impossible to hold governments to account for their promises and the commitments and the outcomes they deliver to our country—I think that's not good. Having people know where their vote's going—I think that is good. So I think there's a strong case for the reforms that are being put to the parliament.' I have listened to the government repeat this time and time again, and we have often heard references made to my fellow crossbench senators and Senator Muir in particular, who at the 2013 election received 479 first preference votes below the line.


But then you go and have a look at the frontbench of the government, and I go to look at how many first preference votes Senator Cash received below the line in the 2013 election, and Senator Cash—the Minister for Women, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment—received 349 first preference votes below the line. Then we have Senator Edwards, who received 667 first preference votes below the line. Senator Fawcett received 1,602 first preference votes below the line. And, of course, Senator Lambie received 1,501 first preference votes below the line.


Of course, it is true that many Australians vote above the line, and they vote according to the voting ticket that their party puts forward, whether it be the government—the Liberal Party and the National Party—the ALP, the Greens or PUP—whoever. So the fact of the matter is that the majority of people put 1 above the line and they say to their party, 'You distribute our vote according to how you, the party, see it.' If any member of the public cares to go to the Australian Electoral Commission website prior to the election, they can look up how the party is directing their preferences.


But, of course, they do not want the public to actually know. This bill is about self-interest and it is about political opportunism. I am all for transparency so the public know where their votes are going, and I support that. I support educating the public to care how they vote and who they vote for, to actually look beyond the tag of whether you are the ALP, the Liberals, the Nationals or the Nick Xenophon party, and to look at the individual who you are voting for to see if their beliefs and their ethics conform with yours—it might be 70 per cent; it might be 100 per cent; it might be 65 per cent—so people understand how their vote works, because there is an incredible amount of ignorance, unfortunately, in the general community about how your votes work.


It is an interesting position that we have here. On the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters are the government, the ALP and the Greens. There are no voting members on that committee other than them. That is a fact. Predominantly, this committee is a House of Representatives committee. In the past, on the public record, former prime ministers of our nation have shown an utter contempt for the Senate and the way the Senate works. Unless the Senate votes the way a government of the day wants it to vote, some people refer to the Senate as swill. So I would say to members of the government in the Senate: be careful what you wish for.


Often we hear in this place about legislation being rammed through this place, and the fact of the matter is that, in the previous Rudd-Gillard governments, the ALP-Greens coalition, for want of a better word, rammed through legislation. At that time, the now government—the Liberal-National party—complained profusely about that. It was an abuse of the Senate process, with lack of scrutiny and lack of process. Now, when the boot is on the other foot, we hear it from the now opposition, the then government.


Some people suggest that it is an easy thing to get into the Senate by gaming it. The fact of the matter is that it is a vertical ski slope. For the incumbents—the cabal, as some people would say—it is all in their favour. The fact of the matter is that in 2013 there was $58,076,456 paid to political parties represented in the House of Representatives and the Senate. To receive funding from the public purse, you have to get four per cent or more of the vote. That already is a huge advantage to incumbency. But we do not hear about that.


So I would suggest to the government: the argument that you use about how many votes people got below the line does not cut the mustard, let alone when you look at how, with the retirement or resignation of people from the Senate, we find people who did not even run in the 2010 or 2013 election and who now occupy seats in this Senate. They never put their name on a ballot paper, but now they are here. Yet we hear arguments about what the people want. They often do not even go to the person who actually ran in those two previous elections and was the next person on the ticket, whether it was the government ticket—the Liberals or the Nationals—or the ALP or the Greens ticket. There are many people who end up occupying seats in this place who have never faced an election and never faced the people.


I say to Senator Dastyari: you did not run, and you will admit that. You were picked by the party to be here. I am not insinuating, Senator Dastyari, that you should not be here. That is the system that the incumbent government has made in this place. Here we are, 30 years on, and one of the biggest electoral changes that the nation has seen in three decades is being rushed through. You would want to be careful what you wish for here. If we accept the government's argument about how many votes people get below the line, it should ring alarm bells for the government. If that is going to be the yardstick, have a look at how many below-the-line first preference votes Senator Di Natale got. One does not have to look too far. At the 2010 election, he got 34,208 votes below the line, with the number 1 in the box next to Senator Di Natale's name. Then look at one of the better performers for the coalition: Senator Fierravanti-Wells. At the 2010 election, Senator Fierravanti-Wells got 12,194 first preference votes below the line. I have to say that she is, by far, one of the better performers in the coalition. Look at how many votes Senator Cormann, who has carriage of this bill, got below the line. He got 5,215 votes in the 2010 election—less than one-sixth of the votes that Senator Di Natale got. I say to the government: the argument that you are putting forward about below-the-line votes does not cut the mustard. In the paper, you attack other people for their low vote. You want to take another look. Senator Bernardi, who is often attacked in this place for his views and for how outspoken he is, got 5,554 votes at the last election, in 2013. Senator Birmingham, who is the Minister for Education and Training, got 1,013 votes. He got fewer votes than I did, and yet he is a minister. But I am not calling into question the fact that he can be a minister.


There is a narrative about there being a problem. Should we have more scrutiny? Yes, we should have more scrutiny. But the government wants to think about what it is doing here. I caution the government: it is not going to ultimately turn out the way you think. You are playing into the hands of the Greens and other people. One thing the ALP has always said in the House of Representatives is 'one vote, one value'. I refer you to the Constitution, which talks about senators being elected by the people to the Senate to represent their states. That is what it says. That is not what I think it says; that is what it actually says. But, in our current system, if you vote 1 above the line for your first preference, you allocate how your vote is going to be distributed to that party above the line, whether it is the ALP, the government, the Greens, PUP, an Independent, a small or minor party or whoever. If you vote 1 above the line, they all distribute your vote according to how they see fit. That is a fact. 


For 32 years—I think it was in 1984 that the system came into play—all the parties were part of putting this current system in place. I say to all of you in this place: for many years, this system has served you. Prior to an election, you all go around to small and minor parties, Independents and any other person who has nominated to run for the Senate, put up their $2,000 nomination fee—or whatever it is—and met all the requirements of the AEC. The fact of the matter is they have not broken the law. There are backroom deals and preference deals done by all parties and individuals represented in this place in some way, shape or form. The fact of the matter is that the people who choose not to vote for the ALP, the Greens, the Nationals or the Liberals are entitled to have a voice. They are entitled to have their vote represented. If somebody chooses to say, 'I agree with one individual more than with another individual. I'm going to give my preferences to that person,' then that is their right to do so. Of people who vote in the Senate, a large proportion chooses to vote below the line. The Liberals might have their first candidate in Victoria being whomever it may be, but the voter might say: 'Well, I don't particularly like that bloke or that woman. I'm going for the person who is No. 6 on the Liberal list, and then I'm going to go to the candidate who's No. 2 on the ALP list, because I concur with their beliefs more than I do with the other five on the Liberal ticket,' or vice versa. It is people's right to do that. Many Australians take up the option to do that. The vast majority of Australians just give it to the party to decide.


But to tell me that people care what the voting public thinks is disingenuous. The fact of the matter is that this is purely about self-interest. It is purely about political opportunism. The selective moral outrage and the toxic sanctimony of the Greens on this issue is just breathtaking. The government have jumped into bed with them. Ultimately they will rue the day that they went along with this.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:15):  I rise to speak on the motion and on the amendment put by my colleague Senator Collins regarding the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. To say that the level of scrutiny that has been given to this bill is farcical is actually something of an understatement. I would like to say at the outset that I support and concur with the contribution by Senator Collins here today about the level of scrutiny and the farcical situation that has been undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on this bill.


We had the inquiry—if you want to call it an inquiry—on this bill this morning. This morning's hearing was, as Senator Collins said, unlike any other inquiry that we have been involved in. We had the farcical situation where questions were put to the AEC that they were unable to answer. Their answer was, 'You need to talk to the department.' Senator Collins has already outlined to the Senate and those listening to this debate the length to which Labor senators went to request the department—it was not an outrageous or unusual request—come to answer questions. But that request was shut down and, in many respects, not even responded to by the chair of the committee. Of course, the coalition and Greens members on the committee chose to not allow the department to come to answer very significant questions on this bill.


The other point that needs to be made on the inquiry that we just had is to do with questions that were taken on notice. Again, there was not even a procedure put in place by the chair of the committee as to when questions on notice should come back to the committee. Questions on notice are a normal process in Senate committees, both legislation and references committees. They are just part of the normal work of a committee. But at this inquiry there was not even an attempt to have questions on notice responded to. We have been told that we may get those responses in time for an 8 am meeting tomorrow to consider the draft report into this piece of legislation.


When Senator Collins talked about the need for greater scrutiny of this bill, she also meant actual scrutiny. It is not good enough to point to a JSCEM report on the 2013 election because what we have before us here is not what was recommended. It has cherry picked parts out of that report on the 2013 federal election. A deal has been done between the coalition and the Greens in this place on what they would like to see. It is not about allowing the Senate and the public to have a greater understanding of what is actually being put before us in this piece of legislation. It is not about that. They can pretend it is about that, but the inquiry clearly showed, I believe, that that is not what it is about. They have cherry picked parts of it. They have put in a section about logos that was not even recommended in the JSCEM report. I do not know who brought that up. It might have been in a discussion between the Liberal Party secretariat, the National Party secretariat and the Prime Minister's office. That is in there, but it was not recommended. Even today when questions were asked about that, primarily by the coalition senators, there were not any details around how that might work. There was nothing at all. So this has been a complete subversion of the Senate process, and it undermines the role of the Senate in this place.


In recent months many of us on this side of the chamber have pointed out that changing the leader of the Liberal Party has actually changed nothing. The conservative and self-interested policies of the Abbott government continue under the Turnbull government. In contrast, we can look at the Australian Greens and see just how much can change with a change of leadership. It was a party that under former Senator Bob Brown and former Senator Milne on many occasions made grand speeches about the importance of Senate oversight and proper consideration. Now, under Senator Di Natale or, in this case, Senator Rhiannon, we know that the Australian Greens have no respect for the role of this place. They have no respect for the processes that we have. 


What we are seeing now is a deal that has clearly been cooked up over months. It is not something that has been neatly settled in the last couple of weeks. Behind closed doors, with no transparency, it has been cooked up to benefit the Greens and the coalition. It is a deal that has been cooked up to subvert the Senate processes and give the Turnbull government the quick out it wants for a double dissolution election.


This is not about the need for urgent reform. If it were, the government would have brought a bill before this place sometime in the last two years. This is not about the procedures we have in this place. Make no mistake: this is not about reform or democracy. Ramming this bill through parliament is about political expedience. This is about what is politically convenient for the Liberals and the Greens. I would throw in the Nats, but I think they just go along with anything. It is most definitely not about the role of this place as a house of review.


The role of the Senate as house of review is to be able to go to the electorate and talk about legislation and to come back better informed, with amendments and with a government that is able to take them into account. None of that is happening here. This is just a directive from the Prime Minister's office which says, 'Clear the slate on Thursday night or Friday and get us out of here so that we can get ready for an election.'


These are not my words but rather the words of the former leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown. They are words he spoke in this place in defence of the Senate—words which have very real meaning in this place today. However, these words obviously do not have any meaning to the Australian Greens we now have under the leadership of Senator Di Natale and Senator Rhiannon. They have similarly forgotten the words of their last leader, former Senator Christine Milne, who said in this place:


The Australian people deserve a house of review. A house of review means appropriate scrutiny of legislation and appropriate scrutiny of governments. You achieve that through estimates committees, through Senate references committees and through Senate legislation committees.


Again, this is a lesson that has been lost on the Greens who now sit in this place.


Anyone who has been following this farce of a process would also know that the bill that was presented in the House of Representatives has already been amended by the government. So quick were they in their haste to get this dirty deal out of the back room and onto the table of the House of Representatives that they have already had to amend it. And it appears that the AEC, from what I can gather from their evidence, have not really had much to do with drafting this legislation. By the time the government ram it through the Senate here, who knows how much will have already been amended.


This is the problem. There has been no scrutiny and no transparency. There has been a deal cooked up by the coalition and the Greens and it is already starting to unravel by way of the fact that it needs amendments. This has not been done properly. There has been no scrutiny and there has been no regard whatsoever for the Australian community. The government have not gone out to talk about it in the community. The Greens have not gone out to talk about it. No-one has even bothered to put up a semblance of pretence that there is going to be proper scrutiny.


As I have said a number of times here, because it needs to be said often and loudly, the Greens have stitched up a deal with the Liberal government to avoid proper scrutiny of the most significant changes to our democratic process in 30 years. This is not about what is best for our democracy. In fact, we cannot even say what is best for our democracy or what the true impact of the proposal being brought before us is, because the government refuse to allow us the time to scrutinise this proposed legislation. They have done the deal with the Greens and Senator Xenophon. It is a deal that will see this legislation rammed through this place with only a pretence of consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That has played out. That is the reality. That is what we saw this morning.


Our colleagues in the other place were forced to vote on the bill before they even saw the outcome of the sham hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. They were not even allowed the time to read the joint standing committee report before they actually had to vote on this proposed legislation—which, as I have said, is the most significant change to our democratic process in over 30 years. The government and the Greens have seen fit to give the appearance of allowing senators an opportunity to consider the bill and the evidence of the hearing that was held this morning. It was, I think, 3½ hours of a farcical meeting with rotating questions. It was a hearing at which members of the committee had just 3½ hours. The most important part of what happened this morning is the fact that the government—and the committee chair, along with the other coalition and Greens members—would not allow the appropriate departments to come and give evidence. Those questions that committee members wanted to ask were not able to be asked. Some of the questions were asked of the AEC, as I have said, but they did not have the information to be able to answer those questions. They referred them and told us that it would be a matter for the finance committee.


If we hear the minister that is responsible for this legislation get up to say, 'We have had the JSCEM report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 election and we have had an inquiry into the legislation before us now,' it is just a farce. People who are listening to this debate should know that it is a complete and utter farce and that the process the government has set out has been explicitly designed to control the debate, to shut down the debate and to ensure scrutiny is at a minimum.


This bill cherry picks elements of the recommendations made in the JSCEM report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 election. But we are not going to have an opportunity to really examine the implications of this bill. If we are all honest with ourselves, we cannot say that we are surprised by the actions of the government. In the last two years, we have seen their complete contempt for the Senate. This government have shown themselves to be completely unable to manage their legislative agenda. They have shown themselves to be completely unable to negotiate. They have shown themselves to be completely unable to prosecute an argument for the changes they have sought to make—which is no shock, given the changes they have sought. They have shown themselves as having complete contempt for the Senate, its role and its procedures.


 For a moment, I was surprised by the Greens—and Senator Xenophon—being complicit in this, until I remembered the Greens track record when it comes to negotiating with the government. And I remembered that, to put it simply, the Greens are not very good at making deals: their bargaining powers have already been found wanting. We saw this when they made a deal with the government on multinational tax transparency. We had the numbers on this issue—we could have got a better deal on tax transparency—but the Greens folded. They folded and let 500 companies off the hook. And yet again we have seen the Greens roll over to have their tummies scratched by the Liberal government.


I am sure many members of the Australian Greens are wondering when their party became opposed to open and transparent debate. Their own members would be asking when this became a bad thing. Given the Greens record under the leadership of Senator Di Natale, you would think that they would be getting better at cutting deals with the Liberal government. It is something we have seen them doing a lot. As I just outlined, the Greens voted with the government to let big companies keep secret how much tax they pay. They voted to defeat Labor amendments requiring large private companies making more than $100 million in profits to publicly disclose how much tax they pay. But this is just the start. 


The Greens also voted with the government in the Senate to cut age pensions by $2.4 billion. They actually voted to pass Mr Abbott's and Mr Hockey's budget measures to cut the age pension to 330,000 elderly Australians. Senator Di Natale's Greens voted with the Liberals to erect new barriers against investment by reducing Foreign Investment Review Board screening thresholds for proposed investments in agriculture and agribusiness. They voted for legislation allowing the health minister to make multimillion dollar medical research funding decisions without following the recommendations of the independent expert advisory body. And the list goes on. Now the Greens have done a dud deal, behind closed doors, with the government to change the Senate voting system. It is a deal that will disenfranchise voters. Some people have estimated that three million Australians vote for parties other than the coalition, Labor and the Greens. This deal is all to help the government call an early double dissolution election.


All of this is not to say that there are not issues with our current electoral system, issues that do need to be addressed. But they should not be addressed in this way, through a piece of legislation that has been rammed through the House of Representatives, that has been rammed through a quick and dirty inquiry this morning, prior to the JSCEM delivering its report, only to see it come into the Senate to again be rammed through. There is no transparency; there is no concern about going out to the community to ask their view. This is about the Greens and the government doing a deal with no concern or care for Australian democracy. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (13:35):  I too rise to put on the record my remarks on what is, in my view, a mistitled piece of legislation before the chamber this morning—the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016—which would be better called the 'dirty deal between the Liberals and the Greens party bill', because that is what is really being discussed here this morning.


For those in this country who live great lives and do not pay 100 per cent attention to the way the Senate works and the way Senate inquiries work, it is important to put some context around what is going on here. To give an example, one of the committees I sit on is the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. We are inquiring into loans that have been impaired, which means that the banks have taken over loans and people have lost their property. That is a very important issue, and we are taking it very seriously. We have had to my knowledge at least six or seven—it is probably more—whole-day hearings that have been held around the country to give Australians the chance to put on the record important matters that relate to loans and banks. That is an important matter but, by comparison to the matter that is being pushed through the Senate right now, that simply pales into insignificance. What is being pushed through this chamber is a deal between the Greens and the Liberals—and it is epitomised by a deep and meaningful conversation going on between the Liberal Minister for Finance and the person who is leading the discussion for the Greens, Senator Rhiannon. The dealing is going on as we speak.


What I really want people to understand is that the reality of that sort of conversation that is going on means that there is going to be no set of six or 10 hearings around this matter which is, as Senator Brown has said, the biggest change that has happened to the way Australians vote in 30 years. Let us get some perspective here: the biggest change in 30 years about the way Australians are going to vote without any proper inquiry or proper process—it is not even good enough to get a hearing in every state or capital city. Let's just push it through and have a pretend game of an inquiry—that is what has happened today in this building. Today democracy got dudded in this building by the coalition government in cahoots with the Greens—they did a deal and they held the most embarrassing sham of an inquiry this morning. On that committee Labor was represented very ably by Senator Conroy, Senator Jacinta Collins and Senator Brown, but they were subjected to the chairing of Mr Coleman. A number members from the Liberals and Greens were also there, as were a few independents who tried to put their views, but the committee was dominated by Liberals and Greens. Mr Coleman as chair used all his excellent skills in trying to keep the debate civil, but the reality was that it started at 8.15 and it finished at 12 o'clock.




Senator Rhiannon:
  Your people ran out of questions!




Senator O'NEILL:
  For most people working around the country that would not even constitute half a day's good work. These guys have decided in the space of less than four hours that they had enough evidence to push through this shameful deal. That is what they have done. It is a disgrace; it is a disgrace that it has happened in this country; it is a disgrace it has happened in this building; and it is a disgrace that they think that sham of performance this morning will constitute anything other than the abuse of the Senate's authority in a most shameful way. It is contemptuous of a proper, robust and transparent inquiry into this most significant piece of legislation.


It is not only the Labor Party which should be upset about this; experts who have long-held and critical views on these matters are absolutely outraged by what is being attempted here. I was very honoured to meet Malcolm Mackerras. I only joined the Labor Party 19 years ago, when I was pregnant with my third child and I was a teacher; I was not a political staffer and I did not know until I got here that it was Malcolm Mackerras who created the horseshoe shaped graph of seats. This is what Malcolm Mackerras, who has had a long and distinguished career as a psephologist, had to say: 'It is not about fairness what is going on here. It is about the reshaping of our party system. South Australia is to have a four-party system, Liberal on the right, Xenophon in the centre and Labor and Greens on the left. The rest of Australia is to have a three-party system—coalition, Labor and Greens. There will be no independent senators, unless Jacqui Lambie can get a short-term at a 2016 double dissolution election. There will be only one benefit for the voters: the ballot paper will be smaller.' That is what Mr Mackerras said.


The Greens are always on about the environment and perhaps their great political goal is to shrink the voting paper for the Senate. They have become the Green political party. Whatever the perception might be out there that the Greens are the cuddly, generous ones, this deal absolutely seals forever that possible view of the world. The Greens are a political party who are seeking to advantage themselves in the most shameful way through what they are undertaking right here in this chamber. They have the hide to call it reform. 'Reform'—there is an abuse of a word if ever there was one in this context. Unlike the Greens and the Liberals, the Labor Party does not believe that putting a sticker that reads 'Reform' on a piece of legislation actually constitutes reform. It is deeply concerning to see the Liberals and the Greens announce a deal that will favour the Green politicians and Liberal politicians, and that is not in the interests of ordinary Australians.


Twenty-five per cent of Australians voted—not for Labor, not for Greens, not for the Liberal Party, not for the national party—for those ordinary Australians who we see here in this chamber. These are people who have been maligned and who have had to suffer the slings and arrows of considerable contempt on their arrival into this place. I think of each one of those senators as valued colleagues who have a right to be here. It is not that I agree with their philosophy or their views on many issues, but they got here by being elected by a system that enabled a range of different views to come into this place. I note the entry into this chamber of Senator Bob Day. Senator Day has not voted with Labor on many occasions, but I do appreciate his support for a particular motion that I put forward to call the government towards some transparency in a deal they did with the ATO in Gosford. I acknowledge that and thank Senator Day for his support. If we counted his votes, I would say he has voted with the Liberal Party an awful lot more often than he has voted with the Labor Party. But he got here legitimately. He got here in a system that this government is seeking to reform, to change in a most significant way after 30 years—and they want to change it without proper scrutiny, without proper care for the impacts, without careful consideration of unintended consequences. They just want to ram it through.


It is true that more than three million Australians exercised their vote by voting for a party other than one of the major parties. Three million people chose candidates carefully—or perhaps without too much care, but of course in the case of Senator Day he is saying it was a very careful choice—and voted for candidates from other than the main parties. It hardly seems fair, when we have that result that indicates what Australians think at this time, that this piece of legislation is being pushed through. Certainly I do not think we can call it reform if you leave out three million people whose intentions were pretty clear, if you construct a way of voting that excludes them from revealing that perspective once again. 


Imagine for a minute if the Liberals had with Tony Abbott what they are seeking now with Malcolm Turnbull. This Senate would have been unable to prevent the worst excesses of a government that will go down in history as a shameful government that attacked very fundamental elements of Australia's health and education systems. If the Independents had not been elected we would by now have had our students in tertiary institutions paying $100,000 for a degree. We would have seen the cuts that they had tried to inflict on Medicare come into being and there would be a $7 co-payment. I notice there is a family sitting in the gallery. I am sure that mums and dads out there, like me, with a few children, find that when you get one child with an ear infection you get three children with an ear infection. When you need to get your child to the doctor to prevent illness or complications—and ear infections can turn into deafness—you need to take your Medicare card and know that you are going to get the service that you want, not take your credit card and hope to god you can afford to pay for the care you need for your child. 


That is what would have been the reality in Australia today if the people opposite had got their way and got their bill through the Senate. But they did not, because Labor stood firm against it and, in a moment of conscience, the Greens came with us some of the time and also there were the Independents, who saw the unfairness of this government particularly in the 2014 budget. They stood up and they were counted. No amount of wiping them off the ballot paper is going to undo the good work that this Senate did in preventing Mr Abbott from doing what he wanted to do to the fabric of our society. If what they are doing now had already been achieved, we would have seen further cuts to family payments. Reform is important but reform that entrenches the right wing of the Liberal Party and reform that entrenches control of the balance of power in the Greens party, who want to legalise ice—that is one of their policies—is not in the interests of the ordinary people of this country. This bill was brought into the parliament by the Greens to reflect the deal that they have done with the Liberals. It does not even reflect the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. If it was in any way significantly the same as that, it might have some validity, but they have ignored that and they have just come up with their own little way of maximising the vote for themselves. It is a greedy power grab.


What we are seeing is a very concerning push for this big change—the biggest since 1984—where people will be encouraged to vote one to six across the top of the ballot paper and the government will be able to enact this very promptly and then get a double dissolution. Labor's concern arising from that and other changes—Senator Dastyari made this point very clearly as early as last week—is that one of the flow-on effects is that there is an informal vote likely when you make this sort of change. We are changing something for an entire country; we are changing what people do when they go in to vote. And we are doing this in the blink of an eye, or as quickly as a dirty deal signed in blood between the Greens and the Liberal government can be delivered. They are seeking this corruption of Australia's democratic processes as fast as possible. It is easy to be sceptical when the Liberals and the Greens hope that this produces more senators of their persuasion. 


It is also very interesting that the Greens party have decided that they are the best minor party in the land—better than anybody else. The Greens have decided that they do not want anybody else to represent an alternative view in this chamber other than them. That is a pretty big call, and that is what the deal is about—it is about getting more Greens in this little bit over here so that they can have a say without all these separate voices, all these different voices that have characterised this Senate. The Greens should be out telling their supporters about what they have done here. They should be confessing to the fact that they have done a dirty deal and given the Liberal Party the permanent blocking vote of a majority in the Senate, that they have handed Australia over to the right wing without critique. As I have said, Senator Day has voted with the right wing more often than not but even he is disgusted by what they are attempting. What they are doing to our nation today shows breathtaking arrogance. 


The Greens have sacrificed all principle and all policy to ensure that they and the Liberal Party together can block a progressive agenda in the future. You wonder how they could do this when you look at some of the things done not just by Mr Abbott but by Mr Turnbull. If they deliver this and he remains Prime Minister he will have control of the Senate and control of the House of Representatives. Who is this Mr Turnbull? Let us have a look.


Mr Turnbull and Julie Bishop conspired to assassinate the Prime Minister. After that departure of Mr Abbott, they delivered a profoundly dysfunctional and divided government. It is constantly contradicting itself, backflipping on one decision and the other. It is a disaster, frankly. We can see that. Mr Turnbull was once full of hope, but now all people hear is the waffle of his words. He backed in the cuts that they made to health and education when he was a cabinet minister. He backed them in again in his mini-budget in December. If he gets the chance, he will back them in again in another budget in May. If he gets elected, God help Australia because we will no longer have a Medicare card that works. We will no longer have schools where any child from any background can go and be assured they will get a good education, because this Senate, reconstructed by this deal between the Liberals and the Greens, will make that impossible to achieve. They will be able to do whatever they want. That is why Labor will fight so hard to give people an alternative. People know what Labor stands for. They can trust the party that instituted Medicare—the Labor Party—to fight to keep it.


It was Mr Turnbull, doing this deal with Ms Bishop, who created an incredible contrast to the way in which the government operated before. Mr Turnbull is a pretty good master of saying one thing and doing another. It is a mighty leap of faith to believe that he will not use the same hand-over-fist tactics while he is dealing with the Greens. On the environment, which is an issue that is supposedly close to the Greens' heart, as Leader of the Opposition Mr Turnbull said, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.' Since becoming the Prime Minister, he has gone weak at the knees about climate change, and there is a very real risk that a re-elected coalition government will pass legislation previously rejected by the Senate, including Tony Abbott's bill abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Remember that blue booklet that everybody got? I found the Liberal Party's Real solutions for all Australians statement of 2013 littered everywhere when I was door-knocking in the lead-up to the last election. It said:


We will improve rewards from working, reduce cost-of-living pressure and help families with the real costs of raising children.


But their words mean nothing because people are not reaping the rewards of working. Wages are not increasing, growth is slowing and unemployment is rising. Mr Turnbull put his name to all of the cuts that Mr Abbott made in the community and he is still after Medicare. This is a shameful deal between the Greens and the Liberal Party, who are in cahoots to take away— (Time expired)

Senator RHIANNON:
  I acknowledge all the interjections. Please put more of them on the Hansard. It illustrates the desperation. They are trying to defend the indefensible because they are bankrupt. What they are trying to defend are the backroom deals. How far they have gone to try and discredit a very useful inquiry that we had today. One of the things they are saying is that there was not enough time. Senator Conroy, who asked 99 per cent of the questions for Labor—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I am happy to take the interjections, but Senator Conroy handed his time over to senators from other parties because he ran out of questions. So, for all the complaints, that is what went on. Useful evidence was given by the Australian Electoral Commission, by experts like Antony Green and Professor Williams, and by political parties. The solid work to help inform us was done. There were some very useful comments about below-the-line voting and a real commitment by people to work through how we ensure that it is voters who decide their preferences. There was much discussion about how ordinary people should play a part in parliament and in the electoral process. I believe that the Senate voting reform proposals before us, when we get to the bill, provide that opportunity. Above-the-line voting will require at least six boxes to be ticked. People will be ticking more than just major parties when they come to allocate their preferences, and therefore we can keep that very important aspect of emerging parties and smaller parties being elected to this parliament.


There was incredible misinformation from some of the earlier speakers in this debate to misrepresent this inquiry, which went to considerable lengths. One hundred and seven submissions were received, Senator Polley and Senator Dastyari, which set out some very real, useful information on how—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Senator Dastyari is bankrupt to the point where he says, 'You can't even say it's real.' It was a very useful inquiry; 107 submissions being made to an inquiry is impressive, with by far the majority of those submissions setting out support for Senate voting reform.


Let us remind Labor colleagues that this is building on the work that they participated in—because these days we are not sure which Labor we are dealing with in this debate. Are we dealing with the Labor of Senator Conroy, who just about froths at the mouth when he talks about this issue? Or are we dealing with the Labor of Jennie George and Gary Gray, who continue to have a balanced, responsible and democratic approach to this issue of Senate voting reform? Labor is split, and that was reflected today when Senator Conroy himself had to do the heavy lifting, getting very little support from any of his colleagues; now the message they have brought in here has been deceptive to their own colleagues.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Senator Conroy, it is good you have joined us! I have just informed the Senate, Senator Conroy, of how you ran out of questions today at the committee inquiry and you had to give over your time to the other senators. It really does speak volumes. It really speaks volumes when Senator Conroy himself runs out of questions on such an important issue as Senate voting reform. He is the warrior for the Labor Party on this issue and he loses the argument. (Time expired)

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:32):  I will start off where I finished last night, talking about some of the concerns around the process being used to ram this legislation through. We saw the first result of the way this legislation has been dealt with when, the day after introducing the bill to the House, the government was forced to essentially rewrite the bill and move a number of amendments to fix a mistake. Only having been in the Senate for a year, I am not sure how standard the practice is to move amendments quite so quickly after a bill is introduced—that is, the next day—as the bill is being debated. From my understanding, it was that the government drafters must have read that ABC's Antony Green's blog where these errors were pointed out.


One of the amendments was to ensure that the votes were able to be counted. That is the result of the speed with which this electoral bill has been brought forward and the mistakes that have been made were clear on day one. The scrutiny of this bill has now been completed through the 4½-hour hearing this morning. I am not sure whether the committee is going to have the time to work through all of the submissions. I have seen a number that raise concerns and that identify other mistakes in this bill.


It seems incredible to me that we are in this situation where we are dealing with significant reform, the most major reform in 30 years, and the way the legislation was concocted. It was written with Senator Di Natale, Senator Xenophon and the Prime Minister sitting together, working out a deal that would in the long term be beneficial for all of them. The scrutiny allowed has been so limited.


We heard concerns from witnesses during the hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters this morning. I have not caught all of today's hearings but I did see a number of people come before the committee this morning and raise concerns. I did manage to hear some of Mr Malcolm Mackerras's evidence before the committee. He raised some substantial concerns. His language was very strong in the evidence that he gave. He had concerns that predated this bill but he also had concerns on this bill. I am not an expert so I do not understand whether there is any merit to Mr Mackerras's arguments but the whole point of having a committee process is to be able to draw those out, consider them, take advice from others and work out whether or not it will have the impact that Mr Mackerras is alleging it will.


I have two major concerns that I will cover off today. The first one is around the process and the urgency. What is it that the Greens political party get out of this in the longer term? It looks to me like the short-term result of this will be the potential loss of a couple of senators. Why the sham process? Who does that benefit? Is it going to benefit democracy in the long run?


Will it ensure that Australians who vote in the upcoming election—whether it be a double dissolution election or a general election—will actually have their vote counted? Or will it mean that there will be millions of Australians who cast a vote and are going to be disenfranchised by the system that is being put in place in this deal by the coalition and the Greens? Those are the two reasons I do not support the way that this electoral bill has been dealt with. It is why the Labor party will continue to argue against it as it proceeds through the Senate.


The legislation is worthy of much greater scrutiny; a longer time frame and extended reporting date; the ability for people who want to provide submissions to provide those submissions; and for individuals or other political parties that might want to contest the next election to be given the opportunity and the time to appear and give evidence on their positions to the joint standing committee. When that joint standing committee process has had a reasonable time to consider the bill, to consult and to consider their report, that report should then be tabled and again people will have time to respond. That is the normal process that we have in this place for dealing with bills. This bill is significant and it is worthy of that level of scrutiny.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. I am pleased to be able to follow Senator Gallagher, who was reminding us of several of the points that were raised last night in this debate. Of course, since that time we have also had the farcical meeting of the JSCEM committee. I will have an opportunity to reflect on some of those processes. I am pleased, Mr President, that you are in the chair at the moment and that Senator Cormann is representing the government in the chamber at the moment, because I have very serious concerns about how this legislation has progressed. That is not just as the senator representing the Special Minister of State in the Senate but also as an individual senator.




Senator Cormann:
  That would be Gary Gray, who actually agrees with this!



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Cormann likes to say that Mr Gray agrees with this.




Senator Cormann:
  He does!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  What we all agree with, Senator Cormann, is that this is a matter that needs to be addressed carefully and with due consideration. However, what is occurring here is a railroad. It is a railroad of a deal that has been done between—




Senator Cormann:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Collins is misleading the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  She is misleading the chamber, because Mr Gray actually said that the government should act now, without delay.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Cormann. Senator Collins has the call.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr President. You are right; there is no point of order. But, if Senator Cormann is getting excited about representations of Mr Gray, let him get excited about the nature of the hearings today. In 20 years in the Senate, I have never experienced a committee deliberation such as that which went before JSCEM today.


I hope that Senator Cormann is aware now that on several occasions senators have sought to have the relevant department appear and explain the decisions made in this bill. It is such a farce that, when we had the AEC this morning, they told us we needed to talk to the Department of Finance. The AEC told us, 'Senators need to talk to the Department of Finance.' But the committee that you control—the numbers that the government and the Greens control on the electoral matters committee—have now blocked that three times. Anyone listening to this debate needs to understand that this behaviour is unprecedented. Mr President, I am glad that you are here, because you can hear this. When a Senate committee looks at a matter, particularly a matter of legislation, the most routine element of any Senate inquiry is to have the department appear and explain to senators the thinking of the government on why it has proceeded in a particular way.


Given the very short time frame we had to look at submissions to this inquiry, I looked at roughly the first 16 that came in. A fair proportion of them said that the explanatory memorandum does not even explain why the government has taken the particular path it has taken. Let's understand what that path is, because Senator Cormann likes to misrepresent Mr Gray and others, and indeed the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. The government, the Greens and Senator Xenophon have chosen a path which is different to the path that was recommended by consensus by this committee. They have failed to explain that difference in the explanatory memorandum and they have blocked any attempt by senators to question the government on why they have chosen this particular path. It has been blocked three times now.


This is probably the best point in this discussion for me to highlight: I will move an amendment to this motion. That amendment is designed to ensure that we will have more time to deal with this matter more carefully. Any student of politics would understand that significant electoral reform—the most significant in 30 years—should involve appropriate scrutiny and consideration. That is what is not happening here.


Malcolm Turnbull might be keen to try to line up the ducks to rush to a double dissolution election, but that does not justify and it does not explain the lack of scrutiny—essentially, the violation of the rights of any senator in this chamber to look at a matter appropriately before we vote on it. As I said, in 20 years I have never seen a committee inquiry like this. Indeed, I understand that even when the Howard government had control in the Senate they did not deny a department providing evidence. This is the path that Senator Cormann does not understand. Maybe there is a bit of limitation in his experience as a senator when it comes to committee work in this place. For the government, through its numbers on this committee, to block the department from even appearing is farcical. It exposes what is really going on. Fortunately, Senator Cormann, either your stupidity or that of the chair of this committee or the other senators of this committee has exposed what is really happening here.


That is because the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill fails any sensible test of policymaking or indeed of parliamentary scrutiny. As you have seen already by Senator Cormann's conduct so far, the government likes to pretend that this legislation implements the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its interim report on the conduct of the 2013 federal election, which indeed focused on Senate voting. But this is not correct. Any cursory glance at the now more than 106 submissions in this matter highlights that this is not correct.


It also highlights my other point, which is that there has been no explanation for why this is so. The only thing that we can do here is surmise about what went on in the back room between the government, or the coalition, the Greens and Senator Xenophon. It is no wonder that a fair proportion—and I will come to this point if I have time later—of people watching this are asking: why have the Greens been so naive here? What is occurring with this bill with the complicity of the Greens is worse than anything that happened when John Howard had control of the Senate. Can they not see where this is taking us? It seems not.


The Liberal Party and fellow travellers such as Senator Xenophon and Senator Di Natale like to say that their deal implements the substance of the JSCEM recommendations. I have even heard them say that it implements 85 per cent of the recommendations.




Senator Cormann:
  Gary Gray said that.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Eighty-five per cent, he claims, are represented—and once again he is trying to hide behind Gary Gray. Now, you might try this sort of glib language, Senator Cormann, but it does not deny the facts. The facts are what we have had before us on this committee. The facts are that you will not even let the Department of Finance appear. It makes your arguments look ludicrous. The facts are that the most basic thing with a bill, which is its explanatory memorandum, does not explain why you have chosen not to fully implement those recommendations. Add to that that you also have commentators watching this debate and saying: 'We predict ultimately they will. We suspect that this was part of their original ambit, that the Greens naively just accepted it and that eventually the crossbenchers will force them to make those further concessions.' But on top of that the other witnesses today were saying, 'Oh, we just don't think they really know what they're doing here.'


Let me spend a few minutes highlighting some of the points that were made in today's hearing. I am sure we will get an opportunity to go back to them in the further debates on this matter. Let us have a look at what was highlighted in today's hearing in the very, very limited time available and, as I said, with the inability to even talk to the Department of Finance.


The AEC in their appearance confirmed that they require a minimum of three months to implement the changes. They need three months—and let me confirm this for every senator—after the bill passes, so a further three months. This is why the government were criticised, not by the AEC here but by other witnesses before the inquiry, for doing nothing for two years. They failed to act for two years. They were criticised for pushing through reform now in the way that they are currently proceeding. They were criticised for cherry picking recommendations which undermine their argument for urgently passing the legislation. They were criticised for not implementing the model that was recommended by JSCEM. Antony Green, for instance, confirmed that under this model the Greens would have lost a seat in South Australia at the last election and that the coalition winning a majority of seats would be more likely in a double dissolution.


Again, we are back to: why are we having this rush, and why is the Prime Minister being so reckless in proceeding this way? I know I have this debate from time to time with other senators about how reckless Mr Turnbull is, and I often like to remind senators of the experience we had with the Prime Minister when he was previously the Leader of the Opposition and his behaviour with Mr Godwin Grech. I had a fair mind at the start of his prime ministership to accept that he might have learnt through that process, but the way he is recklessly proceeding here highlights that he has not learnt. He has not learnt to allow appropriate scrutiny and to run his case for his policies. Instead, we see the government hiding.


We hear concerns that the legislation the government wants to put through this chamber will maximise the number of senators elected by the major parties, such as the Liberal Party, and established minor parties such as the Greens and the Nick Xenophon team. We hear that it will exhaust preferences early so Independents and so-called microparties are deprived of votes. Its object is to prevent new players from entering the Senate, thereby entrenching the electoral dominance of the existing players. The principal beneficiary of this new voting system will be the Liberal Party, which traditionally receives the highest primary vote, bolstered by its coalition partners, the Nationals.


The Greens need to think very carefully about what this means for the composition of the Senate, particularly over a couple of electoral cycles. The only reason the Liberal Party are pushing this bill is that they see it as the best chance of translating their high primary vote into lasting political dominance in the Senate and, over time, a Senate majority in their own right. Let me say that again to the Greens: think very carefully about what that will mean. We often hear from the Greens that they are concerned about gagging debate. I am pleased to see that the government has not been able to proceed this week in the way it originally highlighted, because it does give me an opportunity, again through the amendment I will move, to ensure that there is more time to carefully consider these matters.


As I indicated earlier, the last time the government had a Senate majority we ended up with Work Choices. Even back then the deals that were done about proper legislative scrutiny were more generous than what has happened with this electoral matters committee. Even the committee consideration of the Work Choices legislation—and we criticised that at the time—had the relevant department appear. We were critical about the amount of time involved for what was very complex, detailed and lengthy legislation but we at least had an opportunity to question the relevant department. 


On this occasion the committee has been nobbled in a way I have never seen before. Indeed, if my amendment today succeeds, we will have an opportunity to recall the committee, call the department before us and have the department explain to us the government's thinking behind the way it has chosen to proceed with this bill and to provide more information than what was put by the government in the explanatory memorandum, which left unexplained the important issues that people who made submissions to our inquiry have already highlighted.


It was impossible to establish an inquiry without the support of the coalition when the government had control of the Senate after the 2004 election. The government could pass draconian legislation and changes through regulation and the Senate had no ability to exercise its powers of disallowance. Do you want that? I say to Greens senators: do you want to go back to the budget before last, because that is what this legislation will deliver? It will deliver an environment where the Senate will have no control in the long term to be a brake on government excess and to ensure that draconian legislation does not simply get a quick tick—in this case, we are not even able to scrutinise the department—and measures, such as the budget before last, are allowed to succeed.


I would be surprised if that were really what the Greens want, but equally I have been surprised at their cooperation with the government on how this committee would proceed. I am glad Senator Rhiannon is here because I want to run through the detail of this. Mr President, perhaps the detail will assist your understanding here as well. When we made recommendations about having an inquiry the Labor Party, through the scrutiny of bills process, indicated that we should call the department. We were overruled. We then in the committee sought to ensure that we could call the department. The committee voted us down. 


The Greens were originally going to appear on today's program but then that changed, so I attended the next meeting when we were talking about the program. At that next meeting the chair was not even going to deal with the program. When I highlighted the point that the program was changing since now the Greens were not appearing and there would be more time so we could ask the department to appear, again I was simply ignored. Mr President, I know that you have worked in the role of Deputy President and Chairman of Committees and I know that you understand that this is not the way that committees should proceed, but this is how my rights as an individual senator and indeed as the opposition spokesperson on this matter have been dealt with on this occasion. I believe it is appalling. That is why I will be moving the amendment that has been circulated in my name to add at the end of the motion:


… ""but, may not be further proceeded with until 12 May 2016.""


In that motion I make the points I have already highlighted. There has not been proper consideration of this bill. We have the farcical example of the AEC saying to us, 'Senators, you would need to ask the department.' They came to us today unable to provide during this morning's hearing any detail about the government's rationale for proceeding the way they have with this bill. They were not able to apprise us as to why the explanatory memorandum did not explain the approach the government has taken in relation to below-the-line voting. They were not able to assist us to assess the submissions made to us by witnesses or people who provided submissions, highlighting that no-one can find that rationale. All they can find is glib statements by Senator Cormann—'This is what Gary Gray agreed to.' I am sorry, Senator Cormann, but the Labor Party have processes that determine what our party position is, and I represent that party position here. No glib references such as that can be used to apologise for your failure to make the policy case in relation to this legislation. This is, as was suggested before us today by one of the witnesses, a dirty deal. What we have before us is simply a dirty deal.


Let me see what else was said today. George Williams suggested that this is simply 'incoherent'. It is incoherent because the government are providing little information and no proper scrutiny. They should be ashamed of themselves. I move:


At the end of the motion, add, ""but, may not be further proceeded with until 12 May 2016.""

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2016-03-01,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:59):  I rise today to speak to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. In the public debate what has been put forward by the opposition—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Madigan, I point out that we are actually debating that this bill may now proceed without formalities—and you have used the correct title of the bill—and also now the amendment moved by Senator Collins to that motion. I am sure your subject material will be correct, but I want to make sure you are debating the right matter.




Senator MADIGAN:
  Following on, with the rhetoric, many of the points that Senator Collins made are quite pertinent to the subject. But last night, on the ABC's Q&A, the former Minister for Small Business in the government, Mr Billson, said: 'To see a person elected to the Australian Senate with 1,500 first preference votes that wouldn't even get you elected in a ward election in a local council, and then hold up the trajectory of the nation, make it impossible to hold governments to account for their promises and the commitments and the outcomes they deliver to our country—I think that's not good. Having people know where their vote's going—I think that is good. So I think there's a strong case for the reforms that are being put to the parliament.' I have listened to the government repeat this time and time again, and we have often heard references made to my fellow crossbench senators and Senator Muir in particular, who at the 2013 election received 479 first preference votes below the line.


But then you go and have a look at the frontbench of the government, and I go to look at how many first preference votes Senator Cash received below the line in the 2013 election, and Senator Cash—the Minister for Women, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment—received 349 first preference votes below the line. Then we have Senator Edwards, who received 667 first preference votes below the line. Senator Fawcett received 1,602 first preference votes below the line. And, of course, Senator Lambie received 1,501 first preference votes below the line.


Of course, it is true that many Australians vote above the line, and they vote according to the voting ticket that their party puts forward, whether it be the government—the Liberal Party and the National Party—the ALP, the Greens or PUP—whoever. So the fact of the matter is that the majority of people put 1 above the line and they say to their party, 'You distribute our vote according to how you, the party, see it.' If any member of the public cares to go to the Australian Electoral Commission website prior to the election, they can look up how the party is directing their preferences.


But, of course, they do not want the public to actually know. This bill is about self-interest and it is about political opportunism. I am all for transparency so the public know where their votes are going, and I support that. I support educating the public to care how they vote and who they vote for, to actually look beyond the tag of whether you are the ALP, the Liberals, the Nationals or the Nick Xenophon party, and to look at the individual who you are voting for to see if their beliefs and their ethics conform with yours—it might be 70 per cent; it might be 100 per cent; it might be 65 per cent—so people understand how their vote works, because there is an incredible amount of ignorance, unfortunately, in the general community about how your votes work.


It is an interesting position that we have here. On the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters are the government, the ALP and the Greens. There are no voting members on that committee other than them. That is a fact. Predominantly, this committee is a House of Representatives committee. In the past, on the public record, former prime ministers of our nation have shown an utter contempt for the Senate and the way the Senate works. Unless the Senate votes the way a government of the day wants it to vote, some people refer to the Senate as swill. So I would say to members of the government in the Senate: be careful what you wish for.


Often we hear in this place about legislation being rammed through this place, and the fact of the matter is that, in the previous Rudd-Gillard governments, the ALP-Greens coalition, for want of a better word, rammed through legislation. At that time, the now government—the Liberal-National party—complained profusely about that. It was an abuse of the Senate process, with lack of scrutiny and lack of process. Now, when the boot is on the other foot, we hear it from the now opposition, the then government.


Some people suggest that it is an easy thing to get into the Senate by gaming it. The fact of the matter is that it is a vertical ski slope. For the incumbents—the cabal, as some people would say—it is all in their favour. The fact of the matter is that in 2013 there was $58,076,456 paid to political parties represented in the House of Representatives and the Senate. To receive funding from the public purse, you have to get four per cent or more of the vote. That already is a huge advantage to incumbency. But we do not hear about that.


So I would suggest to the government: the argument that you use about how many votes people got below the line does not cut the mustard, let alone when you look at how, with the retirement or resignation of people from the Senate, we find people who did not even run in the 2010 or 2013 election and who now occupy seats in this Senate. They never put their name on a ballot paper, but now they are here. Yet we hear arguments about what the people want. They often do not even go to the person who actually ran in those two previous elections and was the next person on the ticket, whether it was the government ticket—the Liberals or the Nationals—or the ALP or the Greens ticket. There are many people who end up occupying seats in this place who have never faced an election and never faced the people.


I say to Senator Dastyari: you did not run, and you will admit that. You were picked by the party to be here. I am not insinuating, Senator Dastyari, that you should not be here. That is the system that the incumbent government has made in this place. Here we are, 30 years on, and one of the biggest electoral changes that the nation has seen in three decades is being rushed through. You would want to be careful what you wish for here. If we accept the government's argument about how many votes people get below the line, it should ring alarm bells for the government. If that is going to be the yardstick, have a look at how many below-the-line first preference votes Senator Di Natale got. One does not have to look too far. At the 2010 election, he got 34,208 votes below the line, with the number 1 in the box next to Senator Di Natale's name. Then look at one of the better performers for the coalition: Senator Fierravanti-Wells. At the 2010 election, Senator Fierravanti-Wells got 12,194 first preference votes below the line. I have to say that she is, by far, one of the better performers in the coalition. Look at how many votes Senator Cormann, who has carriage of this bill, got below the line. He got 5,215 votes in the 2010 election—less than one-sixth of the votes that Senator Di Natale got. I say to the government: the argument that you are putting forward about below-the-line votes does not cut the mustard. In the paper, you attack other people for their low vote. You want to take another look. Senator Bernardi, who is often attacked in this place for his views and for how outspoken he is, got 5,554 votes at the last election, in 2013. Senator Birmingham, who is the Minister for Education and Training, got 1,013 votes. He got fewer votes than I did, and yet he is a minister. But I am not calling into question the fact that he can be a minister.


There is a narrative about there being a problem. Should we have more scrutiny? Yes, we should have more scrutiny. But the government wants to think about what it is doing here. I caution the government: it is not going to ultimately turn out the way you think. You are playing into the hands of the Greens and other people. One thing the ALP has always said in the House of Representatives is 'one vote, one value'. I refer you to the Constitution, which talks about senators being elected by the people to the Senate to represent their states. That is what it says. That is not what I think it says; that is what it actually says. But, in our current system, if you vote 1 above the line for your first preference, you allocate how your vote is going to be distributed to that party above the line, whether it is the ALP, the government, the Greens, PUP, an Independent, a small or minor party or whoever. If you vote 1 above the line, they all distribute your vote according to how they see fit. That is a fact. 


For 32 years—I think it was in 1984 that the system came into play—all the parties were part of putting this current system in place. I say to all of you in this place: for many years, this system has served you. Prior to an election, you all go around to small and minor parties, Independents and any other person who has nominated to run for the Senate, put up their $2,000 nomination fee—or whatever it is—and met all the requirements of the AEC. The fact of the matter is they have not broken the law. There are backroom deals and preference deals done by all parties and individuals represented in this place in some way, shape or form. The fact of the matter is that the people who choose not to vote for the ALP, the Greens, the Nationals or the Liberals are entitled to have a voice. They are entitled to have their vote represented. If somebody chooses to say, 'I agree with one individual more than with another individual. I'm going to give my preferences to that person,' then that is their right to do so. Of people who vote in the Senate, a large proportion chooses to vote below the line. The Liberals might have their first candidate in Victoria being whomever it may be, but the voter might say: 'Well, I don't particularly like that bloke or that woman. I'm going for the person who is No. 6 on the Liberal list, and then I'm going to go to the candidate who's No. 2 on the ALP list, because I concur with their beliefs more than I do with the other five on the Liberal ticket,' or vice versa. It is people's right to do that. Many Australians take up the option to do that. The vast majority of Australians just give it to the party to decide.


But to tell me that people care what the voting public thinks is disingenuous. The fact of the matter is that this is purely about self-interest. It is purely about political opportunism. The selective moral outrage and the toxic sanctimony of the Greens on this issue is just breathtaking. The government have jumped into bed with them. Ultimately they will rue the day that they went along with this.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (13:15):  I rise to speak on the motion and on the amendment put by my colleague Senator Collins regarding the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. To say that the level of scrutiny that has been given to this bill is farcical is actually something of an understatement. I would like to say at the outset that I support and concur with the contribution by Senator Collins here today about the level of scrutiny and the farcical situation that has been undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on this bill.


We had the inquiry—if you want to call it an inquiry—on this bill this morning. This morning's hearing was, as Senator Collins said, unlike any other inquiry that we have been involved in. We had the farcical situation where questions were put to the AEC that they were unable to answer. Their answer was, 'You need to talk to the department.' Senator Collins has already outlined to the Senate and those listening to this debate the length to which Labor senators went to request the department—it was not an outrageous or unusual request—come to answer questions. But that request was shut down and, in many respects, not even responded to by the chair of the committee. Of course, the coalition and Greens members on the committee chose to not allow the department to come to answer very significant questions on this bill.


The other point that needs to be made on the inquiry that we just had is to do with questions that were taken on notice. Again, there was not even a procedure put in place by the chair of the committee as to when questions on notice should come back to the committee. Questions on notice are a normal process in Senate committees, both legislation and references committees. They are just part of the normal work of a committee. But at this inquiry there was not even an attempt to have questions on notice responded to. We have been told that we may get those responses in time for an 8 am meeting tomorrow to consider the draft report into this piece of legislation.


When Senator Collins talked about the need for greater scrutiny of this bill, she also meant actual scrutiny. It is not good enough to point to a JSCEM report on the 2013 election because what we have before us here is not what was recommended. It has cherry picked parts out of that report on the 2013 federal election. A deal has been done between the coalition and the Greens in this place on what they would like to see. It is not about allowing the Senate and the public to have a greater understanding of what is actually being put before us in this piece of legislation. It is not about that. They can pretend it is about that, but the inquiry clearly showed, I believe, that that is not what it is about. They have cherry picked parts of it. They have put in a section about logos that was not even recommended in the JSCEM report. I do not know who brought that up. It might have been in a discussion between the Liberal Party secretariat, the National Party secretariat and the Prime Minister's office. That is in there, but it was not recommended. Even today when questions were asked about that, primarily by the coalition senators, there were not any details around how that might work. There was nothing at all. So this has been a complete subversion of the Senate process, and it undermines the role of the Senate in this place.


In recent months many of us on this side of the chamber have pointed out that changing the leader of the Liberal Party has actually changed nothing. The conservative and self-interested policies of the Abbott government continue under the Turnbull government. In contrast, we can look at the Australian Greens and see just how much can change with a change of leadership. It was a party that under former Senator Bob Brown and former Senator Milne on many occasions made grand speeches about the importance of Senate oversight and proper consideration. Now, under Senator Di Natale or, in this case, Senator Rhiannon, we know that the Australian Greens have no respect for the role of this place. They have no respect for the processes that we have. 


What we are seeing now is a deal that has clearly been cooked up over months. It is not something that has been neatly settled in the last couple of weeks. Behind closed doors, with no transparency, it has been cooked up to benefit the Greens and the coalition. It is a deal that has been cooked up to subvert the Senate processes and give the Turnbull government the quick out it wants for a double dissolution election.


This is not about the need for urgent reform. If it were, the government would have brought a bill before this place sometime in the last two years. This is not about the procedures we have in this place. Make no mistake: this is not about reform or democracy. Ramming this bill through parliament is about political expedience. This is about what is politically convenient for the Liberals and the Greens. I would throw in the Nats, but I think they just go along with anything. It is most definitely not about the role of this place as a house of review.


The role of the Senate as house of review is to be able to go to the electorate and talk about legislation and to come back better informed, with amendments and with a government that is able to take them into account. None of that is happening here. This is just a directive from the Prime Minister's office which says, 'Clear the slate on Thursday night or Friday and get us out of here so that we can get ready for an election.'


These are not my words but rather the words of the former leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown. They are words he spoke in this place in defence of the Senate—words which have very real meaning in this place today. However, these words obviously do not have any meaning to the Australian Greens we now have under the leadership of Senator Di Natale and Senator Rhiannon. They have similarly forgotten the words of their last leader, former Senator Christine Milne, who said in this place:


The Australian people deserve a house of review. A house of review means appropriate scrutiny of legislation and appropriate scrutiny of governments. You achieve that through estimates committees, through Senate references committees and through Senate legislation committees.


Again, this is a lesson that has been lost on the Greens who now sit in this place.


Anyone who has been following this farce of a process would also know that the bill that was presented in the House of Representatives has already been amended by the government. So quick were they in their haste to get this dirty deal out of the back room and onto the table of the House of Representatives that they have already had to amend it. And it appears that the AEC, from what I can gather from their evidence, have not really had much to do with drafting this legislation. By the time the government ram it through the Senate here, who knows how much will have already been amended.


This is the problem. There has been no scrutiny and no transparency. There has been a deal cooked up by the coalition and the Greens and it is already starting to unravel by way of the fact that it needs amendments. This has not been done properly. There has been no scrutiny and there has been no regard whatsoever for the Australian community. The government have not gone out to talk about it in the community. The Greens have not gone out to talk about it. No-one has even bothered to put up a semblance of pretence that there is going to be proper scrutiny.


As I have said a number of times here, because it needs to be said often and loudly, the Greens have stitched up a deal with the Liberal government to avoid proper scrutiny of the most significant changes to our democratic process in 30 years. This is not about what is best for our democracy. In fact, we cannot even say what is best for our democracy or what the true impact of the proposal being brought before us is, because the government refuse to allow us the time to scrutinise this proposed legislation. They have done the deal with the Greens and Senator Xenophon. It is a deal that will see this legislation rammed through this place with only a pretence of consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That has played out. That is the reality. That is what we saw this morning.


Our colleagues in the other place were forced to vote on the bill before they even saw the outcome of the sham hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. They were not even allowed the time to read the joint standing committee report before they actually had to vote on this proposed legislation—which, as I have said, is the most significant change to our democratic process in over 30 years. The government and the Greens have seen fit to give the appearance of allowing senators an opportunity to consider the bill and the evidence of the hearing that was held this morning. It was, I think, 3½ hours of a farcical meeting with rotating questions. It was a hearing at which members of the committee had just 3½ hours. The most important part of what happened this morning is the fact that the government—and the committee chair, along with the other coalition and Greens members—would not allow the appropriate departments to come and give evidence. Those questions that committee members wanted to ask were not able to be asked. Some of the questions were asked of the AEC, as I have said, but they did not have the information to be able to answer those questions. They referred them and told us that it would be a matter for the finance committee.


If we hear the minister that is responsible for this legislation get up to say, 'We have had the JSCEM report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 election and we have had an inquiry into the legislation before us now,' it is just a farce. People who are listening to this debate should know that it is a complete and utter farce and that the process the government has set out has been explicitly designed to control the debate, to shut down the debate and to ensure scrutiny is at a minimum.


This bill cherry picks elements of the recommendations made in the JSCEM report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 2013 election. But we are not going to have an opportunity to really examine the implications of this bill. If we are all honest with ourselves, we cannot say that we are surprised by the actions of the government. In the last two years, we have seen their complete contempt for the Senate. This government have shown themselves to be completely unable to manage their legislative agenda. They have shown themselves to be completely unable to negotiate. They have shown themselves to be completely unable to prosecute an argument for the changes they have sought to make—which is no shock, given the changes they have sought. They have shown themselves as having complete contempt for the Senate, its role and its procedures.


 For a moment, I was surprised by the Greens—and Senator Xenophon—being complicit in this, until I remembered the Greens track record when it comes to negotiating with the government. And I remembered that, to put it simply, the Greens are not very good at making deals: their bargaining powers have already been found wanting. We saw this when they made a deal with the government on multinational tax transparency. We had the numbers on this issue—we could have got a better deal on tax transparency—but the Greens folded. They folded and let 500 companies off the hook. And yet again we have seen the Greens roll over to have their tummies scratched by the Liberal government.


I am sure many members of the Australian Greens are wondering when their party became opposed to open and transparent debate. Their own members would be asking when this became a bad thing. Given the Greens record under the leadership of Senator Di Natale, you would think that they would be getting better at cutting deals with the Liberal government. It is something we have seen them doing a lot. As I just outlined, the Greens voted with the government to let big companies keep secret how much tax they pay. They voted to defeat Labor amendments requiring large private companies making more than $100 million in profits to publicly disclose how much tax they pay. But this is just the start. 


The Greens also voted with the government in the Senate to cut age pensions by $2.4 billion. They actually voted to pass Mr Abbott's and Mr Hockey's budget measures to cut the age pension to 330,000 elderly Australians. Senator Di Natale's Greens voted with the Liberals to erect new barriers against investment by reducing Foreign Investment Review Board screening thresholds for proposed investments in agriculture and agribusiness. They voted for legislation allowing the health minister to make multimillion dollar medical research funding decisions without following the recommendations of the independent expert advisory body. And the list goes on. Now the Greens have done a dud deal, behind closed doors, with the government to change the Senate voting system. It is a deal that will disenfranchise voters. Some people have estimated that three million Australians vote for parties other than the coalition, Labor and the Greens. This deal is all to help the government call an early double dissolution election.


All of this is not to say that there are not issues with our current electoral system, issues that do need to be addressed. But they should not be addressed in this way, through a piece of legislation that has been rammed through the House of Representatives, that has been rammed through a quick and dirty inquiry this morning, prior to the JSCEM delivering its report, only to see it come into the Senate to again be rammed through. There is no transparency; there is no concern about going out to the community to ask their view. This is about the Greens and the government doing a deal with no concern or care for Australian democracy.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (13:35):  I too rise to put on the record my remarks on what is, in my view, a mistitled piece of legislation before the chamber this morning—the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016—which would be better called the 'dirty deal between the Liberals and the Greens party bill', because that is what is really being discussed here this morning.


For those in this country who live great lives and do not pay 100 per cent attention to the way the Senate works and the way Senate inquiries work, it is important to put some context around what is going on here. To give an example, one of the committees I sit on is the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. We are inquiring into loans that have been impaired, which means that the banks have taken over loans and people have lost their property. That is a very important issue, and we are taking it very seriously. We have had to my knowledge at least six or seven—it is probably more—whole-day hearings that have been held around the country to give Australians the chance to put on the record important matters that relate to loans and banks. That is an important matter but, by comparison to the matter that is being pushed through the Senate right now, that simply pales into insignificance. What is being pushed through this chamber is a deal between the Greens and the Liberals—and it is epitomised by a deep and meaningful conversation going on between the Liberal Minister for Finance and the person who is leading the discussion for the Greens, Senator Rhiannon. The dealing is going on as we speak.


What I really want people to understand is that the reality of that sort of conversation that is going on means that there is going to be no set of six or 10 hearings around this matter which is, as Senator Brown has said, the biggest change that has happened to the way Australians vote in 30 years. Let us get some perspective here: the biggest change in 30 years about the way Australians are going to vote without any proper inquiry or proper process—it is not even good enough to get a hearing in every state or capital city. Let's just push it through and have a pretend game of an inquiry—that is what has happened today in this building. Today democracy got dudded in this building by the coalition government in cahoots with the Greens—they did a deal and they held the most embarrassing sham of an inquiry this morning. On that committee Labor was represented very ably by Senator Conroy, Senator Jacinta Collins and Senator Brown, but they were subjected to the chairing of Mr Coleman. A number members from the Liberals and Greens were also there, as were a few independents who tried to put their views, but the committee was dominated by Liberals and Greens. Mr Coleman as chair used all his excellent skills in trying to keep the debate civil, but the reality was that it started at 8.15 and it finished at 12 o'clock.




Senator Rhiannon:
  Your people ran out of questions!




Senator O'NEILL:
  For most people working around the country that would not even constitute half a day's good work. These guys have decided in the space of less than four hours that they had enough evidence to push through this shameful deal. That is what they have done. It is a disgrace; it is a disgrace that it has happened in this country; it is a disgrace it has happened in this building; and it is a disgrace that they think that sham of performance this morning will constitute anything other than the abuse of the Senate's authority in a most shameful way. It is contemptuous of a proper, robust and transparent inquiry into this most significant piece of legislation.


It is not only the Labor Party which should be upset about this; experts who have long-held and critical views on these matters are absolutely outraged by what is being attempted here. I was very honoured to meet Malcolm Mackerras. I only joined the Labor Party 19 years ago, when I was pregnant with my third child and I was a teacher; I was not a political staffer and I did not know until I got here that it was Malcolm Mackerras who created the horseshoe shaped graph of seats. This is what Malcolm Mackerras, who has had a long and distinguished career as a psephologist, had to say: 'It is not about fairness what is going on here. It is about the reshaping of our party system. South Australia is to have a four-party system, Liberal on the right, Xenophon in the centre and Labor and Greens on the left. The rest of Australia is to have a three-party system—coalition, Labor and Greens. There will be no independent senators, unless Jacqui Lambie can get a short-term at a 2016 double dissolution election. There will be only one benefit for the voters: the ballot paper will be smaller.' That is what Mr Mackerras said.


The Greens are always on about the environment and perhaps their great political goal is to shrink the voting paper for the Senate. They have become the Green political party. Whatever the perception might be out there that the Greens are the cuddly, generous ones, this deal absolutely seals forever that possible view of the world. The Greens are a political party who are seeking to advantage themselves in the most shameful way through what they are undertaking right here in this chamber. They have the hide to call it reform. 'Reform'—there is an abuse of a word if ever there was one in this context. Unlike the Greens and the Liberals, the Labor Party does not believe that putting a sticker that reads 'Reform' on a piece of legislation actually constitutes reform. It is deeply concerning to see the Liberals and the Greens announce a deal that will favour the Green politicians and Liberal politicians, and that is not in the interests of ordinary Australians.


Twenty-five per cent of Australians voted—not for Labor, not for Greens, not for the Liberal Party, not for the national party—for those ordinary Australians who we see here in this chamber. These are people who have been maligned and who have had to suffer the slings and arrows of considerable contempt on their arrival into this place. I think of each one of those senators as valued colleagues who have a right to be here. It is not that I agree with their philosophy or their views on many issues, but they got here by being elected by a system that enabled a range of different views to come into this place. I note the entry into this chamber of Senator Bob Day. Senator Day has not voted with Labor on many occasions, but I do appreciate his support for a particular motion that I put forward to call the government towards some transparency in a deal they did with the ATO in Gosford. I acknowledge that and thank Senator Day for his support. If we counted his votes, I would say he has voted with the Liberal Party an awful lot more often than he has voted with the Labor Party. But he got here legitimately. He got here in a system that this government is seeking to reform, to change in a most significant way after 30 years—and they want to change it without proper scrutiny, without proper care for the impacts, without careful consideration of unintended consequences. They just want to ram it through.


It is true that more than three million Australians exercised their vote by voting for a party other than one of the major parties. Three million people chose candidates carefully—or perhaps without too much care, but of course in the case of Senator Day he is saying it was a very careful choice—and voted for candidates from other than the main parties. It hardly seems fair, when we have that result that indicates what Australians think at this time, that this piece of legislation is being pushed through. Certainly I do not think we can call it reform if you leave out three million people whose intentions were pretty clear, if you construct a way of voting that excludes them from revealing that perspective once again. 


Imagine for a minute if the Liberals had with Tony Abbott what they are seeking now with Malcolm Turnbull. This Senate would have been unable to prevent the worst excesses of a government that will go down in history as a shameful government that attacked very fundamental elements of Australia's health and education systems. If the Independents had not been elected we would by now have had our students in tertiary institutions paying $100,000 for a degree. We would have seen the cuts that they had tried to inflict on Medicare come into being and there would be a $7 co-payment. I notice there is a family sitting in the gallery. I am sure that mums and dads out there, like me, with a few children, find that when you get one child with an ear infection you get three children with an ear infection. When you need to get your child to the doctor to prevent illness or complications—and ear infections can turn into deafness—you need to take your Medicare card and know that you are going to get the service that you want, not take your credit card and hope to god you can afford to pay for the care you need for your child. 


That is what would have been the reality in Australia today if the people opposite had got their way and got their bill through the Senate. But they did not, because Labor stood firm against it and, in a moment of conscience, the Greens came with us some of the time and also there were the Independents, who saw the unfairness of this government particularly in the 2014 budget. They stood up and they were counted. No amount of wiping them off the ballot paper is going to undo the good work that this Senate did in preventing Mr Abbott from doing what he wanted to do to the fabric of our society. If what they are doing now had already been achieved, we would have seen further cuts to family payments. Reform is important but reform that entrenches the right wing of the Liberal Party and reform that entrenches control of the balance of power in the Greens party, who want to legalise ice—that is one of their policies—is not in the interests of the ordinary people of this country. This bill was brought into the parliament by the Greens to reflect the deal that they have done with the Liberals. It does not even reflect the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. If it was in any way significantly the same as that, it might have some validity, but they have ignored that and they have just come up with their own little way of maximising the vote for themselves. It is a greedy power grab.


What we are seeing is a very concerning push for this big change—the biggest since 1984—where people will be encouraged to vote one to six across the top of the ballot paper and the government will be able to enact this very promptly and then get a double dissolution. Labor's concern arising from that and other changes—Senator Dastyari made this point very clearly as early as last week—is that one of the flow-on effects is that there is an informal vote likely when you make this sort of change. We are changing something for an entire country; we are changing what people do when they go in to vote. And we are doing this in the blink of an eye, or as quickly as a dirty deal signed in blood between the Greens and the Liberal government can be delivered. They are seeking this corruption of Australia's democratic processes as fast as possible. It is easy to be sceptical when the Liberals and the Greens hope that this produces more senators of their persuasion. 


It is also very interesting that the Greens party have decided that they are the best minor party in the land—better than anybody else. The Greens have decided that they do not want anybody else to represent an alternative view in this chamber other than them. That is a pretty big call, and that is what the deal is about—it is about getting more Greens in this little bit over here so that they can have a say without all these separate voices, all these different voices that have characterised this Senate. The Greens should be out telling their supporters about what they have done here. They should be confessing to the fact that they have done a dirty deal and given the Liberal Party the permanent blocking vote of a majority in the Senate, that they have handed Australia over to the right wing without critique. As I have said, Senator Day has voted with the right wing more often than not but even he is disgusted by what they are attempting. What they are doing to our nation today shows breathtaking arrogance. 


The Greens have sacrificed all principle and all policy to ensure that they and the Liberal Party together can block a progressive agenda in the future. You wonder how they could do this when you look at some of the things done not just by Mr Abbott but by Mr Turnbull. If they deliver this and he remains Prime Minister he will have control of the Senate and control of the House of Representatives. Who is this Mr Turnbull? Let us have a look.


Mr Turnbull and Julie Bishop conspired to assassinate the Prime Minister. After that departure of Mr Abbott, they delivered a profoundly dysfunctional and divided government. It is constantly contradicting itself, backflipping on one decision and the other. It is a disaster, frankly. We can see that. Mr Turnbull was once full of hope, but now all people hear is the waffle of his words. He backed in the cuts that they made to health and education when he was a cabinet minister. He backed them in again in his mini-budget in December. If he gets the chance, he will back them in again in another budget in May. If he gets elected, God help Australia because we will no longer have a Medicare card that works. We will no longer have schools where any child from any background can go and be assured they will get a good education, because this Senate, reconstructed by this deal between the Liberals and the Greens, will make that impossible to achieve. They will be able to do whatever they want. That is why Labor will fight so hard to give people an alternative. People know what Labor stands for. They can trust the party that instituted Medicare—the Labor Party—to fight to keep it.


It was Mr Turnbull, doing this deal with Ms Bishop, who created an incredible contrast to the way in which the government operated before. Mr Turnbull is a pretty good master of saying one thing and doing another. It is a mighty leap of faith to believe that he will not use the same hand-over-fist tactics while he is dealing with the Greens. On the environment, which is an issue that is supposedly close to the Greens' heart, as Leader of the Opposition Mr Turnbull said, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.' Since becoming the Prime Minister, he has gone weak at the knees about climate change, and there is a very real risk that a re-elected coalition government will pass legislation previously rejected by the Senate, including Tony Abbott's bill abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Remember that blue booklet that everybody got? I found the Liberal Party's Real solutions for all Australians statement of 2013 littered everywhere when I was door-knocking in the lead-up to the last election. It said:


We will improve rewards from working, reduce cost-of-living pressure and help families with the real costs of raising children.


But their words mean nothing because people are not reaping the rewards of working. Wages are not increasing, growth is slowing and unemployment is rising. Mr Turnbull put his name to all of the cuts that Mr Abbott made in the community and he is still after Medicare. This is a shameful deal between the Greens and the Liberal Party, who are in cahoots to take away— (Time expired)

  I acknowledge all the interjections. Please put more of them on the Hansard. It illustrates the desperation. They are trying to defend the indefensible because they are bankrupt. What they are trying to defend are the backroom deals. How far they have gone to try and discredit a very useful inquiry that we had today. One of the things they are saying is that there was not enough time. Senator Conroy, who asked 99 per cent of the questions for Labor—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I am happy to take the interjections, but Senator Conroy handed his time over to senators from other parties because he ran out of questions. So, for all the complaints, that is what went on. Useful evidence was given by the Australian Electoral Commission, by experts like Antony Green and Professor Williams, and by political parties. The solid work to help inform us was done. There were some very useful comments about below-the-line voting and a real commitment by people to work through how we ensure that it is voters who decide their preferences. There was much discussion about how ordinary people should play a part in parliament and in the electoral process. I believe that the Senate voting reform proposals before us, when we get to the bill, provide that opportunity. Above-the-line voting will require at least six boxes to be ticked. People will be ticking more than just major parties when they come to allocate their preferences, and therefore we can keep that very important aspect of emerging parties and smaller parties being elected to this parliament.


There was incredible misinformation from some of the earlier speakers in this debate to misrepresent this inquiry, which went to considerable lengths. One hundred and seven submissions were received, Senator Polley and Senator Dastyari, which set out some very real, useful information on how—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Senator Dastyari is bankrupt to the point where he says, 'You can't even say it's real.' It was a very useful inquiry; 107 submissions being made to an inquiry is impressive, with by far the majority of those submissions setting out support for Senate voting reform.


Let us remind Labor colleagues that this is building on the work that they participated in—because these days we are not sure which Labor we are dealing with in this debate. Are we dealing with the Labor of Senator Conroy, who just about froths at the mouth when he talks about this issue? Or are we dealing with the Labor of Jennie George and Gary Gray, who continue to have a balanced, responsible and democratic approach to this issue of Senate voting reform? Labor is split, and that was reflected today when Senator Conroy himself had to do the heavy lifting, getting very little support from any of his colleagues; now the message they have brought in here has been deceptive to their own colleagues.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  Senator Conroy, it is good you have joined us! I have just informed the Senate, Senator Conroy, of how you ran out of questions today at the committee inquiry and you had to give over your time to the other senators. It really does speak volumes. It really speaks volumes when Senator Conroy himself runs out of questions on such an important issue as Senate voting reform. He is the warrior for the Labor Party on this issue and he loses the argument. (Time expired)

I think all colleagues would recognise that Australia's media laws were crafted in an analog era for an analog world, and the ways that consumers are accessing their media—the options that technology is presenting for their consumption of media—are bit by bit rendering the existing media laws redundant. Also, a number of media organisations are finding that the existing media laws are constraining their capacity to configure themselves in ways that are the best for their business and best for consumers.


So I announced earlier today that the government will be seeking to abolish what is known as the 75 per cent audience reach rule, which prevents a collection of licences having more than 75 per cent coverage of the Australian audience, and to abolish what is known as the two out of three rule, which prevents merging of more than two out of three of the regulated traditional media platforms controlled by an organisation—those traditional media platforms being print, TV and radio. 


This is good news for the media industry. It will be good news for consumers, and I think I will shortly have the opportunity to share why it will also be particularly good news for regional consumers. We need to make sure that the media laws that we have are appropriate and recognise the world that we live in today. We have to be always ready to change to suit technology.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (14:07):  When you talk about media reform, regional communities, understandably, have a strong and legitimate interest in local content. What we will be proposing is that six months after a trigger event there will be new and higher local content requirements that will come into place for the aggregated markets, going up from 720 to 900 points over a six-week period. Also, if there is a trigger event in major population areas in a non-aggregated market, we will introduce, for the first time, local content requirements. Following a trigger event they, in those areas, will go from zero to 360 points per six-week period. So, there will be higher thresholds and a higher baseline of local content for aggregated areas and, for the first time, there will be a baseline of local content for major population centres in non-aggregated areas, which is good news for consumers.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (14:08):  The greatest protection these days for diversity comes by way of technology and consumer choice. There are new media operations, and consumers have greater capacity to access them than ever before. That is first and foremost. For those who may have some concerns, we can point to the remaining media laws. There is the five-four rule, which requires there to be five voices in metropolitan areas and four voices in regional areas. Also, there will still be the one-to-a-market rule, which will allow one TV licence per market, and the two-to-a-market rule, which will allow only two TV licences per market. There will also be the ongoing ACCC protections. Those do not change. There will also be the existing FIRB requirements. Those do not change. So there are still those historic protections there. But, as I say, the greatest protection and the greatest guarantee of diversity is technology, the plethora of media outlets and the opportunity for consumers to access them.

As an economically damaging protectionist policy, the RET should be removed. 


The very next sentence in that opinion piece stated:


The adjustment should be done over time and the costs should be shared between fossil fuel, energy-intensive and renewable sectors alike.


I am happy to clarify that my opinion piece called for the RET to be removed over time, not scrapped—a position consistent with the policy itself, as it is currently legislated to close in 2030.

 (Queensland) (15:05):  I seek leave to take note of the minister's statement.

Senator McLUCAS:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's statement.


The explanation we have just heard from the minister is less than fulsome, frankly. To say that we need to clarify the difference between 'scrapped' and 'removed' I think is quite pedantic. I do point you, Minister, to paragraph 5.1 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards, where it says:


Ministers are expected to be honest in the conduct of public office and take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not mislead the public or the parliament. It is a Minister's personal responsibility to ensure that any error or misconception in relation to such a matter is corrected or clarified as soon as is practicable and in a manner appropriate to the issues and interests involved.


The 'clarification' that you have given us today, Minister, I do not think takes us quite to paragraph 5.1 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards.


Last Thursday I asked a series of questions in this place which went to comments that the new minister had previously made—particularly made to his constituency in the National Party in Queensland—which went to the effects test, to income splitting and to the Renewable Energy Target. I asked:


Minister, is abolishing the RET in the interests of renewable energy producers in northern Australia, and is that government policy?


In part, the minister said:


I have never suggested that the Renewable Energy Target should be scrapped, as you suggest in that question.


The word 'scrapped' did not appear in my question. That is completely incorrect, and then the minister goes on to give me what I would call gratuitous advice. He says:


…and that is not how you should have presented that question here.


I will leave that gratuitous advice where it sits. I will phrase the questions I want to ask in the way that I want to ask them.


On 19 August 2014, as the minister has advised this place, he said in an opinion piece in The Australian:


As an economically damaging protectionist policy the RET should be removed.


You could  ask the question, 'Who is the minister speaking to in his op-ed piece?' I would suggest to you that the minister is talking to his National Party constituency in Queensland, but now this gentleman, this Senator, is a minister of the Crown. I debate Senator Canavan quite regularly on ABC radio; last week when we had a debate Senator Canavan indicated that he has to choose his words a bit more carefully now—or something along those lines. Yes, you do, but you always have to remember that, when you are playing with a coalition and when you are in government, what you said in the past still stands.


We in this place—particularly from my perspective—who come from regional areas do know that sometimes people will tell a story at home which may be a different story to the one that is told when you come to the parliament. Be very careful about that—we have to be very careful about that. In these modern days, Senator Canavan, we can find out what people to say right around the place. So what is said in Rockhampton or Townsville or Cairns is often reported in Canberra, and vice versa. So, Senator Canavan, I urge you to look again at paragraph 5.1 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards. I encourage you to limit your sharing of gratuitous advice and I thank you for taking heed of the letter that I have wrote to you today. I look forward to more compliance with what the statement actually says.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:11):  I would like to make a few points on Senator McLucas's motion and, for the sakes of Senator Bushby and Senator Canavan, I will be brief. Senator Canavan was given notice of this on the day in question. In fact I stood up after question time and drew the article to his attention and asked him to correct the record. He then asserted that:


Therefore it would not have been removed because in that opinion piece I suggested that it should be ended and closed for new participants.


That is not actually what the piece says. If you go to the back of the piece, it says:


As an economically damaging protectionist policy, the RET should be removed.


Leaving that aside, I would say to Senator Canavan is that the opposition gave him notice on Thursday and then took the next step of writing to him. 


I do think all ministers ought to correct the record where they believe the information is not correct. This was brought to your attention. I do acknowledge that you are doing the right thing today—I do acknowledge that. But I would say that there is no shame in having to give additional information to an answer. I suspect most people who have had the honour of sitting on the front bench in this place would have done so. That sort of accountability should not be like dragging blood out of a stone. You were given plenty of notice, but I do acknowledge that the record has been appropriately corrected—or additional information has been provided.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:13):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Gallagher and Ketter today relating to negative gearing.


I will start where the Prime Minister started back in September 2014, when he said:


It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.


Today—just under six months since that press conference, which led to the doing over of Prime Minister Abbott—the coalition party room got some advice from the former Prime Minister in which he challenged the current Prime Minister over his lack of economic leadership. 


What we have seen over the past six months is a complete vacuum of ideas—there is a blank page of tax policy for the Prime Minister and for the government. It is in that context that all of the issues which the government is having both internally and more broadly lie. Today's questions on negative gearing policy goes to just one element of that tax discussion. We have already seen the GST tossed out as a good idea, as something that should be pursued and something that should be talked about, discussed and on the table. It was removed when cracks started emerging in the position the Liberal Party had. Today, again, and this follows the GST discussion, we have had speculation and some indication that the Prime Minister is examining negative gearing. I understand, from today's answers, he will not rule out retrospectivity. While Senator Brandis is saying here that it has always been our disposition to not apply retrospectivity on tax changes, and in the House I understand on multiple occasions in question time there has been a refusal to rule retrospectivity out.


There is confusion about what the government is doing in a whole range of tax areas but in relation to negative gearing I think there is obviously advice coming from internally and externally. We see reports that John Howard is now providing advice to Malcolm Turnbull on tax policy, we have the previous Prime Minister offering advice on tax policy and we have a group of backbenchers—including Senator Seselja, I presume—providing advice to the government on tax policy. I have seen comments from Senator Seselja on not wanting to see any changes to negative gearing. It is in this vacuum that we are getting inconsistency and no direction and no leadership from the Prime Minister, whose main argument to take the top position was failure of economic leadership. Six months on, numerous ideas have been tossed out. One by one they get ruled out or argued about internally and what we are left with just a few months from the budget being handed down is a complete policy vacuum. We have the embarrassing situation where the Treasurer turns up for his prebudget address to the National Press Club with nothing to say—it is unprecedented in my time watching politics that a Treasurer, the most senior minister responsible for the budget, turns up to a Press Club lunch so we can hear some ideas about what is feeding into the budget without having anything to say.


The contrast could not be more stark: we have the opposition filling that policy vacuum with a whole range of ideas—more than 50 policies that have already been released. We have revenue measures as part of that and ideas around education—a whole range of areas, more than 50 policies. Our negative gearing policy is one of those. We think it is a very good policy. If you ask first home buyers today whether they can afford to enter the housing market, most of them will tell you that they cannot. People younger than that are not even thinking they are ever going to own a home. Our policy has been well thought through and considered, and in this area the opposition is in stark contrast to the government, which has absolutely no ideas at all.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2016-03-01,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the motion that the Senate take note of answers given by Senator Cormann. Senator Gallagher did not mention it just now, but earlier today she said just how much Labor's negative gearing policy was going to whack Canberra. It is going to whack home owners right around the country. As Senator Gallagher acknowledged today, it is going to whack Canberra a lot more.




Senator Gallagher:
  No I didn't. I did not.




Senator SESELJA:
  It is worth getting the quote—




Senator Gallagher:
  You have to tell the truth.




Senator SESELJA:
  I will quote you—it provides a particular insight into how this is going to whack Canberrans and also it indicates Senator Gallagher's attitude to this. During a doorstop today she said:


Well, certainly, Canberra is one of those places where you see high levels of people utilising negative gearing. There is no secret about that. But, I don't think you can make policy, good policy that is good for the future of the country, determined by particular subpopulations or cities. You have to look across the board..




Senator Gallagher:
  And?




Senator SESELJA:
  'And'! Senator Gallaher says, 'Oh well, what about that?' The first thing is that you are a local representative and you are saying even if it is going to whack Canberra, even though we rely even more than the rest of the country on negative gearing, we cannot worry about particular cities—




Senator Gallagher:
  Not what I said.




Senator SESELJA:
  I am quoting directly—we can't worry about particular cities like Canberra, the place you represent—don't worry about them, don't worry about the fact that Canberra is going to get whacked even more than the rest of the country, don't worry about the fact that 13 per cent of Canberrans are investors but a whole lot more are homeowners and the very people who were forced to take out larger mortgages to get into the market as a result of Senator Gallagher's policies when she was Chief Minister are the very people who will be most affected by the Labor's negative gearing policy. They are the people who will be most affected because if you have gotten into the market in the last two years—let us say here in Canberra you have had to take out a $400,000 mortgage, or a $450,000 or a $500,000-plus mortgage—how are you going to feel about a policy from the Labor Party that is designed to drive the value of that purchase down, that is designed to probably put you into negative equity? That is the situation that many recent homebuyers in particular will find themselves in as a result of the policy proposed by Labor and supported by Senator Gallagher even though she knows it will hurt Canberra even more than the rest of the country. And it will not just hurt here in Canberra—it will hurt all around the country whether it is in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane. 


Let us look at some of those capitals where people, in order to get into those markets, have taken out very significant mortgages in the belief that we would not have such a reckless policy from a major party as we have seen from the Labor Party, in the belief that the policy settings that existed would continue and that they could expect reasonable growth on their purchase. It is difficult getting into the market and it always has been, but the Labor Party's policy is not about fixing housing affordability—it is about whacking every homeowner. I say to the Senate that those who will be most impacted by the Labor Party's reckless negative gearing policy are recent purchasers—those families who are servicing large mortgages in the outer suburbs, often as a result of poor land release policies by local Labor governments. 


Putting that aside for the moment, they have those mortgages and now the Labor Party are saying to them and to every other homeowner, 'We want the value of your property to go down.' How much will the value of those properties go down? We do not know. The Grattan Institute, who support the policy, say it is up to 10 per cent. That is their starting gambit. That is a quote from the Grattan Institute. They say it is up to 10 per cent, and that is around the nation. In places like Canberra, where there is a greater reliance on investors, it may well be much more than that. The fact is the Labor Party are so reckless that they have not even bothered to do any modelling, but we know this: if you take that many buyers out of the market, renters will suffer and everyone's home values will go down. This is the Labor Party policy. I repeat in closing that Senator Gallagher has revealed the greater than usual impact on Canberra and the fact that she simply does not care.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:23):  Senator Seselja's comments illustrate the degree of panic and political chaos which exist within this government. I want to particularly emphasise the response from the Minister for Finance today in relation to my question on the issue of negative gearing. We can see that this is a government which does not want to look at the reality of the situation. My first question to Senator Cormann referred to the comments by the Treasurer. One would have thought that the Minister for Finance would be on the same page as the Treasurer in relation to the implications of negative gearing, given that Labor has been courageous in putting forward a policy that is fully funded and costed. It is a policy that breaks the mould of oppositions by addressing issues of inequality as well as the question of budget repair. We have been on the front foot. One would have thought that the Treasurer and the Finance Minister would be on the same page on this, but what Senator Cormann said in relation to the Treasurer's comments was, 'You can't believe everything that you read in the newspaper.' So, in effect, he was denying that the Treasurer had in fact made those comments about excesses in negative gearing. Senator Wong offered to table the Hansard which showed Mr Morrison's comments—not in the newspaper but in parliament. On 10 February, during question time, he was asked a question by the member for McMahon. He said:


What the member opposite is really inquiring into is whether there is any potential for things to be done in relation to that measure that can deal with the excesses that might occur in negative gearing.


So it is quite clear that Mr Morrison has identified excesses. He has formed a conclusion about the fact that there is a potential for excesses in the existing negative-gearing policy, which many commentators believe is leading to a distortion in our taxation system.


Sensible commentators have referred to this fact. None other than the Reserve Bank of Australia has looked at this issue and, over the past 13 years or so, has been indicating that this is perhaps an area that the parliament needs to look at. No less than Mr Turnbull, then a backbencher, indicated in, I think, 2005 that Australia's negative-gearing regime was extremely generous. Most people concede that, around the world, our negative-gearing policy stands out as being an exception to the rule. We know that there are many other respected economists who applaud Labor's position in relation to this matter. We have put forward a thoughtful, considered policy initiative.


We know that the backbench on the other side are desperate because of the rudderless and leaderless position of their government in respect of economic matters. They are desperately looking for an opportunity and they see a political opportunity to differentiate themselves from the Labor position, so they are putting pressure on the government not to make changes to negative gearing, not for reasons as to the efficacy of negative gearing and not for reasons of fairness in our taxation system and what is right for the country. No. This is a poll-driven response and a short-term approach which is unbecoming. It is not the type of approach that one would expect from Mr Turnbull, who forswore using scare campaigns. He thought that his new brand of economic leadership was going to deliver a more enlightened approach in which ideas can be properly considered. That dream of an enlightened approach has been snuffed out in recent times. We have seen a panicked government. This is a government in total disarray.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:28):  Every serious commentator and analyst has confirmed that, were Labor's policy on negative gearing put into place, demand for established properties would fall by about one-third. Perhaps Labor senators are not aware—perhaps they have other investments—but for most Australians their biggest investment is in their home. The Labor policy would reduce the investment of every single homeowner around Australia, and I am quite sure that Labor has not modelled or thought this through properly. I would like to see the 'fully costed, fully funded' analysis that Senator Ketter talked about, but I am sure that any examination of that would show that it is a figment of Labor's imagination.


On tax reform, when we consider the current government against those unfortunate times when we have had Labor governments, the contrast could not be starker. Most Australians simply do not trust Labor with money and economic policy. I often relate this story because people tend to forget this: I was in this parliament when the Labor Party were in government, and, before an election which the Labor Party thought they would lose, they introduced legislation to cut income tax and it passed with the support of the then opposition because we are all about reducing income tax for ordinary Australians. But, no sooner did Labor unexpectedly win that next election, the first piece of legislation that the newly elected Labor government brought in abolished, abandoned, repealed that legislation that had provided for tax cuts. So why would any Australian ever trust anything the ALP said in relation to any form of tax reform or economic policy?


All Australians who are older than 20 would remember that the only tax cuts ever given by any government in recent history were those provided for by coalition governments, who introduced tax cuts in 1998, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. What did you get from Labor, by contrast? You got a carbon tax, which Labor went to an election promising they would never introduce. Their first action when they got into power was to introduce a carbon tax, which put up the price of electricity and the general cost of living for ordinary Australians right around our country. Then they introduced a mining tax, remarkable only—being a typical Labor tax—that it cost a lot but raised absolutely no money. 


If you look at the actions, the actual governance, of the Labor Party compared to those of the coalition over any period of time, you will understand that you simply cannot trust Labor with money, and this applies to their back-of-the-envelope proposal on negative gearing. I know that it was not well thought through. We all know that Senator Conroy devised his NBN program on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight somewhere over Australia. Perhaps the negative gearing policy was done by Mr Shorten, in desperation, in the same way as the NBN was—on the back of an envelope, without any serious understanding or thought about how it could impact on Australians. I say 'Australians' because most investors in negative gearing are ordinary people: policemen, nurses, firemen, tradesmen, civil servants and so on. These are the people that Labor are attacking in their approach to negative gearing. So I know that Australians will treat Labor as they always have: you can never trust Labor with money.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:33):  The Prime Minister was asked yesterday if he had a recommendation for young people who could not afford to buy a home. His response had 351 words but not a single recommendation. This, of course, is just one recommendation less than Mr Hockey, who once unhelpfully suggested that young people should just get a better job—in an economy over which the coalition has presided which has the highest unemployment rate in years. This kind of response is typical of the government's approach to tax more generally, as evidenced in the answers provided to questions on notice today—lots of wasted words but no ideas. 


It has become apparent that the Liberal Party have absolutely no idea what they stand for on tax. Is there a problem with negative gearing, and what would that problem be? The Treasurer believes that there are 'excesses' of negative gearing in the current system, yet Senator Back, our colleague in this place, this morning on ABC radio said:


I don't see any reason at all to change the negative gearing processes …


We heard from the Minister for Finance that the government continues to work on plans to make the tax system more growth friendly. It is absolutely extraordinary; he refused in this debate to allow Senator Wong to table the Hansard in which the minister in the House of Representatives referred to those excesses. It is bad enough that, as has become apparent, in this government the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, but in this place we have now seen evidence that they do not want to know what the right hand is doing. They certainly do not want evidence of what is happening in the House of Representatives tabled in this place for the information of senators.


On another question, will reforming negative gearing affect housing prices? The Assistant Treasurer has said that it is:


… a policy that is going to increase the cost of housing for all Australians—for those people who currently own a home and for those people who would like to get into the housing market through their negative gearing policy. 


In contrast, the Prime Minister says it would 'smash' the residential housing market. The Minister representing the Prime Minister said today:


… the value of most Australians' homes would collapse.


Where is the evidence for any of these competing assertions? There is absolutely none. We might have had some evidence or some analysis on the table to allow the Australian people to have a conversation about this, had we had a tax white paper, but the promised tax white paper has not eventuated, and there is absolutely nothing on the table that would allow the Australian people to assess the propositions which are so confusingly being debated by those opposite amongst themselves.


Is there any intention to reform capital gains tax? Back in 2005, the now Prime Minister said that the capital gains tax discount was fuelling an 'asset bubble in residential real estate'. In question time on Monday, he said:


… increasing capital gains tax is no part of our thinking whatsoever. 


Today he said the comment only referred to the capital gains tax discount where it applies to individuals. 


When the Liberals talked about having a national debate, it seems that they just meant having the Prime Minister and his inconsistent positions debate themselves, having the ministers debate themselves and having the backbench debate the frontbench. It seems that the government has completely abandoned the idea of a national conversation on taxation. I was surprised that Senator Brandis brought it up today, because I would have thought that he would have been too embarrassed to even raise this idea. 


We are seeing anything but grown-up government. We are seeing anything but a serious policy conversation in which the Australian people could meaningfully participate. It seems that when the Prime Minister was talking about being agile he actually meant being really quick at avoiding any chance to make a decision on policy, and when he was talking about being disruptive he was actually talking about the coalition backbench.


The only party that is having a sensible, serious, mature policy conversation about taxation in this country is the Labor Party. Last year we outlined costed, detailed plans to reform taxation on superannuation. We outlined our plans on negative gearing and capital gains tax earlier this year. But this government, after 2½ years in office, with all the resources of the Treasury and with all the resources of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—with all the resources of the entire bureaucracy—cannot get a policy announced.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This is a Bill for an Act to restore the rights of the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island Legislative Assemblies to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of their respective territories, including their right to legislate for dying with dignity laws.


The Bill repeals the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, through which the national parliament overturned this right, and specifically, the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995.


In 1995, the Parliament of the Northern Territory passed a law which reflected not only the will of Northern Territorians, but also the strongly held views of the majority of all Australians. Every opinion poll conducted over the last two decades has shown that approximately three-quarters of Australians support the concept of dying with dignity. A poll conducted by The Australia Institute in November 2012 found that 71 per cent of Australians support the legalisation of dying with dignity for people experiencing unbelievable and incurable physical and/or mental suffering and that only 12 percent opposed. The survey also found that of those Australians who support dying with dignity laws, 85 per cent also believe that terminally ill patients should have the option of choosing when they die.


Previous research has found that 22 percent of respondents nationally have had a personal experience of a close relative or friend being hopelessly ill and wanting voluntary euthanasia. It has been consistently reported that each year hundreds of terminally ill people are assisted to an early and dignified death by compassionate medical professionals. This is an issue of great importance to many Australians and therefore all Australians should have, at the very least, the right to elect representatives to debate and make laws on this subject.


In 1995, the Northern Territory Assembly led the way in Australia by giving its citizens the option to end their suffering with dignity and medical support. In 1997, the Federal Parliament removed that right. This Bill will redress that action and restore the legislative rights of the governments of the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island to make decisions that both affect their citizens and reflect their views and concerns. In so doing, it reflects the heartfelt views of the majority of Australians on this important issue.


In 2011, the Parliament passed the Territories Self-Government Legislation Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment of Laws) Act 2011, introduced by the Australian Greens, which removed the power of the Federal executive to overturn legislation enacted by the Legislative Assemblies of the Territories. This Bill further enhances the rights of Australian citizens in the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island to make legislation on those matters of importance to them without undue interference from the Federal government.


In particular, it should be noted that this Bill does not restore the Northern Territory'sRights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. It does, however, restore the rights of the Northern Territory legislature to make laws about voluntary euthanasia in the future.


We commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:10):  I draw the Senate's attention today to the deal between the Liberals, Greens and Nick Xenophon on Senate voting legislation. The Liberals support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the nuclear fuel cycle, bringing back the ABCC and reviewing gay promotion programs in schools. They repealed the carbon tax, sought to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and agreed to create a wind farm commissioner. They also changed border protection laws and stopped the boats. The Greens voted against every one of these. The crossbench supported them. The latest data on divisions in this parliament show that the Greens vote with the government just six per cent of the time. Every other crossbencher has a superior record of supporting legislation. What policy compromises will the Liberals and the Greens make once the Greens are locked into the balance of power? Not only was this voting deal the mother of all backroom deals but, given the Greens senators he will lose in a double dissolution election, was it also the mother of all captain's calls by Senator Di Natale? How can the Nationals, of all people, be party to locking the Greens into the balance of power, given how the Greens oppose trade deals, live exports and mining? None of this makes sense and will inevitably end in tears.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:12):  I too rise today to speak on Senator Day's matter of public importance. Oh, what irony it is to hear crossbench senators criticising others in this place for working together on important national legislation which includes bipartisan reforms that have been in the public arena now for nearly two full years. There is no-one in this place more aware of the imperfections of our Senate voting system and the AEC's processes that underpin it than myself. I have had to contest two Senate elections within seven months because of these imperfections. They must be fixed so not only other candidates and other parties but Australian voters do not have to go through those processes again.


Just what are the reforms that those opposite are so vehemently against now? When you strip away all of the overblown, misleading and, quite frankly, insulting rhetoric, these reforms are simply about returning control of voting back to voters and away from backroom operators. It is simply about democracy. Having participated in today's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into this bill, I am even more convinced of the merits of it and also the necessity for it. I remind Senators in this place that these reforms have been outlined in the public arena for two years. This is enough time, as the AEC confirmed today, for them to have undertaken preparations, or in their language, 'contingency planning', for these exact reforms to be implemented. In fact, the AEC confirmed today that they have been fully engaged and have participated in the drafting of the bill by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Nearly two years ago, a bipartisan report found that our current system is profoundly undemocratic and requires urgent reform. The report made several recommendations that were suggested and endorsed by Labor at the time. This was not even two years ago. 


Let's take the temperature down a few degrees on the debate, strip away the rhetoric and just simply look at the facts. Let's first take a look at Labor's position on this issue. Two years ago the ALP's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2013 election was unambiguous. George Wright, the ALP's National Secretary then and now, was very, very clear on both the problems and the recommended solutions. So what did Labor say then about the problems and the solutions? I will quote them. Mr Wright, the National Secretary of the Labor Party, said that:


The election of senators who attract only a very low primary vote and rely principally on preference arrangements to get elected do not reflect genuine voter intention and need to be addressed …


He also said that the current system enables candidates whose objective is to game the system to achieve results that do not reflect the intention of voters. That is absolutely unambiguous and that was the Labor Party's position two years ago—that we have a profoundly undemocratic Senate voting system.


What was the ALP's solution two years ago to fix the serious problems that the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens on a bipartisan basis agreed existed? They recommended optional preferential voting above the line as a means to improving the integrity of the Senate voting system. Guess what? Labor also recommended that that be done in conjunction with the abolition of group-voting tickets. That is exactly the recommendation in the report that was issued two years ago by the committee and which is now reflected in the bill before us today. On an issue that Labor felt so strongly about two years ago, what alternatives have the Labor Party put forward in the past two years as they so clearly do not agree with their past position anymore? Astoundingly, if you get rid of all of the rhetoric, hyperbole and vitriol that they have directed mostly towards the Greens and us, they have absolutely not a single alternative.


In fact, as late as last month Gary Gray, a highly respected ALP MP and former national secretary, said:


It would be a travesty for Australian democracy if these careful and thought-through reforms were not in place in time for the next federal election.


Mr Gary Gray is echoing the exact words of George Wright, the current and at the time of the review two years ago ALP National Secretary. Astonishingly, despite some in the ALP having clearly had a complete change of position on this critically important issue, they have failed to oppose any alternatives or amendments in two years—not a single one. Instead, they are now relying on this overblown vitriol and, as I said, hyperbole. I see the Labor Party on this issue at the moment as akin to ostriches, with their heads in the sand for the past two years, hoping no-one would see they had their heads in the sand and would raise the issue with them and make them make a decision to stick with their position two years ago. Guess what? They have been called out.


Today, at the hearing on these reforms, the Labor Party that is so against these reforms declined to appear. The national secretary had absolutely nothing to say in writing and declined to appear to talk to the committee in person. Even more incredibly, Senator Conroy, the chief prosecutor of the ALP's new case, ran out of questions and ceded his time to other senators. The only conclusion I could come to after attending the hearing today was that the party's position on this problem is as it stood in the Labor Party's submission two years ago


Also at today's inquiry Mr Glenn Druery, the so-called preference whisperer, demonstrated to us all just how undemocratic the process is today and how the process is being shamefully abused. Mr Druery opined that, 'Minor parties should work together, in my opinion, before they deal with major parties.' He said nothing about working together on principle, philosophy or the best interests of Australians. So what other conclusion can one come to but that Mr Druery's focus is all on power and the manipulation of voters' preferences to enable microparties to game the system without regard for what voters actually want? He confirmed that opinion for me in response to one of my questions. He also confirmed that, while he has advised over 100 microparties—he cannot even remember how many he has advised—he did not see it as his role in giving that advice to ensure that parties' names matched their policies or, indeed, that they had any policies at all. He confirmed that it was not his role to take into account the will of the voter. It is absolutely shameful. If that does not demonstrate to all in this chamber why we need to urgently reform our Senate voting system I do not think anything well.


Ultimately support of this bill comes down to a simple choice: do we place trust in Australians to direct their own preferences and trust that they are capable of exercising this right? On this side of the chamber, we believe they do. These reforms will ensure voters have the choice to direct where their preferences go and who gets elected with their preferences regardless of whether they choose to vote for parties above the line or individual candidates below the line. They will have a choice to exercise their preference—by voting either for parties or for individual candidates.


I would like to conclude with a quote from the well-respected electoral commentator and psephologist Adjunct Professor Antony Green, who said in his submission to the joint standing committee that:


My overall view is the legislation is on the right path in transferring the power over preferences from parties to voters.


It is quite simple. The measures in this bill had bipartisan support but they now do not. We have no explanation from those opposite and no alternatives to fixing this system. And time, as we heard from the AEC, is running out to actually implement reforms before the next election.


In conclusion, I say to those who now argue against voters taking back control of their own vote—that is, the most basic democratic principle in our country—it is time for you to by a new pair of shoes with some great rubber soles on them. Get out of the backroom where you have been making deals. Get out into the fresh air. Talk to voters. Have policies. Do it the old-fashioned way. Get out and convince people to vote for your party instead of relying on these grubby, dirty backroom deals. Get out and engage with voters and stand for something, instead of being one of these 100 parties— (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:22):  For a moment there, when Senator Reynolds talked about 'putting our shoes on', I thought she was going to announce a double-D date, but, unfortunately, that did not happen. Before I start my contribution on this matter of public importance, submitted by Senator Day, about the contradictions between the Liberals, the Nationals, the Greens and Senator Xenophon's policies and voting records and their cooperation on radical electoral changes, I want to talk a little more about the contribution by Senator Reynolds. First of all, she talked about the fact that there was a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report with recommendations about changes to the electoral system. She is quite right. That was a number of years ago and nothing happened at all. She talked about the fact that preference dealing is done by backroom operators. That is quite laughable when you come to realise that the very bill we will be dealing with in this place in the days to come has been created in a backroom deal by Senator Xenophon, the Greens and the coalition. It is just laughable to come in here and talk about backroom deals when Senator Reynolds has been a part of one done on this bill.


At the inquiry that was held today into this bill, the Australian Electoral Commission said they had been in discussions about the bill. I stand to be corrected, but my memory of the evidence that was given today in the inquiry was that the AEC said they had been in discussions about the proposed legislation from 11 February 2016—not years ago. This bill does not include the recommendations from JSCEM. The government have picked out bits and pieces, cherry-picking what they want, and the rest is left out. They have chosen bits that will help them with their Senate representation in this place and they have left other bits out—including some very important parts of the JSCEM report.


It is also important to realise that the Turnbull-Greens deal, as I have been saying, is not in line with the JSCEM recommendations. To come in here and suggest that somehow it is, and to suggest that the inquiry we had this morning was about transparency and scrutiny, really beggars belief, because that is not the case—and the coalition do not think that it is. They will stand up in here and say, 'Yes, there was a JSCEM report.' They will not say it is not the actual JSCEM report that is reflected in the bill. They will talk about transparency and scrutiny. They know there has been no transparency or scrutiny and they know it is all about a backroom deal done with the Australian Greens—I assume through their representative, Senator Rhiannon—and with Senator Xenophon. The fact is that the AEC were unable to answer a number of questions that were put to them at this morning's inquiry, and the coalition has refused to put the Department of Finance forward to answer some of these questions.


The matter of public importance that we are discussing states:


The contradictions between Liberal, National, Greens Party and Nick Xenophon's policies and voting records, and their co-operation on radical electoral changes.


When we look at the matter before us, it is no understatement to say that this is a strange group of bedfellows. Surely, those who are listening to this discussion or are present today and support the Greens must be left wondering. If Senator Di Natale's Greens are willing to support the government on this, what else will they do a deal with the Liberals on? Surely, the Nationals voters are equally concerned about what the Liberals might be willing to trade away to secure the Greens' support going forward. We know that these strange bedfellows have had very divergent policies and agendas on a number of issues, but, surely, now we must wonder what any of them stand for. Their actions in this matter suggest that they stand for little but their own political interest—because, in this case, it is not what distinguishes these strange bedfellows but what unites them that defines them. What unites them on the issue of Senate voting reforms is political convenience. The deal that the government has struck with the Greens and Senator Xenophon has nothing to do with principles and policies and everything to do with power and political expediency.


The real test of what the Greens and Senator Xenophon stand for will not be their voting records but rather how they vote on amendments that Labor proposes to make to the voting reform bill to enhance transparency around political donations. A few minutes ago, the following motion was moved in this chamber at the request of my colleague Senator Collins:


That the Senate supports the following reforms to the regulation of political donations:


(a)   a donation disclosure threshold of $1,000;


(b)   a ban on overseas donations;


(c)   a $50 cap on anonymous donations; and


(d)   action to prevent donation splitting that avoids disclosure obligations.


Regardless of what Senator Ryan said in his short statement to the chamber, disclosure amendments put forward have always been opposed by the coalition. It will be interesting to see what the Greens and Senator Xenophon will be doing on these amendments, because, as I understand it—and I can stand corrected—supposedly it is the policy of the Greens and Senator Xenophon to lower thresholds, ban overseas donations, cap anonymous donations and deal with donation splitting. Of course, that would result in a more transparent electoral donations system—something that is actually good for our democracy. It is real reform, not the product of a backroom deal. Labor will move to reduce the donations disclosure threshold, as I have said. We will also move amendments to cover those tasks that arise from the motion moved by Senator Collins.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Are you going to stop taking money from the unions?




Senator McGrath:
  Yes, what about the unions?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Come in spinner—I mean, really! Talk about some transparency in donations: no, they are not interested in that. Already they have got their hackles up. They do not like it. They do not like people talking about it. It will be interesting to see whether the Greens and Senator Xenophon support these reforms. But, from what I have seen so far when we have been talking about the Senate voting bill, I cannot say I have much faith in this actually happening. It has become blatantly obvious that what the Greens say they stand for—what they espouse with great theatrics in this place—and what they actually do are not always the same thing. 


A perfect example of this is the complete disregard for the committee processes that we have seen in the conduct of the inquiry into the Senate voting reform bill. The Greens and the coalition joined together to ensure that there was no real transparency and that there was no real scrutiny of the bill. As I said earlier in my contribution on the bill, we have heard each of the Greens speak at length about Senate committees and their importance to Senate processes. However, we have now seen that the Greens are more than happy to completely do away with real legislative scrutiny and review in order to ram these changes through this place. I highlighted earlier what an absolute farce this inquiry process has been. The laws that determine how representatives are elected to the national parliament should not be cooked up behind closed doors and rammed through the parliament in just a matter of days.

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2016-03-01,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (16:32):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. I start by recognising the work of my colleague Senator Lee Rhiannon, who has been pushing this issue for many years. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally reform our voting system in this country and ensure that the will of the Australian community is reflected in election outcomes. Of course, the Greens have been leading this debate over many, many years. It was Senator Bob Brown who first put this on the agenda 12 years ago, and now we are finally at the point where we may see action on this issue—and that is a good thing for democracy in this country.


The thing that I find absolutely bizarre about the arguments we have heard in this place is the complete and utter inconsistency in the kind of scare campaigns that are being run by the Labor Party on this issue. Let's face it: these are the kinds of pathetic scare campaigns that would make Tony Abbott blush. They are completely and utterly inconsistent. Senator Conroy last week said that this is all about putting Greens bums on seats. We had Senator Brown say that this is about self-interest and power for the Greens. Senator Penny Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying that the Greens will in fact suffer as a result of these changes and may well lose seats. So apparently it is some kind of self-interested ploy that will also end up dudding us at the ballot box. 


Let me make one thing very clear—and this will be a shock to the Labor Party, because I know that is not the model of politics they work with—this is not about self-interest or trying to achieve a particular election outcome. It is not about that. This is about doing the right thing and it is about ensuring that we have an election system that reflects the will of the people. It is a fundamental tenet of any democracy that the election outcome should reflect the will of the people. Let us be honest: the reason the Australian Labor Party keep fanning this ridiculous scare campaign about this issue is that they do not want to smash the business model of the faceless men they rely on for their seats in this place. They have talked a lot about backroom deals. Well, the only backroom deals they are really concerned about protecting are the backroom deals that get them into the Senate. They are scared of the Australian people and they realise they do not have the policies in place or the rigor in their ideological position to prosecute an effective case to the Australian people, so they want to protect these pathetic backroom deals. 


There is a suggestion that the discussion around these issues is under some kind of veil of secrecy, when we have had debates in the lower house, debates here in the Senate, the JSCEM report and a long discussion in our community over many years—as I say, Senator Brown put this on the agenda 12 years ago. The suggestion that somehow this is being done under a cloak of secrecy is really absolutely ridiculous. Give us a break!


I talked about the inconsistent nature of the scare campaigns the Labor Party have been running: we win some seats, we lose some seats; on the one hand it is about self-interest and on the other hand it is electoral suicide. They cannot make up their minds about the implications of this reform. Also, up until very recently, the Labor Party were supportive of this change. I saw Gary Gray quoted in the media as saying that it would be very sad to see these reforms scuttled. Well, he must be pretty disappointed about the party that he is leaving behind and the ridiculous and embarrassing scare campaigns they are running against a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our Senate voting system and finally ensure that the will of the Australian people is reflected at the ballot box. It is an important principle. It is a principle that we have been advocating for many years in this place and it is a principle that I, as a member of the Greens, am very proud to support.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-03-01,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:37):  At the outset I want to say that it is not often that you will find me assisting the Australian Labor Party with their debate on an issue. It is interesting to see that Senator Brown was sent into the chamber to lead the charge. Our quartet of the Cs of the party—the Conroys, the Collins, the Carrs and the Camerons—are too embarrassed to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the elevation and the evolution of these reforms. It is good to see Senator Wong in the chamber, but she has been sent in because of their embarrassment. I am here to help them.


Firstly, let's debunk a few things about the undue haste involved with the journey that has led us to this very important bill to introduce transparency.




Senator Lines:
  It's not a journey—it's a dirty deal.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  This journey started in 2013; the journey started before I arrived in this place and I am about to have my second birthday. The journey involved tens of hours of hearings all over the country, open to anybody who wanted to make a contribution. In fact, 216 Australian individuals and organisations made detailed contributions to this question about the effects of the last federal election. It goes all the way back to May 2013. Were the Labor Party excluded from this? No, they were not. In fact, three of their biggest guns—the Hon. Senator Faulkner, Gary Gray and Alan Griffin from that other place—had been intrinsically involved in this due process for over two years. I was on this committee as a voting member; I sat through all the hearings up until all the recommendations went to government. I might say that these three gentlemen made a fine and thoughtful contribution, but let's not worry about them. There have been mass executions in this place in the last 72 hours—there have been heads rolling in the hallways and people have been expunged from the committee after 2½ years. They have been completely annihilated. It would not surprise me to see their names rubbed off the parliamentary website if Labor gets the chance.


Let's have a look at what the Labor Party's own contribution, which led to the unanimous report that was brought down in this place and that underpins the legislation we are about to debate. This contribution was made by none other than George Wright, who was at the time of the contribution the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. Over the last couple of days we have heard Senator Conroy suggest that Gary Gray was toddling around not reflecting the position of the Australian Labor Party and we have heard reflections on Senator Faulkner today. For goodness sake, the Labor Party is turning on Senator Faulkner—devouring a senator who has left this place and is not in a position to defend his contribution to these evolutionary changes. I am certain if he were here he would not be shut down by this current ALP machinery in the Senate. 


Let's go to the contribution from the ALP national secretariat—this is not a piece of paper which fell off a truck; this is a public document which can be found in the ALP's submission to the inquiry. It was this opposition's contribution to the evolution of what we now know as the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016. They make the point:


The ALP has consistently supported the maximisation of the franchise and the election of representatives that reflect the true intention of the voters.


That goes to the heart of the contribution that they have made over the last 2 ½ years or almost 3 years. It continues:


Following the 2013 federal election ALP is supportive of the JSCEM investigating the system of Senate elections.


So they are supportive of it. This document is dated 24 April 2014—we are well into the inquiry by this time, where a lot of evidence has been taken and many submissions considered. They had the whole body of evidence, but here is my favourite bit:


While not wishing to discourage genuine and new participants in the democratic process, it is clear that the current requirements around party registration and nomination are not proving a sufficient filter to discourage or eliminate those candidates whose objective is to game the current system—


To game the current system!—


and achieve Senate results which do not reflect the true intentions of the voters.


There are two clear words in there—the word 'game', to remain faithful to the document, and the word 'clear'.


They did not use the word 'ambiguous' or 'vague' or 'unclear' or 'abstruse' or 'equivocal' or 'uncertain', 'indefinite', 'confusing', 'indistinct', 'hazy', 'woolly', 'perplexing', 'baffling', 'mystifying', 'bewildering', 'bemusing', 'befuddling' or 'complicated'—they used the word 'clear', C-L-E-A-R. 'Clear' is normally associated with the word transparency, which is what this document is all about. This bill is all about introducing complete transparency, to the best of our ability, for those folk voting to choose who might represent them in this place, particularly in the Senate. Why would anyone not want complete transparency? I will invent some parties so that I do not offend any party—it is not directed at anyone. No, let me offend someone. If someone was voting for the anti marijuana party, what would they think if their vote went through four or five or six or seven sets of grubby hands only to settle on the pro marijuana party, leaving the power of their vote in a place that they would find abhorrent, in a place that was the exact opposite of their intention when they put pen to paper? That is exactly what happens. 


The argument has been put forward that these minor parties need to do these deals so that they can get together and bring some, I suppose, Independents, some points of difference, to this chamber. But to do that ought they not take the time to consider the matter properly? All of the evidence we have heard suggests that this did not happen—they have taken this chattel, the property of the voter, but did they consult the voter? Did they even make some attempt to determine where the voter might be comfortable with their preference going? No, they did not. This is just a simple game of political monopoly—nothing more, nothing less. The value of the vote—this most important chattel, this constitutional right—has been traded off through six or seven hands. It looks like the wrong end of a school lunch, with all the paper crumpled up and greasy and no-one knows who has had their hands on it. It eventually puts someone in this place who was not in the mind of the voter, but they arrive here with the fuel of that vote in their tank. 


There are so many parts of the latest submission that I would like to read, but of course I do not have the time. I want to leave everyone with the same thought: clear and transparent. That is what they wanted when they accepted the unanimous bipartisan report and now for some reason, almost overnight, we now find them taking the opposite position. It is hypocrisy on steroids.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:47):  You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. What we hear from the LNP government and their new coalition partner, the Greens, is all about putting lipstick on the pig. The reality is they did a grubby deal. Some, but only some, of what Senator O'Sullivan has said—I love the way they have to quote Labor; they have no idea—is true. Most of what he said was absolutely inaccurate, and he put his own little National Party spin on things. The reality is that Labor worked very hard on the committee, because we want to see good electoral reform.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  A unanimous report.




Senator LINES:
  Yes it was a unanimous report but that is not reflected in the bill that the Liberals, the Nationals, the Greens and Senator Xenophon want to bring into this place. It does not reflect that deal. How dare Senator O'Sullivan try to speak for Labor, how dare he try to put words into our mouths. The Greens and the LNP will not tell you about the grubby little deal that has been done behind closed doors, and that deal does not reflect the hard work that Labor put in, yes, to get a consensus report because we do believe in electoral reform. So let us get the truth out there.


Earlier today I heard Senator Reynolds say that this will get rid of grubby little deals. I do not know where she has been but what was done between the Greens and Senator Xenophon and the LNP was a grubby little deal—it was a grubby little deal and there is no getting away from that. Obviously the Greens have just rolled over—we have seen their inept negotiation before in this place when they have done other grubby little deals with the LNP. They come in here with a matter of public importance about electoral reform when presumably they had the government there, the government needed their agreement to get this grubby electoral reform through, and they did not even raise the issue—or, if they did raise it, they were such poor negotiators that they were not able to get electoral reform through in relation to political donations. Yet they come in here and try to imagine they are pure. 


What about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that they say they stand for? The LNP have told us over and over again—maybe the Greens were not listening but the LNP have made it crystal clear to Labor—that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is something they want to get rid of. In fact, they confirmed that not so long ago in answer to questions we asked them. It is still their intention to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What about the workers that the Greens pretend to be representing? The government has made it clear it wants the registered organisations bill through and the government has also made it very clear—they made it clear this morning in the media—that the re-establishment of the ABCC is absolutely on their agenda. That is the grubby deal the Greens have done. If they go to a double dissolution, which Mr Green confirmed this morning would give the LNP an advantage—you should read the transcript—then we will see antiworker legislation introduced in this place courtesy of the Greens. We will see antiunion legislation introduced into this place courtesy of the Greens. We already have the LNP's appalling record on our environmental future, and we will see the clean energy corporation, which has done such an amazing job, dissolved. Who will bear the responsibility for that? The Greens will. 


Really, the Greens are no longer even a party of policy—they are a party of grubby deals. That is what they have done here today. I have heard some of the Greens in here today and some LNP senators standing here and saying that this is not a grubby deal. That is nonsense. We had experts this morning in the committee hearing who said that if there were a double dissolution it would advantage the government—plain and simple; it is there in the transcript for anyone to see. That is the truth of it. And that is what the government want to do—they want to pull the trigger. They have had years to undertake electoral reform. They are the government, no matter how much they want to point the finger at Labor—we did this, we did that, George Williams said this, Gary Gray, the member for Brand, said something else. Actually, they are the government, they are in charge and they could have at any time put forward an electoral reform bill to be considered in line with the majority report that Labor worked hard to get to. But, no, they did not because that would not have given them the outcome they want. That would not give them the opportunity in a double dissolution election, as Mr Green said this morning, to actually get control.


As Senator Conroy has pointed out, so inept are the Greens at negotiation that it disadvantages them. They seem to have missed that point entirely, but to stand in here and try to make this somehow Labor's responsibility is nonsense. The responsibility for this grubby deal rests very clearly with the Greens, the LNP government and Senator Xenophon.


No wonder the crossbench senators are very angry about this. Yes, we need a fair system which represents everybody, but this system that is being put forward by the government—whenever they get it through this place with the support of the Greens—is not a fair system. Certainly the experts confirmed that today. In fact, one of them says he believes it will be the subject of a High Court challenge. That is where the government and the Greens are leading us. They are leading us down this clumsy road where there is no certainty. So badly and so quickly has the bill been drafted that they left out some pretty important provisions that had to be slipped into the House through amendments concerning counting votes. How could you forget that? Again, it shows the ineptness of the Greens when it comes to negotiation and the double ineptness of the LNP government. That is a little amendment that was slipped in. If it gets through this place, this bill, seemingly, is headed for the High Court. What a mess. It is not enough that the LNP are the worst government we have ever seen—they cannot manage anything and they are well and truly after workers and ordinary working Australians—they are also going to mess up an electoral system that has been there for 30 years. Yes, of course Labor would welcome the opportunity to look at change, but not change that is rushed through in a dirty deal. That is not what Labor is about.


It was a very rushed committee hearing this morning. I watched it. People were given only a few minutes to ask questions. I am sure that it was stacked with people who were there just to waste time. If you were dinkum about it, there would be a proper inquiry and a proper opportunity, and you would explain to the Australian people what the change represents. Most Australians have trouble understanding the Senate, and you are going to make that worse by rushing this bill through. It is a tricky system. There should have been open hearings so that Australians could come, look, ask questions and listen. It is already a difficult system that needs time and explanation. What you are doing now is just rushing it through with a hearing that went for a couple of hours where you brought experts to Canberra, asked them a few questions and sent them on their way. Now you, the Greens and Senator Xenophon will stand in here and say, 'Well, we had a hearing. There was an opportunity for the public to be involved.' What nonsense.


You do not stand for proper electoral reform. You do not stand for Australian voters. You do not stand for democracy. You just stand for grubby deals done behind closed doors. Worse than that—the Greens cannot even protect things that they purport to hold near and dear. They finally have been exposed. They are about power. They want to be the only minority party in this place. They want their minority view to be the only view that gets aired. That is the deal they have done. They will stand judged on that. In fact, polls are already showing that their membership are not happy with them—and why would they be when the Greens have done a grubby deal with the LNP government?

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-03-01,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:57):  There has been an awful lot said in this place about Senate voting reform recently. Much of it is political rubbish and that contribution fits squarely into that category. What I want to do is very clearly lay out the policy issue that is facing us here. I might add before I do that that, when I want a first-principles reference for how I should behave and how I should vote in this place, I go back to the founding principles of the party that I have the massive honour of representing in this place, the Australian Greens. For the edification of senators, the four founding principles of our party are: ecological sustainability, social justice or a fair go for everyone, peace and nonviolence, and a participatory grassroots democracy—I will say the last one again: a participatory grassroots democracy.


For us—and certainly for me—part of a participatory democracy is the will of the voters being reflected to the greatest degree possible in who is elected into this chamber and, in fact, to both chambers of the Australian parliament. The problem with the current system is that it ends up in a make-up of the parliament which does not accurately reflect the will of the voters because, of course, the power over preferences currently rests in the hands of the backroom wheelers and dealers. It does not rest in the hands of the voters. In a democracy with full participation from voters, the power must rest in the hands of the voters to flow through and choose their elected representatives in this place. I would have thought that did not need to be said, but clearly it does need to be said given some of the rubbish we have heard from Labor on this issue over the last couple of days.


The current system is broken. It led, in 2013, to a candidate in Western Australia being elected on 0.2 of one per cent of the vote. That is fewer than 3,000 votes out of over a million votes cast in Western Australia for senators in that election. Fewer than 3,000 votes—out of a million votes—were enough to get someone elected to this place. That is a broken system, particularly when there were numerous candidates in that election who polled far, far more than 3,000 votes who did not get elected to this place.


I want to rebut, in the short time available to me, a number of Labor's arguments. Firstly, they say this legislation is being rushed. We had a joint parliamentary committee inquiry that ran for nearly a year and a half, held 21 public hearings right around this country and ended in a set of unanimous recommendations that were at that time supported by the Labor Party. Unfortunately, as they so often do for their own political purposes, they backflipped on their position and are now opposed to the Senate voting reform that they previously supported.


We believe that this is an opportunity and that the planets have finally aligned for us on an issue that we have been working hard on and campaigning hard on since 2004, when we had just two senators in this place and when Bob Brown, who was then Leader of the Australian Greens, tabled a first effort from us to deliver Senate voting reform. I add that, if Labor had honoured the written agreement they made with the Greens after the 2010 election that they would actually progress and deliver Senate voting reform to the best of their capacity, we would not even be having this argument now. We would not even be having this discussion now, because this would be done sometime between 2010 and sometime in 2013. But Labor squibbed on that written agreement, just as they did on political donations, that they are now going to use in this legislation that is coming before the Senate to try and wedge us out of supporting it. If they had not squibbed on the written agreement they signed with the Greens in 2010, we would have political donations reform already up and running in Australia. But, no, Labor walked away from their written agreement with the Greens in 2010.


Lastly, if Labor really were serious about avoiding coalition control of this Senate, they would not be obsessing about this; they would be getting out there and selling their policies to the Australian people— (Time expired)

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:02):  Much is made of Senator Muir's low vote, but let us be clear: there are 11 senators sitting in this place who have not faced a vote—11 senators from the coalition, the ALP and the Greens. There does need to be some critical analysis of who sits here and how they got here. For the benefit of the Senate, as I said, we have quite a few senators who have never faced a vote, and 11 of those senators, which equates to 14.47 per cent of the Senate, never stood for election. 


Senator McKim referred to backroom deals. Well, Senator McKim, there were 11 people parachuted into this place who never faced the voters, and two of them belong to the Greens. That is a fact. These are people who find themselves here by backroom deals, as I said, not directly elected by the voters. How does the crossbench compare to some of the government senators and the government's rhetoric in this space about who sits here and how they got here? Fifteen point thirty-eight per cent—that is, two senators on the government's front bench, ministers—got here with fewer than 500 votes; 23.07 per cent, three of them, got there with fewer than 1,000 votes; and five of them got fewer than 1,500 votes, which equates to 38.46 per cent. They never faced the voters. Yet the argument put forward on Q&A by the former minister for small business was that people could not get elected in a local council election— (Time expired)

Senator WANG
 (Western Australia) (17:04):  The Liberals, Nationals, Greens and Xenophon coalition wants to wipe independent voices from the Senate. Might I suggest that there is actually a legitimate way to do that: if the established parties represented the people of Australia better, we would not see one-quarter of Australian voters choosing anyone but them. If members of those parties did their jobs better, I would not be standing here as a senator after receiving four times as many first-preference votes as one of my Liberal colleagues from WA, who is now a government minister. The reason I am here today is that the major parties have not been meeting people's expectations. Let us not forget that fact.


But, instead of performing better, the Liberals, Nationals, Greens and Nick Xenophon coalition has chosen to wipe independent voices from the parliament by doing a dodgy deal. What makes it even worse is that they have cherry-picked from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry to suit themselves and left out key recommendations that would truly give back voting power to the people.


I thank the Labor Party for standing up for a truly representative and diverse Senate. As esteemed Professor of Law George Williams noted, about the bill:


Disturbingly, … it is designed to harm the electoral chances of minor parties while retaining the capacity of major parties to manipulate the preferences of voters through the ordering of candidates.


As a senator, I am more than happy to go back into the workforce as a result of the major parties doing a better job. As an Australian citizen I am really worried about where democracy is headed in this country.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:06):  The committee hearing this morning into the Senate voting system was a bombshell. Recognised experts provided a valuable opportunity to learn more about our complicated Senate voting system and the Liberals' and Greens' radical electoral changes. I was very impressed by the testimony of Mr Malcolm Mackerras. He took a principled stand and said the Senate voting system has been and will be unconstitutional. Mr Mackerras referred to our Constitution as an authority, saying our voting system must be candidate based, not party based. He kindly drew our attention to section 7 of the Constitution to support his claim. It states:


The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate.


The system should be changed, but something this important should not be rushed.


The current system has evolved into one which Antony Green describes as 'a herding process to force voters to vote above the line'. But the new system proposed by the Liberals and Greens is, as Mr Mackerras said, 'breathtaking in its contempt for the Australian Constitution'. He called it a party-list system, because it can be gamed in favour of the big parties by running a just-vote-1 campaign. The Liberals want to change our voting system and then game our voting system by running a just-vote-1 campaign—they are quiet over there, aren't they?—and the Greens are the Liberals' enablers.


The Liberals are deliberately picking industrial fights in the construction and maritime sectors. In the short term they will bring our economy to its knees so that there will be a background of economic chaos and industrial unrest in the lead-up to the federal election in order to justify the inconvenience and expense of a double-D election on the Australian voter—every single one of them. Do you know what? You people should be ashamed of yourselves.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland—Leader of the Glenn Lazarus Team) (17:08):  People of Australia have had enough of career politicians who have never lived in the real world making decisions for those who do. As a result, we now have a crossbench in the Senate which reflects the diverse views and expectations of the Australian people. Based on community sentiment, the crossbench will only increase in size.


Major parties, the Greens and politicians like Nick Xenophon can collude to change the voting system to ignore the will of the people and game the system to benefit themselves, but I believe the will of the people will prevail. The need for real people, who generally understand the challenges faced by true-blue Aussies, to lead our country is only going to grow. While the coalition and the Greens may try to fight this through corrupt voting reforms, this will only prove to be a slight bump in the road for the momentum that is building across the country.


The people of Australia have had enough. They are sick of the Greens telling us to care about the planet while they all fly around the countryside on jets and dine out in the parliamentary dining room. They are sick of the silver-spoon Liberals allowing their mates significant tax breaks while hardworking Aussies are being forced to dig deeper. They are sick of the Nationals who claim to care about rural and regional Australia while farmers are being left to go broke and die through drought and the scourge of CSG mining. 


My message to the coalition and the Greens is this: you can try to retain your filthy, corrupt, self-interested powerbase through a flawed, rushed, undemocratic voting system, but the people of Australia have already seen through you—and I believe that your parties are on the outer.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2016-03-01,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I rise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to acknowledge the service of those Australians involved in the First Gulf War some 25 years ago. There is no greater ask that a country makes of its citizens than to send them to war. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 resulted in the formation of an international coalition of over 30 countries to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions. Australia was one of the first nations to join the coalition force, and our forces were deployed under the auspices of the United Nations. 


As part of this international effort, over 1,800 Australian personnel were deployed in the First Gulf War from August 1990 to September 1991. We owe those men and women an enormous debt of gratitude. As others have noted, this conflict marked several significant firsts for Australia. It was the first time that Australian forces went to war under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force. In addition, HMAS Westralia made naval history by carrying seven women, including two officers, into war for the first time. Today we acknowledge the commitment and professionalism of all those Australian Defence Force personnel who were involved in this conflict. 


Australia was fortunate: our servicemen and servicewomen arrived home safely, and no Australian lives were lost in the First Gulf War. That is not to underestimate the significance of their service or the impact it may have had on the lives of those personnel that were deployed to Iraq. But we were fortunate that our personnel returned home, and we must acknowledge that our coalition partners were less fortunate and lost members of their armed forces. Hundreds of coalition personnel lost their lives in combat in the First Gulf War, with our US ally, alone, suffering 148 battle casualties.


We should also acknowledge that Iraqi forces suffered heavily in the fighting, with casualty estimates in the tens of thousands. I also wish to acknowledge the suffering of Iraqi civilians who, through no fault of their own, were caught up in this conflict. Estimates of civilian casualties in the First Gulf War vary widely and are contested. But what is not in dispute is that Iraqi civilians suffered terribly as a result of the actions of Saddam Hussein's regime.


As senators would be well aware, Australian personnel have revisited this theatre several times since the First Gulf War—and we are likely to be engaged in the Middle East for years to come. Indeed, as we meet here today, around 780 Australian Defence Force personnel are currently deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation OKRA to combat the Daesh terrorist threat in Iraq. I wish to take this opportunity to also acknowledge their commitment. Our thoughts are with them and we look forward to their safe return to their families and loved ones.


Today the Senate marks the 25th anniversary of Australia's involvement in the first Gulf War. Those 1,800 Australian personnel who were deployed as part of this conflict did themselves and our nation proud. Our young men and women deployed in the Middle East today continue the tradition of excellence, professionalism and commitment of their predecessors some 25 years ago. I thank all those who have served and sacrificed for this country.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2016-03-01,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:15):  Twenty-five years ago Australia deployed 1,800 defence personnel to the first Gulf War to assist the US and several other countries push Iraq out of Kuwait. There were 146 casualties from the coalition, but Australia was fortunate enough not to lose one digger in this particular war. In the public gallery watching this debate today is a group of veterans from the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association, one of whom, Rod Thompson, is an Australian Gulf War veteran who served on HMAS Adelaide. Thank you all for your service.


Tomorrow these veterans will join with hundreds of their fellow veterans—brothers and sisters—to rally on the lawns in front of Parliament House at 10am. They will protest at the dysfunctional way they are being treated by this government's Department of Veterans' Affairs. They will protest at the lack of respect shown by the Prime Minister and other senior government politicians. I urge all senators who are supportive to join the veterans and hear what they have to say. They have been ignored for far too long. They will suffer in silence no longer. Too many of them have taken their own lives. So it is time that the Canberra politicians and media listened.


The 1,800 Australians who participated in the Gulf War faced a more devastating battle with their minds and bodies after the Gulf War. A Monash University study, the Australian Gulf War Veterans' Health Study 2003, has shown that Gulf War veterans suffered increasing psychological conditions in the years following the Gulf War—and not just PTSD either. The study showed the Australians deployed to the Gulf War were also suffering from anxiety disorders, depression and increasing problems with drinking as well.


This information is not new to the government. The Department of Veterans' Affairs had this report—and, for that matter, the follow-up report—but sought 'independent' review from an 'independent' epidemiologist of their choosing. And these health problems are not exclusive to the first Gulf War. I do not need a university to tell me that war or warlike service can cause crippling psychological damage on top of physical damage.


The things the government expects these people to do are inhuman—fair enough, that is what they sign up for. But what they do not sign up for is being kicked to the kerb and put through the bureaucratic wringer. Veterans do not sign up to poor treatment by the government. They fight—sometimes to the death—to receive the necessary health care they require. A government needs to step up to its responsibility and make sure the people it is training to deal with the extreme circumstances that are likely to arise during war have the best physical and mental health care available to cope with those extreme situations when they leave the Defence Force.


So why haven't the government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs implemented changes surrounding the results of the Monash University's Australian Gulf War Veterans' Health Study 2003? When you reflect on the fact that the total number of Australians who died in combat overseas for the last 15 years is approximately 49 and the total number of Australian former diggers who have committed suicide is 241 the enormity and weight of the tragedy sinks in. It causes in me a terrible dread. That is obviously not a feeling shared by the major parties, who voted against my private members bill which would have granted an automatic gold card to diggers, peacekeepers and peacemakers who had been in a war or warlike conditions.


Making access to a gold card a tick and flick exercise would allow the most vulnerable and often damaged people to bypass a traumatic and further damaging administrative process and immediately receive the relevant medical care they need. An automatic gold card does not just benefit the digger who receives it. It also reduces the administrative burden for the Department of Veterans' Affairs and alleviates the rate of homelessness and suicide, which translates to a greater number of people being healthy enough to contribute to society and the tax base.


These deaths are avoidable. The bureaucratic fight with the Department of Veterans' Affairs to obtain the benefits and services of a health gold card is responsible for killing our veterans and carving a trail of destruction through their families and friends. You people in here have still not learnt anything from the way you treated our Vietnam veterans and their families and the impact it has had on them.


Last week, for political gain, the coalition government and Labor voted down my legislation. While Labor opposed my legislation for the automatic issue of a gold card to veterans, I can report that today I have had an encouraging meeting with the Labor shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Mr Feeney. After listening to members of the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association he has a much better appreciation of the minimal costs of implementing this system.


I am double checking the costings I received from the PBO and its view that the cost will be less than half of what the government is trying to say it will be—with the added benefit that it will save lives. What cost do you put on the life of a veteran—$100 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, $10 billion? Anytime you work that out, please let me know.


I am also working on a private members bill which will provide retraining for diggers leaving the Australian Defence Force after a number of years of warlike service. The 'Diggers' Bill' will provide a smooth transition for diggers from the Defence Force to civilian life. It will be modelled on America's famous GI Bill, which helped build America and properly rewarded veterans for their service to their country. Put simply, the GI bill provided free university education for their former warriors. Why can't we do the same for our veterans?


The Defence Force is all many of our diggers know. Without education and a transition pathway many will not have transferrable skills and many of them will not know where they can get help. The 'Diggers' Bill' will make sure that their potential is captured and utilised in the civilian world. If every one of our diggers is retrained and placed in the workforce again, our rate of homelessness drops and their sense of purpose is maintained, which will decrease the rate of suicide. It will also broaden the tax base, as the 'Diggers' Bill' will see a rise in work place participation and again reduce the administrative burden that is on the Department of Veterans' Affairs. 


So I say to the government: if you are not prepared to look after the men and women of Australia's military—who have pledged undying loyalty to Australia, trained for war, followed politicians' orders, bled, sacrificed and protected our world famous Anzac legend—then don't bloody well send them in the first place! 


My network supports fair pensions indexation for veterans and former ADF members, including those who have been physically and psychologically wounded or harmed. ADF members who are totally and permanently injured should be treated fairly and respectfully. We will introduce legislation that will protect the purchasing power of all former ADF members by linking their pensions and entitlements to the rising cost of average Australian weekly wages.


The JLN has introduced and had passed by the Senate legislation which guarantees fair pay and pay rises for all members of the ADF and a wage rise safety net by linking our diggers' pay increases to the increases given to Australian politicians or to the CPI—whichever is higher. That bill now sits in the lower house of the parliament awaiting debate. Bring that on any time you like. The only person who has the power to bring that debate on is Prime Minister Turnbull, who has been under a bit of pressure this week.


As I have outlined, there are many positive policies that this government can implement to improve the lot of our veterans. However, to immediately help those who are still serving in the ADF the Prime Minister can authorise the debate of my private member's bill in the lower house. I would love it if the government members voted for it, but I am not holding my breath. But all I ask is that for tomorrow we get a commitment to just have a debate. I would like to know the names of the politicians who would vote against a bill that links their pay to the pay of our diggers. 


In closing, I ask that all people who support our veterans and their call for the automatic issue of a gold card wear a gold ribbon tomorrow to show their support. Today, I also put it out there that I will be issuing those gold ribbons for Anzac Day. One way or another, these people will receive the physical and psychological treatment that they have earned. As a matter of fact, you people in there did  a deal with them. Part of our service for signing up in the first place was that you were to look after us if we were hurt or injured. You have failed to get the job done. In this parliament, the major parties have failed to get the job done. That is why we have had over 250 suicides—and still counting. I can tell you now that you might as well double that number, because they are only the ones that we know of.

 (New South Wales) (17:31):  I think that is the most pathetic argument—if you could even call it an argument—as to why the proper process in this place should not go ahead. This is a government that is an absolute chaos. They are an absolute rabble. Really, they should not bring the rabble that is their party room into this place, because that is what this is. They as a government just do not what is going on from day to day.


To say that we should not follow process on this, and get up and give us 30 seconds about why we should not follow process, is totally unacceptable. We have a position where there are issues that have to be dealt with appropriately and effectively through the processes of the Senate. Just because those opposite do a dirty, rotten deal with the Greens they think they can come in here and disrupt everything about process and procedure. We are not going to cop this. You need to convince us why this should be done. You stood up and you failed to do that. It is totally unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.


The minister has been here long enough to understand that there are issues that we can deal with. There are issues that he can sit down and talk to the opposition about. This is not one of them, when you run this line, when you simply stand up and try and breach the proper processes of the parliament.


We are not unattracted to looking at how we can make things work better in this place. But I will tell you what we are not prepared to do. We are not prepared to cop the chaos of your party room coming back in here because you cannot make up your mind about how you get a tax policy in this country. When you have a Prime Minister who is so weak and so jellybacked that he cannot stand up to the right wing of the party on economic issues then this is unacceptable. The reason you are in such chaos about your procedures in this parliament is that you are not cohesive in what you do in relation to your policy and your party.


We see the minister, Senator Cormann, is now talking to Senator Di Natale to try and stitch up another deal. Senator Di Natale is going to make the Australian Democrats look as if they were strong. All that Senator Cormann has to do is go down and eyeball Senator Di Natale and Senator Di Natale goes into the foetal position. He just curls up. He just gives in: 'Don't give me any more arguments! I give in.' That is the Greens in this place. They roll over as soon as any pressure is put on them


The position that is being put forward by the minister is not consistent with the standing orders. He simply wants to try and bring things on and get the debate curtailed. This is the place where you have to have debate. The sooner the Greens understand that there is a proper process, the sooner the Greens understand that they should not just give in every time that Senator Cormann wanders down and pulls their chain—here is the chain getting pulled again! Senator Cormann and Senator Di Natale are in deep, deep discussion about how they can get this through, how they can overcome the proper processes in this place. It is really pathetic.


I was saying that the Prime Minister should grow a backbone. Senator Di Natale, you should grow one. You should stand up to the intimidation of the National Party and the Liberal Party. When the National Party are congratulating the Greens day in, day out we have a problem. Grow a backbone. Stand up to the intimidation. Be the party that says, 'You should be …,' not what you are at the moment, a grovelling party not doing— (Time expired)

 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:36):  What a display. Dummy spits! I have been hearing them whizz straight past my ears here all day and in the committee room. You must have a gross of dummies around there. Everyone is getting four or five every morning in the party room to go in their pocket. I have never seen anything like it. The hypocrisy is as thick as a shearer's gravy—you could not cut it with a chainsaw. The minute someone tweaks the dummy in your mouth off you go. It would all be funny—it would be a tonne of fun—if you were not interfering in the due democratic process of the Senate.




Senator Conroy:
  How many houses have you got negatively geared?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  You want to have a talk about negative gearing? I will have a talk about negative gearing every day of the week with you, but the fact of the matter is that I have seen another side to the Labor Party.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Penny should be down here. I am watching the two of you. It is only a matter of time now. I can smell the axle grease on the rails. It truly is only a matter of time and she will be gone. We do not have to worry about the changes to Senate reform. She will be gone, you will see to it. I already know when there is trouble in the camp. When you, Senator Conroy, and Senator Carr and one or two others start turning up in committee rooms we know that the democratic process of this Senate and its functions will be disrupted.


This is outrageous. We have a situation here where a non-controversial bill is related and you are going to do anything in your power to frustrate every single step in the operation of this Senate and the government going about its business—a government mandated by the people of Australia. They hunted your mob. Never give another regard to it—you were gone. They were sick and tired of you changing the revolving chairs—Rudd, Gillard, Rudd—and had you stayed there a bit longer there would have been one or two others. Everyone gets a turn in the Labor Party. But the fact of the matter is some of the key people in your party—the likes of Gray, Faulkner and others—respected members who participated for some 2½ years in relation to the development of some transparent measures for this place, have been displaced.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Gary Gray is around there trying to get his head stitched back on. That is how Gary Gray gets rewarded from the Labor movement after all of his years of service.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, Senator Dastyari.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  He was one of the most respected members of the Labor Party. He is up to about stitch 760 to get his noggin back on his shoulders. But the problem was that it was an ugly cut. It was not a clean-cut. It was a cut where there were about eight scalpels at him at the one time.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator O'Neill.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  And he did not even see coming, because had he seen it coming he would have behaved differently in the last three years. This is a Labor man. Had he believed truly that the position of the Australian Labor Party was different to his own position he would have been the true soldier that he is to the Labor movement and he would have remained faithful to the script. But what happened? Here is one setting: he goes to bed, and when he wakes up he throws his leg over the side of the bed and sits up and his head is still on the pillow. You people have no rules. When it comes down to getting serious about issues you have no rules.


Here we are implementing an innocuous bill here. We are simply presenting it to the Senate so it can get on with the business of its work. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  We knew there was trouble. When this mob gets together, when the three of them are in the chamber together, we know that democracy is about to suffer.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Joe, I am surprised you have hung out with them mate. You should go and sit back with the others who are not prepared to sit in the benches with them. I expect far more from you. But, of course, when we talk about democracy, one thing we do know about the Labor Party is that there is no democracy inside the Australian Labor Party. We know that the minute that you disagree or have another view, off comes the noggin. It is gone—blunt chainsaw, one big swipe, ugly scars right across your shoulders. And here we are, the mandated government, the government that the people of Australia put into this place, endeavouring to do an ordinary, innocuous piece of business, and what do you do? Don't any of you breath the words 'democracy' or 'transparency' again in this place. (Time expired)

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:41):  Can I thank the Liberal-National Party of Queensland for coming to the protection of the Greens yet again. It is quite sad to watch. They cannot even manage to stand on their own feet to defend their position. They must think they are actually in a Greens conference where you lock the media out and no-one will notice what goes on inside. Everyone has noticed that you are in bed with the Liberal-National Party—and worse, the Queensland Liberal-National Party. They are your protectors. They cheer you when you speak now. You are going to have to have a shower each time you leave the chamber at this rate. What we have here is a government in a mess, a government that is a shambles. 



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  I was sitting in the committee with you, Senator, and I was reading live texts from your party room as Tony Abbott congratulated Mr Turnbull on his communication skills, and I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, were chuckling out loud in that party room as it was happening because we all knew what was really going on—speaking of knives and chainsaws. Mr Abbott was sowing his head back on and he decided that he was going to have a bit of an outing. He was on a bit of a tear this morning. I was reading it live. I was sitting in a joint parliamentary committee and I was reading texts from the Liberal Party live as it went on. We had Senator Abetz get up and back in his good mate. Where were you this morning, Senator Macdonald? Were you defending the Prime Minister from the attack from the Abbott-Abetz forces? I did not read your name in any texts that were coming out of party room.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I was in the committee with you!




Senator CONROY:
  You were in and out of there.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator CONROY:
  You could have gone down there and defended the Prime Minister.



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator CONROY:
  You could have been down there defending him. I should ignore the interjections, Mr Acting Deputy President, I know.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, you should, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  This is a government that has been unable to make the case today about the urgency of these bills, the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016 and the Trade Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016. This is a government that just wants any distraction. Please just give us a distraction from the shambolic performance of Senator Cormann cutting loose the Treasurer seven or eight times on national television. He says, 'No, it's nothing to do with me. Go and ask Mr Morrison. I don't know about any excesses in negative gearing. Mr Morrison said that. I don't talk to the Treasurer about things like that. That's not my portfolio.' I thought they worked on budgetary matters together. So it is no wonder that Mr Morrison has been calling Senator Cormann the chief bed-wetter, because he has cut him off at the knees in public. The finance minister—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Pause the clock. Senator O'Sullivan, do you have a point of order?




Senator O'Sullivan:
  All things aside, this is a robust chamber, but those sorts of reflections are not helpful. I would urge you to ask the Senator to withdraw that remark. We have already had discussions in this place about how to conduct ourselves this week.




Senator CONROY:
  But that is what the Liberal Party are calling each other! I am quoting the Liberal Party!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Conroy. You should refer to senators by their correct title, and so I will ask you to refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator CONROY:
  I accept your admonishment. So what we have is the finance minister cutting loose the Treasurer. This is while they are weeks away from putting a budget to bed. Senator Cormann tells the country on national television, 'I do not talk to Mr Morrison about those issues.' I mean, really, talk about pushing him out the door into the snow, talk about stealing the paddle and pushing him off up the creek. Senator Cormann is paying back Mr Morrison for betraying Tony Abbott.


I admire your ability to stick with Mr Abbott but, seriously, there is a bit of a rule when you are on the front bench, when you are part of the economic team, when you are the Treasurer and the finance minister—you defend each other publicly. Perhaps Mr Morrison does not actually smoke cigars. Perhaps that is the problem—he has not accepted a cigar from Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann has not even attempted to make a case. He arrogantly thinks, 'I can stroll down to the other end of the chamber, I will tickle senator Di Natale on the tummy and I will tell him that he should do this.' It is all part of this filibuster. It is all part of the Labor Party picking on those nice Greens because they are supporting the government to wipe out and purge this chamber of anyone they do not like, to take revenge. How long do we have to put up with a couple of people who did not get elected to parliament dictating party policy? Because they did not win, they want revenge on Senator Leyonhjelm. Goodness me, grow up.


Senator Cormann wanders down there, tickles Senator Di Natale—(Time expired)

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:47):  First, let me make an apology. I want to apologise to all the people who are listening on broadcast right now who have had to endure 20 minutes of vitriol, of nonsense from the Labor Party. The Labor Party are intent on frustrating the business of this parliament. We get that we have a Labor Party who are torn and divided over the issue of electoral reform. We understand that. We understand there is a big tussle going on at the moment within the Labor Party—there are those people who support electoral reform and those people who do not. That is a legitimate position to take. There are arguments on both sides.


Unfortunately what we have seen is the backroom boys prevail over the likes of the more sensible views of people like Gary Gray, who made an explicit commitment and called those positions held by the likes of Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari 'dumb'. 'Dumb' is one word you could use. You could use many others. Unfortunately that is not the topic what we are debating right now.


What we are debating is whether the Labor Party will frustrate the passage of legislation that will help vulnerable people through a specific assessment tool. It is a piece of noncontroversial legislation that I think we all support. Yet here we have the Labor Party trying to frustrate the passage of that legislation. They continue to delay and obfuscate because they have a bitterly divided Labor Party. What they are trying to do is garner support from their own side for tactics that many on their own side actually rightly do not support. I will make a prediction that you will see this nonsense over the next couple of days and it will just melt away. It will disappear. What we will see then is a return to sanity.


Let me say on behalf of those people who are listening, what you are seeing and hearing is the parliament operating at its worst. You are seeing a parliament trying to frustrate the important business of the passage of legislation that is not particularly controversial using a set of parliamentary tactics in an effort to do that. It has got nothing to do with the issue that has occupied much of the Senate's time over the past few days—that is, the issue of putting power back into the hands of voters rather than leaving it within the hands of the backroom dealers.


There are those people within the Labor Party who like the status quo because, let's be frank, Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari are not here because of their soaring intellect or their capacity to be able to grasp complex policy decisions. They are not here because of that; they are here because they are wheelers and dealers. Their power resides within the fact that they exercise brute power in the back rooms of the Labor Party. Right here what you have is an example of everything that is wrong with that modern day Labor Party, completely lacking in substance, completely lacking in integrity.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Dastyari.




Senator DI NATALE:
  We have got a piece of legislation supported by the Labor Party, who are now doing an about face, doing everything they can to frustrate the parliament from doing its job. We are letting them have their fun at the moment. We figured it is important that they get this stuff off their chest. We know that Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari have fought a long battle inside the Labor Party. It appears, sadly, that their position has prevailed and the likes of Alan Griffin, the likes of Gary Gray and the likes of many others inside the Labor Party have lost the day on the issue of optional preferential voting reform.


That is a shame because it was a reform that they supported back in 2014. It was a reform that up until last year they supported wholeheartedly but not now because of the simple reason that they are worried about losing an election. We are more optimistic about the Australian people. We are much more optimistic about the Australian community. We think that ultimately the outcome of an election should be decided by voters, not by the backroom deals, not by the likes of Senator Dastyari and Senator Conroy. We think ultimately it is voters who should decide the outcome of an election and it is politicians who should get on with the job of governing. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:52):  It is not very often that I agree with Senator Di Natale, but I agree with every word he just spoke. He has actually brought some sense and rationality to this debate. Can I just explain to people who might be listening what exactly we are debating at the moment. It is not Mr Turnbull's economic credentials and not the electoral system but a bill to do a Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme. That is the bill that is before the discussion now. What we are doing is getting a message from the House of Representatives, where this bill has been debated and has passed. It has been brought in here and we are debating whether it should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Can I just urge upon the Labor Party to remember—and explain to those who might be listening to this debate—that this bill is about providing money to people working in disability services and enterprises. I repeat that: this bill that we are debating is about making more money available to people with disabilities working in disability enterprises.




Senator Marshall:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order of relevance. We are not in fact debating a bill at all. If Senator Macdonald thinks we are debating a bill, he is clearly not addressing the question before the chair.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Seselja
):  Thank you, Senator Marshall. I will rule on the point of order. I have allowed Senator Conroy to go well beyond—




Senator Conroy:
  I never mentioned the bill!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, I understand that.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator Cormann:
  He has no idea!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  One at a time! I am ruling on the point of order—




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Conroy just said he had no idea what the actual bill was, yet he is raising points of order. You should call him to order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cormann, but there is no point of order there. I am ruling on the point of order. Senator Marshall, I allowed a fairly wide-ranging discussion when Senator Conroy and others were speaking.




Senator Conroy:
  I never mentioned the bill!




Senator Cormann:
  That is how the Labor Party—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Cormann! I accept that it was wide-ranging. I will allow Senator Macdonald to continue.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. That point of order does not behove our Acting Deputy President, I have to say. We are here debating reasons for urgency—




Senator Marshall:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I should not have to accept that. I am entitled to raise points of order. I was in fact seeking the call and thought I was entitled to the call, because it should go across the chamber. I wanted to address the actual question and the process and procedure, and not some of the politics that is being talked about.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Marshall. Senator Macdonald has the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I always know I am making an accurate point that people listening to this would be interested in when the Labor Party keep taking points of order on me. That was confirmed just now. This debate is about the urgency of the message from the House of Representatives to deal with the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016. It is a debate on why this is urgent. Why is this urgent? Because it deals with providing money to people with intellectual disabilities affected by the representative proceedings to claim and receive agreed payments increases.


I would assume that the Labor Party will agree with the bill, but it is important that it is dealt with now so that payments can start. That is why the bill is important. That is why it is a matter of urgency. For the previous speaker who took the point of order, that is why the bill is a matter of urgency. That is why we should deal with the message from the House of Representatives as a matter of urgency, so that we can get on to the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme that will provide more money for people working in disability enterprises. Why would the Labor Party be filibustering so we cannot start the debate on that bill to provide more money for people with disability enterprises? Why would you want to delay this, Senator Conroy? This is for money for people with a disability.



The Labor Party are using filibuster tactics to prevent the Senate from moving on and dealing with this bill. They do it because they spat the dummy over some other bill that we heard Senator Conroy talk about for five minutes without a word of a point of order from those in the Labor Party, who always find reasons to take points of order on me. The Labor Party are defending the indefensible on the electoral matters bill. As Senator Conroy spoke for five minutes on that, I feel I should just answer that for 30 seconds or so. Senator Conroy, and I ask Labor senators generally: what is wrong with allowing the Australian public to actually determine the preferences that they choose when they go to the next ballot for a Senate? The Labor Party want the bovver boys—the factional heads of the Labor Party—to determine who they will vote for in their preferences. We want the people of Australia to determine their own preferences.


I come back to the reason for the urgency with which we should accept and deal with the message from the House of Representatives: so that we can deal with a bill which will provide money to people with intellectual disabilities working in disability enterprises. It is a wonderful idea. I am sure the bill will receive unanimous support when it comes before us. Why is the Labor Party delaying debate on that essential bill? We should be debating it now.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria—Deputy President of the Senate and Chair of Committees) (17:58):  I do not often speak on a political nature in the Senate, or I rarely do anymore, but, given some of the contributions made about the actual process, I do want to lend my views to the processes we are dealing with here. What we are actually debating is whether the bills should be exempt from the cut-off. It is easy for people to say—and people have said—that to exempt a bill from the cut-off is the normal process of events and procedure in the Senate. Of course, it is not. The cut-off is actually there because it has been developed over a long period of time through the Senate and is part of the Senate practice to stop bills being brought in towards the end of the session in order to ensure that they get less scrutiny and have less debate upon them. This was something first identified and complained about by Greens senators. Greens senators actually initiated the early cut-off processes in this chamber, and it was for very good reason. Many senators, particularly senators who were not government senators, had problems with bills being introduced and not being given the appropriate scrutiny.


It is true that from time to time bills need to be given an exemption from the cut-off, but that is more unusual than it is the norm. The norm is that bills that are subject to the cut-off do not get debated until the following session. Now, if there is an urgent requirement for a bill to be debated, one would assume that discussions are had around the chamber and agreement is reached about why the urgency is needed, and those matters are then put before the chamber. If it is agreed that they are urgent, there is agreement on that. I have been in this chamber many, many times where agreement has been reached, and it is simply a process motion for the bills to be exempted from the cut-off because the argument has been made and it has been accepted that bills should be exempted from the cut-off.


But to simply bring things in without discussion—and I am advised that, at least in terms of the opposition, there was no discussion whatsoever about why these bills needed to be exempt from the cut-off; they were simply introduced into the chamber to be exempted from the cut-off, which is against the practice of the Senate. The normal practice of the Senate, established over many, many years and, as I said, initiated by the Greens senators, is that, if bills are introduced late, they should be dealt with in the next session unless there is an urgent reason. Again, all I can say is that a lot of people are assigning different motives to why leave was not given to move a motion to exempt these bills from the cut-off, but I just want to put on the record that the normal process is that bills that are subject to the cut-off should not be dealt with until the next session.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion to suspend standing orders, moved by Senator Cormann, be agreed to.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:09):  The rabble that this government have descended into has again been demonstrated right here. We have a government that are in paralysis in their own party room. They cannot even make the case—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What have you got against disabled people?




Senator CONROY:
  You do not even know the start date for these bills. The government have got no idea so they are desperate for a distraction right now. Unfortunately, to cover their embarrassment they can now call on their new besties the Greens. The government have failed to make the case on these bills. It is a simple fact that not one government member who spoke in this debate in this chamber made the case for why these need to go through the cut-off. 


We do know that, due to the filthy deal that has been done between the Greens and this government, we are going to a double-D on 2 July, because what we have had is the turkeys vote for an early Christmas. Senator Cormann is smooth. He has actually talked them into voting for their own execution. That is good. Paul Keating once said: in politics always back self-interest. These guys have voted for their own execution. It did take some special expertise by Senator Cormann on this.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am wondering if you or Senator Conroy could explain how what Senator Conroy has said so far has anything to do with the subject of the motion. All he has talked about is the Greens and deals. This, as I understand it, is a very formal motion. I would like you to rule on whether Senator Conroy is being relevant to the motion.




Senator CONROY:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: Senator Macdonald is deludedly sitting over there ignoring the fact that this debate and what I have been saying go to the heart of why we oppose this motion—because they have not made the case for this to be brought on. They have not made the case because they are a rabble and they have not made the case because they—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have heard enough on the point of order. I can rule. There is no point of order. You have the call, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you very much. So try not to get up and distract from the rabble that is sitting in front of you, Senator Macdonald. If you had got more votes than Senator Bernardi, you would have been off to New York and not had to worry about this. Let me be very clear. This is a government that is using its numbers with the Greens to pass this—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I take a point of order in that I am quite sure that the speaker is mad. I have no idea why he is talking about New York. It is not something I have ever sought.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Macdonald. There is a provision against frivolous points of order too, I add in passing. Senator Conroy, you have the call.




Senator Heffernan:
  Senator Conroy, do your fly up.




Senator CONROY:
  Now we have Senator Heffernan adding his usual earthy contribution to the debate. Let us try to stay focussed on the bills at hand. The government are masquerading that the bills are urgent when we all know that, because of a filthy deal that the government have done with the Greens, we are going to a double-D. Because of a filthy deal that they have done to sell out their values, to sell out, we are going to a double-D. Any pretence whatsoever that these are urgent bills needs to be tossed out the window. Any pretence that these are urgent bills does not stand up to scrutiny. It does not actually pass the smell test. 


These bills are being brought in here to distract from the rabble that this government has become. We have a finance minister who cut the Treasurer loose today on national television. We have a Prime Minister who has taken control of the tax debate off the Treasurer—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  and put his own head of the Public Service in charge of it. It is relevant, Senator Macdonald, because your government is trying to hide the fact that it is calling a double-D. This is not an urgent bill, and it is not an urgent bill because of all the other things that have been going on in this chamber, which you are party to. You are the party that has gone to the Greens and stitched up a deal to do Senate reform and purge all crossbench senators. Tragically, they did not work out that you are actually going to call a double-D on them and they are actually going to purge themselves. Senator Siewert, it was nice. I have had a lot of fun with you in the chamber, but you are not coming back after a double-D, and there are a couple more of you to go as well.


What we saw today in a joint parliamentary committee hearing about Senate electoral reform, which goes to the heart of this debate, is that Mr Antony Green, the great advocate on behalf of Senator Rhiannon, actually confessed for the first time that the Liberals will get 38 senators in a double-D.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Oh, he didn't.




Senator CONROY:
  Yes, he did.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He didn't.




Senator CONROY:
  He said it. It is in the transcript. You should read it. I have already put a press release out with the transcript in it. That is what he said. Then he said, 'Oh, and they'll also get three senators out of six in a half-Senate election.' I can count. That gets you to 38 as well. So the great supporter of the Greens, who has been—oh, my goodness!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  If you resume your seat, Senator Conroy. Senator Macdonald, on a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I raise the same point of order again, on relevance. Mr Deputy President, if you are ruling as you did before, could you explain to me how what happened in a committee this morning and what Anthony Green said—




Senator CONROY:
  Antony.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  has any relevance to the motion before the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  So your point of order is on relevance?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Yes.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have been listening to the whole debate, going through its process, and I have also heard the ruling of the previous chair in relation to a very similar point of order. It has been a wide-ranging debate, and on that basis, being consistent—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  But someone took a point of order on me.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Indeed, and the ruling was made, and that is the ruling I will be following. So there is no point of order. Senator Conroy, you have the call.




Senator CONROY:
  I would just make the case that Senator Macdonald is correct, but his points of order were not upheld, because it has been a free-ranging debate—you are right—and Senator Macdonald is a beneficiary of the free-ranging debates.


But what we have is a government that is going to a double-D, and the cat was belled this morning when Antony Green told the joint parliamentary committee that in a double-D the government will get 38 senators, and in a half-Senate election they will get three out of six. That is what he said. Did they not explain that to you? When you did the deal, did they not explain that to you?


So this is a government that has pulled the wool over the eyes of this chamber already once today by how it voted. It is a government that has no policy agenda. It is pretending bills are urgent when they are not. But the greatest con on disabled people in this chamber is coming from those opposite, because they have no intention of trying to pass this bill before they call the double-D—no intention whatsoever of passing this bill, because you are calling a double-D.


It is a double-D that will have terrible ramifications in this country. It will mean there is no chance to save and rescue the National Broadband Network from the indolent minister, the indolent board and the indolent management, whose stock in trade is to consistently mislead the Australian public about what is really going on. There will be no chance to save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation when the double-D sitting is held and those opposite use their numbers in both chambers, if they are lucky enough to win, to wipe it out. There is no way to protect Australian workers from the penalty rate cutting that will take place by those opposite. There is no way, when they get back to it, that the GST will not be increased, because, just as John Howard said in the last few days, you are going to have to go back and increase the GST. It is in their DNA.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  Why this is relevant is that those opposite cannot make the case for a positive vote in this chamber on this issue, because they are conning everybody who is listening. They are conning the disabled people in this country. You are calling a double-D. You have no intention of passing this bill before you call the double-D—no intention whatsoever of passing this bill. Don't you sit here and try and pretend that you are doing something for disabled people. Your plan is to use this bill to disguise the fact you have no agenda left and you have pulled the best con—I take my hat off to you, Senator Cormann, as I said earlier. You really have taken the Greens for a ride. Paul Keating said, 'Always back self-interest.' Well, those mugs down there did not understand what their own self-interest was. They were bent on revenge, and you have played them on a break. You have sucked them in, and this country will be far the worse for it because of this double-D that you are planning—the double-D that makes this bill not urgent, Senator Macdonald.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You can sit there and talk and talk and talk, but this bill is not urgent.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should take a pill. You are going madder.




Senator CONROY:
  Hanging around with you too much, Senator Macdonald, has that effect on people. You should start by looking in the mirror if you want to talk about madness.


But let me repeat: the government, after five speakers or so, have yet to make the case for why this was urgent. After five speakers, they have not made the case for why this bill should proceed in the manner that it is being put forward. They have not made the case for why the Senate should be turned upside down, other than the fact that we all know their party room meeting was a shambles this morning. We all know that, sitting in the joint parliamentary committee on electoral reform, I was reading live tweets telling me what Mr Abbott said and what Senator Cormann said. Senator Cormann, in fact, tweeted out of the room. So everyone was paying attention in there. There was sledging backwards and forward. We all knew what was going on. There were Senator Bernardi, Senator Abetz and all of those who wanted to get behind Senator Cormann's undermining of the Treasurer of this country. We all know what this debate is about. You are afraid to bring your real agenda on. You are afraid to reveal your tax policy to the Australian public. You do not want there to be a budget. You do not want to try to govern this country. You do not want to explain what the excesses of negative gearing are—identified on a number of occasions—because you want to hide behind the pretence that this bill is urgent. All of those issues will catch up with you over the coming months. For those in the Greens corner, when that double-D is called on 11 May and held on 2 July, all of the consequences of the filthy deal to sell out their policies and what they believe in will be seen. But the good news is that they will not all be here to realise it. They will be sitting in their homes because they will not be returned.


We know that your attempt today to upturn the Senate procedures to bring on bills that you have not told anyone you are going to bring on and to try to force the Senate to debate something else is not serious. You could prove me a liar. All you have to do is stand up here and say, 'I guarantee you there's no double-D happening. There'll be no election called before or on 11 May.' That is all you have to do to prove me wrong. Those opposite simply have to say, 'Senator Conroy, you're a fool. There's no double-D.' Then the attempt to bring this bill on becomes legitimate. Until you can stand up and promise this chamber and the people of Australia that there is no double-D, you have zero credibility in pretending you are interested in disabled people, good governance in this chamber or even good governance of this country. You are an absolute shambles. Your cabinet leaks. Your finance minister dumps on the Treasurer in public on national television. The Prime Minister, egged on by Senator Cormann, strips him of his portfolio responsibilities. This is a full-scale mugging of the second Treasurer that you have had! You have already tossed one Treasurer overboard!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  It is relevant, Senator Macdonald, because this is about the scam you are attempting on this chamber. There is no urgency. The two people who could make this case are sitting right there. They could stand up and say, 'Senator Conroy, every word you have said is wrong, because we will not be calling a double-D on 11 May, the day after the budget.' This is the highest-taxing and highest-spending government in Australian history, but you claim to be the party of low tax. John Howard hit new records, and you are running second at the moment. You do not want to try to bring down a budget. You are terrified of the budget because your DNA is about cutting people's wages, cutting people's penalty rates, increasing the GST, cutting pensions and introducing $100,000 university degrees. That is what you want to introduce to this country. It is still your official policy. You still want to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


All of those things are part of the agenda that those opposite are trying to hide from us today with this weak attempt to pretend they are interested in disabled people. This chamber should see through it. You have tickled the tummy of a leader who is looking for friends. If you read his Facebook page—he is very popular on his Facebook page today—I think you should send him a like. Senator Ludlam, send Senator Di Natale a few likes on his Facebook page because he really needs them today. Send him a few likes. He is feeling a little bit tender because Greens supporters have woken up to another filthy deal to help this government. I say to the Greens: you protected tax avoiders with the government last time. Now you are giving them the loaded gun to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, introduce $100,000 university educations, put in place pension cuts, put in place cuts to penalty rates and increase the GST. That is what the Greens have signed up to. So just tickle their tummy again, Senator Cormann, and get them to vote with you on this. Senator Macdonald, I thought you were getting up again; I am quite disappointed.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  There is not much point in it, I have to say.




Senator CONROY:
  There is not much point in anything you say, but you still do it a lot! I have to admire it. This is a government that is bereft. Remember when Mr Turnbull became the Prime Minister? He could have said, 'Good governance starts today.' But, no—he actually started off with, 'Isn't it a wonderful time to be alive? Australians are governed by me.' It is heart-warming to see. This is a government that is completely and utterly cannibalising itself from the inside. There is no greater demonstration of that than when the finance minister of this country, on national television, dumps on the Treasurer and will not back him up. Senator Cormann, that is your job. Your job is to back up the Treasurer. Your job is to support him. It sort of comes with the territory of being the finance minister and the Treasurer. The simple fact that you cut him loose today says everything about the shambolic government that you are involved in.


Net debt went over $1 trillion today—congratulations! You like to mock Senator Wong. You have more debt than anybody else in history, Senator Cormann. You are the high-debt finance minister. You are never going to deliver a budget surplus while you are finance minister. That is the badge of honour that you will wear. You are never going to do it while you are the finance minister. You will never deliver it, and Senator Morrison will never deliver a surplus in this country either—it is Mr Morrison; we do not want to promote him.


Let's be clear: this is a government that has lost the plot.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You have you gone quite mad.




Senator CONROY:
  I am having my 20th anniversary dinner tonight.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should lie down and take a Bex.




Senator CONROY:
  There will probably be a few Bexes in the morning!


This is a government that is attacking itself in its own party room. The former Prime Minister got up and, with his tongue firmly in his cheek, extolled the virtues of Mr Turnbull's communication skills. Mr Turnbull did not make it two months barracking for a GST, and Mr Abbott was openly laughing in his face in the party room. He was mocking him in the party room. The former Prime Minister was mocking the current Prime Minister in the party room. That is what it has descended to. That is why you, those opposite, are in here right now trying to pretend that this is an urgent bill. You all know that you are going to a double-D in July. 


I will repeat again in my last few moments speaking that you can prove me wrong. The first words out of the mouths of Senator Fifield or Senator Cormann can be, 'Senator Conroy, you couldn't be more wrong. We're not going to a double-D. We're going to serve our full term.' But you are not going to say that. So do not stand up next and try to pretend that you care about disability. Do not stand up and claim that a trade bill is urgent because you do not have the courage to govern to the end of your term.


You have mugged those in that corner. You have absolutely taken them for gooses, and their gooses will be cooked. You will be okay, Senator Ludlam. We know you are the most popular politician in Western Australia. It is Senator Siewert I am a bit worried about. I am. I want to see Senator Siewert back here. I want to see her come back here.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  No, we should be fair and think of the alternatives! You, the government, have mugged the Greens. All you have to do is stand up next and say, 'There'll be no double-D. Senator Conroy's wrong. This is urgent because we do want— (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:32):  The government will outline the reason why it thinks that these bills are urgent, but I will tell you why I think these bills— (Time expired)




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt, Senator Siewert. I am very interested to hear you speak. I am just wondering what happened to the normal order of calling the opposition, the government and then the crossbench. You clearly saw me, Mr Deputy President. I saw you looking at me. You have again made the ruling that the crossbenchers take preference and precedence over a member of the government side.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have not made any such ruling, but I have given Senator Siewert the call.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The call does usually go around the chamber. I will tell you why I think the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016 is urgent. It is the same reason I thought it was urgent every time we have been discussing this issue. While I disagreed the first time the government brought in the bill in 2014 because they were not being fair to people with disability, the reason I wanted to make sure this issue was dealt with is that it has been on the agenda for years. People with intellectual disability have been short-changed.


Shame on you, the opposition, for using this particular bill to try to frustrate the government's agenda. I, for one, will not stand by silently while you use people with disability to hold up this bill. You ticked and flicked this bill through the House of Representatives because you knew how important it was for people with disability. You also ticked and flicked the trade bill through the House of Representatives. But I particularly want to talk about the bill that—




Senator Ludwig:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I waited to see whether or not the senator's language would change. Could the speaker address her remarks to the President or the Deputy President, as the case may be, rather than using the word 'you' constantly; it is becoming aggravating.




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order, would you also consider the fact that every time members of the opposition have been speaking today in their attempts to frustrate this Senate they have been looking at the Greens. So maybe instead of directing their speeches to us they should be doing the same thing.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Siewert. I have been watching this debate since prior to being in the chair and I think you are right. I remind senators that they should direct their comments through the chair. There has been leeway given in this particular debate.




Senator SIEWERT:
  In that case, Mr Deputy President, I will make sure that I am looking at you and the general direction of the front of the chamber! However, I will get back to the point because I am sure the opposition are trying to distract me from the point I am trying to make. They should hang their heads in shame that they are using this particular bill to try to frustrate the work of this chamber.


We will have ongoing discussions in the future about election reform, but this particular bill is about people with disability, particularly intellectual disability, who have been working in ADEs and other locations who have been short-changed. They have been waiting for years for compensation. The reason I think this bill should be exempt from the cut-off order is that the sooner this issue is dealt with the sooner the Federal Court can settle some of the cases that are currently before it. I, for one, would urge the government to make this noncontro. In fact, I thought it probably would end up as non-contro legislation so it could be dealt with. I thought that everybody in this parliament was now agreed that we should in fact be acting to end the discrimination against people with disability who have been caught up on substandard wages.


In the past in my numerous contributions on this particular matter, I have pointed out to the chamber and those listening that, if people had had access to the money that they have been denied because they were given substandard, inadequate wages, it would have made a substantial difference to their life's progress. In the same way, people getting access to compensation as soon as possible will make a substantial difference. You have picked on the wrong bill to make your point, at the expense of people with disability who deserve compensation. That is not up for argument here. I believe these bills should be exempt from the cut-off order, which is why I think this motion should be brought on.




Senator Sterle:
  Then sit down and stop talking!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind senators that they ought not interject at all if they are not sitting in their seats and that, even when they are in their seats, interjections are disorderly. 




Senator SIEWERT:
  I was in fact winding up, but, talking about winding up, perhaps the opposition is trying to wind up the speakers. These bills should be exempt from the cut-off order. Under any other circumstances, I am sure the opposition—who I know have also been very keen to help people with disability who have been caught up under this flawed approach in the past—would have let this through. I urge them to address this issue so that it does not get held up in this chamber for no other reason than the opposition trying to turn this into a chaotic place and frustrate the process. They have picked on the wrong bill. They should change their minds, support this through and let us get on with making sure that people with disability who have been waiting for so long actually get their compensation.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that a motion to exempt these bills from the bills cut-off order may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today until determined.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE 





IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





BUSINESS SERVICES WAGE ASSESSMENT TOOL PAYMENT SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill



The bill will increase payments under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme from 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the difference between the actual wage paid to the eligible person and the amount they would have been paid under the productivity-only component of the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool, and make associated amendments to improve the payment process.


The bill will also extend all relevant scheme dates by 12 months so people have more time to register for the scheme and submit applications.


The amendments will give effect to a recently mediated settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and the Applicant in a representative proceeding in the Federal Court of Australia (Duval-Comrie v the Commonwealth VID 1367/2013). If the bill is passed and the terms of the settlement agreed by the Federal Court, the representative proceeding will cease.




Reasons for Urgency



The payment scheme, as amended by this bill, is the method agreed by the parties to settle the representative proceeding.


Passage in the Autumn sittings would allow the 10,000 people with intellectual disability affected by the representative proceeding to claim and receive their agreed increased payments quickly.




STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE 





IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





TRADE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1)





Purpose of the Bill 



The changes proposed in Schedule 1 of this Bill (to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997) allow the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme to continue beyond 1 July 2016, by amending the definition of a grant year. At the same time, a number of other minor policy and technical amendments will be made to ensure the continued effective and efficient operation of the scheme. Some of these changes introduce cost-saving measures that will help to bring scheme demand closer in line with the Budget. 


The changes proposed in Schedule 2 of this Bill seek to change the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, and the consequential changes required to other Acts of Parliament resulting from this change. 




Reasons for Urgency




Schedule 1: The Export Market Development Grants Act 1997, as it currently stands, does not make provision for a grant year past 30 June 2016. The Act must be amended if the EMDG scheme is to continue to operate past this date. 


A number of the measures in this bill are cost-savings, and they are being introduced to help bring scheme demand closer in line with the budget. Failure to have these measures in place by 1 July 2016 will mean that they are introduced and communicated retrospectively. As they reduce an applicant's entitlement to a grant, this would not be a satisfactory outcome.


Delaying passage of this bill would cause unnecessary uncertainty for small businesses, and undermine the purpose of the scheme. Having the amendments passed during the Autumn Session will provide certainty for Australian small and medium-sized exporters, who will be planning their 2016-17 marketing strategies at that time. 



Schedule 2: The Government has placed increasing priority and importance on attracting foreign investment into Australia to help secure Australia's future prosperity. Changing the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission highlights this importance.

BUSINESS SERVICES WAGE ASSESSMENT TOOL PAYMENT SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2016



This Bill will amend a payment scheme established by the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Act 2015 to give effect to a recently mediated settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and the Applicant in a representative proceeding in the Federal Court of Australia (Duval-Comrie v the Commonwealth of Australia VID 1367 of 2013).


The Australian Government provides funding to Australian Disability Enterprises through the Disability Services Act 1986 (Cth)to provide employment support to workers with moderate to severe disability. There are 184 organisations supporting around 20,000 workers with disability in such employment across Australia. Australian Disability Enterprises can use wage tools prescribed in the Supported Employment Services Modern Award 2010 to determine pro-rata wages for workers with disability. The Business Services Wage Assessment Tool the subject of the Federal Court proceeding was previously used for this purpose. 



In 2012, two supported employees were found through a separate Federal Court decision to have experienced indirect discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), because their wages were assessed under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool based on both their productivity and competency (Nojin v the Commonwealth of Australia [2012] FCAFC 192). The subsequent representative proceeding on behalf of a limited group of supported employees was also initiated and remains before the Federal Court of Australia. The applicant seeks compensation calculated on 100 per cent of the difference between the wages they were paid and the wages they would have been paid if their wage was assessed based only on their productivity. 



As a result of the earlier Federal Court decision, the Commonwealth Government established the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool payment scheme in 2015, which has been providing one-off payments to eligible supported employees of Australian Disability Enterprises at 50 per cent of the difference between the wages they were paid and those they would have been paid if the competency component was not included in the wage tool.


The Commonwealth's payment scheme is helping to provide certainty to supported employees that their employers will not close because of concerns about employers' perceived liability for discrimination following that earlier Federal Court case. 


With significant Commonwealth support, Australian Disability Enterprises are commercial businesses employing people with disability who need support to stay in paid work. These supported employees are paid wages using revenue from the enterprises' business activities.


There are 184 organisations operating Australian Disability Enterprises in communities across Australia – supporting 20,000 workers with moderate to severe levels of disability.


Supported employees are paid a pro-rata wage. Their wage is determined using a wage tool stipulated in the Supported Employment Services Award 2010, which is one of the 'modern awards' in the Commonwealth workplace relations system.


The Business Services Wage Assessment Tool was one of these wage tools. It was developed by the Australian Government in consultation with stakeholders, and was first used in 2004. The tool determined a worker's wage by measuring both their productivity and competence in performing a job. 


On 16 December 2015, the Commonwealth announced that a settlement had been agreed with the Applicant in the representative proceeding before the Federal Court. The amendments in this Bill will give effect to that settlement agreement.


If the Bill is passed, and the terms of the settlement are agreed by the Federal Court, the representative proceeding will be dismissed by the consent of the parties, and the supported employees concerned, along with their families and carers, will move into a more stable and certain future.


Importantly, the terms of the settlement are supported by advocates for supported employees, including the AED Legal Centre and People with Disability Australia, who have called it 'an outcome which sees wage justice for these employees'.


The parties have agreed to settle if, amongst other matters, the payments under the current scheme are calculated at 70 per cent of the difference between the wages the person was paid and the wages that would have been paid if only the productivity component of the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool had been used, that is, not including the competency component of the wage tool. Under the current legislation, a person receives 50 per cent of the difference.


If employers had used productivity-only tools, it is clear that the average wage of supported employees would have been higher. But this undoubtedly would have raised employers' labour costs. It is equally clear that some employers would have responded by reducing employees' work hours, or even stopped hiring some or all supported employees. In these circumstances, the important benefits of supported employment for the employees, their families and carers would have been lost. 


The parties have taken initial steps to overcome these difficulties, and have reached a payment amount that is fair to all of the relevant eligible supported employees. 


The payment scheme is currently available to all intellectually impaired persons. While the representative proceeding represents a more limited class of employees, the Commonwealth, via this Bill, will ensure that everyone eligible under the scheme will receive the increased payment. The Government has taken this approach to maximise equity between all supported employees with intellectual impairment who were paid wages under the tool. 


Under the current Act, eligible supported employees will only be paid if they register for the scheme by 1 May 2016. This Bill extends the dates for registering, applying for, and accepting the payments from the payment scheme by 12 months so people have more time to register for the scheme and submit applications. 


The Bill will also allow a deceased person's legal personal representative to engage with the payment scheme on their behalf. The money that would have been paid to the person, if the person were eligible and the offer accepted will now be able to be paid to the person's estate.


Importantly, the Bill does not remove or weaken any of the protections of the current Act. For example, the payment scheme retains key features that provide supported employees with choice and control, including:


the applicant's ability to nominate a person to assist them with the payment scheme and be appointed as a nominee;


the ability for applicants to seek both internal and external reviews on decisions regarding eligibility and offers of payment; 


extension of times for acceptance period and review period; and 


the ability for applicants to seek financial counselling and legal advice, at the Commonwealth's expense.


Any person who has already received a payment under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool payment scheme will receive a top-up to reflect the increased payments provided by this Bill. Importantly, people will not have to make an application or seek further legal advice or financial counselling to receive these top‑ups. 


The Bill will still allow people who have received offers of payment to seek independent legal advice and financial counselling. The Bill will amend the legal advice provision to be voluntary, rather than mandatory. This will remove a current impediment to participants receiving their payments quickly, especially for those who receive small offers of payment. Access to these services continues to be funded under the scheme by the Commonwealth, and the Government remains committed to ensuring people are able to make informed choices about their access to payments as a result of previously having been assessed using the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool. 


People receiving payments under the scheme are eligible for a lump sum in arrears tax offset. In addition, a payment under the scheme does not count as income, which therefore reduces the risk of affecting an individual's social security entitlements. Payments under the scheme are also indexed to the Consumer Price Index rate for each year in the period relating to payment amounts. The effect of these protections and enhancements is to effectively increase the payments made to individuals under the payment scheme. 


To ensure people participating in the scheme have the opportunity to provide further information regarding their applications or raise any concerns, the scheme will have both internal and external review processes. 


Self-evidently, any person previously assessed using the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool has a choice as to whether they receive a payment from the Tool payment scheme. As with the resolution of any legal claim, if a person accepts an offer under the payment scheme, they will be unable to make any further claims in relation to the assessment of wages under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool. 


As part of the representative proceeding's processes, class members have had an opportunity to opt out. As agreed with the other parties to the representative proceeding in the Federal Court, if this Bill is passed by the Parliament and the terms of the settlement are accepted by the Court, the proceeding will be dismissed. 


Nonetheless, this Bill does not take rights away from individuals who are not members of the class currently before the Federal Court. As long as they have opted out of the proceeding or never joined it, people who disagree with the terms of the settlement or the payments offered by the payment scheme can choose to continue to pursue their rights through the courts. Neither the current payment scheme, nor the proposed amended form of the scheme, prevents an individual from making that choice. 


The Commonwealth Government is of the firm view that the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool payment scheme provides the most favourable outcome for employees, their families and carers by removing any perceived liability on the part of supported employers, Australian Disability Enterprises, who have previously used the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool to assess the wages of their employees. 


Self-evidently, it is both economically rational and socially just to support employment for people with disability. This Bill is one of many measures that the Government has put forward to achieve that important goal. These include funding to help the supported employment sector transition to new wage arrangements and funding to help the sector become more independent, sustainable and robust.


Together with the improved payment scheme proposed in this Bill, these additional measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to help to ensure all forms of employment for people with disability are widely available and secure for the future. 


TRADE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2016


The changes proposed in this Bill, the Trade Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, give effect to several key recommendations resulting from the 2015 Review of the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme conducted by Mr Michael Lee in the second half of last year, as well as making several minor policy and technical amendments designed to improve the operation of the Export Market Development Grants Act, and to make changes designed to deliver savings to align the scheme closer to its budget.


The changes proposed in this Bill also change the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission.


EMDG celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, and since 1974, has been reviewed fifteen times, with ongoing bipartisan support for the Scheme. These reviews have consistently found the scheme to be an effective and efficient means of promoting the development of Australian exports under successive governments. The most recent review concluded that EMDG is effective in conferring a net benefit to the Australian economy and community, with increased economic activity across the economy and enhanced community welfare attributable to the scheme.



Given this background, and the many amendments that have been made over the years to reflect changing economic circumstances and budget decisions, major changes to the scheme are not warranted at this time. Indeed, in his 2015 review report to me in June last year, Mr Michael Lee stated, ""My recommended changes to the scheme will add certainty and confidence to long-term planning for exporting businesses, governments and Austrade. I am recommending few significant changes to the scheme…."" The changes proposed in the bill are designed to update and/or rationalise some of the provisions of the scheme, including some of the changes recommended in the 2015 Review.


Specifically, the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997 (the Act):


to amend the definition of a grant year, which is currently up to 30 June 2016. In effect, this will make the scheme evergreen, so that the scheme can continue beyond that date and will remove the need for periodic re-authorisation which creates significant uncertainty with SME claimants, and undermines the purpose of the scheme. Given it has enjoyed over 40 years of bipartisan support, it is of little benefit to subject the scheme to 4-yearly sunset provisions


 to remove the requirements that the independent review of the scheme be conducted for the specific purpose of making recommendations about the continuity of the scheme – not necessary given we are removing the sunset provisions - however we do see benefit in continuing to review the operation of the scheme from time to time, so the bill sets a date for the next review, and determines a process for later reviews


 to remove communications as an eligible expenditure category to reflect the reduced cost of communications as a result of advances in technology


 to place a limit of $15,000 on the free sample expenditure category. This cap will not be applied retrospectively to first-year claimants with a combined year 1 and 2 claim, who were not aware of this cap at the time they incurred their expenditure. 


 to describe the promotional literature or other advertising expenditure category as including literature or material in electronic or any other form


 to repeal the provision for in-country travel expenses to be reimbursed, (other than air fares) and to change the amount of the daily allowance for overseas visits from $300 to $350


 to add to the list of excluded expenses those relating to eligible promotional activities, things or eligible products that, in the opinion of the CEO of Austrade, may have had a detrimental impact on Australia's trade reputation


 to permit Austrade to direct funds from other sources towards EMDG administration costs if required


I am introducing this bill at this time to enable it to come into effect on 1 July 2016, in order to provide exporters with certainty of the EMDG provisions applicable to their export promotions activities for the 2016-17 financial year and beyond.


At the same time I am also introducing an amendment to the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 that will change the Commission's name to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission.


This name change will better reflect both the Austrade's significant role in promoting and attracting foreign investment and the priority the Government places on attracting foreign investment to secure Australia's future prosperity. Since becoming Australia's first Trade and Investment Minister, I have seen there is significant value in a regular dialogue with major investors in Australia, both foreign direct investors and portfolio investors. Australia has relied on foreign capital to grow since the days of the first fleet, and this continues to be the case. We are the world's 12th largest economy, with the 6th largest land mass, but with the 51st largest population. So we consistently generate more attractive investment opportunities than we can fund from our own pool of domestic savings, and the country is the wealthier for it, with higher paying jobs, by harnessing foreign investment to capitalise on and develop such opportunities. Note that I do not propose to change the corporate moniker 'Austrade' as this name and brand carries significant goodwill with business in Australia. 


I commend the bill to the House.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MOORE:
  The minister has just sought to have a process put in place to adjourn the debate. We have been lectured for the last few minutes on how important it is to have the BSWAT legislation brought forward. I have offered the minister the opportunity to move straight into a debate on BSWAT. I am ready to go. I am speaking for the opposition on this business. This offer was made to the minister in good faith. We have listened to the position put forward by the Greens that this was so important we had to bring it forward. We have not had that discussion. No-one had told us what they wanted to do previously. 


I am ready to go with BSWAT; the opposition is ready to go with BSWAT. We want to debate this bill. We have listened to the argument about how important it is. We care—which Senator Macdonald has been lecturing us about all the way through. I wish to put on record that we have listened; we are prepared to have the debate. We want to know why it cannot be brought on now for debate, because we were told only recently of its importance. (Time expired)

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (18:52):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for five minutes, Senator Fifield.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The purpose of seeking an exemption from the cut-off is so that a particular bill can be dealt with in the current sitting. You may have noticed, Mr President, that, if you look at the red, those opposite have prevented this chamber making orderly progress through the bills listed on the red. What we sought earlier today in housekeeping, in the ordinary course of events, was for the cut-off to be exempted for a number of bills, and those opposite—I am speaking now in relation to the list of non-controversial bills—decided, like everything else this week, that they would be, and I think the technical term is, bloody minded. Those opposite denied leave for an exemption from the cut-off for even non-controversial bills. What we are seeking to do here is—hopefully, we have been successful—to exempt a couple of bills from the cut-off so they can be dealt with in the current sitting. Whether that happens or not is entirely dependent on whether those opposite continue to filibuster—as they are currently doing on the message from the House in relation to the electoral matters bill. They have been going for six, eight, nine hours, speaking to the message from the other place to do with the electoral matters bill.


If ever there was a concrete example of filibustering and sheer bloody mindedness we have seen it over the last day and a half. So no pious lectures from those opposite, we are simply endeavouring to engage in what are usually routine procedural matters so that we can deal with business in an orderly way. I will conclude my remarks here, so that we can get on with business.

The PRESIDENT:  I need direction here to give direction to the clerks. Has leave been granted for a period longer than one minute? Leave is granted to two minutes, Senator Wong.




Senator WONG:
  We just had a lecture from the Manager of Government Business about sheer bloody mindedness. I want to remind people why it is that the opposition is seeking to have the debate we are having and why we will not be facilitating passage of the electoral reform bills. It is because we do not believe this is good legislation. We do not believe that legislation that imposes the largest changes in three decades on this parliament and on the Australian people for an election should be rushed through just because the government wants to rush to a double dissolution election with the assistance of the Greens. We do not believe that is good for Australian democracy. I will remind the Greens of the evidence that was given to the joint standing committee by Antony Green, whom they have cited in debate on many issues in this chamber. He said that the most likely outcome is blocking majority for the coalition. So in years to come, if this legislation goes through and the coalition imposes its radical right-wing agenda on the Australian people, we will be blaming you, because you have come in here with your piety and you have lain in bed with the government on this issue. All of us will remember it.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. In your absence the Deputy President made an order in the run up to this debate that senators should not refer to people as 'you', but should speak through the chair. I am sure Senator Wong was here—and she has been here long enough to know that. Mr President, I would raise a further point of order: it is impolite and bad manners to point at anyone, as this particular speaker continues to do.



The PRESIDENT:  I would remind all Senators to address the chair, and not to direct your remarks directly to other senators or across the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion that the debate be now adjourned be agreed to.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Special Minister of State) (17:29):  Pursuant to contingent notice standing in the name of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the moving of a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion to exempt these bills from the bills cut-off order.


What is happening here is one massive filibuster. This is not even in relation to a piece of legislation that Labor has any concerns about. What Labor is doing in this chamber today—we heard Senator Dastyari yell across the chamber, 'You get nothing!'—is playing games. This is Labor not making judgements about what is in the public interest. This is a bill that I suspect Labor might even end up not opposing. I think everyone across Australia well understands what is happening here. We have the union politics and student politics brought back into the chamber by some very juvenile people on the Labor side. I commend to the Senate to support this suspension.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:31):  I think that is the most pathetic argument—if you could even call it an argument—as to why the proper process in this place should not go ahead. This is a government that is an absolute chaos. They are an absolute rabble. Really, they should not bring the rabble that is their party room into this place, because that is what this is. They as a government just do not what is going on from day to day.


To say that we should not follow process on this, and get up and give us 30 seconds about why we should not follow process, is totally unacceptable. We have a position where there are issues that have to be dealt with appropriately and effectively through the processes of the Senate. Just because those opposite do a dirty, rotten deal with the Greens they think they can come in here and disrupt everything about process and procedure. We are not going to cop this. You need to convince us why this should be done. You stood up and you failed to do that. It is totally unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.


The minister has been here long enough to understand that there are issues that we can deal with. There are issues that he can sit down and talk to the opposition about. This is not one of them, when you run this line, when you simply stand up and try and breach the proper processes of the parliament.


We are not unattracted to looking at how we can make things work better in this place. But I will tell you what we are not prepared to do. We are not prepared to cop the chaos of your party room coming back in here because you cannot make up your mind about how you get a tax policy in this country. When you have a Prime Minister who is so weak and so jellybacked that he cannot stand up to the right wing of the party on economic issues then this is unacceptable. The reason you are in such chaos about your procedures in this parliament is that you are not cohesive in what you do in relation to your policy and your party.


We see the minister, Senator Cormann, is now talking to Senator Di Natale to try and stitch up another deal. Senator Di Natale is going to make the Australian Democrats look as if they were strong. All that Senator Cormann has to do is go down and eyeball Senator Di Natale and Senator Di Natale goes into the foetal position. He just curls up. He just gives in: 'Don't give me any more arguments! I give in.' That is the Greens in this place. They roll over as soon as any pressure is put on them


The position that is being put forward by the minister is not consistent with the standing orders. He simply wants to try and bring things on and get the debate curtailed. This is the place where you have to have debate. The sooner the Greens understand that there is a proper process, the sooner the Greens understand that they should not just give in every time that Senator Cormann wanders down and pulls their chain—here is the chain getting pulled again! Senator Cormann and Senator Di Natale are in deep, deep discussion about how they can get this through, how they can overcome the proper processes in this place. It is really pathetic.


I was saying that the Prime Minister should grow a backbone. Senator Di Natale, you should grow one. You should stand up to the intimidation of the National Party and the Liberal Party. When the National Party are congratulating the Greens day in, day out we have a problem. Grow a backbone. Stand up to the intimidation. Be the party that says, 'You should be …,' not what you are at the moment, a grovelling party not doing— (Time expired)

The hypocrisy is as thick as a shearer's gravy—you could not cut it with a chainsaw. The minute someone tweaks the dummy in your mouth off you go. It would all be funny—it would be a tonne of fun—if you were not interfering in the due democratic process of the Senate.

We do not have to worry about the changes to Senate reform. She will be gone, you will see to it. I already know when there is trouble in the camp. When you, Senator Conroy, and Senator Carr and one or two others start turning up in committee rooms we know that the democratic process of this Senate and its functions will be disrupted.


This is outrageous. We have a situation here where a non-controversial bill is related and you are going to do anything in your power to frustrate every single step in the operation of this Senate and the government going about its business—a government mandated by the people of Australia. They hunted your mob. Never give another regard to it—you were gone. They were sick and tired of you changing the revolving chairs—Rudd, Gillard, Rudd—and had you stayed there a bit longer there would have been one or two others. Everyone gets a turn in the Labor Party. But the fact of the matter is some of the key people in your party—the likes of Gray, Faulkner and others—respected members who participated for some 2½ years in relation to the development of some transparent measures for this place, have been displaced.

But what happened? Here is one setting: he goes to bed, and when he wakes up he throws his leg over the side of the bed and sits up and his head is still on the pillow. You people have no rules. When it comes down to getting serious about issues you have no rules.

We know that the minute that you disagree or have another view, off comes the noggin. It is gone—blunt chainsaw, one big swipe, ugly scars right across your shoulders.

Mr Abbott was sowing his head back on and he decided that he was going to have a bit of an outing. He was on a bit of a tear this morning. I was reading it live. I was sitting in a joint parliamentary committee and I was reading texts from the Liberal Party live as it went on. We had Senator Abetz get up and back in his good mate.

  This is a government that has been unable to make the case today about the urgency of these bills, the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016 and the Trade Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016. This is a government that just wants any distraction. Please just give us a distraction from the shambolic performance of Senator Cormann cutting loose the Treasurer seven or eight times on national television. He says, 'No, it's nothing to do with me. Go and ask Mr Morrison. I don't know about any excesses in negative gearing. Mr Morrison said that. I don't talk to the Treasurer about things like that. That's not my portfolio.' I thought they worked on budgetary matters together. So it is no wonder that Mr Morrison has been calling Senator Cormann the chief bed-wetter, because he has cut him off at the knees in public. The finance minister—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Pause the clock. Senator O'Sullivan, do you have a point of order?




Senator O'Sullivan:
  All things aside, this is a robust chamber, but those sorts of reflections are not helpful. I would urge you to ask the Senator to withdraw that remark. We have already had discussions in this place about how to conduct ourselves this week.




Senator CONROY:
  But that is what the Liberal Party are calling each other! I am quoting the Liberal Party!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Conroy. You should refer to senators by their correct title, and so I will ask you to refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator CONROY:
  I accept your admonishment. So what we have is the finance minister cutting loose the Treasurer. This is while they are weeks away from putting a budget to bed. Senator Cormann tells the country on national television, 'I do not talk to Mr Morrison about those issues.' I mean, really, talk about pushing him out the door into the snow, talk about stealing the paddle and pushing him off up the creek. Senator Cormann is paying back Mr Morrison for betraying Tony Abbott.


I admire your ability to stick with Mr Abbott but, seriously, there is a bit of a rule when you are on the front bench, when you are part of the economic team, when you are the Treasurer and the finance minister—you defend each other publicly. Perhaps Mr Morrison does not actually smoke cigars. Perhaps that is the problem—he has not accepted a cigar from Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann has not even attempted to make a case. He arrogantly thinks, 'I can stroll down to the other end of the chamber, I will tickle senator Di Natale on the tummy and I will tell him that he should do this.' It is all part of this filibuster. It is all part of the Labor Party picking on those nice Greens because they are supporting the government to wipe out and purge this chamber of anyone they do not like, to take revenge. How long do we have to put up with a couple of people who did not get elected to parliament dictating party policy? Because they did not win, they want revenge on Senator Leyonhjelm.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:47):  First, let me make an apology. I want to apologise to all the people who are listening on broadcast right now who have had to endure 20 minutes of vitriol, of nonsense from the Labor Party. The Labor Party are intent on frustrating the business of this parliament. We get that we have a Labor Party who are torn and divided over the issue of electoral reform. We understand that. We understand there is a big tussle going on at the moment within the Labor Party—there are those people who support electoral reform and those people who do not. That is a legitimate position to take. There are arguments on both sides.


Unfortunately what we have seen is the backroom boys prevail over the likes of the more sensible views of people like Gary Gray, who made an explicit commitment and called those positions held by the likes of Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari 'dumb'. 'Dumb' is one word you could use. You could use many others. Unfortunately that is not the topic what we are debating right now.


What we are debating is whether the Labor Party will frustrate the passage of legislation that will help vulnerable people through a specific assessment tool. It is a piece of noncontroversial legislation that I think we all support. Yet here we have the Labor Party trying to frustrate the passage of that legislation. They continue to delay and obfuscate because they have a bitterly divided Labor Party. What they are trying to do is garner support from their own side for tactics that many on their own side actually rightly do not support. I will make a prediction that you will see this nonsense over the next couple of days and it will just melt away. It will disappear. What we will see then is a return to sanity.


Let me say on behalf of those people who are listening, what you are seeing and hearing is the parliament operating at its worst. You are seeing a parliament trying to frustrate the important business of the passage of legislation that is not particularly controversial using a set of parliamentary tactics in an effort to do that. It has got nothing to do with the issue that has occupied much of the Senate's time over the past few days—that is, the issue of putting power back into the hands of voters rather than leaving it within the hands of the backroom dealers.


There are those people within the Labor Party who like the status quo because, let's be frank, Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari are not here because of their soaring intellect or their capacity to be able to grasp complex policy decisions. They are not here because of that; they are here because they are wheelers and dealers. Their power resides within the fact that they exercise brute power in the back rooms of the Labor Party. Right here what you have is an example of everything that is wrong with that modern day Labor Party, completely lacking in substance, completely lacking in integrity.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Dastyari.




Senator DI NATALE:
  We have got a piece of legislation supported by the Labor Party, who are now doing an about face, doing everything they can to frustrate the parliament from doing its job. We are letting them have their fun at the moment. We figured it is important that they get this stuff off their chest. We know that Senator Conroy and Senator Dastyari have fought a long battle inside the Labor Party. It appears, sadly, that their position has prevailed and the likes of Alan Griffin, the likes of Gary Gray and the likes of many others inside the Labor Party have lost the day on the issue of optional preferential voting reform.


That is a shame because it was a reform that they supported back in 2014. It was a reform that up until last year they supported wholeheartedly but not now because of the simple reason that they are worried about losing an election. We are more optimistic about the Australian people. We are much more optimistic about the Australian community. We think that ultimately the outcome of an election should be decided by voters, not by the backroom deals, not by the likes of Senator Dastyari and Senator Conroy. We think ultimately it is voters who should decide the outcome of an election and it is politicians who should get on with the job of governing. (Time expired)

 (Queensland) (17:52):  It is not very often that I agree with Senator Di Natale, but I agree with every word he just spoke. He has actually brought some sense and rationality to this debate. Can I just explain to people who might be listening what exactly we are debating at the moment. It is not Mr Turnbull's economic credentials and not the electoral system but a bill to do a Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme. That is the bill that is before the discussion now. What we are doing is getting a message from the House of Representatives, where this bill has been debated and has passed. It has been brought in here and we are debating whether it should be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Can I just urge upon the Labor Party to remember—and explain to those who might be listening to this debate—that this bill is about providing money to people working in disability services and enterprises. I repeat that: this bill that we are debating is about making more money available to people with disabilities working in disability enterprises.




Senator Marshall:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order of relevance. We are not in fact debating a bill at all. If Senator Macdonald thinks we are debating a bill, he is clearly not addressing the question before the chair.

(

  I never mentioned the bill!

  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Conroy just said he had no idea what the actual bill was, yet he is raising points of order. You should call him to order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cormann, but there is no point of order there. I am ruling on the point of order. Senator Marshall, I allowed a fairly wide-ranging discussion when Senator Conroy and others were speaking.




Senator Conroy:
  I never mentioned the bill!




Senator Cormann:
  That is how the Labor Party—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Cormann! I accept that it was wide-ranging. I will allow Senator Macdonald to continue.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. That point of order does not behove our Acting Deputy President, I have to say. We are here debating reasons for urgency—




Senator Marshall:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I should not have to accept that. I am entitled to raise points of order. I was in fact seeking the call and thought I was entitled to the call, because it should go across the chamber. I wanted to address the actual question and the process and procedure, and not some of the politics that is being talked about.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Marshall. Senator Macdonald has the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I always know I am making an accurate point that people listening to this would be interested in when the Labor Party keep taking points of order on me. That was confirmed just now. This debate is about the urgency of the message from the House of Representatives to deal with the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016. It is a debate on why this is urgent. Why is this urgent? Because it deals with providing money to people with intellectual disabilities affected by the representative proceedings to claim and receive agreed payments increases.


I would assume that the Labor Party will agree with the bill, but it is important that it is dealt with now so that payments can start. That is why the bill is important. That is why it is a matter of urgency. For the previous speaker who took the point of order, that is why the bill is a matter of urgency. That is why we should deal with the message from the House of Representatives as a matter of urgency, so that we can get on to the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme that will provide more money for people working in disability enterprises. Why would the Labor Party be filibustering so we cannot start the debate on that bill to provide more money for people with disability enterprises? Why would you want to delay this, Senator Conroy? This is for money for people with a disability.



The Labor Party are using filibuster tactics to prevent the Senate from moving on and dealing with this bill. They do it because they spat the dummy over some other bill that we heard Senator Conroy talk about for five minutes without a word of a point of order from those in the Labor Party, who always find reasons to take points of order on me. The Labor Party are defending the indefensible on the electoral matters bill. As Senator Conroy spoke for five minutes on that, I feel I should just answer that for 30 seconds or so. Senator Conroy, and I ask Labor senators generally: what is wrong with allowing the Australian public to actually determine the preferences that they choose when they go to the next ballot for a Senate? The Labor Party want the bovver boys—the factional heads of the Labor Party—to determine who they will vote for in their preferences. We want the people of Australia to determine their own preferences.


I come back to the reason for the urgency with which we should accept and deal with the message from the House of Representatives: so that we can deal with a bill which will provide money to people with intellectual disabilities working in disability enterprises. It is a wonderful idea. I am sure the bill will receive unanimous support when it comes before us. Why is the Labor Party delaying debate on that essential bill? We should be debating it now.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria—Deputy President of the Senate and Chair of Committees) (17:58):  I do not often speak on a political nature in the Senate, or I rarely do anymore, but, given some of the contributions made about the actual process, I do want to lend my views to the processes we are dealing with here. What we are actually debating is whether the bills should be exempt from the cut-off. It is easy for people to say—and people have said—that to exempt a bill from the cut-off is the normal process of events and procedure in the Senate. Of course, it is not. The cut-off is actually there because it has been developed over a long period of time through the Senate and is part of the Senate practice to stop bills being brought in towards the end of the session in order to ensure that they get less scrutiny and have less debate upon them. This was something first identified and complained about by Greens senators. Greens senators actually initiated the early cut-off processes in this chamber, and it was for very good reason. Many senators, particularly senators who were not government senators, had problems with bills being introduced and not being given the appropriate scrutiny.


It is true that from time to time bills need to be given an exemption from the cut-off, but that is more unusual than it is the norm. The norm is that bills that are subject to the cut-off do not get debated until the following session. Now, if there is an urgent requirement for a bill to be debated, one would assume that discussions are had around the chamber and agreement is reached about why the urgency is needed, and those matters are then put before the chamber. If it is agreed that they are urgent, there is agreement on that. I have been in this chamber many, many times where agreement has been reached, and it is simply a process motion for the bills to be exempted from the cut-off because the argument has been made and it has been accepted that bills should be exempted from the cut-off.


But to simply bring things in without discussion—and I am advised that, at least in terms of the opposition, there was no discussion whatsoever about why these bills needed to be exempt from the cut-off; they were simply introduced into the chamber to be exempted from the cut-off, which is against the practice of the Senate. The normal practice of the Senate, established over many, many years and, as I said, initiated by the Greens senators, is that, if bills are introduced late, they should be dealt with in the next session unless there is an urgent reason. Again, all I can say is that a lot of people are assigning different motives to why leave was not given to move a motion to exempt these bills from the cut-off, but I just want to put on the record that the normal process is that bills that are subject to the cut-off should not be dealt with until the next session.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion to suspend standing orders, moved by Senator Cormann, be agreed to.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:09):  The rabble that this government have descended into has again been demonstrated right here. We have a government that are in paralysis in their own party room. They cannot even make the case—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What have you got against disabled people?




Senator CONROY:
  You do not even know the start date for these bills. The government have got no idea so they are desperate for a distraction right now. Unfortunately, to cover their embarrassment they can now call on their new besties the Greens. The government have failed to make the case on these bills. It is a simple fact that not one government member who spoke in this debate in this chamber made the case for why these need to go through the cut-off. 


We do know that, due to the filthy deal that has been done between the Greens and this government, we are going to a double-D on 2 July, because what we have had is the turkeys vote for an early Christmas. Senator Cormann is smooth. He has actually talked them into voting for their own execution. That is good. Paul Keating once said: in politics always back self-interest. These guys have voted for their own execution. It did take some special expertise by Senator Cormann on this.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am wondering if you or Senator Conroy could explain how what Senator Conroy has said so far has anything to do with the subject of the motion. All he has talked about is the Greens and deals. This, as I understand it, is a very formal motion. I would like you to rule on whether Senator Conroy is being relevant to the motion.




Senator CONROY:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: Senator Macdonald is deludedly sitting over there ignoring the fact that this debate and what I have been saying go to the heart of why we oppose this motion—because they have not made the case for this to be brought on. They have not made the case because they are a rabble and they have not made the case because they—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have heard enough on the point of order. I can rule. There is no point of order. You have the call, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you very much. So try not to get up and distract from the rabble that is sitting in front of you, Senator Macdonald. If you had got more votes than Senator Bernardi, you would have been off to New York and not had to worry about this. Let me be very clear. This is a government that is using its numbers with the Greens to pass this—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I take a point of order in that I am quite sure that the speaker is mad. I have no idea why he is talking about New York. It is not something I have ever sought.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Macdonald. There is a provision against frivolous points of order too, I add in passing. Senator Conroy, you have the call.




Senator Heffernan:
  Senator Conroy, do your fly up.




Senator CONROY:
  Now we have Senator Heffernan adding his usual earthy contribution to the debate. Let us try to stay focussed on the bills at hand. The government are masquerading that the bills are urgent when we all know that, because of a filthy deal that the government have done with the Greens, we are going to a double-D. Because of a filthy deal that they have done to sell out their values, to sell out, we are going to a double-D. Any pretence whatsoever that these are urgent bills needs to be tossed out the window. Any pretence that these are urgent bills does not stand up to scrutiny. It does not actually pass the smell test. 


These bills are being brought in here to distract from the rabble that this government has become. We have a finance minister who cut the Treasurer loose today on national television. We have a Prime Minister who has taken control of the tax debate off the Treasurer—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  and put his own head of the Public Service in charge of it. It is relevant, Senator Macdonald, because your government is trying to hide the fact that it is calling a double-D. This is not an urgent bill, and it is not an urgent bill because of all the other things that have been going on in this chamber, which you are party to. You are the party that has gone to the Greens and stitched up a deal to do Senate reform and purge all crossbench senators. Tragically, they did not work out that you are actually going to call a double-D on them and they are actually going to purge themselves. Senator Siewert, it was nice. I have had a lot of fun with you in the chamber, but you are not coming back after a double-D, and there are a couple more of you to go as well.


What we saw today in a joint parliamentary committee hearing about Senate electoral reform, which goes to the heart of this debate, is that Mr Antony Green, the great advocate on behalf of Senator Rhiannon, actually confessed for the first time that the Liberals will get 38 senators in a double-D.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Oh, he didn't.




Senator CONROY:
  Yes, he did.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He didn't.




Senator CONROY:
  He said it. It is in the transcript. You should read it. I have already put a press release out with the transcript in it. That is what he said. Then he said, 'Oh, and they'll also get three senators out of six in a half-Senate election.' I can count. That gets you to 38 as well. So the great supporter of the Greens, who has been—oh, my goodness!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  If you resume your seat, Senator Conroy. Senator Macdonald, on a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I raise the same point of order again, on relevance. Mr Deputy President, if you are ruling as you did before, could you explain to me how what happened in a committee this morning and what Anthony Green said—




Senator CONROY:
  Antony.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  has any relevance to the motion before the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  So your point of order is on relevance?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Yes.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have been listening to the whole debate, going through its process, and I have also heard the ruling of the previous chair in relation to a very similar point of order. It has been a wide-ranging debate, and on that basis, being consistent—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  But someone took a point of order on me.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Indeed, and the ruling was made, and that is the ruling I will be following. So there is no point of order. Senator Conroy, you have the call.




Senator CONROY:
  I would just make the case that Senator Macdonald is correct, but his points of order were not upheld, because it has been a free-ranging debate—you are right—and Senator Macdonald is a beneficiary of the free-ranging debates.


But what we have is a government that is going to a double-D, and the cat was belled this morning when Antony Green told the joint parliamentary committee that in a double-D the government will get 38 senators, and in a half-Senate election they will get three out of six. That is what he said. Did they not explain that to you? When you did the deal, did they not explain that to you?


So this is a government that has pulled the wool over the eyes of this chamber already once today by how it voted. It is a government that has no policy agenda. It is pretending bills are urgent when they are not. But the greatest con on disabled people in this chamber is coming from those opposite, because they have no intention of trying to pass this bill before they call the double-D—no intention whatsoever of passing this bill, because you are calling a double-D.


It is a double-D that will have terrible ramifications in this country. It will mean there is no chance to save and rescue the National Broadband Network from the indolent minister, the indolent board and the indolent management, whose stock in trade is to consistently mislead the Australian public about what is really going on. There will be no chance to save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation when the double-D sitting is held and those opposite use their numbers in both chambers, if they are lucky enough to win, to wipe it out. There is no way to protect Australian workers from the penalty rate cutting that will take place by those opposite. There is no way, when they get back to it, that the GST will not be increased, because, just as John Howard said in the last few days, you are going to have to go back and increase the GST. It is in their DNA.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  Why this is relevant is that those opposite cannot make the case for a positive vote in this chamber on this issue, because they are conning everybody who is listening. They are conning the disabled people in this country. You are calling a double-D. You have no intention of passing this bill before you call the double-D—no intention whatsoever of passing this bill. Don't you sit here and try and pretend that you are doing something for disabled people. Your plan is to use this bill to disguise the fact you have no agenda left and you have pulled the best con—I take my hat off to you, Senator Cormann, as I said earlier. You really have taken the Greens for a ride. Paul Keating said, 'Always back self-interest.' Well, those mugs down there did not understand what their own self-interest was. They were bent on revenge, and you have played them on a break. You have sucked them in, and this country will be far the worse for it because of this double-D that you are planning—the double-D that makes this bill not urgent, Senator Macdonald.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You can sit there and talk and talk and talk, but this bill is not urgent.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should take a pill. You are going madder.




Senator CONROY:
  Hanging around with you too much, Senator Macdonald, has that effect on people. You should start by looking in the mirror if you want to talk about madness.


But let me repeat: the government, after five speakers or so, have yet to make the case for why this was urgent. After five speakers, they have not made the case for why this bill should proceed in the manner that it is being put forward. They have not made the case for why the Senate should be turned upside down, other than the fact that we all know their party room meeting was a shambles this morning. We all know that, sitting in the joint parliamentary committee on electoral reform, I was reading live tweets telling me what Mr Abbott said and what Senator Cormann said. Senator Cormann, in fact, tweeted out of the room. So everyone was paying attention in there. There was sledging backwards and forward. We all knew what was going on. There were Senator Bernardi, Senator Abetz and all of those who wanted to get behind Senator Cormann's undermining of the Treasurer of this country. We all know what this debate is about. You are afraid to bring your real agenda on. You are afraid to reveal your tax policy to the Australian public. You do not want there to be a budget. You do not want to try to govern this country. You do not want to explain what the excesses of negative gearing are—identified on a number of occasions—because you want to hide behind the pretence that this bill is urgent. All of those issues will catch up with you over the coming months. For those in the Greens corner, when that double-D is called on 11 May and held on 2 July, all of the consequences of the filthy deal to sell out their policies and what they believe in will be seen. But the good news is that they will not all be here to realise it. They will be sitting in their homes because they will not be returned.


We know that your attempt today to upturn the Senate procedures to bring on bills that you have not told anyone you are going to bring on and to try to force the Senate to debate something else is not serious. You could prove me a liar. All you have to do is stand up here and say, 'I guarantee you there's no double-D happening. There'll be no election called before or on 11 May.' That is all you have to do to prove me wrong. Those opposite simply have to say, 'Senator Conroy, you're a fool. There's no double-D.' Then the attempt to bring this bill on becomes legitimate. Until you can stand up and promise this chamber and the people of Australia that there is no double-D, you have zero credibility in pretending you are interested in disabled people, good governance in this chamber or even good governance of this country. You are an absolute shambles. Your cabinet leaks. Your finance minister dumps on the Treasurer in public on national television. The Prime Minister, egged on by Senator Cormann, strips him of his portfolio responsibilities. This is a full-scale mugging of the second Treasurer that you have had! You have already tossed one Treasurer overboard!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can this possibly be relevant?




Senator CONROY:
  It is relevant, Senator Macdonald, because this is about the scam you are attempting on this chamber. There is no urgency. The two people who could make this case are sitting right there. They could stand up and say, 'Senator Conroy, every word you have said is wrong, because we will not be calling a double-D on 11 May, the day after the budget.' This is the highest-taxing and highest-spending government in Australian history, but you claim to be the party of low tax. John Howard hit new records, and you are running second at the moment. You do not want to try to bring down a budget. You are terrified of the budget because your DNA is about cutting people's wages, cutting people's penalty rates, increasing the GST, cutting pensions and introducing $100,000 university degrees. That is what you want to introduce to this country. It is still your official policy. You still want to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


All of those things are part of the agenda that those opposite are trying to hide from us today with this weak attempt to pretend they are interested in disabled people. This chamber should see through it. You have tickled the tummy of a leader who is looking for friends. If you read his Facebook page—he is very popular on his Facebook page today—I think you should send him a like. Senator Ludlam, send Senator Di Natale a few likes on his Facebook page because he really needs them today. Send him a few likes. He is feeling a little bit tender because Greens supporters have woken up to another filthy deal to help this government. I say to the Greens: you protected tax avoiders with the government last time. Now you are giving them the loaded gun to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, introduce $100,000 university educations, put in place pension cuts, put in place cuts to penalty rates and increase the GST. That is what the Greens have signed up to. So just tickle their tummy again, Senator Cormann, and get them to vote with you on this. Senator Macdonald, I thought you were getting up again; I am quite disappointed.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  There is not much point in it, I have to say.




Senator CONROY:
  There is not much point in anything you say, but you still do it a lot! I have to admire it. This is a government that is bereft. Remember when Mr Turnbull became the Prime Minister? He could have said, 'Good governance starts today.' But, no—he actually started off with, 'Isn't it a wonderful time to be alive? Australians are governed by me.' It is heart-warming to see. This is a government that is completely and utterly cannibalising itself from the inside. There is no greater demonstration of that than when the finance minister of this country, on national television, dumps on the Treasurer and will not back him up. Senator Cormann, that is your job. Your job is to back up the Treasurer. Your job is to support him. It sort of comes with the territory of being the finance minister and the Treasurer. The simple fact that you cut him loose today says everything about the shambolic government that you are involved in.


Net debt went over $1 trillion today—congratulations! You like to mock Senator Wong. You have more debt than anybody else in history, Senator Cormann. You are the high-debt finance minister. You are never going to deliver a budget surplus while you are finance minister. That is the badge of honour that you will wear. You are never going to do it while you are the finance minister. You will never deliver it, and Senator Morrison will never deliver a surplus in this country either—it is Mr Morrison; we do not want to promote him.


Let's be clear: this is a government that has lost the plot.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You have you gone quite mad.




Senator CONROY:
  I am having my 20th anniversary dinner tonight.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should lie down and take a Bex.




Senator CONROY:
  There will probably be a few Bexes in the morning!


This is a government that is attacking itself in its own party room. The former Prime Minister got up and, with his tongue firmly in his cheek, extolled the virtues of Mr Turnbull's communication skills. Mr Turnbull did not make it two months barracking for a GST, and Mr Abbott was openly laughing in his face in the party room. He was mocking him in the party room. The former Prime Minister was mocking the current Prime Minister in the party room. That is what it has descended to. That is why you, those opposite, are in here right now trying to pretend that this is an urgent bill. You all know that you are going to a double-D in July. 


I will repeat again in my last few moments speaking that you can prove me wrong. The first words out of the mouths of Senator Fifield or Senator Cormann can be, 'Senator Conroy, you couldn't be more wrong. We're not going to a double-D. We're going to serve our full term.' But you are not going to say that. So do not stand up next and try to pretend that you care about disability. Do not stand up and claim that a trade bill is urgent because you do not have the courage to govern to the end of your term.


You have mugged those in that corner. You have absolutely taken them for gooses, and their gooses will be cooked. You will be okay, Senator Ludlam. We know you are the most popular politician in Western Australia. It is Senator Siewert I am a bit worried about. I am. I want to see Senator Siewert back here. I want to see her come back here.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  No, we should be fair and think of the alternatives! You, the government, have mugged the Greens. All you have to do is stand up next and say, 'There'll be no double-D. Senator Conroy's wrong. This is urgent because we do want— (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:32):  The government will outline the reason why it thinks that these bills are urgent, but I will tell you why I think these bills— (Time expired)




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I am sorry to interrupt, Senator Siewert. I am very interested to hear you speak. I am just wondering what happened to the normal order of calling the opposition, the government and then the crossbench. You clearly saw me, Mr Deputy President. I saw you looking at me. You have again made the ruling that the crossbenchers take preference and precedence over a member of the government side.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have not made any such ruling, but I have given Senator Siewert the call.




Senator SIEWERT:
  The call does usually go around the chamber. I will tell you why I think the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Bill 2016 is urgent. It is the same reason I thought it was urgent every time we have been discussing this issue. While I disagreed the first time the government brought in the bill in 2014 because they were not being fair to people with disability, the reason I wanted to make sure this issue was dealt with is that it has been on the agenda for years. People with intellectual disability have been short-changed.


Shame on you, the opposition, for using this particular bill to try to frustrate the government's agenda. I, for one, will not stand by silently while you use people with disability to hold up this bill. You ticked and flicked this bill through the House of Representatives because you knew how important it was for people with disability. You also ticked and flicked the trade bill through the House of Representatives. But I particularly want to talk about the bill that—




Senator Ludwig:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I waited to see whether or not the senator's language would change. Could the speaker address her remarks to the President or the Deputy President, as the case may be, rather than using the word 'you' constantly; it is becoming aggravating.




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order, would you also consider the fact that every time members of the opposition have been speaking today in their attempts to frustrate this Senate they have been looking at the Greens. So maybe instead of directing their speeches to us they should be doing the same thing.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Siewert. I have been watching this debate since prior to being in the chair and I think you are right. I remind senators that they should direct their comments through the chair. There has been leeway given in this particular debate.




Senator SIEWERT:
  In that case, Mr Deputy President, I will make sure that I am looking at you and the general direction of the front of the chamber! However, I will get back to the point because I am sure the opposition are trying to distract me from the point I am trying to make. They should hang their heads in shame that they are using this particular bill to try to frustrate the work of this chamber.


We will have ongoing discussions in the future about election reform, but this particular bill is about people with disability, particularly intellectual disability, who have been working in ADEs and other locations who have been short-changed. They have been waiting for years for compensation. The reason I think this bill should be exempt from the cut-off order is that the sooner this issue is dealt with the sooner the Federal Court can settle some of the cases that are currently before it. I, for one, would urge the government to make this noncontro. In fact, I thought it probably would end up as non-contro legislation so it could be dealt with. I thought that everybody in this parliament was now agreed that we should in fact be acting to end the discrimination against people with disability who have been caught up on substandard wages.


In the past in my numerous contributions on this particular matter, I have pointed out to the chamber and those listening that, if people had had access to the money that they have been denied because they were given substandard, inadequate wages, it would have made a substantial difference to their life's progress. In the same way, people getting access to compensation as soon as possible will make a substantial difference. You have picked on the wrong bill to make your point, at the expense of people with disability who deserve compensation. That is not up for argument here. I believe these bills should be exempt from the cut-off order, which is why I think this motion should be brought on.




Senator Sterle:
  Then sit down and stop talking!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind senators that they ought not interject at all if they are not sitting in their seats and that, even when they are in their seats, interjections are disorderly. 




Senator SIEWERT:
  I was in fact winding up, but, talking about winding up, perhaps the opposition is trying to wind up the speakers. These bills should be exempt from the cut-off order. Under any other circumstances, I am sure the opposition—who I know have also been very keen to help people with disability who have been caught up under this flawed approach in the past—would have let this through. I urge them to address this issue so that it does not get held up in this chamber for no other reason than the opposition trying to turn this into a chaotic place and frustrate the process. They have picked on the wrong bill. They should change their minds, support this through and let us get on with making sure that people with disability who have been waiting for so long actually get their compensation.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that a motion to exempt these bills from the bills cut-off order may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business today until determined.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE 





IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





BUSINESS SERVICES WAGE ASSESSMENT TOOL PAYMENT SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill



The bill will increase payments under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme from 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the difference between the actual wage paid to the eligible person and the amount they would have been paid under the productivity-only component of the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool, and make associated amendments to improve the payment process.


The bill will also extend all relevant scheme dates by 12 months so people have more time to register for the scheme and submit applications.


The amendments will give effect to a recently mediated settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and the Applicant in a representative proceeding in the Federal Court of Australia (Duval-Comrie v the Commonwealth VID 1367/2013). If the bill is passed and the terms of the settlement agreed by the Federal Court, the representative proceeding will cease.




Reasons for Urgency



The payment scheme, as amended by this bill, is the method agreed by the parties to settle the representative proceeding.


Passage in the Autumn sittings would allow the 10,000 people with intellectual disability affected by the representative proceeding to claim and receive their agreed increased payments quickly.




STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE 





IN THE 2016 AUTUMN SITTINGS





TRADE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1)





Purpose of the Bill 



The changes proposed in Schedule 1 of this Bill (to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997) allow the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme to continue beyond 1 July 2016, by amending the definition of a grant year. At the same time, a number of other minor policy and technical amendments will be made to ensure the continued effective and efficient operation of the scheme. Some of these changes introduce cost-saving measures that will help to bring scheme demand closer in line with the Budget. 


The changes proposed in Schedule 2 of this Bill seek to change the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, and the consequential changes required to other Acts of Parliament resulting from this change. 




Reasons for Urgency




Schedule 1: The Export Market Development Grants Act 1997, as it currently stands, does not make provision for a grant year past 30 June 2016. The Act must be amended if the EMDG scheme is to continue to operate past this date. 


A number of the measures in this bill are cost-savings, and they are being introduced to help bring scheme demand closer in line with the budget. Failure to have these measures in place by 1 July 2016 will mean that they are introduced and communicated retrospectively. As they reduce an applicant's entitlement to a grant, this would not be a satisfactory outcome.


Delaying passage of this bill would cause unnecessary uncertainty for small businesses, and undermine the purpose of the scheme. Having the amendments passed during the Autumn Session will provide certainty for Australian small and medium-sized exporters, who will be planning their 2016-17 marketing strategies at that time. 



Schedule 2: The Government has placed increasing priority and importance on attracting foreign investment into Australia to help secure Australia's future prosperity. Changing the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission highlights this importance.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Last week, we started to see something that is quite unusual in this place. We saw a couple of those opposite express the fact that they actually care what happens in our classrooms and about the challenges that are facing our schools. Unfortunately, those opposite failed to identify the biggest challenges facing the Australian school system—that is, this government and this government's policies. If those opposite really cared about the education that Australian children are receiving, we would hear them speak up about the fact that their own government intends to rip $30 billion out of the Australian education system.


We know that these cuts will be detrimental and have a huge impact on every school's ability to improve literacy and numeracy in the classroom and we know that these cuts will disadvantage our children and limit the opportunities and possibilities that a quality education can provide. 


The Prime Minister likes to talk about how important innovation is for Australia's future, but the simple reality is that we cannot be an innovative nation without investing in a world-class school education system. If we take a close look at Mr Turnbull's actions when it comes to innovation, they all have a negative impact on Australia's ability to be the innovative nation we want for the future.


This is a Prime Minister who promised ideas but has delivered an education bust, a Prime Minister who says that he supports innovation but who is still committed to $100,000 degrees and is sacking hundreds of world-class researchers at the CSIRO. That says it all about the commitment that this government and this Prime Minister have to education in this country. This Prime Minister can talk as much as he likes—and we all know how much he likes to talk—but he is a Prime Minister who will ultimately be judged on his actions, and his actions undermine education and innovation in Australia in every single way.


In my home state of Tasmania we know that the Liberal government has ripped $154 million from school funding in the electorate of Bass, where I live. That is $154 million gutted out of education. We know that every school in Bass will be worse off because of Mr Malcolm Turnbull and his government's cuts to education. The Liberal government's $30 billion cuts over the next decade will see an average of $3.2 million cut from every school, which is the equivalent of losing one in seven teachers. The current member for Bass, Mr Nikolic, has failed to stand up for his electorate to deliver funding for education—not just for the private sector but also for the public sector. The government's actions say it all when it comes to their priorities. We know that the $30 billion cuts to our schools will lock Australian students into inequality and will mean that students who need the most help will be pushed further behind. 


We cannot afford to stick with the Turnbull government's school education policies, because we will fall too far behind. Whilst the Liberal Party have no vision for the future of our education system, we have a comprehensive plan to invest in our children's future. We recognise that our nation's performance is slipping and that we must invest in our schools and in our children's future. We on this side of the chamber understand that the need to address inequality and improve outcomes in our schools is more urgent than ever. That is why, with the education policy that we have announced—Your child. Your future—we are investing in a positive plan. We are prepared to invest in every single child in this country to ensure that they reach their potential, and they deserve nothing less.
